BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 3
Financial headlines The year
This has been a really good year for BT. We said
12 months ago that, in a turbulent market, your
company had taken the hard decisions and necessary
actions early. Events have shown that we were right to
do so and that we have now established a strong base
for sustainable growth. Earnings per share in the year
increased by 61% and net debt reduced by over
£4 billion. The group generated free cash ﬂow of
£1.7 billion. The full year dividend of 6.5 pence per
share reﬂects the group’s ﬁnancial performance,
operational strength and conﬁdence in the future.
In the past two years, our net debt has been
reduced from £27.9 billion as at 31 March 2001 to
£9.6 billion as at 31 March 2003, a reduction of 66%.
The foundations of the progress in 2003 were the
achievement of operating efﬁciencies and the sale of
non-core assets, such as our stake in Cegetel, which
we sold for £2.6 billion. Progress was sustained by
improving service in our traditional markets, and our
growing success in such new-wave markets as
broadband, mobility, information and communications
technology (ICT) and solutions. We continue to invest
in and to transform our network to help take our
20 million customers into a future shaped by new
communications possibilities.
Purpose and responsibilities
As a business, our purpose is to connect the worlds
of our customers. In achieving that purpose we will
provide the greatest customer satisfaction and enjoy
commercial success if we make every experience of
our services simple and complete.
Your company’s broader responsibilities include
the maintenance of a good reputation, deﬁnitive
standards of governance and a coherent corporate
social responsibility programme, all vital to
encouraging investors to put their trust in us,
customers to buy from us and the best people to
work for us. This sense of responsibility runs through
the whole of our organisation.
Pensions
BT takes its responsibilities to its pensioners, existing
and prospective, very seriously. The result of a recent
valuation of the main BT pension scheme, carried out
by the independent actuary appointed by the Scheme
trustees, showed a funding deﬁcit of £2.1 billion. This
compares to £1 billion at the last formal valuation in
1999. BT has agreed it will make good this deﬁcit with
additional annual payments of £232 million, compared
to the £200 million additional annual payments that BT
has been making.
Strength of the BT Pension Scheme
The BT Pension Scheme, which has been closed to new
members since 31 March 2001, is backed by BT. The
Scheme assets are controlled by trustees who must act
in the best interests of its members. Any deﬁcit has to
be made good by the company, and no changes can be
made to the rules and beneﬁts that apply to Scheme
members without the agreement of the trustees.

6 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003
A year ago, I said that there were three main parts to
BT’s strategy. This year, I’m saying the same thing.
First, we have a passion for customers. Second, we
have broadband at the heart of BT – and BT at the
heart of broadband. Third, we have rigorous
ﬁnancial discipline.
By concentrating on these three priorities we can
continue to reward shareholders, drive down debt and
invest in the business – where it matters.
First and foremost, we are passionate about
customers. Every time we deal with a customer,
our goal is to deliver an excellent experience – an
experience which is simple, but also complete.
We are working to meet the needs that customers
have today. And we are innovating to meet the needs
they will have tomorrow.
This means getting ever closer to customers,
understanding their lifestyles and businesses,
establishing long-term relationships with them.
We are proud to serve individuals, families, small
or medium-sized businesses, and global corporations.
In the past year, our passion for customers has
delivered results. For example:
& consumers and businesses are now more satisﬁed
with the way we provide and repair their services,
as shown by our satisfaction surveys
& packages such as BT Together, which has
ten million residential customers, have been a major
success story. From June this year, BT Together will be
even simpler, making minute-by-minute charges for
evening and weekend calling a thing of the past
& we are the UK’s leading internet service provider
for small and medium businesses
& the order book for our solutions business is very
strong and orders worth £3.6 billion were taken during
the 2003 ﬁnancial year, including a major e1 billion
contract to manage Unilever’s worldwide
communications network for seven years
& we promised that our major European operations
would break even at the EBITDA level and, thanks to
our market success and efﬁciency programme,
we delivered
& new business revenues among wholesale
customers (other telecoms operators and internet
service providers) grew by 85% year on year
& and, very importantly, overall customer
dissatisfaction was signiﬁcantly down by 37% for the
company (against the target we set of 25%).
Broadband is the biggest opportunity for growth
in the communications market. It’s no exaggeration
to say that it will be as important to our future as
voice telephone calls were to our past. Broadband is
more than just another product. It is a whole new way
of communicating. It sparks off tremendous demand
and is growing at a rapid rate – connections having
increased almost fourfold in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Our record over the past year shows how we are
meeting this demand:
& at 31 March 2003, we had around 800,000 ADSL
(asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections, and we
are well on the way to reaching our target of one million
this summer BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 7
& two-thirds of the UK population is now connected
to an ADSL-enabled exchange, and our development
of new business models, coupled with technological
breakthroughs, could put 90% of the UK’s homes and
small businesses within reach of broadband services
within the next few years.
And as well as signing up customers, we are
moving quickly to offer them inspiring new services.
Our understanding of what customers want is growing
every day and we are making sure that the company
is able to provide it. For example, new broadband
services were launched, offering music – Dotmusic on
Demand, sport – Sportal on Demand, and education –
the BT Learning Centre.
Our third key priority is ﬁnancial discipline. We put
our heart into customer service, but also into a
rigorous approach to ﬁnance.
As the broadband record shows, we have to meet
the demands of our customers in a way that also serves
the interests of shareholders – in other words, it has
to be ﬁnancially responsible and sustainable.
Financial discipline is not the same thing as cost
savings. It’s about doing things smarter, raising the
bar, proving that it is possible to do more with less.
We did substantially reduce operating costs and,
in addition, we very carefully targeted our capital
expenditure, which was £2.4 billion during the 2003
ﬁnancial year, a 21% reduction on the previous year,
on a like-for-like basis.
We are investing to transform our network.
Equipment designed for 20th century services is
making way for a true 21st century network, delivering
the broadband, multimedia services that today’s
customers require. It will also deliver these services
in the way many of today’s customers now demand
them – for example enabling customers to conﬁgure
and adjust their services themselves.
In this network, we are creating a new engine for
growth; simultaneously offering lower operating costs
and higher performance.
These then are the priorities that we have been
focused on in the past year and that we will remain
focused on in the year ahead.
Our success will depend not just on making our
strategy work but on the way in which we make it work.
The new corporate identity that we unveiled at the
beginning of April 2003 deﬁnes the kind of company
we are now and need to be in the future.
Central to that new identity is a commitment to
be simple and complete in all we do. And that, in turn,
means living our brand values.
Being trustworthy means consistently delivering on
our promises. Helpful means listening and responding.
Being straightforward means keeping things simple
and clear, and inspiring means constantly working
to create new communications possibilities. And we
have to do everything with real heart – showing passion
and conviction.
Those values, of course, can only be lived through
people – and, of course, our strategy can only be
delivered by the teams of motivated people throughout
the business. It simply couldn’t happen without them.
They breathe life into it. They make it work. And I’d
like to thank them for their loyalty and their hard work.

Introduction
BT Group plc is the listed holding company for an
integrated group of businesses that provide voice
and data services in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.
British Telecommunications plc is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of BT Group plc and holds virtually all
businesses and assets of the BT group. Our collective
aim is to create shareholder value through service
excellence, an effective brand, our large-scale networks
and our existing customer base, and also through
developing and marketing new, higher-value
broadband and internet products and services.
BT consists principally of three lines of business:
BT Retail, BT Wholesale and BT Global Services
(formerly BT Ignite).
In the year ended 31 March 2003 (the 2003
ﬁnancial year), 94% of our revenues were derived from
operations within the UK, where we are the largest
full service telecommunications operator, serving over
20 million customers. BT Retail and BT Wholesale
operate almost entirely within the UK, addressing
the consumer, major business, business and wholesale
markets, and offer a broad spectrum of
communications products and services. Our aim is to
increase proﬁtable revenues from data and advanced
broadband and internet services and to reduce further
our dependence on revenues and proﬁt generated by
ﬁxed-line voice services.
For a summary of turnover for our lines of business
for the years ended 31 March 2001, 2002 and 2003,
see the table on page 10.
Corporate identity
In early April 2003, we unveiled a new corporate
identity to replace the piper logo and reﬂect our
strategy. Because it represents BT as part of the
multimedia age and communicates our global reach,
this change better reﬂects the range of activities that
we encompass.
The new mark is the company’s ﬁrst visual identity
change since 1991.
Governance
BT’s policy is to achieve best practice in our standards
of business integrity in all our operations, in line with
our published statement of business practice – The Way
We Work. This includes a commitment to maintaining
the highest standards of corporate governance
throughout the group (see pages 53 to 57).
Corporate social responsibility
BT is committed to maximising its positive impact
on society through leadership in CSR (corporate social
responsibility). In our view, a well managed CSR
programme supports the delivery of strategy and
is in the best interests of the business, customers,
shareholders and the community (see pages 24 to 25).
Group strategy
In 2002 BT set out its three-year strategy to create
value for shareholders by being the best provider of
communications services and solutions for everybody in Business review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 9
the UK, and for multi-site organisations with European
operations, achieving global reach through partnership.
We have seven strategic priorities:
& to deliver the highest levels of customer
satisfaction performance and reduce the number of
dissatisﬁed customers each year
& to achieve organic proﬁtable revenue growth,
while carefully controlling capital expenditure
& to put broadband at the heart of BT, expand the
market for broadband services and create a
media-enabled network
& to provide solutions and other value-added services
for multi-site organisations with European operations
& to place all UK networks under a single
management structure and to limit investment in
legacy voice and data platforms, while migrating
operations to new platforms
& to move into broadband and mobility services for
consumers; and also into advanced services, such as
communications solutions and outsourcing for major
business customers; and ICT (information and
communications technology) for SME (small and
medium enterprises)
& all delivered by diverse, skilled and
motivated people.
Customer satisfaction
Reducing customer dissatisfaction by 25% a year is a
key target in our drive to deliver the highest levels of
customer satisfaction.
BT has an extensive programme of quantitative
customer research run by external agencies to assist
us to focus on the level and causes of customer
dissatisfaction.
This research shows we achieved a 37% reduction
in customer dissatisfaction over the year, beating the
target of 25%. All areas of the business improved
satisfaction levels, with particularly signiﬁcant
improvement among our international and wholesale
customers. Although in most areas customer
satisfaction is well ahead of our competitors, we will
strive to make further signiﬁcant improvements.
A programme has been put in place that focuses on
key areas of customer dissatisfaction.
Broadband
Broadband is at the heart of our strategy and,
during the year, we made progress in our drive to
enhance the awareness, availability and attractiveness
of broadband.
As at 16 May 2003, we had 936,000 ADSL
(asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections and are
on track to meet our target of one million connections
by summer 2003. The speed at which this is happening
is generating economies of scale that will help us
continue to reduce costs and progress beyond the one
million ﬁgure.
A series of technological breakthroughs can,
for the ﬁrst time, bring ADSL within potential reach
of 90% of UK homes and small businesses within
the next few years.
In November 2002, as further evidence of our
commitment to broadband, we announced the
appointment of BT’s ﬁrst Chief Broadband Ofﬁcer,
whose role is to direct and align the people and
processes involved in the end-to-end delivery
of broadband.
Reporting on BT Openworld
With effect from 1 January 2003, the former BT
Openworld results have been reported within BT Retail.
BT Openworld’s internet access and portal services
remain as a separately run business. All other parts of
the BT Openworld portfolio, including GamesDomain
and Dotmusic, together with the customer service and
network operations teams, have been integrated into
BT Retail.
This reorganisation has already delivered cost
savings and efﬁciency gains, mostly arising from the
avoidance of duplication in administrative and other
support activities.
Restructuring
During the 2002 ﬁnancial year, we substantially
completed a radical restructuring programme, the
key elements of which were:
& the UK’s largest-ever rights issue – 1.98 billion
new shares were issued to shareholders who took up
their rights, raising £5.9 billion, net of expenses
& the demerger of the majority of BT’s mobile
businesses to create two separate listed companies –
BT Group plc and mmO
2
plc
& the disposal of signiﬁcant non-core businesses
and assets
& the unwind of Concert, BT’s joint venture
with AT&T
& the creation of customer-focused lines of business
& a major programme of debt reduction.
Demerger of mmO
2
On 19 November 2001, we completed the demerger
of mmO
2
, comprising what were BT’s wholly-owned
mobile assets in Europe: O
2
UK (formerly known as
BT Cellnet), O
2
Communications (Ireland) (formerly
known as Esat Digifone), Telfort Mobiel, Viag Interkom,
Manx Telecom and Genie. Shareholders received one
share in mmO
2
plc and one share in BT Group plc for
each share they previously held in British
Telecommunications plc. Trading in BT Group plc and
mmO
2
plc shares began on 19 November 2001.
BT and mmO
2
, through arm’s length negotiations,
entered into a number of agreements to deﬁne the
continuing relationship between the groups, including
the agreement that, until November 2004, we will
exclusively promote the mobile products and services
of O
2
UK to the business market in the UK.
The agreements that we would not offer mobile
products and services to the consumer market in the
UK solely under the BT brand, and that parts of mmO
2
were able to use some of our trademarks and brands
on a transitional basis, both lapsed on 31 March 2003.
Acquisitions and disposals
Between the 1999 and 2002 ﬁnancial years, BT made
a number of signiﬁcant acquisitions, including taking
stakes in Japan Telecom and J-Phone Communications Business review
10 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003
in Japan, and control of Viag Interkom in Germany,
and Esat Telecom and Esat Digifone in the Republic
of Ireland. During the 2002 ﬁnancial year, reﬂecting
the change in the group’s strategy, we disposed of a
number of businesses and assets, including Yell – our
international directories and e-commerce business –
and our stakes in Japan Telecom, J-Phone
Communications and Airtel, the Spanish wireless
operator. The consideration received enabled us to
focus on our core businesses and to reduce net debt.
In January 2003, we completed the sale of our 26%
stake in Cegetel Groupe SA, the leading alternative
ﬁxed-line operator in France, to Vivendi Universal for
£2.6 billion in cash. After accounting for goodwill
written back from reserves, BT realised a proﬁt of
approximately £1.5 billion before an exceptional
interest charge of £0.3 billion on closing out ﬁxed
interest rate swaps.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, we disposed of a
number of non-core investments, including stakes
in BSkyB, Mediaset, Blu and SmarTone.
No material acquisitions were made in the 2003
ﬁnancial year.
Property
In December 2001, as part of our wider property
outsourcing arrangement, we completed the sale and
leaseback of the majority of our UK property portfolio
to Telereal, a 50/50 joint venture partnership between
Land Securities Trillium and the William Pears Group,
for £2.4 billion in cash. Approximately 6,700 properties
– ofﬁces, telephone exchanges, vehicle depots,
warehouses, call centres and computer centres –
equating to approximately 5.5 million square metres,
were transferred. Under these arrangements, Telereal
is responsible for providing accommodation and estate
management services to BT.
We retained direct ownership of approximately
220 properties – including certain telephone
exchanges, computer centres and high radio towers –
totalling some 800,000 square metres. We also
retained BT Centre, our headquarters building,
Adastral Park, our major research facility near Ipswich,
Madley and Goonhilly earth satellite stations and the
BT Tower in Central London.
In the third quarter of the 2003 ﬁnancial year,
we provided £198 million against the costs of vacating
and disposing of surplus London ofﬁces, as we
rationalise from 14 buildings to ﬁve.
Concert
On 1 April 2002, we completed the unwind of Concert,
our international joint venture with AT&T, which
involved the return of Concert’s businesses, customer
accounts and networks to the two parent companies.
As a result of the unwind, we have largely taken
back into our ownership those parts of Concert
originally contributed by us to the joint venture, while
AT&T has taken back into its ownership those parts it
originally contributed. We have acquired substantially
all of Concert’s managed services network
infrastructure in Europe, Africa, the Middle East
and the Americas, and substantially all of the customer
and supplier contracts that we originally contributed
to Concert. Concert assets that have been returned
to us are now managed by BT Global Services while
Concert customers that have been returned to us are
now managed partly by BT Global Services and partly
by BT Retail.
Simultaneously with the completion of the
termination of the Concert joint venture, AT&T
acquired BT’s share of our Canadian joint venture,
through which we held an indirect minority
shareholding in AT&T Canada. As a result, BT no
longer has any obligations in relation to AT&T Canada.
Debt reduction programme
Net debt has been reduced from £27.9 billion as at
31 March 2001 to £9.6 billion as at 31 March 2003.
Key to the reduction in the 2003 ﬁnancial year was
the disposal of our stake in Cegetel and operating
cash ﬂow improvements.
Dividend
In 2002, we returned to the dividend list with the
payment of a ﬁnal dividend for the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
An interim dividend of 2.25 pence per share for the
2003 ﬁnancial year was paid in February 2003, and
a ﬁnal dividend of 4.25 pence per share is proposed
for payment in September 2003.
Pension fund
The latest triennial funding valuation of the group’s
deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the BT Pension
Scheme, was performed by the independent actuary
as at 31 December 2002. The valuation showed the
assets of £22.8 billion to be sufﬁcient to cover 92%
of the liabilities, with a resulting deﬁcit of £2.1 billion.
With effect from April 2003, the regular company
contributions have increased to 12.2% of employees’
pensionable pay from 11.6%, and the annual
deﬁciency payment has increased to £232 million from
£200 million. The group remains committed to making
good the funding deﬁcit.

BT Retail is the UK’s largest communications service
provider, by market share, to the residential and
business markets. It trades under one of the UK’s
leading brands – BT – and is the prime channel to
market in the UK for other businesses in the BT group.
It supplies a wide range of communication products
and services, including voice, data, internet and
multimedia services, and offers a comprehensive range
of managed and packaged communications solutions.
Its strategy is to improve the customer experience,
control costs and increase cashﬂow, defend core
revenues and build new revenue streams.
The core portfolio covers traditional telephony
products such as calls, analogue/digital lines and
private circuits. New revenue generation is focused
on broadband, mobility and ICT.
BT Retail has three main customer groups:
consumer (residential customers), major business
(corporate customers and the public sector) and
business (usually companies of up to 500 employees).
It has approximately 19 million consumer customers
and over one million business customers, including
major business customers.
Core business
As at 31 March 2003, BT Retail had more than
29 million customer lines (exchange line connections),
nine million of which were business lines and lines for
other service providers, and the remainder of which
were for residential customers.
Fixed-network call revenues, including rental and
connection charges, accounted for approximately 29%
of our revenues in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The number
of business lines remained stable, although high-speed
ISDN services grew by over 6%.
In the residential ﬁxed-voice call market, BT
Retail’s share remained stable over the year at around
73%, as it has been since June 2000. The number of
residential voice lines grew by 0.2%. Our market share
of the business ﬁxed voice sector for the 2003 ﬁnancial
year was 45%, compared with 49% for the 2002
ﬁnancial year.
Consumer
Our residential business saw revenue growth, for
the ﬁrst time for a number of years, driven by stable
market share, stable customer numbers and growth
in national calls.
& During the 2003 ﬁnancial year, the BT Together
pricing packages, whichoffer arange of competitive call
prices and ﬁxed-fee pricing options, continued to win
customers. As at 31 March 2003, ten million customers
had signed up for BT Together, accounting for 70% of
residential customer call minutes. In April 2003, we
announced that BT Together would be streamlined with
effect from 1 June 2003, per-minute charging for
evening and weekend calls would be removed and the
distinction between local and national calls abolished,
in favour of a single UK rate.
& During the 2003 ﬁnancial year, we reduced the
costs of our payphones operation through removal of
over 18,000 payphones from sites where there is a
suitable alternative. We remain committed to retaining
payphones in locations, such as rural communities,
where there is no suitable alternative.
& The launch in December 2002 of our new
directories operation provides customers with a
one-stop directory enquiries and information service
on a single number – 118 500. In addition to the
number service, our acquisition in August 2002 of the
business of Scoot.com, the business ﬁnder directory
service, enables customers to access classiﬁed listings
and other enhanced information services.
Major business
& BT Retail helps its major business customers to
manage their communications spend, using a free
PC-based tool to analyse customer bills – BT Billing
Analyst. This assists in pinpointing areas of inefﬁciency,
identifying unnecessary calls at premium or peak rates
and combating fraud. A consulting service is being
introduced which uses this information to construct
more efﬁcient customer networks.
& The deregulation of inbound 0800 numbers means
that we can offer bespoke pricing to our largest call
centre customers.
Business
In the business market, our strategy is to provide
business customers with a simpler and tailored service,
thereby creating greater certainty and predictability in
their business. We continue to defend and acquire
telephony contracts through our BT Business Plan and
BT Commitment portfolio against the carrier pre-select
and wholesale line rental services.
& Between October 2002 and March 2003, the
number of business customers on the BT Commitment
Reward discount package doubled to over 60,000.
& In January 2003, BT became the ﬁrst UK
telecommunications company to cap the cost of
business calls by launching BT Business Plan which sets
a ceiling of 10 pence on local and national calls –
provided only that they last less than an hour. At the
end of March 2003, BT Business Plan had attracted
over 20,000 business customers. Over the same
period, the awareness of the plan among business
customers reached 33.5%.
New-wave business
In total, BT Retail grew new-wave revenues from
£582 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year to £850 million
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, a 46% increase.
Consumer
& The launch during the year of BT Broadband is
key to our approach to helping build the broadband
market in the UK. For £27 per month, BT Broadband
customers get instant connection to the internet,
unlimited access with no time restrictions, the
opportunity to use the phone and surf at the same Business review
12 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003
time, speeds up to ten times faster than a normal
connection, and access to a range of content and
service providers, including a range of e-mail choices.
Free connection special offers and reduced modem
prices for customers ordering online helped to drive
demand and, as at 31 March 2003, BT Broadband
had 137,000 customers.
& BT Retail launched two new ventures in the second
half of 2002, both designed to provide new revenue
streams, and to promote the uptake of broadband.
BT Click&Buy is an on-line payment service,
particularly suited to small transactions. BT Home
Computing is a complete package, covering choice
of broadband-ready PC, installation by a BT engineer
and ongoing support.
& We announced a number of initiatives under
the ‘‘Home of Possibilities’’ banner, which extend
the beneﬁts of broadband further into the home.
These include home networking products (which
enable multiple devices to share a single broadband
connection), home monitoring services (which provide
customer alerts via text, voice or e-mail) and home
entertainment services.
& We continued to bring the internet to the high
street with a programme to increase the number of
e-payphones from 500 to 20,000 by 2007. The new
kiosks enable customers to surf the internet, send web-
based and instant e-mails, and send text messages to
mobile phones, as well as make payphone calls. During
the 2003 ﬁnancial year, we installed 1,200 new kiosks.
& During the year, BT Retail returned to the
consumer mobile market with Mobile Sense, a service
enabling customers to select their own call charge
package online. In February 2003, BT and T-Mobile
(UK) formed a partnership with the aim of delivering
a consumer-led mobile service in the summer of 2003.
& BT Openworld achievements during the 2003
ﬁnancial year included the launch: in December 2002
of the Dotmusic on Demand service, offering
downloads of more than 150,000 music tracks;
in partnership with ukbetting plc, Sportev Ltd and
InTheBox Media, of Sportal on Demand, the UK’s ﬁrst
broadband sports network; in March 2003 the BT
Learning Centre, which aims to enable parents and
children to learn more effectively online. In addition,
BT Openworld introduced a number of new, value-
added services during the year, including anti-spam
functionality and virus protection and was approved
as an ADSL supplier for Microsoft’s Xbox Live and
Sony’s PlayStation 2 online games services.
Major business
Our ICT objective is to grow our share of selected
growth markets. These are the markets in which
communication and network skills are signiﬁcant,
migration is from our core markets, our brand has
value and in which partnerships proﬁtably supplement
our capability.
& Major outsourcing deals signed by BT Retail in
conjunction with BT Global Services during the year
include a £125 million deal with Abbey National to
install and manage a consolidated company-wide
integrated voice and data telecommunications solution;
an £83 million ﬁve-year extension to a current contract
with the National Australia Group to manage its
information and communications technology services;
a £168 million agreement with the NHS Information
Authority, to upgrade the existing NHSnet
infrastructure to a broadband platform, linking more
than 7,000 NHS sites in England; and a £136 million
contract over ten years with Bradford & Bingley to
install wide and local area networks to connect more
than 550 sites across the UK. In May 2003, BT was
part of a consortium which was awarded a multi-million
pound outsourcing agreement with Royal Mail to
manage business and IT services.
& During the 2003 ﬁnancial year, year-on-year
growth of 8% was achieved in the outsourcing
business; 58% in IP (internet protocol) infrastructure;
and 416% in broadband. New businesses revenues
grew signiﬁcantly during the 2003 ﬁnancial year,
e.g. revenues from mobility were £41 million.
There was also signiﬁcant revenue growth from
BT Broadband, managed desktop solutions and
CRM (customer relationship management) activity.
& Under the theme of ‘‘Connecting your world.
Completely’’, we launched a suite of mobile solutions
during the ﬁnancial year, to support corporate
customers in meeting their business requirements,
not just in the ofﬁce or the regular place of work,
but also on the move. Mobile Ofﬁce, for example,
offers customers secure, managed connections to
their corporate infrastructure, including internet
and intranet, e-mail and back ofﬁce systems.
& The installation of 122 live BT Openzone-enabled
areas in stations, airports, hotels and motorway service
stations in the 2003 ﬁnancial year helped BT maintain
a competitive position in the UK market for public
wireless LAN (local area network). BT Openzone offers
the opportunity to conduct high-speed transactions
while on the move. The target is to install 400 hotspots
by summer 2003, and 4,000 by summer 2004.
& CRM developments included a strategic alliance
with Eckoh Technologies, to provide speech recognition
technology and the ﬁrst ‘‘pay as you go’’ contact
centre service.
& Closer collaboration with strategic partner Siebel
Systems Inc, on solutions for local government, should
now make it possible for citizens to deal with their local
authority using a range of media – post, e-mail,
internet, telephone or text message.
Business
& BT Openworld remained the leading ISP (internet
service provider) for SMEs and, in an extremely
competitive market, increased market share to 31%
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year (source: Oftel – share
of ISP market for one to 250 employee businesses).
BT Openworld grew its broadband SME customer base
by 215% to over 132,000 by the end of March 2003.
More than 80,000 business customers now use a BT
Openworld value-added service, such as the Internet
Business Pack, which helps SMEs establish a
professional online business presence. BT Openworld’s
broadband portfolio continues to develop. SMEs can
choose from a wide range of different products and Business review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 13
value-added services, with access speeds varying from
512 Kbits to 2 Mbits and with functionality that
enables up to ten PCs to share a single access link.
& By March 2003, we were converting business
customers to broadband at the rate of one line every
minute (based on a 40 hour working week).
& Sales of IP telephone systems increased
substantially. 30% of all the telephone systems now
sold by BT Retail in the SME market are either pure IP
or a hybrid of IP and conventional systems. With the
launch of the Versatility system in November 2002,
BT Retail now offers convergent telephone systems
suitable for all customers, regardless of size.
& To complement the growth in sales of IP-based
network infrastructure, we launched BT Business
Software (a range of messaging and collaboration
tools) and Open Orchard (a new venture offering
software applications and consultancy to
mid-market customers).
& The launch of Mobile Worker in August 2002
was BT Retail’s ﬁrst offering as a service provider.
It connected 3,500 handsets by the end of March
2003, and we also launched BT Business Mobile,
a bespoke tariff for business customers.
Internet access
At 31 March 2003, BT Openworld had approximately
1.75 million UK consumer and business ISP customers,
making it one of the leading internet access providers
in the UK.
During the year, the rate of growth of internet
penetration in the UK slowed and the narrowband
(dial-up) market showed signs of maturity. Against
this background, BT Openworld’s strategy is to create
a proﬁtable business and drive the growing
broadband market.
BT Openworld’s narrowband business continued
to prove itself to be sustainable and viable.
BT Openworld’s strategy is to increase its proﬁt
from this area, while simultaneously migrating
narrowband customers onto broadband access services.
This strategy is designed to increase revenues and
provide customers with a superior internet experience.
During the year, BT Openworld grew its broadband
customer base by 171% to over 290,000 and it
remains the leading ISP supplier for broadband ADSL
services in the UK.
Enhanced customer access
We continued to use new technology to develop more
effective relationships with customers.
& We remained on track in the development of
next-generation multifunctional contact centres, an
upgrading of the traditional call centre. Eight of
the planned 31 centres in the UK, all of which will
be equipped with state-of-the-art CRM systems, were
completed during the year. Increased efﬁciencies
achieved cost reductions of £86 million – on track
to reach the target of £150 million annual savings by
the end of the 2004 ﬁnancial year. The restructuring
was achieved without compulsory redundancy.
Specialist broadband contact centres were set up in
Newcastle and Exeter, and in March 2003 BT Retail
announced that we would be opening new contact
centres in New Delhi and Bangalore.
& During the ﬁnancial year, we embarked on
a programme to transform and expand our online
relationships with customers. At 31 March 2003,
we had a total of almost four million online
relationships, and over 300,000 customers receiving
e-bills. We continued to extend the range of online
services, particularly those made possible by broadband
and mobile access. This programme made a signiﬁcant
contribution to our cost reduction achievements in the
2003 ﬁnancial year.
& Our integrated multi-channel transformation
programme aims to change the way BT Retail serves
major business customers. The programme is focused
on improving the customer experience and reducing
the cost of sale through integrated web and desk-based
access, and on increasing market reach and adding
value through our strategic partners. Signiﬁcant cost
savings were delivered by deploying online service
support to 500 customers, handling 3,000 transactions
per day by the end of March 2003. The new
tele-channel opened 10,500 new leads, and closed
contracts worth £84 million. Our indirect channel
partners made a signiﬁcant contribution.

Core business
BT Wholesale provides network services and solutions
within the UK, including ADSL, conveyance, transit,
bulk delivery of private circuits, frame relay and ISDN
(integrated services digital network) connections. It
serves more than 500 communication companies, ﬁxed
and mobile network operators, and service providers,
including BT Retail and BT Global Services. It aims to
build complete communications packages and works
with its customers to help them succeed in their
businesses. BT Wholesale has 885 local and trunk
processor units, 119 million kilometres of copper wire
and six million kilometres of optical ﬁbre.
Consistent with our strategy, BT’s UK networks are
now managed by BT Wholesale – this includes the
UK PSTN (public switched telephone network), ATM
(asynchronous transfer mode) and IP networks.
Together, they constitute the most extensive
telecommunications network in the UK, capable of
touching virtually every home and business.
The fact that all UK network capital expenditure
decisions are now made by one team has enabled BT
Wholesale to reduce the capital expenditure it controls
by realising synergies through more efﬁcient network
planning and responding quickly to worsening market
conditions. This is the capital expenditure of
BT Wholesale and of BT Global Services on the UK IP
network, which together has been reduced from
£2,109 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year to £1,793
million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. Business review
14 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003
Changing market conditions
In 2003, the UK telecommunications market continued
to experience its most signiﬁcant slowdown in many
years. BT Wholesale’s external turnover declined by
11%, and our internal turnover reduced by 7% in the
2003 ﬁnancial year, reﬂecting the downward pressure
on prices, a slowdown in volume growth and the
unwind of Concert.
Strategic intent
BT Wholesale intends to be number one in broadband
and data services in the UK. This intent is underpinned
by six strategic imperatives: to lead the market in
customer satisfaction; to grow proﬁtable revenues;
to achieve best-in-class costs; to deliver commercially
successful broadband; to create a 21st century
network; and to create a high performing, customer-
focused organisation.
External new business revenues
BT Wholesale is moving into new markets. The
emphasis is changing from the regulated, capital-
intensive products in our traditional portfolio, to
internet connectivity, network facilities management,
mobility, equipment, and content and applications.
In total, BT Wholesale grew its new business
revenues from £102 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year
to £189 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year – 85%
growth. Key contract wins in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
included a six-year, full network outsourcing contract
with Redstone. Over the next 12 months, a series of
key product and service launches are expected to
continue this growth, focusing on innovation and
a ﬂexible route to market.
This focus on new business goes hand in hand
with maintenance of the traditional interconnect
business, from which the majority of BT Wholesale’s
external revenues (£3,283 million traditional
interconnect business revenues in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year) were derived.
Broadband
As at 31 March 2003, BT Wholesale’s installed base of
ADSL lines was around 800,000, including lines for BT
Broadband’s 137,000 customers and BT Openworld’s
290,000 customers, representing growth of 380%
over the previous year. Since January, we have been
adding well over 20,000 connections per week and at
16 May 2003 total connections were 936,000. We are
on target to reach one million connections
in summer 2003.
There were a number of notable BT Wholesale
achievements in the broadband arena during the year.
All of these helped drive up demand for, and access
to, broadband.
& The monthly rental charged to wholesale
customers for a consumer broadband connection
was reduced on 1 April 2002 from £25 to £14.75.
This reduction was quickly reﬂected in the retail
prices charged by ISPs.
& We ADSL-enabled a further 67 exchanges,
bringing the total to 1,167, ensuring that 67%
of UK households are connected to ADSL-enabled
exchange areas.
& We developed and implemented a demand
registration scheme. Under this scheme, people in
areas where the local exchange has not been upgraded
for broadband ADSL can register their interest via a
service provider. Over 800 exchanges have been given
a trigger level, indicating the number of customers
required to make enabling that exchange commercially
viable – with trigger levels for a further 759 exchanges
already planned for the next ﬁnancial year. At 31 March
2003, more than 320,000 people had registered an
interest: 44 exchanges had been broadband enabled
as a result of the scheme (with a further 247 having
reached their trigger levels).
& We continued to explore commercially viable ways
to roll out broadband services to smaller communities.
For example, we began trials of a new commercial
model for broadband exchange activation, using
lower-cost exchange technology and a sponsoring
organisation – with a social, development or
commercial interest in bringing broadband to the area
– providing up-front funding. The Exchange Activate
trial was run in eight sites across the UK. In April 2003,
BT Wholesale announced that it would be proceeding
with the full implementation of Exchange Activate from
July 2003.
& We began a trial of new broadband symmetric
services for business customers based on SHDSL
(symmetric high-speed digital subscriber line). Products
developed using SHDSL are capable of supporting a
range of services for service providers and businesses,
including e-mail, web-hosting, video conferencing,
VPN (virtual private networks) and WAN (wide area
network). The trial is planned to run until mid-summer
2003 and in 100 exchanges within London,
Manchester, Birmingham,Yorkshire, Merseyside
and parts of Scotland.
21st century network
At the heart of BT Wholesale’s strategic intent to be
the UK’s number one in broadband and data is our
commitment to create a world-leading, commercially-
focused, market-driven UK network, which fulﬁls
customer requirements today and anticipates their
future needs.
Our commitment to the quality and reliability of
the PSTN and narrowband remains undiminished. Early
choices will be made on appropriate next generation
technology to replace the oldest narrowband switches,
but the plan is for a long-term migration.
BT Wholesale plans to build an advanced
broadband network based on IP standards. This is
a major change from traditional telecommunications
network standards. It will consist of very high-capacity
routers connected together by an optical network
capable of meeting many years of future customer
demand for voice, video and data services. This will
be designed to make BT simpler and more efﬁcient
to deal with.
The objective is to build this network using
stringent capital return criteria and taking an Business review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 15
increasingly rigorous approach to investment in the
narrowband network.
The21stcenturynetworkaimstodeliverlong-term,
structural cost reduction, as we progressively migrate
ontoasimpler,lower-costnetworkarchitecture.Theaim
is that the new network will be reliable and hands-off,
with self-diagnostic and self-healing capabilities, which
means that investment now should lead to signiﬁcantly
lower operational costs in the future.
Efﬁciency
BT Wholesale’s cost base strategy includes improved
processes, better inventory control, and a
relentless focus on productivity. This resulted in
signiﬁcant savings.
A major contribution to efﬁciency in the 2003
ﬁnancial year was a reduction in the pay bill for BT
Wholesale, as over 2,000 employees left the business
on leaver terms.
Savings have also been achieved as a result of
improved automation and the adoption of new
technology, for example the development of self-install
processes for our ADSL broadband product.
By concentrating on the efﬁcient use of existing
equipment, the requirement for capital expenditure has
also been controlled. Tightening spare plant margins
on ISDN line cards, and more efﬁcient deployment of
transmission equipment, for example, have resulted
in reduced costs, while maintaining standards for
provision of service.

Customer wins
In addition to contracts signed in conjunction with
BT Retail and described on page 12, BT Global Services
entered into a number of other signiﬁcant customer
contracts in 2003. Examples include:
& In November 2002, working closely with BT Retail,
we signed a seven-year contract worth arounde1 billion
with Unilever, to manage and develop the company’s
global communications infrastructure. This is one of
the largest outsourcing contracts in UK corporate
history and the majority of revenues will come from
operations outside the UK. BT Global Services will
supply Unilever with a range of voice, data and mobile
services, as well as developing new technologies on
its behalf.
& In January 2003, we were awarded the contract
to restructure the communications platform of the
Bavarian state in Germany. The seven-year contract is
the largest government contract BT has signed outside
the UK and involves the fundamental restructuring and
harmonisation of the Bavarian state’s entire
communications platform.
& In January 2003, we won a four-year contract with
the Ministry of Public Administration in Spain, worth Business review
16 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003
over e20 million, to provide ﬁxed-voice, data and
internet services. The ministry, which has more than
400 sites throughout Spain, provides administrative
support to government at the central, regional and
local levels.
& In April 2003, we signed a three-year contract with
high street bank HBOS plc to manage its voice and
data services.
& Syntegra signed deals worth in excess of
£800 million, including a ten-year strategic partnership
with Essex County Council – one of the biggest
partnerships of its kind ever established by a
county council.
Business realignment
On 1 April 2002, the management of BT’s contracts
with former Concert customers was transferred to
BT Global Services and BT Retail.
During 2003, the Concert MPLS virtual private
network platform, with its global presence in Europe,
USA and Asia, was integrated with the BT Global
Services European platform, to enhance reach and
coverage, on schedule and within budget.
BT Global Services also achieved greater
integration of its European businesses through
continued product harmonisation, network and
customer service centre consolidation and
people realignment.
Global reach
In Europe, BT Global Services owns operations in:
Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands,
Spain, the Nordics and Central and Eastern Europe.
We deliver services to customers in Italy through our
joint venture Albacom and I.Net (our applications
hosting company). In the Americas and Asia Paciﬁc,
we deliver service to our customers through a
combination of direct sales and services operations
and strategic partners.
BT Global Services’ network-based services (Frame
Relay, ATM, IP-VPN) extend to and across North and
South America, and the Asia Paciﬁc region. This means
that BT Global Services’ products are delivered
seamlessly within and from Europe to our own locations
in the Americas, and delivered locally through
interconnect and supply agreements with regional
carriers. In the Asia Paciﬁc region, we deliver services
locally to customers via a network of partners in the key
commercial centres of Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore
and Australia, and provide reach across the region
through other regional operators.
Global customer service is provided via service
and network management centres around the world,
24 hours a day, seven days a week. As part of BT
Global Services’ programme to deliver a standard
operating environment across our operations,
all network operations are in the process of being
consolidated into a single network control centre in
Brussels. This centre will manage BT’s networks across
16 European countries, and through functions such as
shared incident management and fault resolution,
performance monitoring, and seamless customer
service, help customers maximise the use of
their infrastructure.
Other businesses
As at 31 March 2003, BT held stakes in a number
of other businesses, including:
& stakes in four satellite entities – Eutelsat, Inmarsat,
Intelsat and New Skies.
& a 16.6% stake in L G Telecom, a mobile cellular
telephone operator in the Republic of Korea.
& an 11.9% stake in StarHub, the enlarged ﬁxed and
mobile communications operator and pay-TV operator
in Singapore, formed by the merger in June 2002
between StarHub and Singapore Cable Vision (BT’s
stake was previously 18% in StarHub alone).
& a 23% stake in Albacom, a ﬁxed communications
operator in Italy.
Research and development and IT support
BT Exact is BT’s centre of excellence in IT and
networking technologies, providing the specialist
technical skills that BT needs to extend the reach of our
broadband services, operate our networks efﬁciently
and deliver world-class customer service.
BT Exact also works with BT Retail, BT Wholesale
and BT Global Services to address the more complex
needs of our customers, extend our portfolio of
products and services and ensure that our customers
gain full advantage from the opportunities created by
new technologies.
Specialist technical services are also offered directly
to telecommunications equipment manufacturers and
suppliers of the software applications used in the core
of the world’s public communication networks. For
example, BT Exact works with companies such as
Alcatel, Juniper Networks, Lucent Technologies and
Marconi to provide independent assessments of their
products’ performance and suitability for use in public
communications networks.
All these aspects of BT Exact’s business are based
on expertise and insight created through our research
programmes, which focus on the next-generation
internet, advanced data services, information and
network security, software systems to support the
management and integrity of networks worldwide,
and the future impact of advanced communications
on lifestyles, education and healthcare.
The work undertaken by BT Exact is part of an
investment of £380 million in research and
development that BT made in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
This compares with £362 million and £364 million
invested in the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial
years, respectively.
The intellectual property created from this work
is valuable and BT Exact is responsible for the
exploitation, management and defence of the patents
that result from our research and development work,
and has a policy of commercial exploitation of our
technology through patent licensing (including a
contract with ipValue to secure revenues from US
and Canadian companies), and the incubation of
new technology companies. Business review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 17
In February 2003, BT Exact announced a partnership
with Coller Capital and New Venture Partners (NVP) to
create an independent corporate venturing partnership
– NVP Brightstar – in which BT has a minority stake.
NVP Brightstar, which began operations in April 2003,
has the exclusive rights to create new, start-up
businesses with BT Exact, using our extensive and
developing intellectual property portfolio. NVP
Brightstar purchased the majority of the existing
portfolio of technology ventures developed by
BT Exact’s corporate incubator, Brightstar.

Total discontinued activities – – 20.2
Total employees 104.7 108.6 137.0
At 31 March 2003, BT employed 104,700 people
throughout the world, with 96,300 in the UK.
During the 2003 ﬁnancial year, as part of the
continuing programme of reshaping the group, 4,300
people left BT under our voluntary paid leaver
package, Newstart.
Well managed, motivated people are fundamental
to our success. Our reputation as a progressive and
innovative employer not only helps us recruit and retain
an excellent workforce, it also enhances our ability to
serve our customers and generate revenues.
Training and development
During the year we spent around £70 million (excluding
staff and other direct costs) on the training and
development of our employees. We provide a range
of training opportunities for employees, including
customer service and technical training, management
development and professional training, as appropriate.
We aim to deliver this as cost-effectively as possible by
using the capabilities of broadband and progressively
increasing the emphasis on e-learning and
self-teach opportunities.
Because a passion for our customers is
fundamental to the way we do business, a number of
training and development initiatives have focused on
aspects of customer satisfaction. One example of this
is the My Customer programme, targeted at 50,000
people in BT Retail, to reinforce their engagement skills
with customers.
In January 2003, BT was accredited as an Investor
in People, for the fourth time.
Communications
We maintain and develop the awareness of our
employees in relation to ﬁnancial and economic factors
that affect the performance of the company in a
number of ways. Employees are kept informed through
a monthly internal newspaper and regular e-mail
bulletins, as well as having access to the intranet.
Health and safety
We have undertaken a comprehensive review of our
health and safety strategy and are committed to
eradicating avoidable work-related illness and injury.
We have speciﬁcally targeted those business activities
that carry the greatest risks and we are enhancing the
information, instruction and training provided for our
people to help improve performance. Good progress
is being made against the stringent targets we set
ourselves in 2001, with a 21% reduction in workplace
injuries and a 23% fall in cases of occupational ill
health over two years.
A stake in the company
We encourage our employees to acquire shares in
BT Group to enable them to share in our success,
and offer a range of tax-beneﬁcial employee share
plans to help them make such acquisitions.
For the 2003 ﬁnancial year, £36 million was
allocated to provide free shares to UK employees under
the BT Employee Share Investment Plan (ESIP). Under
the terms of the scheme, the amount of proﬁt set aside
to buy free shares is linked to corporate performance
measures determined by the Board. These shares are
held in trust for a minimum of three years, and for ﬁve
years in order to obtain the beneﬁcial tax treatment
(employees outside the UK receive a cash payment
equivalent to the value of the shares).
The partnership shares section of the ESIP gives
employees an opportunity to purchase shares in the
company through monthly deductions from their
pre-tax salaries.
In addition, employees have the opportunity to buy
shares at a discount under the BT Group Employee
Sharesave schemes. Share options are normally
exercisable on completion of a three- or ﬁve-year save-
as-you-earn contract.
Pensions
Most of our employees are members of the BT Pension
Scheme or the BT Retirement Plan, both of which are
controlled by independent trustees. The BT Pension
Scheme was closed to new members on 31 March
2001. The majority of employees who joined the
company after that date are eligible to join the
BT Retirement Plan.
Listening to our people
We run an annual employee attitude survey, and
encourage managers and their teams to put in place
action plans to address the issues that it highlights.
The most recent phase of the survey was conducted
at the end of 2002 and showed extremely high
levels of support for and commitment to the
company’s strategy.
Work/life balance
We want our people to give of their best for customers
and BT, and we provide the scope, within operational
requirements, for them to optimise their work/life
balance. At 31 March 2003, we had more than 6,000
people working part time, almost 600 job sharers
and around 6,600 people working from home. Business review
18 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003
Other options include alternative attendance patterns,
maternity, paternity, adoptive and parental leave,
career breaks and an increasingly ﬂexible approach to
assist individuals to prepare for their retirement age.
Industrial relations
An estimated 75% of our UK employees belong to one
of two main trade unions recognised by the company.
We have a good record of industrial relations and
constructive, occasionally robust relationships, based
on partnership and mutual respect, with both unions
in the UK and works councils elsewhere across Europe.
Equal opportunities
We are an equal opportunities employer and are
committed to developing a working culture that
enables all employees to make their own distinctive
contribution. We are an active member of many equal
opportunity and diversity organisations, and during
the year were awarded the platinum standard by
Opportunity Now for our work on gender equality and
the gold standard by Race for Opportunity (RfO) for
our work on race equality.
We were also recognised by the Employers’ Forum
on Disability for our leadership in the employment of
people with disabilities.
Our Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen, is chairman
of the National Employment Panel’s Steering Group on
Lone Parents, which aims to create more opportunities
for lone parents to work.
Regulation, competition and prices
The commercial environment in the UK and in the
countries in which BT operates or wishes to operate
is increasingly competitive and dynamic. However,
we remain subject to extensive regulation, particularly
in the UK, which can materially affect the way in which
we carry out our business. We also use inputs from
other regulated operators, largely outside the UK,
and the availability and price of these inputs may
change from time to time, impacting on our business.
Regulation in the UK
The regulatory structure for UK telecommunications
is set out principally in the Telecommunications Act
1984, which gives regulatory authority to the Secretary
of State for Trade and Industry and the Director
General of Telecommunications who heads the Ofﬁce
of Telecommunications (Oftel). The Secretary of State
and the Director General are each required to exercise
their functions under the Act in the way which they
consider is best calculated to ensure, as far as
reasonably practical, that all reasonable demand for
telecommunication services, including certain
community services, is met, and to secure the ability
of licensed telecommunications operators to ﬁnance
the provision of the services which they are licensed
to provide. In addition, they are required, among
other things, to promote the interests of consumers,
purchasers and other users in the prices, variety and
quality of telecommunication services and equipment,
and to promote and maintain efﬁciency and effective
competition among UK telecommunications operators.
With limited exceptions, a licence under the
Telecommunications Act is required to run a
telecommunication system in the UK. The Secretary
of State is responsible for issuing licences after
consulting the Director General. The regulatory regime
will change during 2003 and a new regulator, Ofcom,
will take over – see sections ‘‘The BT Licence’’, ‘‘New
European Union Directives’’ and ‘‘Communications Bill
and Ofcom’’ for further information.
The BT Licence
BT currently operates in the UK under a number of
licences, the most important of which is our licence
to operate our ﬁxed-line public telecommunications
network (the ‘‘Licence’’). Subject to the
implementation of the new European Union Directives
(see below), the Licence remains in force indeﬁnitely,
but the Secretary of State may revoke the Licence on
ten years’ notice. The Licence can also be revoked at
any time on various grounds, including non-compliance
with an enforcement order from the Director General.
In September 1999, the Licence was modiﬁed to meet
the harmonisation requirements of the European Union
Licensing Directive.
The Licence contains terms and conditions
designed principally to ensure the widespread provision
of telecommunication services in the UK, to protect
the interests of consumers and to encourage the
development of effective competition in
telecommunication services and network provision
within the UK.
Under the Licence, we have to fulﬁl reasonable
requests for voice telephony, low-speed data and fax
transmission services, and provide public call boxes
in accordance with published guidelines, throughout
nearly all the UK, including rural areas (these being the
principal elements of the Universal Service Obligation).
Under the Licence, we must allow other licensed
operators to interconnect with our telecommunications
systems on cost-oriented, transparent and non-
discriminatory terms.
We must comply with a variety of fair trading
obligations, such as:
& a prohibition on showing undue discrimination
between customers or unfairly favouring any part of
our own business as against competitors in relation
to matters such as the price, terms and conditions
or quality of our main services; and
& a prohibition on the unfair cross-subsidy of certain
of our activities.
We must publish audited ﬁnancial statements for
the regulated ‘‘businesses’’ and ‘‘activities’’, in order
to support the linkage of costs with interconnect prices
and with a view to providing demonstrable evidence
that we are neither behaving in a discriminatory fashion
nor unfairly subsidising our activities. If it appears to
the Director General that an unfair cross-subsidy exists
between speciﬁed parts of our own business, we must
take such steps as the Director General may direct to
remedy the situation. The regulatory businesses for
which separated accounts are currently produced are
retail narrowband access, apparatus supply, network,
retail systems, mobile, supplemental services and Business review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 19
residual services. The Licence also contains provisions
enabling the Director General to monitor our activities,
including requirements for BT to supply him with
information requested.
The Licence contains price control formulae, the
overall effect of which requires us to reduce, or restricts
the extent to which we can increase, the prices of many
of our telephony services to the bulk of the residential
market and also the prices for our interconnection
services, wholesale line rental services and number
portability services. In addition, the Licence contains
certain speciﬁc restrictions on the terms on which we
can trade. In particular, we are required to publish and
adhere to standard prices and other terms for providing
certain services and, in general, to apply uniformly
a published scale of charges for installing residential
exchangelinesonpremises tobeservedbyasingle line.
As a result of our international interests, a Licence
condition prohibits us from doing anything, by act or
omission, that would detract materially from our ability
to meet our Licence obligations to provide UK
telecommunication services and to do so to any
speciﬁed standards. BT’s directors are required to
submit an annual compliance certiﬁcate to the
Director General.
The Director General may make modiﬁcations
to a licence if the licensee does not object or the
modiﬁcation is deregulatory. Alternatively, proposed
changes to the Licence may be referred by the Director
General to the Competition Commission. In either
case, the Telecommunications Act requires public
consultation before a licence can be modiﬁed. Licences
may also be modiﬁed in order to implement European
Union directives into UK law.
New European Union Directives
The provision of telecommunications networks and
services throughout the European Union was liberalised
through the implementation of a number of Directives
which came into force in January 1998. Following a
review initiated by the European Commission in 1999,
a new package of Directives for the regulation of
electronic communications continuing the EU’s policies
of liberalisation and harmonisation was adopted by
the EU in April 2002. These Directives must be
implemented in all Member States by 25 July 2003.
The new framework aims to be technologically neutral.
Individual licences will be replaced by a general
authorisation applying automatically to all providers
of electronic communications networks and services.
Member States will no longer be permitted to require
undertakings to obtain licences before operating in the
sector, though providers of electronic communications
networks and services may be required to comply with
a limited range of general conditions. Additional
obligations, legally separate from the general
conditions, will be imposed on individual providers
designated by their National Regulatory Authority
as having Universal Service Obligations or ‘‘signiﬁcant
market power’’ in speciﬁed market sectors. The
‘‘signiﬁcant market power’’ trigger will be aligned with
the competition law concept of dominance, and any
obligations imposed on signiﬁcant market power
grounds must be the minimum required to address
identiﬁed competition problems. The new framework
requires the availability of full rights of appeal,
including appeal on the merits, against regulatory
decisions to a body with appropriate expertise. The
new Directives also incorporate mechanisms designed
to ensure consistency of regulation across the
European Union.
Oftel is currently consulting on the proposed
general conditions and Universal Service designations
and obligations. Both these aspects of the new
framework need to be in place when all existing
licences are due to cease to apply on 25 July 2003,
the implementation date for the new Directives. Oftel
is also consulting on market analyses required to
identify whether signiﬁcant market power exists in
speciﬁed market areas. However, as existing signiﬁcant
market power obligations can be carried forward until
the analyses are completed, this aspect of the
framework does not have to be in place by 25 July.
Signiﬁcant market power obligations under the new
framework may not, therefore, be implemented until
later in 2003 and Oftel has indicated that because the
process cannot be completed before 25 July, certain
existing licence conditions relating to market areas
subject to the analyses will need to be carried over until
at least the end of August. BT can, in any event, expect
to continue to be regulated in the majority of the
markets in which it is currently regulated.
The new general conditions and Universal Service
Obligations are not expected to have a major impact
on BT, although some beneﬁcial rationalisation of
these aspects of the framework is anticipated to result.
The introduction of the new deﬁnition of signiﬁcant
market power and the requirement for market analyses
should lead to the eventual withdrawal of competition-
related regulation, relying instead on competition law
in speciﬁed market sectors which are competitive or
which become competitive in the future. In its current
market analysis consultation documents, Oftel is
proposing the removal or relaxation of such regulation
in a number of markets. Similar regulatory reviews are
underway in all EU member states which will have an
impact on the level of regulation BT, and its suppliers,
are subject to in those countries.
The Communications Data Protection Directive,
which is not part of the main Electronic Communication
Directives, was adopted in June 2002 and must come
into force in Member States by 30 October 2003.
This Directive may have cost implications for industry.
Communications Bill and Ofcom
The UK Government has completed a review of
telecommunicationsandbroadcastingregulation.Anew
regulatory body has been established, called the Ofﬁce
of Communications (Ofcom), to amalgamate the roles
of the ﬁve existing regulatory agencies: the Director
General of Telecommunications; the Independent
Television Commission; the Broadcasting Standards
Commission; the Radio Authority and the
Radiocommunications Agency. Ofcom is headed by
a chairman (Lord Currie) and chief executive (Stephen Business review
20 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003
Carter) and supported by executive and non-executive
board members.
The reforms are in two parts. The ﬁrst comprises
the Ofﬁce of Communications Act passed in March
2002, which enables the board, ofﬁce and budgets of
Ofcom to be established, but does not enable Ofcom
to exercise any regulatory functions. The second
comprises a Communications Bill. The draft Bill was
published in May 2002 and the ﬁnal Bill is expected to
be passed by Parliament by 17 July 2003. It will confer
regulatory functions on Ofcom, which will be able to
take up those functions when the Bill is brought into
force. However, Ofcom is not expected to take up its
regulatory functions until later in the year and the Bill
provides for a transitional period between the Bill
coming into force and the date when Ofcom takes up
its formal powers. In this period, the existing regulators
will carry out Ofcom’s functions relating to networks
and services, and spectrum.
The main changes for providers of electronic
communications networks and services will be the
possibility of ﬁnes being imposed for breach of
regulatory obligations, appeals on the merits against
regulatory decisions and the creation of a new
regulatory regime which will, among other things,
implement the requirements of the new EU Directives
for general authorisations, instead of individual
licences, and basing regulation of dominant players
on analyses of relevant markets. Statutory instruments
have been made to enable preliminary work to be
undertaken to implement the Directives, and, in the
event that the Bill is not passed before 25 July 2003,
the deadline for implementation, the Government will
ensure implementation by means of further statutory
instruments which will, for a limited period, duplicate
provisions in the Bill.
Competition
The competitive environment
The UK telecommunications market is fully open to
entry and highly competitive. As a result, the UK
Government and Oftel have indicated their expectation
that it will be appropriate to move away from sector-
speciﬁc (including licence-based) regulation to greater
reliance on the Competition Act as individual markets
become sufﬁciently competitive. Furthermore, the new
EU Directives – see ‘‘New European Union Directives’’
– prohibit the imposition of competition based, sector-
speciﬁc economic regulation in any market which is
found to be effectively competitive.
In January 2000, Oftel published a strategy
statement based on the principle that regulation should
go no further than the minimum necessary to protect
consumers. The strategy is underpinned by a
programme of competition reviews, which are intended
to ensure that the regulatory framework responds to
changed competitive conditions: where it is found that
competition is delivering beneﬁts to consumers in the
sectors reviewed, regulation will be reduced or
withdrawn as appropriate. These reviews will need to
be incorporated into the market reviews mandated by
the new EU Directives, which will come into force by
25 July 2003 (see ‘‘New European Union Directives’’).
Although it is some years since the
Telecommunications Act abolished the monopoly
of the former statutory corporation, British
Telecommunications, in the running of
telecommunication systems, obligations placed on BT,
including pricing regulation and the requirement to
provide universal service (discussed below) are
generally more onerous than for other licensees.
Competition Act
In addition to telecommunications industry regulation,
BT is subject to general competition law.
By virtue of provisions in the Competition Act
1998, UK competition law is in line with European
Community law in prohibiting anti-competitive
agreements and concerted practices and the abuse
of a dominant market position. In the case of
telecommunications, the Director General of
Telecommunications has concurrent investigatory and
enforcement powers with the Ofﬁce of Fair Trading.
They also have signiﬁcant investigative powers. Breach
of the relevant prohibitions could lead to ﬁnes of up to
10% of relevant turnover in the UK for each year of
infringement (up to a maximum of three years) and/or
result in claims for damages in the civil courts. There
are also powers to order a company to cease an
infringing activity. There is an independent mechanism
for appeals to the Competition Appeals Tribunal
against decisions under the Competition Act.
Oftel is continuing to investigate the terms and
conditions of BT’s telephone rental business under
the Competition Act. Also, following the decision of
the Competition Appeals Tribunal in the Freeserve case
in April 2003, Oftel has undertaken to re-issue a
decision on BT Openworld’s broadband activities.
Enterprise Act
The Enterprise Act 2002, which received Royal Assent
on 7 November 2002, aims to give more independence
to the competition authorities, to reform insolvency
and bankruptcy laws and to tackle trading practices
that harm consumers.
TheprovisionsoftheActarelargelycomplementary
tothose ofthe CompetitionAct 1998, which willremain
in force with some minor amendments – but it also
contains new provisions criminalising cartels and
allowing for the disqualiﬁcation, in appropriate cases,
of company directors where companies commit
breaches of competition law.
Pricing regulation
Fixed network
We are subject to price controls on our ﬁxed network
services in the UK at two levels: retail and network.
Fixed network competitors are generally not subject to
direct price controls, although there are some controls
on mobile network operators.
Retail price controls
We are subject to two sets of UK retail price controls,
one on certain public-switched telephony call charges
and exchange line rentals, and one on certain private
circuits. Each price control is based on a formula Business review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 21
calculated by reference to the UK Retail Prices Index
(RPI) and a factor, X.
For services covered by the controls, the weighted
average of base prices cannot increase in each year
beginning 1 August by more than the annual change in
RPI minus X. The current retail price control for public-
switched telephony, applying from August 2002 to July
2006 is RPI minus RPI (i.e. the value of X is RPI and
prices cannot increase). It is measured on services used
by the lowest 80% of our residential customers
classiﬁed by bill size. From August 2002 the services
covered by the control were extended to include BT’s
share of the revenue for calls to all four mobile
networks, replacing the previous separate control on
BT for calls to Vodafone and O
2
. The price control
formula and our performance against the formula are
set out in the table below.
Under the new controls, we have also given an
assurance that increases in line rental for business
customers will be no more than the annual change in
RPI. Under the price controls for private circuits that
applied from August 1997 to July 2001, prices for
domestic analogue and low-speed digital private
circuits could not increase by more than the change
in the RPI in any year. The application of the analogue
price cap has been extended until July 2005 and the
low-speed digital private circuits cap was removed in
July 2001.
Review of retail price controls
In July 2002, BT accepted Oftel’s proposals for
changes to its licence to introduce new retail price
controls of RPI minus RPI (i.e. no price increase) from
1 August 2002 until 31 July 2006. Under the changes:
& BT is required to provide a cost-based wholesale
line rental product to other service providers at a
regulated price and in a way that does not discriminate
between BT’s retail business and service providers.
This product (Wholesale Access) has been available
from BT since 1 September 2002. Oftel has since
issued a further consultation regarding enhancements
to this product and BT, Oftel and industry are
discussing the proposed requirements.
& for those services covered by the previous control,
BT’s prices to the lowest spending 80% of its
customers would be pegged at their current level and
not allowed to rise with inﬂation, using an RPI minus
RPI price control. The services covered by the control
have been extended to include BT’s share of the
revenue for calls to all four mobile networks, replacing
the previous separate control (RPI minus 7%) on BT
for calls to Vodafone and O
2
UK.
& once Oftel is satisﬁed that the new wholesale line
rental product is fully implemented and starting to have
an impact in the retail market, the retail price control
will be further revised to allow prices to increase at the
rate of inﬂation.
& there are some minor changes to the workings of
the Light User Scheme designed speciﬁcally for people
making fewer calls, including provisions to extend the
number of customers potentially qualifying if the
standard exchange line rental rises signiﬁcantly.
Network charge control
We operate under interconnection agreements with
most other licensed operators. A new network charge
control period began on 1 October 2001 and will last
for four years from that date. It requires us to set
reasonable charges based on long-run incremental
costs for our standard interconnection services.
Depending on the degree of competition for these
services, charges are cap controlled each year by RPI
minus X (where X ranges from 7.5% to 13%) for
services Oftel considers unlikely to become competitive
in the near future; safeguard cap controlled (i.e. no
increases above RPI during any relevant year of the
overall control period) for services likely to become
competitive; and those services considered fully
competitive are not subject to direct charge controls.
The network charge controls that ended on
30 September 2001 capped charges for services
unlikely to become competitive in the near future at
RPI minus 8%. On 12 July 2002, a new condition was
included in the Licence. The effect was to set charges
for, and bring under regulatory control, BT’s ﬁxed
portability services. Number portability allows
customers to change the company providing their
telephony services without changing their telephone
number. Fourteen non-conveyance Portability Standard
Services were identiﬁed. The charge control runs from
1 August 2002 until 31 July 2006. The charges are
controlled by a RPI minus X formula, with X set at 5%.
BT must publish a notiﬁcation to the Director General
and other licensed operators if it intends to amend
existing charges or to offer new services.
Wholesale Access Charge Control
The charges for the Wholesale Access services agreed
by BT in July 2002 are subject to price control. The
charges for the line rental (residential and business

products), line transfer and new line installations have
been determined and are subject to a price control
of RPI minus 2% effective from 1 September 2002
for four years. The control applies to the aggregate
of all charges (rental, transfer and installation) as well
as to line transfers separately. BT is also under an
obligation to notify the Director General and service
providers if it intends to amend existing charges;
the notiﬁcation is 90 days for determined charges
and 28 days for all others.
Non-UK regulation
BT must comply with the regulatory regimes in the
countries in which it operates or wishes to operate.
The obligations placed on BT and its suppliers continue
to be relevant to its business models and have cost
implications for its end user services. These rules are
generally applied by national regulatory authorities
operating under a governmental mandate. The impact
of decisions of these bodies can have a material impact
on our business models from time to time.
European Union
See ‘‘New European Union Directives’’.
Rest of the world
The vast majority of the markets in which BT operates
around the world are regulated, and in the majority of
these it has to obtain licences or other authorisations
and comply with the conditions of these. The degree
to which these markets are liberalised varies widely:
while many are fully open to competition, others place
restrictions on market entrants, such as the extent
to which foreign ownership is permitted, or on the
services which may be provided. The extent to which
the national incumbent operator is effectively regulated
also varies considerably. BT’s ability to compete fully in
some countries is therefore constrained.
Other signiﬁcant changes and issues
Broadband regulation
There has been considerable dialogue with Oftel and
the Department of Trade and Industry over the past
ﬁnancial year regarding the introduction of broadband
services and how best to deal with the issues arising
from rapid roll-out. Much of this activity has centred
around the creation of approaches designed to foster
increased demand, to reduce the costs of providing
broadband facilities, and to encourage creative
partnerships with others, both in the public and private
sectors, and to bring the beneﬁts of broadband to
areas that might not be reached on a purely
commercial basis. In addition to the standard licence
and competition law obligations, BT ensures that the
particular obligations for wholesale service provider
products are met. These include the need to treat BT’s
retail businesses and service providers equally and the
provision of various interconnection points to BT’s
broadband network.
Deregulation of inbound services
Inbound services were deregulated in July 2002 as
the market for these services is now fully competitive.
BT no longer has a regulatory obligation to supply
voice inbound services (e.g. 0800, 0845, 0870, 09XX),
to notify and publish prices, or adhere to them.
We can therefore choose to offer different prices
and service levels to different customers. BT must,
of course, still comply with competition law. The
result of deregulation has been that prices have been
reduced in this market.
Local loop unbundling
The Licence requires the provision of unbundled local
loops to other operators to enable them to provide
telecommunications services, including broadband
ADSL services, to end customers. Local loop
unbundling, line sharing and sub-loop unbundling
are also required by an EU Regulation. Local loop
unbundling services have been phased in over the
past few years. In March 2003, BT launched a line
sharing service.
Carrier pre-selection
Carrier pre-selection (CPS), required by a condition
in the Licence, allows customers to opt for certain
classes of call to be carried by an alternative operator,
selected in advance, without having to dial additional
access codes.
Leased lines
Oftel published a Direction in respect of Partial Private
Circuits (PPCs) in December 2002. PPCs are a
wholesale variant of certain private circuits at cost-
based prices, which interconnecting operators can use
to form local tail-parts of end-to-end circuits offered
to their retail customers. The Direction resulted from
an investigation into the cost base of this relatively new
wholesale product group (PPCs were initially launched
in August 2001). The Direction resulted in reductions
averaging 15% to 20% in PPC charges compared with
the initial 2001 PPC charge levels, along with a range
of relatively minor amendments to the product
speciﬁcations. A proportion of the price reductions has
been made on a retrospective basis, as the majority
of private circuits leased by other operators had
already switched to PPC prices and conditions following
initial launch. Now that the Oftel investigation has
concluded, BT is looking forward to a period of
stability as the use of the new product portfolio
becomes established.
Universal Service Obligation (USO)
The Communications Bill will implement the Universal
Service Directive, one element of the new European
Union Directives package (see ‘‘New European Union
Directives’’). Oftel consulted in March 2003 on
conditions to apply to BT. Some additional obligations
are proposed, such as guidelines that refer to a
minimum data rate of 28.8 kbit/s which will have
adverse cost implications for BT if implemented. Oftel
continues to take the view that the USO is not an
unfair burden on BT. Oftel is expected to carry out
a formal review of the USO next year, looking at
the scope and funding of the USO, and is currently Business review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 23
consulting on the controls applying to removal and
re-siting of payphones.
Flat-rate internet interconnection (FRIACO)
Initially launched in 2000, this group of products
is the normal means of providing interconnecting
operators with a service to support ﬂat-rate internet
access packages via internet service providers to end
users. Most FRIACO use involves interconnection at
local exchange level, and the period of rapid growth
in demand, following the initial FRIACO launch, has
now developed into a more stable environment. The
charges for both FRIACO services are subject to RPI
minus X controls under the Network Charge Control
regime and hence have been falling gradually. Oftel
is currently consulting on whether there should be a
further reduction in the price of one element of the
service with effect from December 2001.
Relationship with the UK Government
The UK Government collectively is BT’s largest
customer, but the provision of services to any one
department or agency of the UK Government does
not comprise a material proportion of its revenues.
Except as described below, the commercial relationship
between BT as a supplier and the UK Government
as customer has been on a normal customer and
supplier basis.
We can be required by law to do certain things
and to provide certain services for the UK Government.
The Licence obliges BT and other licensees,
after consultation with central and local government,
to make, and if necessary implement, plans for the
provision or restoration of services in emergencies.
In addition, the Secretary of State has statutory powers
to require us to take certain actions in the interests
of national security and international relations.
Legal proceedings
The company does not believe there are any pending
legal proceedings which would have a material
adverse effect on the ﬁnancial position or operations
of the group.
Proceedings have been initiated in Italy against
21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in
connection with the Italian UMTS auction. Blu, in which
BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction
process. The ﬁrst hearing has been scheduled for
11 July 2003, in Rome. If the proceedings are
successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for
any damages. The company has concluded that it is
not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any
such potential claim. 24 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003
Investors are paying increasing attention to the ways
in which social, environmental and ethical issues are
managed to both preserve and grow shareholder value.
For example, the Dow Jones sustainability indexes
rank companies for their success in managing those
factors for competitive advantage. During the 2003
ﬁnancial year, BT was ranked as the top
telecommunications company in the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index for the second year running.
We also won the Queen’s Award for Enterprise
in recognition of our contribution to sustainable
development.
A further manifestation of investor interest is the
Association of British Insurers’ disclosure guidelines
covering social, environmental and ethical risks and
opportunities.
BT’s top-level response to those guidelines is
provided in the section on Corporate governance,
with further information provided here.
Other parts of this report cover business integrity,
corporate governance and employee issues, such as
diversity and health and safety. This section
concentrates on CSR (corporate social responsibility)
governance, CSR risks, digital inclusion, environment,
community and business opportunities.
More detailed disclosures on BT’s implementation
of social, ethical and environmental policies and
procedures are available online in our independently
veriﬁed social and environmental report.
Corporate social responsibility governance
A Board committee – the Community Support
Committee – oversees social investment expenditure
and establishes the strategy for maximising our
contribution to society. The committee, chaired by
Sir Christopher Bland, consists of representatives from
BT businesses, two non-executive directors and two
external independent members, who have a reputation
for excellence in this ﬁeld.
An internal committee, known as the Corporate
Social Responsibility Steering Group, oversees the
implementation of our CSR programme. This includes
risk assessment, performance management, public
accountability, ISO14001 certiﬁcation – the
international standard for environmental management
systems – and objective setting and control. The
steering group, which makes regular reports to
the Board, is chaired by a member of the
Operating Committee.
During 2003 the steering group agreed an action
plan to ensure that BT’s CSR activities help deliver the
BT strategy and established a set of non-ﬁnancial key
performance indicators to provide an overview of BT’s
social and environmental performance. The steering
group also approved an accompanying set of targets
for the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
BT takes quality very seriously and is fully
accredited to ISO9001.
To ensure that CSR is embedded into BT’s
commercial operations we have commenced a
series of CSR ‘‘health checks’’ of our main
commercial initiatives.
These health checks identify speciﬁc social, economic
and environmental impacts (both positive and negative)
and particular CSR risks and opportunities. A report is
then compiled, including recommended actions.
In addition, social, ethical and environmental
matters have been incorporated into the directors’
induction programme.
We have important relationships with a wide range
of different stakeholders, including employees,
customers and suppliers. We engage with these
stakeholders in a number of ways, including consumer
liaison panels, an annual employee survey and a
supplier relationship management programme.
We also employ a number of CSR experts who
investigate long-term societal trends, identify potential
issues that might affect the business and support BT’s
commercial activities.
Finally, our social and environmental report
has been brought into accordance with the 2002
Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and received
a commendation in the 2002 Association of
Chartered Certiﬁed Accountants (ACCA) Sustainability
Reporting Awards.
Social, environmental and ethical risks
Currently, we identify no social, environmental or
ethical risks that would have a material impact on
our business.
However, we have identiﬁed the issue of supply
chain working conditions as posing a potential risk to
our reputation. In order to address this potential risk,
we have introduced our Sourcing with Human Dignity
programme – a collaborative undertaking seeking the
active support of all our relevant suppliers.
By 31 March 2003, 16 key suppliers (79% of those
targeted) had signed an agreement with BT giving their
written support concerning ethical trading.
Over the past two years, 16 initial on-site
assessments and seven re-visits have been undertaken
in industry sectors where we believe the risk of falling
short of our Sourcing with Human Dignity standard
is at its highest.
BT’s certiﬁcation to ISO14001 includes an
environmental risk assessment process and the bulk
storage of diesel fuel for use in back-up generators
at telephone exchanges has been identiﬁed as our
only signiﬁcant environmental risk.
Although there are a small number of BT sites
where ground remediation is taking place, the cost is
not material and so we declare no material contingent
environmental liability in our ﬁnancial statements. In
order to minimise any future liability in this area, we
are undertaking an £18 million programme to cover
tank testing, enhanced maintenance scheduling and
remedial works.
Digital inclusion
The digital divide is a key public policy issue and we
are working together with the UK Government and
the voluntary sector to ﬁnd effective ways to use
communications technology to tackle social exclusion.
Our commitment to society Our commitment to society
In particular, we launched a digital inclusion campaign
to support the Government’s aim to give all citizens
online access within the next few years and
demonstrate how communications can help
improve society.
A key element of the campaign is the
‘‘Everybodyonline’’ programme, which has been
established in partnership with charity campaign group
Citizens Online and is initially focused in ﬁve deprived
communities. The campaign aims to increase access
to communications technology in underprivileged
areas and to deepen the understanding of the causes
and effects of the digital divide and how they may
be addressed nationally.
Through our age and disability action team, we are
committed to providing older and disabled customers
with access to a full range of products and services.
For people with hearing or speech impairments,
our textphone offers easy access to BT TextDirect —
the service that enables textphone users to dial direct
to other text or voice users. In addition, our mm215
Videophone has improved communications for people
who rely on non-verbal communication, such as British
Sign Language. Building on the success of our Big
Button phone, the range has been extended to include
an analogue cordless version with a digital (DECT)
version being planned.
We continue to offer services to protect the
telephone lines of people who are vulnerable, free
directory enquiries for those unable to use the printed
directory, as well as billing, service and product
information in a variety of formats, such as Braille
and large print.
We are committed to increasing the accessibility
of our internet pages and currently offer an alternative
text version of the www.bt.com homepage. Our age
and disability website, www.bt.com/age_disability,
highlights features of products and services that may
be beneﬁcial to older and disabled people and is
continually updated to ensure that it can be accessed
by all customers, regardless of ability.
Environment
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year we continued to focus on
reducing our environmental impacts. We invested
£845,000 in our energy conservation programme
which, despite the roll-out of broadband, enabled us to
restrict our electricity consumption to a 4% increase.
A combined heat and power supply contract provided
76% of our electricity needs, saving 274,000 tonnes
of global warming CO
2
emissions.
Also in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, we recycled 24%
of our total 89,878 tonnes of waste. We received
£4.26 million income from our recycling activities,
offset against the £8.29 million we spent managing our
waste contracts, recycling our waste and sending waste
to landﬁll. The cost of sending our waste to landﬁll
sites was £1.17 million. However, during the year we
succeeded in reducing the amount of waste sent to
landﬁll by 1.1%.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year we reduced our
operational ﬂeet by 9.4% to 33,979 vehicles – still
one of the largest in the UK – and reduced our
fuel consumption by 11%.
Community
We commit a minimum of 0.5% of our UK pre-tax
proﬁts to direct activities in support of society. This
has ranged from £10 million in 1987, peaking at
£16 million in 2001 and was £8.2 million (including
£1.2 million to charities) in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
BT operations also provided a further £17.9 million
in funding and support in kind over the past
ﬁnancial year.
The focus of our community programmes is on big
issues where better communication can make a real
difference to society.
For example, more than 8,300 schools and around
two million young people engagements with the
BT Education Programme – a drama-based campaign
helping children to improve their communication skills
– have taken place. This activity is supported by our
volunteering programme which, at 31 March 2003,
had 4,000 registered volunteers working with schools.
BT’s contribution to charitable causes uses a range
of communications tools, including our telephone
network, for disaster appeals and for telethons such as
Comic Relief, Children in Need and GMTV’s Get Up
and Give. Through our support, we enable the appeals
to raise tens of millions of pounds each year.
We are working with ChildLine on a major new
campaign to help ensure that all young people can
be heard. At the heart of this campaign is our
commitment to raise funds to help ChildLine answer
every one of the 4,000 children who call them
every day.
During the second year of the BT Community
Connections scheme (ending in July 2003) BT will
award 1,700 internet-ready PCs to individuals and
community groups.
In addition, BT people gave £2 million directly to
charities during the 2003 ﬁnancial year through Give
as you Earn, to which BT added a direct contribution
of £1 million.
Business opportunities
Following a detailed statistical analysis of customer
opinion data going back up to 80 months and based on
tens of thousands of interviews, we have been able to
show that a 1% improvement in the public’s perception
of our CSR activities results in a 0.1% increase in our
retail customer satisfaction ﬁgures.
This is a critical correlation and shows how
important it is not only to protect our reputation
through appropriate risk management activities, but
also to enhance it through our community activities.
Long-term sustainability trends are creating market
opportunities for us, such as the use of
teleconferencing and ﬂexible working to reduce the
need to travel and provide more ﬂexible lifestyles.
Increasingly, BT has to address social and
environmental matters when bidding for business. In
the 2003 ﬁnancial year, contracts to the value of more
than £300 million required us to demonstrate expertise
in managing these issues.

Introduction
The 2003 ﬁnancial year was characterised by a focus
on implementing and delivering the three-year strategy
announced in April 2002 and further corporate
transactions in the continued restructuring of the group
and reduction of net debt. The corporate transactions
included the unwind of the Concert joint venture on
1 April 2002 and the disposal of our interest in Cegetel
for £2.6 billion.
The 2002 ﬁnancial year was dominated by a series
of corporate transactions designed to focus and
transform the group and reduce its net debt position.
Those corporate transactions included raising
£5.9 billion through the rights issue in June 2001,
selling our Japanese telecom and Spanish mobile
investments for £4.8 billion, selling the Yell directories
business for approximately £2 billion, the demerger of
mmO
2
and the sale and leaseback of properties for
£2.4 billion.
During the 2001 ﬁnancial year the group
underwent an organisational restructuring that resulted
in the formation of the lines of business with activities
being grouped by market sector rather than
geography. Signiﬁcant acquisitions were also made for
a total consideration of £11.9 billion, including Viag
Interkom and Telfort.
As a result of the major restructuring of the group
and the signiﬁcant level of corporate transactions
completed during the period under review, we believe
it is difﬁcult for investors to meaningfully compare the
ﬁnancial performance of the group between the
ﬁnancial years under review. In this Financial review the
commentary is therefore focused principally on the
trading results of the continuing activities of BT Group
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. In
comparing the continuing activities of the group, the
results of our discontinued activities, namely our
Japanese telecom and Spanish mobile investments, Yell
and mmO
2
are excluded. Goodwill amortisation is
excluded because the annual charge has varied
signiﬁcantly during the period under review as a result
of the corporate transactions noted above and the
exceptional impairment charges. The exceptional items
are excluded because they predominantly relate to the
corporate transactions rather than the trading activities
of the group. This is also consistent with the way that
ﬁnancial performance is measured by management and
we believe allows a meaningful comparison to be made
of the trading results of the group during the period
under review.
The goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
are therefore analysed and discussed separately from
the line of business results in this Financial review
because they are considered to be a reﬂection of the
corporate activity rather than the trading activity of the
lines of business.
The following table shows the summarised proﬁt
and loss account which includes a reconciliation of the
key performance measures before and after goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items and is discussed
further in this Financial review. The operating results by
line of business are discussed in addition to the overall
group results as we believe the activities and markets
they serve are distinct and this analysis provides a
greater degree of insight to investors. Summarised proﬁt and loss account 2003 2002 2001

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 29 Group results
All references in this section to the prior year results
or performance against the prior year are in relation
to the results from continuing activities.
Group turnover increased by 2% to £18,727 million
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The strength in the group’s
new wave businesses and a strong defence of the
group’s market share in its existing businesses was
offset by price deﬂation. This compared to growth of
8% in the 2002 ﬁnancial year and reﬂected the difﬁcult
market conditions.
Group operating proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items at £2,790 million
for the 2003 ﬁnancial year was £19 million higher than
the prior year. The cost efﬁciencies achieved during the
year were offset by a £90 million increase in leaver
costs, the negative group operating proﬁt effects of
unwinding the Concert global venture and the Telereal
property sale and leaseback transaction. In total, these
effects reduced group operating proﬁts by over
£400 million, although this was compensated for at the
proﬁt before tax level by a corresponding improvement
in our share of the operating proﬁts of associates and
joint ventures and net interest payable.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year the group operating
proﬁt before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items declined by 10% to £2,771 million.
BT’s share of associates and joint ventures
operating proﬁts before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items was £181 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year compared to a £108 million loss and a
£157 million loss in the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years,
respectively. The improvement in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year mainly reﬂected the beneﬁt of the unwind of the
Concert global venture.
Net interest payable before exceptional items was
£1,146 million for the 2003 ﬁnancial year, an
improvement of £271 million against the 2002
ﬁnancial year as a result of the reduction in the level
of net debt. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year net interest
payable was £221 million higher than the 2001
ﬁnancial year effecting the increased net debt.
The above factors resulted in the group achieving
a proﬁt before taxation, goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items of £1,829 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year, an increase of 44%, reﬂecting the
underlying operating performance of the group and
lower net interest costs. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year
the proﬁt before taxation, goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items of £1,273 million was £490 million
lower than the 2001 ﬁnancial year.
The taxation charge for the 2003 ﬁnancial year was
£598 million on the proﬁt before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items, an effective rate of 32.7%
compared to 41.5% and 21.8% in the 2002 and 2001
ﬁnancial years. The high effective rate in the 2002
ﬁnancial year was mainly due to the impact of loss
making subsidiaries outside the UK for which tax relief
was not available. The low effective rate in the 2001
ﬁnancial year reﬂected tax relief on losses surrendered
by discontinued activities.
Basic earnings per share before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items were 14.2 pence
for the 2003 ﬁnancial year, an increase of 61% from
8.8 pence in the 2002 ﬁnancial year, and 19.3 pence
in the 2001 ﬁnancial year. The 2002 ﬁnancial
year reﬂected the higher operating costs and net
interest payable.
Line of business results
In the following commentary, we discuss the operating
results of the group for the 2003, 2002 and 2001
ﬁnancial years in terms of the lines of business
established during the 2001 ﬁnancial year. During the
2003 ﬁnancial year BT Openworld was transferred
under the management control of BT Retail and the
results have been adjusted to reﬂect this change for
all periods under review.
There is extensive trading between the lines of
business and their proﬁtability is dependent on the
transfer price levels. The intra-group trading
arrangements are subject to review and have changed
in certain circumstances. Where that is the case the
comparative ﬁgures have been restated to reﬂect
these changes.
The line of business results are presented and
discussed before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, for the reasons set out above, to provide a
meaningful comparison of the trading results between
the ﬁnancial years under review. Goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items are discussed separately in a
group context in the Financial review.

management also measure the operating ﬁnancial
performance of the lines of business based upon the
EBITDA before exceptional items. EBITDA is deﬁned
as the group operating proﬁt (loss) before depreciation
and amortisation. This may not be directly comparable
to the EBITDA of other companies as they may deﬁne
it differently. EBITDA excludes depreciation and
amortisation, both being non cash items, from group
operating proﬁt and is a common measure, particularly
in the telecommunications sector, used by investors
and analysts in evaluating the operating ﬁnancial
performance of companies.
EBITDA before exceptional items is considered to
be a good measure of the operating performance
because it reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs,
by eliminating depreciation and amortisation, and
excludes non-recurring exceptional items that are
predominantly related to corporate transactions.
EBITDA is not a direct measure of the group’s liquidity,
which is shown by the group’s cash ﬂow statement and
needs to be considered in the context of the group’s
ﬁnancial commitments. A reconciliation of EBITDA
before exceptional items to group operating proﬁt by
line of business is provided in the table across the page
above. Trends in EBITDA are discussed for each line of
business in the following commentary.
The following commentary on the line of business
results also discusses their operating free cash ﬂow
before exceptional items, which is deﬁned as EBITDA
before exceptional items less capital expenditure. This
cash ﬂow measure is used to monitor the contribution
to the group free cash ﬂow of the line of business
management teams, who are set targets against this
measure. It is not possible to directly reconcile this
measure to the cash ﬂow from operating activities by
line of business because of the group’s centralised
treasury and cash operations. We believe investors are
interested in understanding the cash ﬂow performance
of the individual lines of business and therefore
operating free cash ﬂow is the liquidity measure that
we use at a line of business level. Operating free cash
ﬂow is not used as a liquidity measure at a
consolidated group level where cash generation can
be directly measured by reference to the consolidated
cash ﬂow statement. Trends in operating free cash
ﬂow are discussed for each line of business in the
following commentary.
The table across the page above shows the
reconciliation of the group operating proﬁts to EBITDA
before exceptional items and operating free cash ﬂow

Within the residential voice market BT Retail
maintained market share as it has done since June
2000, with share internally estimated at around 73%.
In the business voice market, internal estimates put
BT Retail’s market share at 45% compared to 49%
and 53% in the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years.
BT Retail’s turnover increased by 4% in the 2003
ﬁnancial year to £13,301 million after rising by 2% in
the 2002 ﬁnancial year. The increase in the 2003
ﬁnancial year included revenues from the UK
multinational customers re-integrated into BT Retail
from the Concert global venture. As well as the beneﬁt
of the returning Concert business, BT Retail continued
to defend core revenues and grew new wave revenues.
Turnover for the three years is summarised as follows:

Voice services comprise calls made by customers on
the BT ﬁxed line network in the UK, analogue lines,
equipment sales and rentals and other business voice
products. Overall turnover from voice services was
maintained in the 2003 ﬁnancial year after declining
by 2% in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
Call revenues comprise all calls made by customers
on the BT ﬁxed line network in the UK, including
outbound international calls, calls to mobile phones
and calls to the internet. These were 2% lower in the
2003 ﬁnancial year and 5% lower in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year as a result of price and volume reductions.
BT Retail’s total call volumes declined by 5% in the
2003 ﬁnancial year (2002 – 6% growth, 2001 – 8%
growth) with geographic (local, national and
international) calls declining by 4% (2002 – 6%, 2001
– 10%). This decline in geographic call volumes has
been offset by growth in ﬁxed to mobile call volumes
of 6% (2002 – 10%, 2001 – 32%). The rate of decline
in geographic call volumes has been stemmed due
to initiatives in the residential market such as
BT Together, Chataway weekends and the 1571
service. In the business voice market, volumes have
declined in both the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years,
driven by a combination of customers switching out
of traditional telephony and pressure from the
implementation of Carrier Pre-Selection (CPS).
Building on the success of the BT Together residential
packages, BT Business Plan was launched in January
2003 to combat the effect of CPS, a competitive
package which places a ceiling of 10 pence on national
and local business calls, rewards loyalty and provides a
single BT customer contact.
Non geographic call volumes switched from growth of
23% in the 2002 ﬁnancial year to a decline of 6% in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year mainly reﬂecting the switch of
internet calls from measured call minute products to a
mixture of ﬂat rate based products and broadband
products. This continued trend will dilute the
correlation between revenues and call minutes.
Turnover from analogue exchange lines and other
voice services (which includes operator services,
directory enquiries, payphones and chargecards) of
£4,896 million (2002 – £4,778 million, 2001 –
£4,654 million) increased by 3% in both the 2003 and
2002 ﬁnancial years.
Turnover from intermediate products in the 2003
ﬁnancial year of £2,873 million (2002 – £2,668 million,
2001 – £2,413 million) increased by 8% in the 2003
ﬁnancial year and 11% in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. This
is despite the migration of customers from retail
private circuits to partial private circuits. As a result of
changes required by Oftel, partial private circuits used
by UK ﬁxed network operators are no longer provided
by BT Retail, but are provided as a BT Wholesale
product. This reduced revenue by approximately
£100 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
The total number of BT Retail lines have increased
by 1% to 29.3 million at 31 March 2003 following an
increase in the 2002 ﬁnancial year, with high speed
ISDN lines being the main driver behind the growth.
New wave revenues grew by 46% to £850 million
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year compared to a growth of
40% to £582 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. This
growth reﬂects the continued focus on the ICT,
broadband and mobility products. The key contract
wins in the 2003 ﬁnancial year were Unilever, Bradford
& Bingley, National Australia Group, Abbey National
and Honeywell. Under the terms of the trading model
with BT Global Services these ICT revenues are
recognised as an internal sale by BT Retail.
BT Broadband and BT Openworld broadband
products performed strongly. BT Broadband, launched
in September 2002, had 137,000 connections at
31 March 2003 and the BT Openworld broadband
product, launched in March 2002 had 292,000
connections at 31 March 2003 giving total BT Retail
broadband connections of 429,000, 54% of
BT Wholesale’s 800,000 ADSL connections.
Gross margin increased by 12% to £3,874 million
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year and was ﬂat in the 2002
ﬁnancial year. The improvements are driven by the
success of BT Together packages, improved product
mix and lower wholesale prices which more than offset
the impact of the decline in call volumes.
Gross margin is turnover less costs directly
attributable to the provision of the products and
services reﬂected in turnover in the period. Selling,
general and administration costs are those costs that
are ancillary to the business processes of providing
products and services and are the general business
operating costs. BT Retail analyse their costs in this
manner for management purposes in common with
Financial review
32 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 other retail organisations and they have set target
savings for selling, general and administration costs.
Cost transformation programmes in the 2003
ﬁnancial year generated savings in sales, general and
administration costs which were offset by the additional
costs associated with the Concert business. Excluding
these Concert related costs there was a reduction of
7% to £2,240 million. These savings were driven by
a reduction in people related expenses such as travel,
accommodation and communications, lower service
costs resulting from improvements in service quality,
billing initiatives and similar cost reduction
programmes. These cost savings were net of the costs
of the investment in new wave activities. BT Retail
comfortably exceeded its target of £200 million sales,
general and administration cost savings in the core
business in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. In the 2002
ﬁnancial year, the cost transformation programmes
produced savings of £167 million (7%) in selling,
general and administration costs, excluding goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items.
The number of employees in BT Retail at 31 March
2003 and 31 March 2002 was 50,400 and 51,200
respectively. 800 employees joined BT Retail from
the Concert global venture.
The cost savings and improved gross margins
contributed towards BT Retail’s strong EBITDA growth,
before exceptional items, in the 2003 ﬁnancial year of
£434 million (36%) to £1,634 million and by
£326 million (37%) to £1,200 million in the 2002
ﬁnancial year. These improvements have enabled
BT Retail to contribute an operating free cash ﬂow
(EBITDA less capital expenditure) before exceptional
items of £1,519 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year and
£1,047 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year, representing
improvements of 45% and 48%, respectively. This
improvement also reﬂects the reduction in capital
expenditure to £115 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
(2002 – £153 million, 2001 – £167 million).
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year, BT Retail launched the
next generation multifunctional contact centre
programme, which rationalises the number of call
centres from 104 sites to 30 over a two year period.
The programme remains on track. The associated
exceptional costs of £68 million, and the other
exceptional costs of £43 million relating to the
impairment of payphone assets and investments,
are discussed on pages 36 and 37.

The majority of BT Wholesale’s revenues are for
supplying network services to other BT lines of business
(2003 – 69%, 2002 – 68%, 2001 – 72%), mainly to
BT Retail. External turnover is derived from providing
wholesale products and solutions to other operators
interconnecting with BT’s UK ﬁxed network, including
mmO
2
since the demerger. Internal turnover and costs
with mmO
2
for prior years have been reclassiﬁed as
external in this section to enable a meaningful year
on year comparison.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, turnover totalled
£11,260 million, a decline of 8% following an increase
of 5% to £12,256 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
The results for the 2002 ﬁnancial year included total
turnover of £770 million relating to the former Concert
global venture, which was re-integrated from 1 April
2002. Excluding this Concert turnover in the 2002
ﬁnancial year, the underlying turnover declined by 2%
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. This reduction in the 2003
ﬁnancial year is primarily due to a 7% decrease in
network unit prices and mix, and a 5% increase in
network volumes. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year network
volume growth of 8% was partly offset by the effect
of price and product mix.
External turnover declined by 11% in the 2003
ﬁnancial year to £3,472 million; although excluding
sales to Concert in the 2002 ﬁnancial year, the
underlying external turnover increased by 3%. In the
2002 ﬁnancial year, external turnover grew by 19%
to £3,911 million.
Within traditional products, the impact of price
reductions – due to ﬂat rate price packages, Network
Charge Control (NCC) and Oftel price determinations –
coupled with unfavourable market conditions have
stemmed the rate of growth in external turnover in the
2003 ﬁnancial year. Turnover from retail private
circuits at £309 million reduced by 14% in the 2003
ﬁnancial year and in the 2002 ﬁnancial year at
£358 million increased by 3% when compared to the
respective prior year. The decline in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year is due to the migration of customers from retail
private circuits to lower priced partial private circuits,
introduced in August 2001, which showed an increase
in turnover of 89% to £106 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. FRIACO generated turnover of
£84 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year (2002 –
£68 million, 2001 – £nil) and follows the move to ﬂat
rate packages by internet service providers.
Conveyance and low margin transit revenues of
£2,064 million have remained virtually ﬂat in the 2003
ﬁnancial year reﬂecting the ongoing slow down in the
mobile market and TMT sector that began in the ﬁnal
quarter of the 2002 ﬁnancial year. This followed an
increase of 17% in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
New business external turnover, including
broadband and solutions products and services, at
£189 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year showed strong
growth of 85%. This continued the trend from the
2002 ﬁnancial year when new business turnover, at
£102 million, was 240% higher. The increase in the
2003 ﬁnancial year principally reﬂects the gains being
made in network facilities management and internet
connectivity products, including ADSL lines. Wholesale
ADSL lines had an installed base of 800,000 at
31 March 2003 representing growth of 380% over the
previous year. At 16 May 2003 the installed base was
936,000 and with additions since January 2003
running at a rate of well over 20,000 connections per
Financial review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 33 week are on target to reach one million connections in
the summer of 2003.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, internal turnover
decreased by 7% to £7,788 million after a decrease of
1% to £8,345 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. The
unwind of the Concert global venture has resulted in
a reduction of internal revenues in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year. Excluding the Concert related revenues in the
2002 ﬁnancial year, the reduction in internal turnover
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year was 4%. This reduction was
primarily due to a reduction in prices on sales to
BT Retail, partly offset by the increased sales to other
BT lines of business.
Despite network volume increases in the 2003
ﬁnancial year, BT Wholesale’s operating costs,
excluding depreciation and exceptional items,
decreased by 10% to £7,538 million, mainly due to
the £905 million of Concert related costs in the 2002
ﬁnancial year offset by an increase in leaver costs of
£108 million. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year, operating
costs, excluding depreciation and exceptional items,
rose by 9% to £8,355 million. The principal reasons
for these changes are discussed below.
Interconnect payments to other network operators
decreased by 18% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year to
£3,143 million. The unwind of the Concert global
venture accounted for the majority of this reduction
as interconnect payments to Concert were no longer
made. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year, these costs increased
by 11% to £3,849 million compared to the prior year.
These costs are mainly recharged to BT Retail with no
margin or reﬂect external transit revenues with a
minimal margin.
Net staff costs in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, at
£815 million, increased by 19% after increasing by
15% to £686 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
The increase in the 2003 ﬁnancial year reﬂects an
increase in leaver costs compared to the prior year
of £108 million. The increase in both years also reﬂects
a change in the mix of capital and current work.
Payments to other BT lines of business declined by
12% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year to £3,010 million after
increasing by 6% to £3,429 million in the 2002
ﬁnancial year. The reduction in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
was principally due to the unwind of the Concert global
venture which reduced the cost of sales of BT Retail
products, and a reduction in service costs. The increase
in the 2002 ﬁnancial year was mainly due to an
increase in payments to BT Retail for cost of sales of
BT Retail products and services, and an increase in
payments to BT Global Services for broadband services,
offset by reductions in other group charges.
Depreciation costs were broadly ﬂat in the 2003
ﬁnancial year at £1,923 million, after an increase
of 10% to £1,914 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
The increase in the 2002 ﬁnancial year was due
to a reduction in assumed asset lives as BT continues
its programme of network investment offset by the
effect of reduced capital expenditure.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year an exceptional bad debt
charge of £79 million was recognised as a result of the
severe liquidity problems in the TMT sector during the
latter part of the year.
EBITDA at £3,847 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
was 7% lower than in the 2002 ﬁnancial year following
a reduction of 3% to £4,156 million, before exceptional
items, in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
Operating proﬁt at £1,924 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year was 14% lower after a reduction of 12%
to £2,242 million, before exceptional items, in the
2002 ﬁnancial year. The operating proﬁt margins,
before exceptional items, achieved in each of the 2003,
2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years have been reducing at
17%, 18% and 22%, respectively.
Capital expenditure on plant and equipment at
£1,652 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year was 16%
lower than the 2002 ﬁnancial year, following a decline
in the 2002 ﬁnancial year of 13% to £1,974 million.
This reﬂects continued cost control, tight governance
and the alignment of capital spend with the
development of the future network strategy.
During the 2003 ﬁnancial year, BT Wholesale
focused its cost reduction programme on managed
cash costs (operating costs excluding payments to
other network operators and depreciation, plus capital
expenditure). After adjusting for the unwind of Concert,
managed cash costs at £6,047 million decreased by
1% despite the 5% increase in network volumes and
extra leaver payments of £108 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. After allowing for price changes and
volume effects, the managed cash cost savings were
£237 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, exceeding the
full year target of £200 million. Managed cash costs
are used to measure the controllable operating and
capital cash costs of the BT Wholesale business.
Accordingly it excludes payments to other network
operators and depreciation. Targets have been set for
achieving managed cash cost savings and accordingly
performance against those targets is reported.
BT Wholesale maintained its strong cash
generation performance with operating free cash ﬂow
(EBITDA less capital expenditure) of £2,195 million in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year. This follows an increase of 9%
to £2,182 million, before exceptional items, in the
2002 ﬁnancial year.

BT Global Services (formerly known as BT Ignite) is
BT’s business services and solutions business, serving
customers worldwide. It is an ICT service provider,
offering integrated data and value-added services to
meet the European needs of global multi-site
corporates and the global needs of European
corporates. BT Global Services now includes the former
Concert managed services network infrastructure in
Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas within
its business supporting the frame relay, ATM IP and
other data services. The Global Products and Global
Financial review
34 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Carrier divisions within BT Global Services reﬂect
the majority of the results of the returning Concert
businesses in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year BT Global Services
turnover was £5,251 million representing an increase
of 17% compared to the prior year. The Global Carrier
division reﬂected an increase of £744 million in the
2003 ﬁnancial year to £1,007 million, principally due
to the re-integration of the international carrier
business of the former Concert global venture. Global
Products turnover grew by 22% in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year to £1,883 million mainly due to the re-integration
of Concert and the growth in IP VPN (Internet Protocol
Virtual Private Network) products. Syntegra performed
strongly in the difﬁcult systems integration market with
turnover of £623 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, an
increase of 2%. Solutions turnover grew by 11% in the
2003 ﬁnancial year to £2,042 million and order intake
in the second half of the year has been very strong,
with total orders for the year of £3.6 billion, after a
slow ﬁrst half year.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year BT Global Services’
turnover was £4,472 million representing an increase
of 29% driven mainly by Solutions, European
operations and UK IP revenues.
Continued cost reductions, both in network costs
as well as selling, general and administration costs,
helped generate improvements in EBITDA before
exceptional items in the 2003 ﬁnancial year of 22% to
£178 million, following an improvement of £96 million
in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. The re-integration of the
former Concert business has had an adverse impact on
the growth in EBITDA before exceptional items. The
2003, 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years include leaver
costs of £65 million, £55 million and £8 million
respectively. Headcount increased by 3% to 17,200 in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year as a result of the re-integration
of 1,900 employees from the former Concert business
offset by leavers and reduced by 2,100 to 16,700 in
the 2002 ﬁnancial year. All major European operations
achieved their target of becoming EBITDA positive
during the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year an exceptional charge
of £2,211 million was recognised principally relating
to the impairment of the goodwill and tangible ﬁxed
assets of the European activities. This followed the
announcement that activities were being streamlined
to focus on multi-site corporate customers.
The group operating loss before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items increased by
£74 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year to a loss of
£427 million after increasing by £44 million to a loss
of £353 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. The loss
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year includes the adverse impact
of the former Concert business.
Capital expenditure for the 2003 ﬁnancial year was
£439 million, a reduction of 28%, and £609 million in
the 2002 ﬁnancial year, a reduction of 35%. This
demonstrates the focus on cash control and is reﬂected
in the £202 million improvement in operating free cash
outﬂow (EBITDA less capital expenditure) before
exceptional items to £261 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year. This represents a turnaround of £624 million
since the 2001 ﬁnancial year.
Other operating income
As part of the arrangements for the establishment of
Concert, BT had been seconding staff and providing
administrative and other services from its launch in
early January 2000. The income from these services
totalled £nil in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, £135 million
in the 2002 ﬁnancial year and £168 million in the 2001
ﬁnancial year.
Operating costs
Total operating costs from continuing activities were
reduced by 13% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year to £16,370
million after increasing by 30% in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year. As a percentage of group turnover from
continuing activities, operating costs from continuing
activities, excluding goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items, increased from 84% in the 2001
ﬁnancial year, to 87% in the 2002 ﬁnancial year and
reduced to 86% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. Operating
costs in the 2003 ﬁnancial year include the costs
associated with the re-integrated activities of the
former Concert global venture. Because these activities
have been fully integrated into the lines of business it is
not possible to separately identify those speciﬁc costs
associated with the activities of the former Concert
global venture. In all three ﬁnancial years, net
exceptional costs from continuing activities were
incurred. These amounted to £198 million,
£2,696 million and £7 million in the 2003, 2002
and 2001 ﬁnancial years, respectively. These
exceptional costs are considered separately in the
discussion which follows.

Staff costs from continuing activities were broadly ﬂat
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year at £4,254 million after
increasing by 5% in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. In the
2003 ﬁnancial year, the numbers employed in the
Financial review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 35 continuing activities decreased by 3,900 to 104,700
at 31 March 2003 after decreasing by 8,200 in the
2002 ﬁnancial year. The increased leaver costs and
salary increases offset the impact of the lower head
count in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. Higher pension
costs for enhanced beneﬁts provided to leavers and
the annual pay awards were the main reasons
for the increase in staff costs in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
The allocation for the employee share ownership
scheme, included within staff costs, was £36 million
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The allocation for the
2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years was £25 million and
£32 million, respectively.
Early leaver costs from continuing activities, before
exceptional items, of £276 million were incurred in the
2003 ﬁnancial year, compared with £186 million in the
2002 ﬁnancial year and £111 million in the 2001
ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects BT’s continued focus on
reducing headcount and improving operational
efﬁciencies. This includes the cost of enhanced pension
beneﬁts provided to leavers which amounted to
£60 million, £46 million and £nil in the 2003, 2002
and 2001 ﬁnancial years. In the 2002 and 2001
ﬁnancial years this did not reﬂect the full cash cost
because there was a pension fund accounting surplus,
which for accounting purposes includes any provision
for pensions on the group’s balance sheet, and in
accordance with BT’s accounting policies, the
accounting surplus was utilised before making a charge
to the proﬁt and loss account. The cost of enhanced
pension beneﬁts charged against the accounting
surplus in the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years amounted
to £140 million and £429 million, respectively. In the
2002 ﬁnancial year the excess over the available
accounting surplus, amounting to £46 million, was
charged to the proﬁt and loss account. Under the
NewStart programme launched in the fourth quarter
of 2001, BT employees who leave in advance of normal
retirement age receive a leaving payment rather than
a redundancy payment and the incremental pension
beneﬁts have been scaled down which has reduced the
level of the cash cost associated with early leavers.
The depreciation charge from continuing activities
increased by 1% in the 2003 ﬁnancial year to
£3,011 million after increasing by 11% in the 2002
ﬁnancial year. The increase in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
is despite the reduction in property depreciation as a
result of the property sale and leaseback in December
2001. The increase in the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial
years reﬂects a reduction in the estimated asset lives,
reﬂecting BT’s continuing investment in its networks
and broadband investment.
Goodwill amortisation in respect of subsidiaries and
businesses acquired since 1 April 1998, when BT
adopted Financial Reporting Standard No. 10, and
amortisation of other intangibles totalled £24 million
in the 2003 ﬁnancial year compared with £124 million
in the 2002 ﬁnancial year and £91 million in the 2001
ﬁnancial year. The low charge in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year reﬂects the impact of the demerger of mmO
2
and the impairment of goodwill in the 2002 and 2001
ﬁnancial years which signiﬁcantly reduced the carrying
value of goodwill. Goodwill on acquisitions before
1 April 1998 was written off directly to reserves.
Payments to other telecommunication operators from
continuing activities reduced by 10% in the 2003
ﬁnancial year to £3,846 million after increasing by 15%
in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. The payments in the 2002
and 2001 ﬁnancial years include those made to the
Concert global venture for the delivery of BT’s outgoing
international calls, which accounts for most of the
reduction in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Other operating costs, which rose by 9% in the
2003 ﬁnancial year to £5,620 million after increasing
by 13% in the 2002 ﬁnancial year, include the
maintenance and support of the networks,
accommodation and marketing costs, the cost of sales
of customer premises equipment and non pay related
leaver costs. The increase in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
includes the property rental costs of around
£190 million following the sale and leaseback
transaction in December 2001.

In the 2003 ﬁnancial year a property rationalisation
charge of £198 million was recognised in relation
to the rationalisation of the group’s London ofﬁce
portfolio. The rationalisation involves the exit from
a number of ofﬁce properties.
The most signiﬁcant item in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year was the impairment of goodwill and tangible ﬁxed
assets in the European activities of BT Global Services.
In the light of our announcement that BT Global
Services was streamlining its activities to focus on
multi-site corporate customers with European activities
and the assimilation of BT’s share of Concert’s
activities, an impairment review of the investment in
its European activities was performed. As a result, a
goodwill impairment charge of £1,939 million and a
tangible ﬁxed asset impairment charge of £263 million
was recognised. The goodwill in the European activities
was fully written down as a result of the charge.
Financial review
36 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Other exceptional items in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year included:
& costs of £172 million associated with the unwind
of the Concert global venture, discussed further on
page 38
& charges of £68 million in relation to the BT Retail
call centre rationalisation programme, reducing the
number of call centres from 104 to 30 over two years
& bad debt charges of £79 million, in BT Wholesale,
as a result of severe liquidity problems in the TMT
sector during the latter part of the year
& costs of £98 million associated with the demerger
of mmO
2
& other charges of £77 million including impairment
of payphone assets
The most signiﬁcant item in the 2001 ﬁnancial
year was the impairment of goodwill in Viag Interkom.
The acquisition of the 55% interest in the company
was completed for £8,770 million in February 2001
and goodwill of £4,992 million arose on this
transaction. The impairment review resulted in an
impairment in goodwill of £3,000 million, of which
£200 million related to BT’s continuing activities.
Other exceptional items within operating costs
in the 2001 ﬁnancial year included a credit of
£193 million for the refund of rates on BT’s
infrastructure following a successful legal action taken
by BT in 2000 to challenge the rateable valuations
on which it was charged for its network assets.
Group operating proﬁt (loss)
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, group operating proﬁt
from continuing activities before goodwill amortisation
and the exceptional items, described above,
of £2,790 million was 1% higher than in the 2002
ﬁnancial year, which in turn was 10% lower than in
the 2001 ﬁnancial year.
Total group operating proﬁt for the 2003 ﬁnancial
year was £2,572 million compared to a loss of
£479 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year and a proﬁt
of £27 million in the 2001 ﬁnancial year, reﬂecting
the losses generated by the discontinued activities
and the exceptional costs of £2,707 million in the 2002
ﬁnancial year.

During the period under review there has been a
signiﬁcant rationalisation of the group’s investments
in associates and joint ventures. On 1 April 2002 the
unwind of the Concert global venture was completed
and on 22 January 2003 the sale of the group’s stake
in Cegetel was completed. As a result BT’s share of its
ventures’ turnover fell to £1,455 million in the 2003
ﬁnancial year from £4,764 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year. The disposals made in the 2002 and 2001
ﬁnancial years resulted in BT’s share of its ventures’
turnover falling to £4,764 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year from £9,937 million in the 2001 ﬁnancial year.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, £1,447 million of the total
arose from ventures located outside the UK, compared
with £4,618 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year and
£9,677 million in the 2001 ﬁnancial year.
The principal contributors to turnover in the 2003
ﬁnancial year were Cegetel in France (£956 million)
up to the date of disposal and LG Telecom in Korea
(£198 million). The principal contributors to turnover
from continuing activities in the 2002 ﬁnancial year
were Concert (£2,158 million), Cegetel (£1,068 million)
and LG Telecom (£240 million) and in the 2001
ﬁnancial year were Concert (£2,576 million), Cegetel
(£860 million) and LG Telecom (£281 million).
The principal contributors to turnover from
discontinued activities in the 2002 ﬁnancial year were
Japan Telecom and J-Phone (£559 million to June
2001) and Airtel (£76 million to June 2001). The
principal contributors to turnover from discontinued
activities in the 2001 ﬁnancial year were Japan
Telecom and J-Phone (£4,542 million), and Airtel
(£286 million).
The group’s share of its ventures’ operating proﬁts
from continuing activities totalled £181 million in the
2003 ﬁnancial year, before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional proﬁts. The comparable losses amounted
to £108 million and £157 million in the 2002 and 2001
ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The principal contributor to the group’s share of
operating proﬁts from continuing activities before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items in the
2003 ﬁnancial year was Cegetel (£198 million). In the
2002 ﬁnancial year the principal contributor to the loss
was Concert (£225 million) offset by proﬁts from
Cegetel (£168 million). In the 2001 ﬁnancial
year Concert reported proﬁts of £19 million and
Cegetel proﬁts of £90 million, offset by losses in
other ventures.

In the 2003 ﬁnancial year BT completed the exit from
its investment in Blu on more favourable terms than
anticipated and accordingly exit cost provisions of
£150 million were released.
Concert’s performance was a cause of concern in
2001 and in October 2001 BT and AT&T announced
the unwind of Concert which was subsequently
completed on 1 April 2002. On completion, the
businesses, customer accounts and networks returned
to the two parent companies with BT and AT&T each
taking ownership of substantially those parts of Concert
originally contributed by them. As part of the
settlement with AT&T for the unwind of the Concert
global venture, BT received net cash of $72 million
(£56 million). This net settlement includes the receipt
of $350 million reﬂecting the allocation of the
businesses and the payment of $278 million to achieve
the equal division of speciﬁed working capital and other
liability balances.
BT and AT&T also terminated their Canadian joint
venture agreement under which BT was committed to
participate in AT&T’s future obligation to acquire all of
the publicly traded shares of AT&T Canada. AT&T has
taken full ownership of BT’s interest in the Canadian
joint venture and in AT&T Canada, and has now
assumed full responsibility for all future obligations of the
joint venture. BT has now ceased to have any interest in
AT&T Canada, and has been released from its future
expenditure commitment associated with AT&T Canada.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year BT wrote down the
carrying value of its investments in both Concert and
AT&T Canada. The exceptional impairment charge of
£1,153 million against these investments comprises
Concert goodwill impairment of £260 million, Concert
tangible ﬁxed asset write-downs of £546 million and the
write off of BT’s £347 million interest in AT&T Canada
(included within amounts written off investments).
BT also recognised exceptional restructuring
charges of £81 million for its share of redundancy and
other unwind costs in Concert and BT’s own unwind
costs of £172 million have been charged against group
operating costs in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year exceptional impairment
charges and related exit costs totalling £407 million,
principally relating to goodwill and asset impairments
in Blu and SmarTone, were recognised in the light of
the rapidly changing global telecoms market conditions.
In the 2001 ﬁnancial year there was an exceptional
write off of previously capitalised costs in certain
non-UK operations related to deferred subscriber
acquisition costs in the ventures. In addition goodwill
in Asian ventures became impaired and an exceptional
impairment charge of £200 million was recognised.
Goodwill amortisation in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
amounted to £2 million, compared to £53 million in
the 2002 ﬁnancial year and £185 million in the 2001
ﬁnancial year. This reduction reﬂects the disposals and
the goodwill impairment charges referred to above.
Total operating proﬁt (loss)
Total operating proﬁt from continuing activities before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items for the
2003 ﬁnancial year of £2,971 million was 12% higher
than in the 2002 ﬁnancial year which in turn was 9%
lower than the previous ﬁnancial year. The increase in
the underlying total operating proﬁt was due to the
factors explained above.
Total operating proﬁt for the 2003 ﬁnancial year
was £2,901 million, including BT’s share of the
operating results of its ventures. This compared to a
loss for the 2002 ﬁnancial year of £1,860 million and
the 2001 ﬁnancial year of £370 million. This improved
performance reﬂects the group’s exit from certain loss
making activities and the lower level of goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items.
Proﬁt on sale of group undertakings and ﬁxed asset
investments
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year a number of remaining non-
core investments were sold. The consideration for the
disposals totalled £3,028 million and the proﬁt before
taxation from disposals totalled £1,691 million. This
was principally in relation to the disposal of our 26%
interest in Cegetel, a French telecommunications
operator, on 22 January 2003. The total proceeds were
£2,603 million, received in cash, and the proﬁt was
£1,509 million before the recognition of an exceptional
interest charge of £293 million on closing out ﬁxed
interest rate swaps following receipt of the sale
proceeds.
Financial review
38 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 A major feature of the 2002 ﬁnancial year was the

BT completed the sale to Vodafone of its 20%
economic interest in Japan Telecom and its 20%
interest in J-Phone Communications on 1 June 2001
and subsequently its interest in J-Phone group
companies. The total proceeds of sale were
£3,709 million received in cash, and the proﬁt was
£2,358 million.
The sale of Yell, BT’s classiﬁed advertising
directory businesses in the UK and the USA, was
completed on 22 June 2001 for a consideration of
£1,960 million, giving a proﬁt of £1,128 million. In
May 2001, the UK Ofﬁce of Fair Trading announced
that the price controls over the UK Yellow Pages
advertising rates were to be tightened signiﬁcantly.
The price we achieved for the sale of Yell, which was
announced on 26 May 2001, reﬂected the impact of
these controls on Yell’s prospects.
BT completed the sale of its 18% interest in Airtel,
a major Spanish wireless operator, to Vodafone for
£1,084 million on 29 June 2001. The proﬁt of
£844 million on the sale compares with BT’s
investment in the company of £223 million, built up
during the 1990s.
In November 2001, BT completed the sale of its
33% interest in Maxis Communications of Malaysia for
£350 million, which broadly equated with its carrying
value. We completed the sale of our interest in Rogers
Wireless to AT&T for £267 million on 29 June 2001
and recognised a loss of £23 million.
BT’s interest in BiB was diluted in July 2000 when
BSkyB gained control and in May 2001 we agreed to
exchange our residual interest in BiB for tranches of
shares in BSkyB. We received the ﬁrst tranche of
19 million BSkyB shares with an initial value of
£128 million on 28 June 2001. We were required
to hold 50% of this tranche until May 2002 and
recognised a proﬁt on these shares when they were
sold in May 2002. We also received the second tranche
of BSkyB shares with a similar value in November
2002, and they were sold at that time. The proﬁt of
£120 million recognised in the 2002 ﬁnancial year
relates to the BSkyB shares which we were permitted
to sell on receipt. In the 2003 ﬁnancial year a proﬁt
on disposal of BSkyB shares of £131 million
was recognised.
In December 2001, BT completed the sale
of its wholly owned subsidiary company, Clear
Communications Limited, which operates a
communications network in New Zealand, for
consideration of £119 million. A loss of £126 million
has been recognised on this sale of which £45 million
relates to goodwill taken directly to reserves before
April 1998.
In February 2002, we completed the sale of our
50% interest in e-peopleserve, a major human resource
outsourcing activity, to our joint-venture partner,
Accenture, for initial consideration of £50 million. BT is
entitled to receive additional payments from an earn-
out arrangement based on e-peopleserve’s revenues
from customers other than BT and Accenture over the
ﬁve years to 2007. These additional earn-out payments
will total between £27 million and approximately
£167 million. A proﬁt of £61 million on this transaction
has been recognised in the 2002 ﬁnancial year based
on the initial consideration and the discounted value
of the additional minimum payments of £20 million.
In addition, in the 2002 ﬁnancial year we
recognised an impairment charge of £347 million in
relation to the ﬁxed asset investment in AT&T Canada,
as noted above, and £157 million in relation to Impsat.
In the 2001 ﬁnancial year, we sold our 34%
interest in sunrise communications of Switzerland to
another joint venture partner in November 2000 for
£464 million, realising a proﬁt of £454 million. This
was the main element in the total proﬁt from disposals
of group undertakings and ﬁxed asset investments of
£619 million in that year. Other proﬁts during the year
were principally derived from the disposal of certain of
our aeronautical and maritime interests, the sale of an
interest in I.Net by way of a public offering, the
reduction of our equity interest in BiB to below 20%
and the sale of minor equity investments.
Proﬁt on sale of property ﬁxed assets
In December 2001, as part of a wider property
outsourcing arrangement, BT completed the sale and
leaseback of the majority of its UK properties to
Telereal, a joint venture partnership formed by Land
Securities Trillium and The William Pears Group.
Around 6,700 properties were transferred totalling
some 5.5 million square metres. The consideration
received amounted to £2,380 million. BT has leased
the properties back at a total annual rental
commencing at £190 million and subject to a 3%
annual increase. In addition, BT has transferred the
economic risk on a large portion of its leased properties
to Telereal in return for an annual rental commencing
at approximately £90 million per annum. This is
broadly equivalent to the current level of rentals.
In February 2002, BT outsourced its property
management unit to Telereal.
BT has the option to purchase the reversionary
interest from Telereal (i) when BT vacates a property
at open market value (ii) at the end of 30 years for the
specialised estate (buildings of an operational nature
such as telephone exchanges) at open market value
Financial review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 39 or (iii) if BT wishes to terminate all arrangements with
Telereal at any time, in which circumstances BT would
pay open market values for the property and
compensation to Telereal covering funding costs and
equity return. BT can also re-acquire the reversion of
the general estate (non-operational buildings such as
ofﬁces and warehousing) at the end of the headlease
term of 999 years. BT has the right to renew the lease
of the specialised estate for successive periods which,
in total, amount to 130 years. After 130 years, the
freehold specialised properties revert to BT. The leases
include normal commercial restrictions and covenants.
BT’s divestment of its property estate provides a
ﬂexible approach to BT’s ofﬁce arrangements and
building requirements. BT expects to reduce its
property needs over time and the transaction allows BT
to vacate properties covering approximately 35% by
rental value of the estate, including existing lease ends,
over the contract term without penalty.
The proﬁt on the sale of the properties amounted
to £1,019 million and was determined after allowing
£129 million for BT’s actual and future obligations
under the terms of the legal agreement with Telereal
and for the cost of advisors’ fees. The obligations
include expenditure of £34 million to be incurred on
completing nearly ﬁnished new properties and remedial
work to be undertaken on several properties.
Part of the proceeds of sale were used in novating
ﬁxed interest rate obligations to support Telereal’s
ﬁnancing. An exceptional cost of £162 million was
incurred in unwinding this position and was included
in the interest charge for the year.
In summary, the property transaction beneﬁted the
results for the 2002 ﬁnancial year by £857 million as
shown below:
Proﬁt on sale and leaseback of properties £m
Sales proceeds 2,380
Net book value of assets disposed (1,232)
Estimated cost of BT’s future obligations (129)
Proﬁt on properties sold 1,019
Interest rate swap novation costs (162)
Net proﬁt on sale and leaseback of properties 857
The rentals payable under the lease have an adverse
impact on other operating costs in future years, which
is initially around £190 million for the 2003 ﬁnancial
year which is wholly offset by reduced depreciation
and interest charges.
In advance of the property transaction being
completed with Telereal, BT also completed the sale
of one of its major properties in London at a proﬁt
of £43 million.
Interest charge
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, the total net interest
charge, including BT’s share of its ventures’ charges,
at £1,439 million was £183 million lower than in the
preceding year, which in turn was £308 million higher
than in the 2001 ﬁnancial year. Of the total net
charge, £1,420 million arises in the BT group for
the 2003 ﬁnancial year, compared with £1,540 million
and £1,044 million in the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial
years, respectively.
The reduction in the net interest charge in the
2003 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the reduction in the level
of net debt and is partly offset by the £293 million
exceptional cost of terminating ﬁxed interest rate
swaps as a consequence of the receipt of the Cegetel
sale proceeds.
The substantially higher charge in the 2002 and
2001 ﬁnancial years is mainly due to the cost of
funding the acquisition of mmO
2
’s third-generation
mobile licences, principally in the UK and Germany,
and the cost of acquisitions in the 2001 and 2000
ﬁnancial years. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year, the group’s
net interest charge was further increased by the
£162 million exceptional cost of novating interest
swaps as a consequence of the property sale and
leaseback transaction. In the 2001 ﬁnancial year, there
was also a one-off £194 million increase in BT’s share
of its ventures’ interest charges principally through the
Japanese investments and Viag Interkom which was
partly offset by an exceptional interest receipt of
£25 million relating to the rates refund from the
UK Government, noted above.
Interest cover for continuing activities in the 2003
ﬁnancial year represented 2.6 times total operating
proﬁt before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, and compares with interest cover of 1.9 in the
2002 ﬁnancial year and 2.4 in the 2001 ﬁnancial year.
The improvement in cover in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
is due to the reduction in the interest charge and
improvement in the operating proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items. We expect the net
interest charge to decrease and interest cover to
continue to improve in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
following the continued reduction in net debt during
the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Proﬁt (loss) before taxation
The group’s proﬁt before taxation for the 2003
ﬁnancial year was £3,157 million, compared with a
proﬁt of £1,461 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year
and a loss of £1,031 million in the 2001 ﬁnancial year.
The proﬁt in the 2003 ﬁnancial year included the
exceptional proﬁts from the sale of investments and
businesses totalling £1,691 million. The proﬁt in the
2002 ﬁnancial year included net exceptional gains of
£753 million. The loss in the 2001 ﬁnancial year was
principally due to the £3,200 million exceptional
goodwill impairment charges.
The group’s proﬁt before taxation from continuing
activities before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items for the 2003 ﬁnancial year was £1,829 million,
compared with £1,273 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year and £1,763 million in the 2001 ﬁnancial year.
The signiﬁcantly higher underlying proﬁt in the 2003
ﬁnancial year was principally due to the exit from loss
making businesses, improved operating proﬁts and
lower interest charges explained above.
The proﬁt before taxation from discontinued
activities in the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years
amounted to £3,954 million and a loss of £2,968
million, respectively. The 2002 ﬁnancial year included
Financial review
40 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 gains on disposals from discontinued activities of
£4,368 million.
Taxation
The tax charge for the 2003 ﬁnancial year was
£459 million and comprises £598 million on the proﬁt
before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, offset by tax relief of £139 million on certain
exceptional charges. The tax charge on the proﬁt
before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items is at an effective rate of 32.7%.
The tax charge for the 2002 ﬁnancial year was
£443 million. The effective rate was 41.5% of the
proﬁt from continuing activities before taxation,
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. This was
in excess of the standard UK tax rate of 30% due to the
impact of loss making subsidiaries outside the UK for
which tax relief is not immediately available and
associate company taxation.
The tax charge for the 2001 ﬁnancial year was
£712 million. The effective rate was 21.8% of proﬁt
from continuing activities before taxation, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items. This was lower
than the standard UK corporation tax rate of 30%
due to tax relief on losses surrendered by
discontinued activities.
Earnings (loss) per share
The basic earnings per share of 31.2 pence per share
for the 2003 ﬁnancial year compares with 12.0 pence
for the 2002 ﬁnancial year and loss of 25.7 pence for
the 2001 ﬁnancial year. These results include those of
the group’s discontinued activities up to the date of
demerger or sale, as well as signiﬁcant exceptional
items and goodwill amortisation. The following table
illustrates the impact of these factors on the basic
earnings per share for the past three ﬁnancial years:

Basic earnings per share before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items, from BT’s continuing activities
of 14.2 pence for the 2003 ﬁnancial year compares
with an equivalent of 8.8 pence and 19.3 pence for
the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share are not materially
different in all three years.
Dividends
The board recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 4.25 pence
per share to shareholders, amounting to £366 million.
This will be paid, subject to shareholder approval, on
8 September 2003 to shareholders on the register on
8 August 2003. This takes the dividend for the full year
to 6.5 pence per share, compared to 2.0 pence in the
2002 ﬁnancial year. This year’s dividend is covered
2.2 times by the proﬁt before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items. BT remains committed to a
progressive dividend policy, reﬂecting growth in
earnings per share and an improving balance sheet.
In view of our strong cash generation and success in
reducing net debt, in the 2004 ﬁnancial year we expect
dividend cover to reduce further towards the 2 times
target that we set out last year.
The ﬁnal and full dividend for the 2002 ﬁnancial
year was 2.0 pence per share, which absorbed
£173 million. As part of BT’s debt reduction and
restructuring plans, the Board decided in May 2001
that there was to be no interim dividend for the 2002
ﬁnancial year, nor any ﬁnal dividend in respect of the
2001 ﬁnancial year. The dividend for the 2001
ﬁnancial year of 7.8 pence per share therefore solely
comprised the interim dividend paid in February 2001
which absorbed £571 million.
Financing
Net cash inﬂow from operating activities of
£6,023 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year compares
with £5,257 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year and
£5,887 million in the 2001 ﬁnancial year. Net cash
inﬂow from continuing operating activities amounted
to £6,023 million, £5,023 million and £5,410 million in
the 2003, 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
Special and deﬁciency contributions to the main
pension fund, described below, of £329 million in the
2003 ﬁnancial year, £600 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial
year and £300 million in the 2001 ﬁnancial year were
paid, consequently reducing the net cash inﬂow by
these amounts. The strong cash generation in the
2003 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the improved operating
performance of the group.
Tax paid in the 2003 ﬁnancial year totalled
£434 million compared with £562 million in the 2002
ﬁnancial year and £669 million paid in the 2001
ﬁnancial year. The lower tax paid in the 2003 and 2002
ﬁnancial years reﬂects the lower current tax charge.
The net cash outﬂow of £2,381 million for capital
expenditure and ﬁnancial investment in the 2003
ﬁnancial year included £2,580 million of capital
expenditure on plant and equipment, offset by £200
million received on the sale of ﬁxed assets. In the 2002
ﬁnancial year the net cash outﬂow of £1,354 million for
capital expenditure and ﬁnancial investment included
£4,069 million of capital expenditure on plant
and equipment, offset by £2,752 million received
on the sale of ﬁxed assets. These proceeds included
£2,380 million from the property sale and
leaseback transaction completed in December 2001,
described above. Net cash outﬂow of £8,442 million
for capital expenditure and ﬁnancial investment in
the 2001 ﬁnancial year was principally for capital
expenditure on plant and equipment of £4,756 million
and £4,208 million invested in mmO
2
’s
third-generation mobile licences.
Financial review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 41 The net cash inﬂow from disposals less acquisitions in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year totalled £2,842 million. Cash
proceeds from disposals amounted to £2,919 million
and principally comprised £2,603 million from the sale
of the investment in Cegetel. In the 2002 ﬁnancial year
the net cash inﬂow from disposals less acquisitions
totalled £5,785 million. Cash proceeds from disposals
amounted to £6,916 million and principally comprised
£3,075 million from the sale of the investment in Japan
Telecom and J-Phone, £1,838 million from the sale of
the Yell directories business and £1,084 million from
the sale of our investment in Airtel. The principal cash
outﬂow for acquisitions was the completion of the
purchase of a minority interest in Esat Digifone in April
2001 for £869 million.
In the 2001 ﬁnancial year, the group made
signiﬁcant acquisitions and the net cash outﬂow
on these totalled £13,754 million in that year. This
included £11,438 million invested in Viag Interkom,
including acquisition of its licences, £1,233 million in
Telfort, £1,176 million in completing the Esat Telecom
Group acquisitions, offset by £464 million received
principally on the disposal of sunrise communications.

totalled £367 million whilst there were no equity
dividends paid in the 2002 ﬁnancial year, as explained
above. Equity dividends paid in the 2001 ﬁnancial year
totalled £1,432 million.
The resulting cash inﬂow for the 2003 ﬁnancial
year, before management of liquid resources and
ﬁnancing, of £4,183 million was mainly applied in
repaying short-term borrowings and investing in
short-term investments, with total borrowings of
£2,535 million being repaid. The cash inﬂow for the
2002 ﬁnancial year of £7,433 million was also applied
in repaying short-term borrowings and investing in
short-term investments. In the 2001 ﬁnancial year, the
signiﬁcant cash outﬂow of £19,127 million was funded
by issuing substantial amounts of long-term debt
instruments and drawing on medium-term notes
programmes. In December 2000, £6,909 million was
raised through the issue of four series of US dollar
notes totalling $10 billion, with maturities between
three and thirty years. In February 2001, £6,038 million
was received through the issue of six series of euro and
sterling notes totalling e9.7 billion, with maturities
between two and sixteen years. In April 2000, a
twenty-ﬁve year £250 million index-linked Eurobond
was issued.
The cash inﬂow for the 2003 ﬁnancial year resulted
in net debt reducing by a further £4,128 million to
£9,573 million having reduced by £14,241 million to
£13,701 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. In the 2001
ﬁnancial year the cash outﬂow resulted in net debt
increasing to £27,942 million at 31 March 2001.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, the group repaid
borrowings totalling £2,535 million and no new long-
term debt was raised having repaid borrowings totalling
£12,006 million in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. This was in
part due to the success of the company’s rights issue
which closed in June 2001. 1,976 million new shares
were issued for a total consideration of £5,876 million,
net of expenses. As part of the demerger
arrangements, £440 million was received from mmO
2
;
additionally mmO
2
assumed £60 million of the group’s
external net debt.
In the 2001 ﬁnancial year, the group borrowed
£14,552 million in long-term loans and repaid
£225 million in long-term debt. This was in accordance
with our intention, expressed at the end of the 2000
ﬁnancial year, to reﬁnance a signiﬁcant part of our
commercial paper borrowings with medium or longer-
term debt when market conditions allowed and also
to raise further signiﬁcant ﬁnance in the 2001 ﬁnancial
year to meet the ﬁnancing needs of the UK third-
generation mobile licence, won in April 2000, increased
capital expenditure and acquisitions of interests in
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and their
additional funding requirements.
We expect to see a continued improvement in the
ﬁnancial position of BT and are seeking to obtain a
single A rating from all the major rating agencies.

The group has a centralised treasury operation whose
primary role is to manage liquidity, funding,
investment and the group’s ﬁnancial risk, including
risk from volatility in currency and interest rates and
counterparty credit risk. The treasury operation is
not a proﬁt centre and the objective is to manage
risk at optimum cost.
The Board sets the treasury department’s policy
and its activities are subject to a set of controls
commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowings
and investments under its management. Counterparty
credit risk is closely monitored and managed within
controls set by the Board. Derivative instruments,
including forward foreign exchange contracts, are
entered into for hedging purposes only.
We have set out further details on this topic and
on our capital resources and foreign currency exposure
in note 36 to the ﬁnancial statements in compliance
with FRS 13.
Capital resources
During the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years the group
has reduced its level of borrowings so that its net debt
was £9.6 billion at 31 March 2003 compared with
£13.7 billion at 31 March 2002 and £27.9 billion at
31 March 2001. The debt reduction in the 2003 and
2002 ﬁnancial years was achieved by the disposal
of our stake in Cegetel, a successful rights issue in
June 2001, the mmO
2
demerger, sales of investments
and the Yell business and the property sale and
leaseback transaction.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that
the group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future and
therefore they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
There has been no signiﬁcant change in the
ﬁnancial or trading position of the group since
31 March 2003.
At 31 March 2003, the group had cash and short-
term investments of £6,431 million. At that date,
£2,548 million of debt falls due for repayment in the
2004 ﬁnancial year. The group had unused short-term
bank facilities, amounting to approximately
£575 million at 31 March 2003.
At 31 March 2002, the group had cash and short-
term investments of £4,739 million. In addition, the
group had unused committed short-term bank
facilities, amounting to approximately £2,100 million
at 31 March 2002, in support of a commercial paper
programme or other borrowings. The group also had
£461 million of uncommitted short-term bank facilities.
Foreign currency and interest rate exposure
Most of the group’s current turnover is invoiced in
pounds sterling, and most of its operations and costs
arise within the UK. The group’s foreign currency
borrowings, which totalled £12.3 billion at 31 March
2003, are used to ﬁnance its operations. These
borrowings have been predominantly swapped into
sterling. Cross currency swaps and forward foreign
exchange contracts have been entered into to reduce
the foreign currency exposure on the group’s
operations and the group’s net assets. The group also
enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to
hedge investment, interest expense and purchase and
sale commitments. The commitments hedged are
principally US dollar and euro denominated. As a result
of these policies, the group’s exposure to foreign
currency arises mainly on the residual currency
exposure on its non-UK investments in its subsidiaries
and ventures and on any imbalances between the value
of outgoing and incoming international calls. To date,
these imbalances have not been material. As a result,
the group’s proﬁt has not been materially affected
by movements in exchange rates in the three years
under review.
The group’s exposure to changes in currency
movements decreased signiﬁcantly following the
demerger of the mmO
2
business and its European
operations in November 2001. A 10% strengthening
in sterling against major currencies would cause the
group’s net assets at 31 March 2003 to fall by less
than £100 million, with insigniﬁcant effect on the
group’s proﬁt. This compares with a fall of less than
£150 million and £1,200 million in the years ended
31 March 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Foreign exchange contracts are entered into as a
hedge of sales and purchases, accordingly a change in
the fair value of the hedge is offset by a corresponding
change in the value of the underlying sale or purchase.
The majority of the group’s long-term borrowings
have been, and are, subject to ﬁxed interest rates. The
group has entered into interest rate swap agreements
with commercial banks and other institutions to vary
the amounts and period for which interest rates are
ﬁxed. At 31 March 2003, the group had outstanding
interest rate swap agreements with notional principal
amounts totalling £5,170 million compared to
£7,870 million at 31 March 2002.
The long-term debt instruments which BT issued
in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained
covenants that if the BT group credit rating were
downgraded below A3 in the case of Moody’s or below
A minus in the case of Standard & Poor’s (S&P),
additional interest would accrue from the next interest
coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points for
each ratings category adjustment by each ratings
agency. In May 2001, Moody’s downgraded BT’s credit
rating to Baa1, which increased BT’s annual interest
charge by approximately £32 million. BT’s credit rating
from S&P is A minus. Based upon the total amount of
debt of £12 billion outstanding on these instruments at
31 March 2003, BT’s annual interest charge would
increase by approximately £60 million if BT’s credit
rating were to be downgraded by one credit rating
category by both agencies below a long-term debt
rating of Baa1/A minus. If BT’s credit rating with
Moody’s was to be upgraded by one credit rating
category the annual interest charge would be reduced
by approximately £30 million.
Based upon the composition of net debt at
31 March 2003, a one percentage point increase
in interest rates would increase the group’s annual
net interest expense by less than £10 million. This
Financial review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 43 compares with an increase of less than £20 million and
less than £90 million in the years ended 31 March
2002 and 2001 respectively. The group’s exposure to
interest rate ﬂuctuations has reduced in line with the
decrease in net debt and the increased percentage of
the group’s net debt being at ﬁxed rates.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure on plant, equipment and property
(excluding the movement on capital accruals) totalled
£2,445 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, compared
with £3,908 million and £4,986 million in the 2002
and 2001 ﬁnancial years, respectively. Of the total
capital expenditure, £3,100 million and £3,857 million
were in relation to the group’s continuing activities
in the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The reduction in the level of capital expenditure
reﬂects continued management focus and tight
control. Work continues on enhancing the intelligence
of the network to enable customers to beneﬁt from
advanced services and improving the network’s
capacity to carry high-speed data. Capital expenditure
is expected to rise in the 2004 ﬁnancial year as the
group invests in its 21st century network programme.
Capital expenditure in relation to the group’s
discontinued activities amounted to £808 million and
£1,129 million in the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years,
respectively. Prior to the demerger, mmO
2
continued
improving the quality and capacity of its digital GSM
network. In April 2000, we purchased one of the ﬁve
3G licences in the UK Government’s auction for
£4.03 billion, which we paid in May 2000. A third
generation mobile licence in the Netherlands was
awarded to Telfort in July 2000 for £267 million.
Of the capital expenditure, £138 million was
in Europe, outside the UK, in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
and £634 million was spent there in the 2002
ﬁnancial year.
Contracts placed for ongoing capital expenditure
totalled £616 million at 31 March 2003. We plan to
develop the 21st century network using stringent
capital return criteria and a rigorous approach to any
investment in the narrowband network. The 21st
century network aims to deliver long term, structural
cost reduction, as we progressively migrate onto a
simpler, lower cost network architecture. BT expects
that future capital expenditure will be funded from net
cash inﬂows from operating activities, and, if required,
by external ﬁnancing.
Acquisitions
The total amount invested in the 2003 ﬁnancial year,
including further funding of existing ventures, was
£77 million, signiﬁcantly lower than the £1,131 million
invested in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. In the 2002
ﬁnancial year only one signiﬁcant acquisition was
made, being the purchase in April 2001 of the 49.5%
interest in Esat Digifone that we did not already own,
from Telenor, for £869 million under an agreement
made in early 2000.
During the 2001 ﬁnancial year, BT completed
a number of acquisitions of businesses, mainly
located outside the UK. The total amount invested,
including further funding of existing ventures, was
£14,501 million.
In April 2000, we took an equity interest, jointly
with Japan Telecom, in a number of regional Japanese
mobile phone companies (J-Phone Communications).
Instead of investing directly in J-Phone
Communications, we guaranteed bank loans to that
group totalling £782 million at 31 March 2001 that no
longer apply following the disposal. As noted above, we
have now sold our interests to Vodafone for £3.7 billion.
In June 2000, we acquired for £1,207 million our
partner’s 50% interest in Telfort, the communications
joint venture which we established in the Netherlands
in 1997. The wireless business of Telfort was demerged
with mmO
2
in November 2001. In the 2002 ﬁnancial
year the remaining goodwill was written off.
In the ﬁnal quarter of the 2001 ﬁnancial year, we
acquired the 55% interest in Viag Interkom that we did
not already own. In January 2001, we acquired a 10%
interest in Viag Interkom including its share of the
German third generation licence from Telenor for
£1,611 million, and in February 2001, we acquired the
remaining 45% interest from E.ON for £7,148 million,
including its share of the cost of the licence. Goodwill
of £4,992 million arose on these transactions. In the
light of falling equity valuations for wireless companies
in the 2001 ﬁnancial year, we carried out impairment
reviews of the carrying values of Viag Interkom and
other major wireless interests at that time. As
discussed above, we recognised a £3,000 million
goodwill impairment in Viag Interkom of which
£200 million related to the ﬁxed network business
remaining in the BT Group after the mmO
2
demerger.
In the 2002 ﬁnancial year the remaining goodwill was
written off.
Demerger and capital reduction
The demerger of mmO
2
, the group’s former mobile
phone business, was completed in November 2001.
The demerger, scheme of arrangement and associated
reduction in capital were approved by shareholders in
October 2001 and the High Court in November 2001.
The demerger of mmO
2
created two new listed
companies and dealings in BT Group and mmO
2
shares
commenced on 19 November 2001. BT shareholders
on record on 16 November 2001, received one
BT Group plc share and one mmO
2
plc share for each
existing British Telecommunications plc share held.
Based on the ﬁrst day’s dealings on the London Stock
Exchange, BT Group represented approximately 78%
of the equity value of the former BT group and mmO
2
represented approximately 22%.
On the demerger, net assets of £19,490 million
attributable to mmO
2
were distributed to shareholders
in the form of a demerger distribution. mmO
2
assumed
approximately £500 million of debt, with the bulk of
the outstanding debt remaining with the continuing BT
Group. The reduction of capital had the effect of
increasing distributable reserves in BT Group plc by
£9,537 million.
Financial review
44 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Balance sheet
Net assets at 31 March 2003 amounted to
£2,642 million compared to a deﬁcit of £358 million at
31 March 2002, with the increase principally due to the
retained proﬁts of £2,126 million.
BT Group plc, the parent company, has maintained
reserves at £9,537 million at both 31 March 2003 and
31 March 2002.
BT’s ﬁxed assets totalled £16,661 million at
31 March 2003 of which £15,888 million were tangible
assets, principally forming the UK ﬁxed network. At
31 March 2002 ﬁxed assets were £17,551 million and
tangible assets were £16,078 million. The reduction in
ﬁxed assets is principally due to the group’s exit from
non core investments as a result of which investments
have reduced by £666 million to £555 million at
31 March 2003.
Return on capital employed
The return before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items on the average capital employed
(total assets, excluding goodwill, less current liabilities,
excluding corporate taxes and dividends payable, and
provisions other than those for deferred taxation) was
15.7% for the 2003 ﬁnancial year. In the 2002
ﬁnancial year the group made a return from continuing
activities before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items of 15.7% on the average capital employed in its
business excluding mmO
2
and goodwill. In the 2001
ﬁnancial year, the group made a return on all activities
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
of 14.9%.
Pensions
The most recently completed triennial actuarial
valuation of the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS), BT’s main
pension fund, performed by the scheme’s independent
actuary for the trustees of the scheme, was carried out
as at 31 December 2002. This valuation showed the
fund to be in deﬁcit to an amount of £2.1 billion.
Assets of the fund of £22.8 billion at that date covered
92% of the fund’s liabilities. The previous valuation
was carried out as at 31 December 1999. The result
of this valuation was that the fund was in deﬁcit by
£1.0 billion. Assets of the fund of £29.7 billion at
that date covered 97% of the fund’s liabilities.
The deterioration in the funding position was
principally the result of lower equity returns over
the last three years and improved life expectancy
of scheme members and is in spite of the additional
deﬁciency funding payments totalling £600 million that
have been paid over the last three years. The valuation
under the prescribed Minimum Funding Requirement
approach showed the assets to cover 101% of the
liabilities at 31 December 2002.
The group’s ordinary contribution rate will increase
to 12.2% of employees’ pensionable pay with effect
from April 2003. The contribution rate was 11.6% for
the 2003, 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years. In addition,
the company will make annual deﬁciency contributions
to the scheme of £232 million with effect for the 2004
ﬁnancial year. This compares to the £200 million
annual deﬁciency payments made in the 2003, 2002
and 2001 ﬁnancial years. The group is also required to
pay special contributions to cover costs arising from
enhanced pension beneﬁts provided to leavers. The
special contributions paid in the 2003, 2002 and 2001
ﬁnancial years amounted to £129 million, £400 million
and £100 million, respectively, in respect of early
leavers. The payment expected to be made in
December 2003 is £100 million in relation to leavers
in the calendar year ended 31 December 2002.
The group continues to account for pension costs
in accordance with UK Statement of Standard
Accounting Practice No. 24 (SSAP 24). The group’s
total annual pension charges, including discontinued
activities, for the 2003, 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years
were £322 million, £382 million and £326 million,
respectively. This includes £314 million, £373 million
and £315 million, respectively, in relation to the BTPS.
The reduction in the pension charge in the 2003
ﬁnancial year reﬂects the lower membership of the
BTPS and the interest credit on the balance sheet
prepayment. The increase in the pension charge in
the 2002 ﬁnancial year was due principally to the
£46 million charge for enhanced pension beneﬁts
provided to leavers.
Under the UK accounting standard SSAP 24,
and BT’s accounting policy, if the costs of providing
incremental pension beneﬁts for leavers are less than
the total accounting surplus based on the latest
actuarial valuation of the scheme and the amount of the
provision for pension liabilities on the balance sheet,
the costs are not charged to the proﬁt and loss
account. In the 2001 ﬁnancial year the cost of the
incremental beneﬁts was charged against the
accounting surplus and was not charged against the
proﬁt in the period in which people agreed to leave. In
the 2003 and 2002 ﬁnancial years the total cost of the
incremental pension beneﬁts exceeded the total
accounting surplus and accordingly the excess was
charged to the proﬁt and loss account. This amounted
to £60 million and £46 million in the 2003 and 2002
ﬁnancial years, respectively.
The pension charge for the 2004 ﬁnancial year will
be based upon the SSAP 24 valuation as at 31 March
2003. This valuation is based on the December 2002
funding valuation, rolled forward to 31 March 2003,
and uses a slightly higher investment return
assumption than was used for the trustees’ funding
valuation, a lower inﬂation rate and lower salary
increase assumptions. The resulting SSAP 24 deﬁcit
amounts to £1.4 billion. The regular pension cost will
be charged at 11.3% of pensionable salaries compared
to the 11.6% rate applied in the 2003, 2002 and 2001
ﬁnancial years. In addition, the pension charge will
include the amortisation of the combined pension fund
position of £1.4 billion and pension prepayment of
£630 million held on the BT group balance sheet, over
the average remaining service lives of members which
amounts to 13 years, and enhanced pension beneﬁts
provided to leavers.
The number of retired members and other current
beneﬁciaries in the pension fund has been increasing
in recent years and, at 31 December 2002, was
approximately 94% higher than the number of active
Financial review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 45 members. Consequently, BT’s future pension costs
and contributions will depend on the investment
returns of the pension fund and could ﬂuctuate in the
medium term.
We changed the arrangements for people leaving
BT in advance of the normal retirement age. Under
our NewStart programme launched during the fourth
quarter of the 2001 ﬁnancial year, BT employees will
be expected to leave with a leaving payment in place
of a redundancy payment, and incremental pension
beneﬁts have been scaled down. This should reduce
the level of early leaver costs, which have been
signiﬁcant in recent years.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March
2001 and we launched a new deﬁned contribution
pension scheme for people joining BT after that date
which is to provide beneﬁts based on the employees’
and the employing company’s contributions. This
change is in line with the practice increasingly adopted
by major UK groups and is designed to be more ﬂexible
for employees and enable the group to determine its
pension costs more precisely than is the case for
deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. The ﬁnancial impact of this
change was not signiﬁcant in the 2003 and 2002
ﬁnancial years and is not expected to be signiﬁcant
in the next few years but it should reduce pension costs
in the longer term.
Regulation and prices
BT has been operating under a revised retail price
control from 1 August 2002, under which a cap of RPI
minus RPI (therefore price cannot increase) applies to
the services used by the lowest 80% of BT’s residential
customers by bill size. This retail price control is
estimated to have covered services representing about
13% of the group’s turnover from continuing activities
for the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The requirement is to keep
prices unchanged for the price control year to 31 July
2003. Regulation allows any unused allowance or
excess deduction remaining at the end of the price
control year (31 July) to be carried forward. The
equivalent reduction in the previous control year was
2.50% against the required reduction of 2.45%.
Most of BT’s interconnect (network) charges to
other UK operators are based on long-run incremental
costs. Until 30 September 2001, there were annual
reductions in these charges based on a RPI minus 8
price cap. Since that date, the broad structure of the
interconnect (network) services has been retained but
the ‘‘X’’ within the RPI minus X price-cap formula now
varies between 7.5 and 13, this new price control runs
until 2005.
The regulatory environment in the UK has had, and
is expected to continue to have, a signiﬁcant adverse
impact on the group’s turnover and operating proﬁt.
As the group has extended its activities to other
countries, BT is required to comply with the regulatory
regimes in those countries.
Competition and the UK economy
BT has a signiﬁcant market share in its main UK
markets for ﬁxed network calls and provision of
exchange lines, although competition has eroded BT’s
market share signiﬁcantly in key market sectors, in
particular areas of the UK and for certain products and
services. This trend shows signs of slowing in the
residential market and we estimate that BT had 73% of
the market for residential ﬁxed voice calls in the 2003,
2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years. Additionally, we
estimate that BT had 45% of the market for business
ﬁxed voice calls in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, compared
with 49% and 53% in the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial
years, respectively. We also estimate that BT supplied
81% of the exchange lines in the UK at 31 March
2003, compared with 83% and 84% at 31 March 2002
and 2001, respectively.
The growth in cable operators’ networks in the
UK has historically had an adverse effect on BT’s share
of the residential market as a result of increasing
competition from these cable operators. However, in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year, BT has grown its residential
customer base by 100,000. The cable operators have
been concentrating on ﬁnancial restructuring and
increasing penetration in current markets. Current and
future wholesale line rental arrangements will allow
BT’s ﬁxed line customers to move PSTN lines to other
operators which are expected to be the source of more
competition in future.
The group has seen some diversion of demand
from its ﬁxed network as a result of the growth in
mobile voice calls and other licensed operators’
activities. This diversion may intensify now that BT’s
ﬁxed line customers are able to pre-select their carrier.
Additionally, BT’s Licence was amended in April
2000 to require BT to provide other operators with use
of the lines connecting BT’s local exchanges to its
customers and allow operators to install equipment in
BT’s exchanges (local loop unbundling). This
amendment took effect as a result of an EU Regulation
which came into force on 1 January 2001.
For its operations as a whole, BT expects the
competitive pressure to persist and it will continue
to defend its market share vigorously and fairly.
The strength of the UK economy is an important
determinant of BT’s business volumes and the gross
domestic product grew by 2.3% in the 2003 ﬁnancial
year, compared with 1.2% and 2.6% in the 2002 and
2001 ﬁnancial years, respectively.
Environment
When removing old analogue exchange equipment
from buildings, BT recycles the metal content and
takes special care to properly dispose of any hazardous
materials. Although BT receives proceeds from the sale
of recovered materials, this is more than offset by the
cost of dealing with hazardous materials, contracting
and planning their removal and preparing the released
site for further development. BT believes that the total
cost of dealing with these hazardous materials will not
be signiﬁcant.
Geographical information
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, approximately 94% of the
group’s turnover was generated by operations in the
UK, compared with 89% in the 2002 and 91% in the
Financial review
46 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 2001 ﬁnancial years. Of its continuing activities,
approximately 92% of the group’s turnover was
generated by operations in the UK in the 2002
ﬁnancial year, compared with 95% in the 2001
ﬁnancial year. BT’s operating proﬁts have been derived
from its UK operations with losses being incurred
outside the UK in each of the last three ﬁnancial years.
Regulatory ﬁnancial information
BT is required under its main licence to publish
disaggregated ﬁnancial information for various
activities of the group, which have been used as the
basis of charges paid by other telecommunication
operators in the UK for the use of BT’s network.
The activities presented separately in the regulatory
ﬁnancial statements do not necessarily correspond with
any businesses separately managed, funded or
operated within the group. The results set out in
regulatory ﬁnancial statements for the 2002 and 2001
ﬁnancial years showed that the group’s operating proﬁt
is derived predominantly from ﬁxed-network calls.
Critical accounting policies
The group’s principal accounting policies are set out
on pages 76 to 78 of the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements and conform with UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). In accordance with
the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard No.
18, these policies and applicable estimation techniques
have been reviewed by the directors who have
conﬁrmed them to be the most appropriate for the
preparation of the 2003 ﬁnancial statements.
We, in common with virtually all other companies,
need to use estimates in the preparation of our
ﬁnancial statements. The most sensitive estimates
affecting our ﬁnancial statements are in the areas of
assessing the level of interconnect income with and
payments to other telecommunications operators,
providing for doubtful debts, establishing ﬁxed asset
lives for depreciation purposes, making appropriate
long-term assumptions in calculating pension liabilities
and costs, making appropriate medium-term
assumptions on asset impairment reviews and
calculating current tax liabilities on our proﬁts.
We are required to interconnect our networks with
other telecommunications operators. In certain
instances we rely on other operators to measure the
trafﬁc ﬂows interconnecting with our networks. We use
estimates in these cases to determine the amount of
income receivable from or payments we need to make
to these other operators. The prices at which these
services are charged are often regulated and are
subject to retrospective adjustment. We use estimates
in assessing the likely effect of these adjustments.
We provide services to over 20 million individuals
and businesses, mainly on credit terms. We know that
certain debts due to us will not be paid through the
default of a small number of our customers. We use
estimates, based on our historical experience, in
determining the level of debts that we believe will not
be collected. These estimates include such factors as
the current state of the UK economy and particular
industry issues.
The plant and equipment used in our networks is
long-lived with cables and switching equipment
operating for over ten years and underground ducts
being used for decades. The annual depreciation
charge is sensitive to the estimated service lives we
allocate to each type of asset. We regularly review
these asset lives and change them when necessary
to reﬂect current thinking on their remaining lives
in light of technological change, prospective
economic utilisation and physical condition of the
assets concerned.
As part of the property rationalisation programme
we have identiﬁed a number of properties that are
surplus to requirements. Although efforts are being
made to sub-let this space it is recognised by
management that this may not be possible
immediately in the current economic environment.
Estimates have been made of the cost of vacant
possession and any shortfall arising from the sub
lease rental income being lower than the lease costs
being borne by BT.
We have a commitment, mainly through the
BT Pension Scheme, to pay pension beneﬁts to
approximately 366,000 people over more than
60 years. The cost of these beneﬁts and the present
value of our pension liabilities depend on such factors
as the life expectancy of the members, the salary
progression of our current employees, the return that
the pension fund assets will generate in the time before
they are used to fund the pension payments and the
discount rate at which the future pension payments
are discounted. We use estimates for all these
factors in determining the pension costs and liabilities
incorporated in our ﬁnancial statements.
In the 2002 and 2001 ﬁnancial years, we made
charges for the impairment of the carrying value of
goodwill, investments and tangible ﬁxed assets in our
balance sheet. The amount of the charges are in most
cases based on the discounted present value of the
future cash ﬂows that we expected to be derived from
these assets. We use estimates in determining these
future cash ﬂows and the discount rate.
The actual tax we pay on our proﬁts is determined
according to complex tax laws and regulations. Where
the effect of these laws and regulations is unclear, we
use estimates in determining the liability for the tax to
be paid on our past proﬁts which we recognise in our
ﬁnancial statements.
New UK accounting standards
Under a new UK accounting standard, FRS 17
‘‘Retirement beneﬁts’’, the method of accounting for
deﬁned beneﬁt pensions will be substantially changed.
The Accounting Standards Board has delayed the full
adoption of this new standard until our 2006 ﬁnancial
year. The pension cost charged to the proﬁt and loss
account would have been lower under FRS 17 than
SSAP 24 in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. Net ﬁnancing costs
will be volatile reﬂecting movements in the value of the
scheme assets and interest rates. Pension fund
actuarial gains and losses, including investment returns
varying from the assumed returns, will be recorded in
full in the statement of total recognised gains and
Financial review
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 47 losses annually. Pension fund deﬁcits, calculated in
accordance with prescribed rules in the standard, will
be shown on the balance sheet as will any surpluses to
the extent we expect to obtain value from them in the
foreseeable future. In accordance with the transitional
rules of the standard the pension fund deﬁcit and proﬁt
and loss charge calculated under FRS 17 is disclosed in
note 31. It should be noted that the deﬁcit is largely
dependent on the strength of equity markets at the
balance sheet date and is expected to be volatile.
Economic and Monetary Union
The euro is now established as a single currency
spanning the 12 EU member countries participating
in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
Most of the group’s business in Europe is
conducted in the UK, which is not one of the 12
participants. Government policy on UK membership
was set out by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his
statement to the House of Commons in October 1997
and restated by the Prime Minister in February 1999.
The Chancellor has set ﬁve economic tests to deﬁne
whether or not a clear and unambiguous case can be
made in support of the UK joining the EMU.
Based on the outcome of the economic
assessment, the Government will take a decision
on whether the ﬁve tests have been met and an
announcement on whether the UK should join will
be made in the House of Commons on 9 June 2003.
If the Government decides to recommend UK
entry, it will be put to a vote in Parliament and then
to a referendum. In the interim, BT has maintained
a steering group, with representatives from across each
of the lines of business and supporting group functions,
to review the impact of the euro. A project team acts
as co-ordination point to ensure consistency of
approach across the group and that plans are in place
to meet agreed business strategy for the possibility of
euro changeover in the UK.
US GAAP
The group’s net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per
share for the three ﬁnancial years ended 31 March
2003 and shareholders’ equity at 31 March 2003 and
2002 under US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (US GAAP) are shown further in the United
States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
Section (see Consolidated ﬁnancial statements).
Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP include
results of the differing accounting treatment of leasing
transactions, pension costs, redundancy costs,
intangible assets, goodwill, deferred taxation,
capitalisation of interest, ﬁnancial instruments,
contributing assets to joint ventures, stock
compensation, and dividends. Cash ﬂow information
under the US GAAP presentation is also shown further
in this document.
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143 ‘‘Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations’’ which is applicable to
ﬁnancial years commencing after 15 June 2002. SFAS
No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation be recognised in the period
in which it is incurred if it is possible to make a
reasonable estimate of the fair value. The associated
asset retirement costs are required to be capitalised
as part of the carrying value of the long lived asset.
The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not expected to
have a material impact on the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,
‘‘Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities’’ which is applicable to disposals initialised
after 31 December 2002. The Statement requires costs
associated with exit or disposal activities to be
recognised when the costs are incurred rather than
at the date of the commitment to an exit or disposal
plan. Accordingly, we have reﬂected the impact of
SFAS No. 146 in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. SFAS No. 146
may apply to future activities which are not currently
envisaged and accordingly it is not possible to assess
the future impact of SFAS No. 146 on any such
activities at this time.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.
148, ‘‘Accounting for Stock Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure – an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123’’ which is applicable to ﬁnancial
years beginning after 15 December 2002. The
Statement permits two additional transition methods
for an entity voluntarily adopting fair value based
accounting for stock based compensation. It also
amends the disclosure requirements to require
prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net
income of an entity’s accounting policy decisions with
respect to stock based employee compensation. This
Statement does not have a signiﬁcant impact on the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements as SFAS No. 123
continues to be satisﬁed for disclosure purposes only.
In April 2003 the FASB issued SFAS No. 149
‘‘Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities’’. This Statement
amends and clariﬁes ﬁnancial accounting and reporting
for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively
referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities
under SFAS No. 133, ‘‘Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities’’. BT is currently
evaluating the impact of this change.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, ‘‘Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others’’. FIN 45
requires that certain guarantees must be recognised
at fair value. FIN 45 also requires disclosure of detailed
information about each guarantee or group of
guarantees. The disclosure requirements are effective
for ﬁnancial statements ending after 15 December
2002. The recognition and measurement provisions of
FIN 45 are applicable to guarantees issued or modiﬁed
after 31 December 2002. FIN 45 could have an impact
on the future results of BT depending on guarantees
issued; however, at this time the adoption of this
statement did not have a material impact on BT’s
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46,
‘‘Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities – an
Financial review
48 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB)
No. 51’’. FIN 46 requires the primary beneﬁciary to
consolidate a variable interest entity (VIE) if it has a
variable interest that will absorb a majority of the
entity’s expected losses if they occur, receive a
majority of the entity’s expected residual returns if they
occur, or both. FIN 46 applies immediately to VIEs
created after 31 January 2003, and to VIEs in which
the entity obtains an interest after that date. This
statement is not expected to have a material impact
on BT’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF 00-21,
‘‘Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables’’.
The consensus addresses how to account for
arrangements that may involve multiple revenue
generating activities, for example, the delivery or
performance of multiple products, services, and/or
rights to use assets. In applying this guidance, separate
contracts with the same party, entered into at or near
the same time, will be presumed to be a package, and
the consideration will be measured and allocated to the
separate units based on their relative fair values. This
consensus guidance will be applicable to agreements
entered into after 15 June 2003. BT is currently
evaluating the impact of this new pronouncement.
In January 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on
EITF 02-18, ‘‘Accounting for Subsequent Investments
in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Method Loss
Recognition’’. This consensus states that if the
additional investment, in whole or in part, represents
the funding of prior losses, the investor should
recognise previously suspended losses. When
appropriate to recognise prior losses, the amount
recognised would be limited to the amount of the
additional investment determined to represent the
funding of prior losses. The consensus is effective for
additional investments made after 5 February 2003.
This consensus is not expected to have a material
impact on BT’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 51 Report of the directors
The directors submit their report and the audited
ﬁnancial statements of the company, BT Group plc,
and the group, which includes its subsidiary
undertakings, for the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Introduction
BT Group plc is the listed holding company for
the BT group of companies and was formed when
the mmO
2
business (comprising what had been British
Telecommunications plc’s mobile activities in the UK,
the Netherlands, Germany and the Republic of Ireland)
was demerged on 19 November 2001.
The Business review on pages 8 to 23, Our
commitment to society on pages 24 and 25,
the Financial review on pages 28 to 49, the discussion
on Corporate governance on pages 53 to 57, the
Report on directors’ remuneration on pages 58 to 72
and Risk Factors on page 140 form part of this report.
The audited ﬁnancial statements are presented on
pages 75 to 135.
Principal activity
The group’s principal activity is the supply
of communications services and equipment. In the 2003
ﬁnancial year, approximately 94% of group turnover
arose from operations in the UK.
Directors
The names and biographical details of the directors
of the company are given on pages 50 and 51. All
served throughout the ﬁnancial year, with the exception
of Ian Livingston and Clayton Brendish who joined
the Board on 8 April and 1 September 2002,
respectively. In addition, Philip Hampton served as
a director until his retirement on 30 April 2002.
Following his retirement from the Board on 1 May
2001, the former Chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, remained
with BT as President Emeritus until 31 July 2002.
In accordance with the articles of association,
Clayton Brendish, having been appointed as a director
by the Board, retires at the forthcoming annual general
meeting (AGM) and will be proposed for election.
Sir Anthony Greener, Louis Hughes and Maarten van
den Bergh retire by rotation and will be proposed
for re-election. Details of these directors’ contracts
of appointment are included in the Report on
directors’ remuneration on pages 62 and 63 and
the discussion on Corporate governance on page 53.
Substantial shareholdings
At 21 May 2003, the company had received
notiﬁcations from Legal & General Investment
Management Limited and Barclays PLC under Part VI
of the Companies Act 1985 in respect of holdings
of 261,519,674 shares and 261,518,424 shares
respectively each representing holdings of 3.02%
of the company’s issued ordinary share capital.
Interest of management in certain transactions
During and at the end of the 2003 ﬁnancial year, none
of the company’s directors was materially interested in
any material transaction in relation to the group’s
business and none is materially interested in any
presently proposed material transactions.
Policy on the payment of suppliers
BT’s policy is to use its purchasing power fairly and
to pay promptly and as agreed.
BT has a variety of payment terms with its
suppliers. The terms for payments for purchases under
major contracts are settled when agreeing the other
terms negotiated with the individual suppliers. It is
BT’s policy to make payments for other purchases
within 30 working days of the invoice date, provided
that the relevant invoice is presented to the company
in a timely fashion and is complete. BT’s payment
terms are printed on the company’s standard purchase
order forms or, where appropriate, speciﬁed in
individual contracts agreed with the supplier. The ratio,
expressed in days, between the amounts invoiced to
the company by its suppliers in the 2003 ﬁnancial year
and the amounts owed to its trade creditors at the end
of the year was 23 days.
Auditors
Following the conversion of PricewaterhouseCoopers,
the company’s auditors, to a limited liability
partnership from 1 January 2003,
PricewaterhouseCoopers resigned and the directors
appointed the new ﬁrm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
as auditors.
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP as auditors of the company and authorise
the directors to settle their remuneration will be
proposed at the AGM.
Authority to purchase shares
The authority given at last year’s AGM of the company
held on 17 July 2002 for the company to purchase in
the market 867 million of its shares, representing 10%
of the issued share capital, expires on 16 October
2003. This authority was not used during the year and
shareholders will be asked to give a similar authority
at the AGM.
AGM resolutions
The resolutions to be proposed at the AGM to be held
on 16 July 2003, together with explanatory notes,
appear in the separate Notice of Annual General Meeting
sent to all shareholders.

52 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Corporate governance
BT’s policy is to achieve best practice in our standards
of business integrity for all our operations. This
includes a commitment to maintaining the highest
standards of corporate governance throughout
the group.
During the year there have been recommendations
on UK corporate governance by Derek Higgs and
Sir Robert Smith, and hence proposed changes to
the UK’s Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
This section of the annual report describes how BT
has applied the Code and where it stands on some
of the key proposed changes resulting from the above
recommendations. The directors consider that BT has,
throughout the year, complied with the provisions
of the current Code.
The Board
The Board meets every month, except in August.
Additionally, it meets on an ad hoc basis to consider
matters which are time critical. The Board met 14
times during the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
The Board’s principal focus is the overall strategic
direction, development and control of the group. In
support of this focus the Board approves the group’s
strategic plans, annual budget, capital expenditure
and investments budgets, larger capital expenditure
proposals and the group’s overall system of internal
controls, governance and compliance authorities and it
has oversight and control of the group’s operating and
ﬁnancial performance. These responsibilities are set
out in a formal statement of the Board’s role which,
together with the powers of the Operating Committee
and Management Council and the authorities delegated
to individual members of the Operating Committee, are
made available to everyone in the group on the group’s
intranet site.
The Board, which operates as a single team, is
currently made up of the part-time Chairman, ﬁve
executive directors and seven independent non-
executive directors. It is BT’s policy that the board will
comprise a majority of independent non-executive
directors. The desired combination of experience, skills
and other attributes that the non-executive directors as
a whole are to bring to the Board is agreed and
regularly reviewed by the Nominating Committee. This
proﬁle is used by the Committee to assess
the suitability as non-executive directors of candidates
put forward by the directors and outside consultants
before the Committee meets short-listed candidates.
Between them, the current non-executive directors
bring experience and independent judgement, gained
at the most senior levels, of international business
operations and strategy, marketing, technology,
communications and political and international affairs.
The non-executive directors provide a strong
independent element on the Board. Sir Anthony
Greener, the Deputy Chairman, is the senior
independent director. In his capacity as the chairman
of the Remuneration Committee,he meets with BT’s
major institutional shareholders. The Deputy Chairman
will also continue to be available to discuss matters
with institutional shareholders where it would be
inappropriate for those discussions to take place with
either the Chairman or the Chief Executive. He will also
attend, at his discretion and in consultation with
the Chairman and the Chief Executive, other meetings
with shareholders during the year. The Chairman and
the non-executive directors hold regular dinners
at which they discuss matters without the presence
of the executive directors.
Sir Anthony Greener chairs the Audit and
Remuneration Committees.Heis also a member
of the Nominating Committee. Maarten van den Bergh
sits on all three committees. Both directors bring great
breadth of relevant experience to these committees,
whose total memberships are six, ﬁve and four
directors, respectively.
Non-executive directors are appointed initially for
three years. At the end of that period the appointment
may be continued by mutual agreement, subject
normally to three months’ termination notice from
either BT or the director. The longest serving non-
executive director has been in ofﬁce for nearly three
and a half years.
All directors are required by the company’s articles
of association to be elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst
AGM after their appointment, if appointed by
the Board. A director must subsequently retire by
rotation at an AGM if he or she was elected or last
re-elected at or before the AGM in the third year before
the year in question. The director may seek re-election.
The Chairman and executive directors have service
agreements, which are approved by the Remuneration
Committee. Information about the periods of these
contracts is in the Report on directors’ remuneration
on page 63.
The Board has a procedure for directors, in
furtherance of their duties, to take independent
professional advice if necessary, at the company’s
expense. In addition, all directors have access to
the advice and services of the Secretary,
the appointment and removal of whom is a matter for
the whole Board. He advises the Board on appropriate
procedures for the management of its meetings and
duties (and the meetings of the company’s principal
committees), as well as the implementation
of corporate governance and compliance within
the group.
On appointment, the directors take part in an
induction programme when they receive information
about BT, the role of the Board and the matters
reserved for its decision, the terms of reference and
membership of the principal Board and management
committees, and the powers delegated to those
committees, the company’s corporate governance
practices and procedures, including the powers
reserved to the group’s most senior executives, and
the latest ﬁnancial information about the group.
This is supplemented by visits to key BT locations and
meetings with members of the Operating Committee
and other key senior executives. Throughout their
period in ofﬁce the directors are continually updated
on BT’s business, the competitive and regulatory
environments in which it operates, corporate social
responsibility matters and other changes affecting BT
and the communications industry as a whole, by
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 53 Corporate governance
written brieﬁngs and meetings with senior BT
executives. Directors are also advised on appointment
of their legal and other duties and obligations as
a director of a listed company, both in writing and in
face-to-face meetings with the Secretary. They are
reminded of these duties each year and they are also
updated on changes to the legal and governance
requirements of the company and upon themselves as
directors. During the 2003 ﬁnancial year, for example,
they have received brieﬁngs on the recommended
changes to UK corporate governance put forward by
Derek Higgs and Sir Robert Smith, the Enterprise Act
and the provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 that affect BT because its shares are registered
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Guidelines are in place concerning the content,
presentation and delivery of papers for each Board
meeting, so that the directors have enough information
to be properly briefed.
The Board has agreed that it will carry out an
evaluation of its performance. This will be carried out
by questionnaire and, where appropriate, individual
interviews during summer 2003, with a subsequent
review at a board meeting.
Principal Board committees
The Chief Executive, Ben Verwaayen, chairs
the Operating Committee, which meets weekly. The
other members are the Group Finance Director,
the Chief Executives of BT Retail, BT Wholesale and
BT Global Services and the Chief Broadband Ofﬁcer.
The Secretary attends all meetings. The Committee
has collective responsibility for running the group’s
business end-to-end. To do that, it develops the group’s
strategy and budget for Board approval, recommends
to the Board the group’s capital expenditure and
investments budgets, monitors the ﬁnancial,
operational and customer quality of service
performance of the whole group, allocates resources
across the group within plans agreed by the Board,
plans and delivers major cross-business programmes
and reviews the senior talent base and succession plans
of the group.
A sub-committee of the Operating Committee,
the Management Council, meets monthly. It consists
of the Operating Committee members plus a number
of other senior executives. It is an advisory forum
supporting the Chief Executive and the Operating
Committee in policy formulation, in areas such as public
policy, reputation and business practices policies,
human resources and employment policies. Through a
speciﬁc sub-committee of its own the Management
Council monitors the performance of the BT Pension
Scheme, draws material matters on pensions policy to
the Board’s attention, reviews public policy, regulatory
and Government activities in the pensions area and
oversees internal and external communications on
pensions matters.
The Nominating Committee, consisting of
the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and two other
non-executive directors, ensures an appropriate
balance of experience and abilities on the Board, using
this evaluation to review annually the size and
composition of the Board and to recommend any
proposed changes to the Board. It keeps under review
the need for appointments to the Board, prepares
a description of the speciﬁc experience and skills
needed for an appointment, considers candidates who
are put forward by the directors and external
consultants, and recommends to the Board
the appointments of all directors after having met
short-listed candidates. It also reviews the time
required from the Deputy Chairman and other
non-executive directors to carry out their duties and
advises the Board on succession planning for
the positions of the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Chief
Executive and all other Board appointments. In
the Board’s opinion, it is appropriate for the Chairman
to chair the Nominating Committee in its task
of reviewing and agreeing the structure of the board
and considering candidates as directors, both executive
and non-executive. The Committee met once during
the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
The Audit Committee, comprising solely
independent non-executive directors, is chaired by
Sir Anthony Greener. The members of the Committee
all bring relevant experience from senior executive
levels. The Committee recommends the appointment
and reappointment of the company’s auditors,
ensuring that key partners are rotated at appropriate
intervals, and considers the resignation or dismissal
of the auditors, recommending to the Board
appropriate action to appoint new auditors. It reviews
the auditors’ performance, including the scope of
the audit, and recommends to the Board appropriate
remuneration. The Committee monitors the extent
of non-audit work to be performed by the company’s
auditors to ensure that the provision of non-audit
services does not impair their independence or
objectivity. It discusses with the auditors the scope
of their audits before they commence, reviews
the results and considers the auditors’ Management
Letter and reports the results of those reviews to the
Board. The Audit Committee reviews the company’s
published ﬁnancial results, the Annual Report and Form
20-F and other published information for statutory and
regulatory compliance. It also reviews the disclosure
made by the Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director during the certiﬁcation process for the annual
report about the design or operation of internal
controls or material weaknesses in the controls,
including any fraud involving management or other
employees who have a signiﬁcant role in the company’s
ﬁnancial controls. The Board, as required by UK law,
takes responsibility for all disclosures in the annual
report. The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the
standards of risk management and internal control, the
effectiveness of internal control, ﬁnancial reporting,
accounting policies and procedures, and the company’s
statements on internal controls before they are agreed
by the Board for each year’s annual report. It also
reviews the company’s internal audit function and its
relationship with the external auditors, including
internal audit’s plans and performance. The Group
Finance Director and the Secretary attend its meetings.
Each year, the Committee sets aside time to seek
54 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Corporate governance
the views of the company’s internal and external
auditors in the absence of executives. The Committee
met four times during the 2003 ﬁnancial year. At its
meetings the Committee has reviewed the company’s
full year and quarterly results and its Annual Report
and Form 20-F and considered the adequacy of
the ﬁnancial systems that have produced those results.
It has reported its views to the Board so it has been
able to approve the results announcements and the
annual report for publication. It has also during the
2003 ﬁnancial year considered the group’s risk register
as submitted to it by the Management Council and
reviewed the company’s internal control, accounting
systems and related matters.
The Committee has agreed, for the 2004 ﬁnancial
year, in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to:
& establish a process for dealing with complaints
received by the company regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and
the conﬁdential, anonymous submission by employees
of concerns regarding questionable accounting or
auditing matters.
& oversee the adoption of a speciﬁc code of ethics
for the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and
Director Group Financial Control, which is consistent
with BT’s overall statement of business ethics (see
‘‘Statement of business practice’’ on page 56).
The Remuneration Committee comprises solely
independent non-executive directors and is chaired
by Sir Anthony Greener. It met seven times during
the 2003 ﬁnancial year. Further details about
the Committee are included in the Report on
directors’ remuneration.
Committee memberships are shown in Board of
directors and Operating Committee on pages 50
to 51.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the group’s systems
of internal control and risk management and for
reviewing the effectiveness of those systems. Such
systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate,
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives; any
system can provide only reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board also takes account of signiﬁcant social,
environmental and ethical matters that relate to BT’s
businesses. The company’s workplace practices,
speciﬁc environmental, social and ethical risks and
opportunities and details of underlying governance
processes are dealt with in the Our people and
Our commitment to society sections of this report.
BT has processes for identifying, evaluating and
managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the group.
These processes have been in place for the whole
of the 2003 ﬁnancial year and have continued up to
the date on which this document was approved.
The processes are in accordance with the guidance
for directors published in the UK in September 1999.
Risk assessment and evaluation takes place as an
integral part of the group’s annual strategic planning
cycle. The group has a detailed risk management
process which identiﬁes the key risks facing the group
and each business unit. This information is reviewed by
senior management as part of the strategic review.
The group’s current key risks are summarised on
page 140 of this document.
The key features of the risk management process
comprise the following procedures:
& senior executives, led by the group’s Risk
Manager, review the group’s key risks and have created
a group risk register. This is reviewed by
the Management Council before being approved by
the Board.
& the lines of business carry out risk assessments
of their operations, have created registers relating
to those risks, and ensure that the key risks are
addressed. Line of business audit committees monitor
the standards of internal controls in the lines
of business.
& senior management report regularly to the Group
Finance Director on the operation of internal controls
in their area of responsibility.
& the Chief Executive receives annual reports from
senior executives with responsibilities for major group
operations with their opinion on the effectiveness of the
operation of internal controls during the ﬁnancial year.
& the group’s internal auditors carry out continuing
assessments of the quality of risk management and
control. They also promote effective risk management
in the lines of business operations.
& the Audit Committee,on behalf of the Board,
considers the effectiveness of the operation of internal
control procedures in the group during the ﬁnancial
year. This follows consideration of the matter by
the Management Council. The Audit Committee reviews
reports from the internal auditors and from the external
auditors and reports its conclusions to the Board.
The Audit Committee has carried out these actions
for the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Material joint ventures and associates, which BT
does not control, outside the UK have not been dealt
with as part of the group for the purposes of this
internal control assessment.
Relations with shareholders
Senior executives, led by the Chief Executive and
the Group Finance Director, hold meetings with
the company’s principal institutional shareholders to
discuss the company’s strategy, ﬁnancial performance
and speciﬁc major investment activities. As explained
in the Report on directors’ remuneration,we also
maintain contact, when appropriate, through
the chairman of the Remuneration Committee and other
senior executives to discuss overall remuneration
policies and plans. Contact with institutional
shareholders (and with ﬁnancial analysts, brokers and
the media) is controlled by written guidelines to ensure
the protection of share price sensitive information that
has not already been made generally available to
the company’s shareholders.
We are continuing our policy that shareholders
vote on the annual report at the AGM. Shareholders
will also be asked this year to vote on the Report on
directors’ remuneration as required by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, having been
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 55 Corporate governance
asked to vote on the company’s remuneration policy
at previous AGMs.
It is part of our policy to involve shareholders fully
in the affairs of the company and to give them
the opportunity at the AGM to ask questions about
the company’s activities and prospects. We also give
the shareholders the opportunity to vote on every
substantially different issue by proposing a separate
resolution for each issue. The Board’s opinion is that
the re-election and the fees of the auditors are
inter-related matters and should therefore be dealt with
in one resolution.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution,
as well as abstentions, will be counted before the AGM
and the results will be made available at the meeting
after the shareholders have voted on each resolution
on a show of hands.
It is our policy for all directors to attend the AGM
if at all possible. Whilst, because of ill health or other
pressing reasons, this may not always be possible, in
normal circumstances this means that the chairman of
the Audit and Remuneration Committees is at the AGM
and is available to answer relevant questions.
The Annual Review and, if requested, the Annual
Report and Form 20-F, together with the Notice of the
AGM, are sent to shareholders in the most
cost-effective fashion, given the large number of
shareholders. We aim to give as much notice as
possible and at least 21 clear days, as required by
the company’s articles of association. In practice, these
documents are being sent to shareholders more than
20 working days before the AGM.
Established procedures ensure the timely release
of share price sensitive information and the publication
of the company’s ﬁnancial results and regulatory
ﬁnancial statements.
Non audit services provided by the external
auditors
As a result of regulatory or similar requirements, it is
necessary to employ the company’s external auditors
for certain non-audit work. In order to maintain
the independence of the external auditors, the Board
has determined policies as to what non-audit services
can be provided by the company’s external auditors
and the approval processes related to them. Under
those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be
offered to the external auditors unless there are clear
efﬁciencies and value added beneﬁts to the company.
The Audit Committee monitors the level of non-audit
fees paid to the external auditors.
Statement of business practice
To reinforce our commitment to achieve best practice
in our standards of business integrity, BT has a written
statement of business practice (The Way We Work).
The statement covers all our operations and reﬂects
the expectations in the area of corporate governance
and business practice standards. A copy of the
statement has been sent to every employee and is
also available on the company’s intranet site.
These high-level principles are supported by
a comprehensive communications programme and
online training. A conﬁdential helpline and e-mail
facility are also available to employees who have
questions about the application of these principles.
We also continue to require our agents and contractors
to apply these principles when representing BT.
Political donations
It has always been BT’s policy that no company in
the group shall make cash contributions to any political
party. This policy continues. However, the Companies
Act 1985 requires companies to obtain shareholder
authority before they can make donations to EU
political organisations (which includes UK political
parties). The deﬁnition of political donations used in
the Act is very much broader than the ordinary sense
in which these words are used. As a result, it covers
activities which form part of normal relationships
between BT and the political machinery. These
activities are not designed to support any political party
or to inﬂuence public support for a particular party and
would not be thought of as political donations in
the everyday sense of these words. They are entirely
non-political in nature and are designed so that BT can
make MPs and others aware of key industry issues and
matters affecting the company.
The authority we are requesting from shareholders
at the AGM is not designed to change the company’s
stated policy of not making cash contributions. It will,
however, ensure that BT acts within the provisions
of the current UK law when carrying out the above
activities. They are carried out on an even-handed
basis related broadly to the major UK political parties’
electoral strength and the company believes that they
make an important contribution to the success of BT.
Pension funds
BT’s two main pension funds – the BT Pension Scheme
and the BT Retirement Plan – are not controlled by
the Board but by separate trustees who are company
and union nominees, under independent chairmen.
The trustees look after the assets of the funds, which
are held separately from those of the company.
The pension schemes’ funds can only be used in
accordance with their respective rules and for no
other purpose.
Reporting
A statement by the directors of their responsibilities
for preparing the ﬁnancial statements is included in
the Statement of directors’ responsibility on page 73.
US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
BT has securities registered with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, BT is obliged
to comply with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act (the ‘‘Act’’) applicable to foreign issuers. BT will
comply with the legal and regulatory requirements
introduced pursuant to this new legislation, in so far
as they are applicable to the group.
In accordance with the recommendations issued by
the SEC, BT has established a Disclosure Committee
comprising appropriate senior executives which reports
to the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
56 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Corporate governance
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director after
evaluating the effectiveness of BT’s disclosure controls
and procedures within 90 days of the date of the
group’s Annual Report and Form 20-F, have concluded
that, at that date, BT’s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to ensure that material
information relating to BT was made known to them
by others within the BT group particularly during
the period in which the Annual Report and Form 20-F
was being prepared. The Chief Executive and Group
Finance Director have also provided the certiﬁcations
required by the Act.
There were no signiﬁcant changes in BT’s internal
controls or in other factors that could signiﬁcantly
affect these controls subsequent to the date the Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director completed their
evaluation, nor were there any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies
or material weaknesses in BT’s internal controls
requiring corrective actions.

Operating Committee Report on directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee is made up wholly
of independent non-executive directors. Throughout
the year, the company has applied the principles in
Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the Code) and complied with the Code.
The Board is ultimately responsible for both
the structure and amount of executive remuneration,
but it has delegated prime responsibility for executive
remuneration to the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee’s role is to set the remuneration policy
and individual remuneration packages for the Chairman,
the executive directors, members of the Operating
Committee (OC) and other senior executives reporting
to the Chief Executive. It also approves changes in
the company’s long-term incentive plans, recommends
to the Board those plans which require shareholder
approval and oversees their operation.
The Committee met seven times during the 2003
ﬁnancial year. Sir Anthony Greener has chaired
the Committee since 18 July 2001. Other members
of the Remuneration Committee during the year were:
& Maarten van den Bergh
& Louis Hughes
& Margaret Jay (appointed 5 November 2002)
& Carl Symon.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are invited to
attend meetings. They are not present when matters
affecting their own remuneration arrangements
are considered.
Non-executive directors who are not members
of the Committee are entitled to receive papers and
minutes of the Committee.
The Committee has access to professional advisers,
both from within the company and externally. Towers
Perrin, (HR consultants); Ben Verwaayen, Chief
Executive; Ian Livingston, Group Finance Director;
Alex Wilson, Group HR Director (and his predecessor
John Steele) and Larry Stone, Company Secretary
(and his predecessor Colin Green), provided advice
that materially assisted the Committee in relation to
the 2003 ﬁnancial year. The Committee has agreed
that Towers Perrin may advise both the Committee and
BT, and should be invited to attend meetings when
major remuneration policy issues are being discussed.
Towers Perrin provides BT with a range of data and
advisory services covering all aspects of executive pay,
bonus arrangements, shares and beneﬁts.
Remuneration policy
This part of the report is not subject to audit.
BT’s executive remuneration policy is to reward
employees competitively, taking into account individual
performance, company performance, market
comparisons and the competitive pressures in
the information and communication technology
industry. Base salaries are positioned around
the mid-market, with total direct compensation (basic
salary, annual bonus and the value of any long-term
incentives) to be at the upper quartile only for
sustained and excellent performance. There are no
plans to change this policy.
A signiﬁcant proportion of the total executive
remuneration package is linked to line of business
and corporate performance. Remuneration
arrangements and performance targets are kept under
regular review to achieve this.
Where any signiﬁcant changes are proposed to
executive remuneration, these are discussed with BT’s
principal shareholders and the main representative
groups of the institutional shareholders.
Packages
The remuneration package for the executive directors,
members of the OC and certain other senior executives
reporting to the Chief Executive comprises:
Basic salary
Salaries are reviewed annually. Salary increases are
made where the Committee believes that adjustments
are appropriate to reﬂect contribution, increased
responsibilities and/or market pressures.
Performance-related remuneration
Annual bonus
The annual bonus plan is designed to reward
the achievement of results against set objectives.
Targets, set at the beginning of the 2003 ﬁnancial year
for each objective, were based on earnings per share,
cash ﬂow and customer satisfaction. Speciﬁc weights
were attached to each objective. On-target and
maximum bonus levels, as a percentage of salary, were
unchanged at 50% and 75% (Chief Executive 85% and
130% under his service agreement).
The Committee retains the ﬂexibility to enhance or
reduce bonus awards in exceptional circumstances.
Deferred bonus
Awards in the form of BT shares, granted under
the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP), are linked to the value
of annual bonuses. The shares are held in trust and
transferred to the executive if still employed by
the company in three years’ time. There are no
additional performance measures for the vesting
of DBP awards.
Awards are generally equivalent in value to 50%
of the executive’s gross annual bonus, except in
the case of the Chief Executive whose award in respect
of the 2003 ﬁnancial year is 100% of gross annual
bonus in accordance with his service agreement.
The awards under the DBP held by Ben Verwaayen,
Pierre Danon, Andy Green and Paul Reynolds at the end
of the 2003 ﬁnancial year are contained in the table
on page 71. The awards this year include an award for
Ian Livingston. The amounts are in note f on page 65.
Long-term incentives
The BT Equity Incentive Portfolio (the Portfolio) is
designed to ensure that equity participation is
a signiﬁcant part of overall remuneration. It comprises
three elements: share options, incentive shares and
retention shares. Share options are currently the main
element of equity participation, replacing incentive
shares in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. Retention shares
are used primarily as a recruitment tool.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 59 Report on directors’ remuneration
No individual receives awards under all elements
of the Portfolio in any one year.
Generally, awards vest and options become
exercisable only if a predetermined performance target
has been achieved. The performance measure is TSR
(total shareholder return) compared with the FTSE 100
companies. The Remuneration Committee chose TSR
as it links the reward given to directors with
the performance of BT against the shares of other
major UK companies in which investors have
the opportunity to invest.
For 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 awards, the base
price at the beginning of the performance period has
been calculated by averaging the BT share price over
the six months to 31 March in the year of award. For
the 2002 awards, the period was from 19 November
2001 (the date of the mmO
2
demerger) to 31 March
2002. The end price is the average of the share price
over the six months to the end of the performance
period. The end price is adjusted for all capital actions
and dividend payments that occur during
the performance periods.
Share options
The price at which shares may be acquired under
the Global Share Option Plan (GSOP) is the market
price at the date of grant. Other than for new recruits,
the size of option grant is based on corporate and
individual performance, and market relativity.
Options granted will be exercisable in three years
only if a performance target has been met.
The Committee would not normally expect the initial
value of annual grants of options, based on the market
price of a BT share, to exceed three times salary.
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, as BT embarked on
a radical business transformation and rejuvenation
programme, the initial value was four times salary in
the case of the senior executives most responsible for
delivering BT’s strategic plan. The grants comprised
options with an initial value of 2.5 times salary relative
to a TSR test and 1.5 times salary relative to
an earnings per share test.
For those options that were granted subject to
a TSR measure, BT’s TSR at the end of the three-year
period must be in the upper quartile for all of the options
to be exercisable. At median, 30% of the options will
be exercisable. Below that point, none of the options
may be exercised. If the performance measure is not
met at the ﬁrst measurement, it may be re-tested
against a ﬁxed base in years four and ﬁve. If TSR has
not reached the median at the end of the ﬁfth year,
previously unexercisable options will lapse.
To provide an additional incentive for exceptional
performance in exceeding business goals, further
options were granted to seven senior executives.
For these options to become exercisable, there must
be a 35% compound annual growth in BT’s earnings
per share over three years (equivalent to 22 pence
per share at the end of the 2005 ﬁnancial year). There
will be no opportunity to re-test.
An option was granted to Sir Christopher Bland
on 22 June 2001 as part of his recruitment package.
This was not subject to a performance measure as
it matched a personal investment in BT shares
of £1 million.
The details of the options held by Sir Christopher
Bland, Ben Verwaayen, Pierre Danon, Andy Green, Ian
Livingston and Paul Reynolds at the end of the 2003
ﬁnancial year are contained in the table on page 68.
Incentive shares
There were no awards under the Incentive Share Plan
(ISP) in the 2003 ﬁnancial year. A number of awards
made in previous years are, however, still outstanding.
Participants are entitled to shares at the end
of a three-year performance period if the company has
met the relevant predetermined performance target
and participants are still employed by the group.
At the end of the three-year period, BT’s TSR must
be in the upper quartile for all the shares to vest.
At median, 25% of the shares under award vest.
Below that point, none of the shares vest.
None of the awards of incentive shares granted
in 2000 will vest as BT’s TSR was at 85th position
on 31 March 2003, the closing date of the
performance period.
The awards under the ISP held by Sir Christopher
Bland, Pierre Danon, Andy Green and Paul Reynolds
at the end of the 2003 ﬁnancial year are contained
in the table on page 69.
Retention shares
Retention shares are granted under the Retention
Share Plan (RSP) to individuals with critical skills,
as a recruitment or retention tool. As a result, awards
of shares currently in place are not linked to
the satisfaction of a corporate performance target.
The length of the retention period before awards
vest is ﬂexible. The shares are transferred at the end
of the speciﬁed period if the individual is still employed
by BT.
Retention shares are used only in exceptional
circumstances and, in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, six
awards were made for recruitment purposes (one
of which was made to an executive director) and
a further six were made for retention purposes.
The awards under the RSP held by Ben Verwaayen,
Pierre Danon and Ian Livingston at the end of the 2003
ﬁnancial year are contained in the table on page 69.
Executive Share Plan (ESP)
The last awards under the ESP were granted in 1999.
Participants will generally only be entitled to shares
at the end of a ﬁve-year performance period if
the company has met the relevant predetermined
performance target and participants are still employed
by the group. At the end of the ﬁve-year period, if BT’s
TSR reaches 30th position, all the shares vest. If BT is
at 70th position starting from the top of the list, none
of the shares vest. Between those points, the shares
will vest on a straight line pro rata basis.
In 1994, 1995 and 1996 ESP participants could
invest 50% of their annual bonus in the ESP for
the purchase of shares. These invested shares were
matched by the company.
60 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Report on directors’ remuneration
The vesting date of 1998 ESP awards is in August
2003. None of the shares will vest as BT’s TSR was
at 83rd position on 31 March 2003, the closing date
of the performance period.
The awards under the ESP held by Andy Green
and Paul Reynolds at the end of the 2003 ﬁnancial year
are contained in the table on page 69.
Other share plans
The executive directors may participate in BT’s Inland
Revenue approved all-employee share plans,
the Employee Sharesave Scheme and Employee Share
Investment Plan (which replaced the Employee Share
Ownership Scheme), on the same basis as other
employees. There are further details of these plans
in note 34 to the accounts.
Annual package – 2004 ﬁnancial year
The Remuneration Committee has decided that there
should be no increase in base pay for executive
directors in 2004. For the achievement of target,
performance-related remuneration will be
approximately 67% of total remuneration (excluding
pension) for the Chief Executive and 54% for the other
executive directors.
Under his current service agreement the Chairman
is not entitled to be paid a bonus, or to participate in
the Equity Incentive Portfolio.
Performance targets for the 2004 ﬁnancial year
are signiﬁcantly more challenging than the outturn
of the 2003 ﬁnancial year. To increase the proportion
of performance-related remuneration, the maximum
bonus level will increase to 100% of salary for truly
exceptional performance for six executives only. The
on-target and maximum bonus levels for the Chief
Executive are unchanged. The threshold level, below
which a bonus payment will not be paid, has been set
at a higher level than the results achieved in the 2003
ﬁnancial year. The proportion of the bonus linked to
corporate performance has been increased from 60%
to 75% for the lines of business chief executives. For
all other relevant executives, bonuses are based solely
on corporate performance.
The Committee has decided that in 2004 and
subsequent years the value of the Chief Executive’s
DBP awards will be in line with other executives at 50%
of his gross annual bonus.
The value of options granted in the 2004 ﬁnancial
year will not exceed three times salary. Grants will be
subject to the same TSR performance conditions as
described above, except that the number of re-tests
will be reduced to one only, in year ﬁve.
Executive share ownership
A shareholding programme encourages executive
directors and OC members to build up a shareholding
in the company. The programme, which is not
mandatory, is designed to encourage executive
directors and members of the OC to build up
a shareholding with a value of 100% of their annual
salary within a period of three years from appointment.
Pensions
For the executive directors and most other senior
executives who joined the company prior to 1 April
2001, pension beneﬁts are one-thirtieth of ﬁnal salary
for each year of service with two-thirds of the executive’s
pension for the surviving spouse. Those with longer BT
service have undertakings of pension beneﬁts
of two-thirds of ﬁnal salary payable at normal
retirement age (inclusive of the pension equivalent
of any retirement cash lump sum) plus a pension
of two-thirds of the director’s or executive’s pension for
the surviving spouse. On death-in-service, a lump sum
equal to four times annual salary is payable together
with a pension of two-thirds of the director’s or
executive’s prospective pension for the surviving
spouse. Pensions are based on salary alone – bonuses,
other beneﬁts and long-term incentives are excluded.
BT closed its ﬁnal salary pension arrangements to
new employees with effect from 1 April 2001 and this
has been reﬂected in the retirement provision granted
to executive directors and other senior executives hired
since that date.
For these executive directors and other senior
executives, retirement provision is made on a deﬁned
contribution basis where the company agrees to pay
a ﬁxed percentage of the executive’s salary each year
towards the provision of retirement beneﬁts. Typically
this is 20-30% of salary. On death-in-service, a lump
sum equal to four times annual salary is payable.
Other beneﬁts
Other beneﬁts for the Chairman and executive
directors include some or all of the following: company
car, fuel and driver, personal telecommunications
facilities and home security, medical and dental cover
for the director and immediate family, professional
subscriptions and personal tax and ﬁnancial
counselling. The company has a permanent health
insurance policy to provide cover for the Chairman
and executive directors and members of the OC who
may become permanently incapacitated.
Service agreements
It is the policy for the Chairman and executive directors
to have service agreements providing for one year’s
notice. It may be necessary on recruitment to offer
longer initial periods to new directors from outside BT,
or circumstances may make it appropriate to offer
a longer ﬁxed term. All the service agreements contain
provisions dealing with the removal of a director
through poor performance, including in the event
of early termination of the contract by BT.
Termination payments
Sir Christopher Bland’s contract entitles him on
termination of his contract by BT to payment of salary
and the value of beneﬁts until 12 months from notice
of termination. Ben Verwaayen’s contract entitles him
on termination of his contract by BT to payment
of £700,000. The contracts of Pierre Danon, Andy
Green, Ian Livingston and Paul Reynolds entitle them
on termination of their contract by BT to payment
of salary and the value of beneﬁts until the earlier
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 61 Report on directors’ remuneration
of 12 months from notice of termination or the director
obtaining full-time employment.
If the contract of an executive director is
terminated by BT within one year after BT entering into
a scheme of arrangement or becoming a subsidiary
of another company, he will be entitled to receive his
salary, the higher of that current year’s on-target
bonus or the previous year’s bonus, the market value
of shares awarded under an employee share ownership
plan or deferred bonus plan that have not vested,
together with a year’s salary and the value
of any beneﬁts.
The Committee intends to review contracts in
the 2004 ﬁnancial year taking into account the joint
statement of best practice on executive contracts and
severance, published in December 2002 by the
Association of British Insurers and the National
Association of Pension Funds, and other relevant
guidelines.
Outside appointments
The Committee believes that there are signiﬁcant
beneﬁts, to both the company and the individual, from
executive directors accepting non-executive
directorships of companies outside BT. The Committee
will consider up to two external appointments (of which
only one may be to the Board of a major company),
for which a director may retain the fees.
Non-executive directors’ contracts of appointment
Non-executive directors have contracts of appointment.
They are normally appointed for an initial period
of three years. During that period, either party can give
the other at least three months’ notice. At the end
of the period the appointment may be continued by
mutual agreement. Further details of their appointment
arrangements are set out on page 53 in the section
dealing with corporate governance issues.
The contracts of appointment of non-executive
directors are terminable on notice by the company
without compensation.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
Seven of the directors on the Board are non-executive
directors who, in accordance with BT’s articles
of association, cannot individually vote on their own
remuneration. Therefore, non-executive remuneration
is set by the Chairman and the Chief Executive after
considering advice on appropriate levels
of remuneration (plus a general Board discussion).
The basic fee for non-executive directors, which
includes membership of one committee, is £30,000
per year. Additional fees for membership of Board
committees range from £3,000 to £5,000 per year.
Sir Anthony Greener, Deputy Chairman and senior
non-executive director, who also chairs both
the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee,
is paid an inclusive annual fee of £90,000.
Non-executive directors’ fees will be reviewed during
the 2004 ﬁnancial year.
To align further the interests of the non-executive
directors with those of shareholders, the company’s
policy is to encourage these directors to purchase,
on a voluntary basis, £5,000 of BT shares each year.
The directors are asked to hold these shares until they
retire from the Board. This policy is not mandatory.
No element of non-executive remuneration is
performance-related. Non-executive directors do not
participate in BT’s bonus or employee share plans.

Performance graph
This graph illustrates, as required by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002,
the performance of BT Group plc measured by TSR
(adjusted for the rights issue and the demerger of BT’s
mobile business in the 2002 ﬁnancial year) relative to
a ‘broad equity market index’ over the past ﬁve years.
The FTSE 100 is considered to be the most appropriate
index against which to measure performance, as BT
has been a constituent of the FTSE 100 throughout
the ﬁve-year period and the index is widely used. TSR
is the measure of the returns that a company has
provided for its shareholders, reﬂecting share price
movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 65 Report on directors’ remuneration
Sir Christopher Bland was appointed as part-time
Chairman on 1 May 2001. His annual salary on
appointment was £500,000.
Ben Verwaayen joined the company on 14 January
2002 on an annual salary of £700,000. He became

on a salary of £450,000.
The salaries of the Chairman and executive
directors remained unchanged during the 2003

the Committee decided there should be no increase
from 1 June 2003 in basic salaries.
Annual bonus awards to executive directors ranged
from 72% to 121% of salary in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
These payments are not pensionable.
Former directors
Yve Newbold, who retired from the Board in June
1997, remains a member of the Community Support
Committee for which she received fees of £5,000 in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
Dr Iain Anderson, who retired from the Board in
September 2001, is chairman of the BT Scotland
Board, for which he received £12,000 in the 2003
ﬁnancial year.
On the terms of his leaving the company on
31 January 2002, Sir Peter Bonﬁeld was entitled to
the sum of £820,000 payable in 12 monthly
instalments and contractual beneﬁts for one year.
During the 2003 ﬁnancial year, he received £683,000
as the ﬁnal ten monthly instalments of his contract
and contractual beneﬁts of £1,000.
Sir Iain Vallance, following his retirement from
the Board on 1 May 2001, received fees as President
Emeritus of £350,000 per annum until 31 July 2002.
He received £117,000 for the 2003 ﬁnancial year. He

Loans
Prior to the date of their appointment to the Board on
19 November 2001, Pierre Danon and Paul Reynolds
each had interest free loans from the company to assist
with re-location of £375,000 and £300,000,
respectively. At 31 March 2003, Pierre Danon owed
£281,250 (2002 – £318,750) and Paul Reynolds owed
£290,000 (2002 – £300,000). During the 2003
ﬁnancial year, the maximum amount outstanding was
£571,250. There are no outstanding loans granted
by any member of the BT group to any other of the
directors or guarantees provided by any member
of the BT group for their beneﬁt.
Pensions
Sir Christopher Bland is not a member of any of the
company pension schemes, but the company matches
his contributions, up to 10% of the earnings cap, to
a personal pension plan. Company contributions
of £9,720 were payable in respect of the 2003 ﬁnancial
year. The earnings cap is a restriction on the amount
of pay which can be used to calculate contributions and
beneﬁts due to a tax approved pension scheme.
Ben Verwaayen is not a member of any of the
company pension schemes, but the company has
agreed to pay an amount equal to 20% of his salary
towards pension provision. The company paid £24,300
into his personal pension plan plus £140,007 as a cash
payment. This amount, which is included in the table
on page 65, represents £110,840 being part of the
pension allowance for the 2003 ﬁnancial year, plus
£29,167 which was outstanding from the previous
ﬁnancial year. The balance of the 2003 pension
allowance of £4,860 has been carried forward to the
2004 ﬁnancial year. BT also provides him with a lump
sum death in service beneﬁt of four times his salary.
Ian Livingston is not a member of any
of the company pension schemes, but the company has
agreed to pay an amount equal to 30% of his salary
towards pension provision. The company paid £19,440
into his personal pension plan plus a cash payment
of £115,560 representing the balance of the pension
allowance for the 2003 ﬁnancial year, which is
included in the table on page 65. BT also provides
him with a lump sum death in service beneﬁt of four
times his salary.
Pierre Danon’s pension accrues at the rate of
one-thirtieth of his ﬁnal salary for each year of service.
In addition, a two-thirds widow’s pension would
be payable on his death. He is a member
of the BT Pension Scheme, but as he is subject to
the earnings cap the company has agreed to increase
his beneﬁts to the target level by means
of a non-approved, unfunded arrangement.
Andy Green is a member of the BT Pension
Scheme. From 31 December 1997 the company has
been purchasing an additional 203 days of pensionable
service each year to bring his pensionable service at age
60 up to 40 years. A two-thirds widow’s pension would
be payable on his death.
Paul Reynolds is a member of the BT Pension
Scheme. From 1 July 1996 the company has been
purchasing an additional 109 days of pensionable
service each year to bring his pensionable service
at age 60 up to 40 years. A two-thirds widow’s
pension would be payable on his death.
Sir Iain Vallance was part time Chairman and
subsequently President Emeritus. His deferred pension
under the BT Pension Scheme came into payment with
effect from 1 April 2003, although as the pension is paid
monthly in arrears the ﬁrst payment was not made until
30 April 2003. During the year he received a pension
payable by the company of £361,580. The pension
payable by the company will be reduced in the 2004
ﬁnancial year by the equivalent amount of pension he

Pensions continued
Philip Hampton left the company on 30 April 2002. His pension accrued at the rate of one-thirtieth of his ﬁnal
salary for each year of service. In addition, a two-thirds widow’s pension would have been payable on his death.
He was a member of the BT Pension Scheme, but as he was subject to the earnings cap, the company agreed
to increase his beneﬁts to the target level by means of a non-approved, unfunded arrangement. On leaving
the company his deferred pension was increased to the level it would have been had he completed
two years’ service.
The table below shows the increase in the accrued beneﬁts, including those referred to above, to which each
director has become entitled during the year and the transfer value of the increase in accrued beneﬁt:

These amounts represent the deferred pension to which the directors would have been entitled had they left the company on 31 March 2002 and
2003, respectively.
c
Transfer value of the deferred pension in column (a) as at 31 March 2003 calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance
Note GN11 and excludes directors’ contributions. The transfer value represents a liability of the company rather than any remuneration due to
the individual and cannot be meaningfully aggregated with annual remuneration, as it is not money the individual is entitled to receive.

72 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Statement of directors’ responsibility
for preparing the financial statements
The directors are required by law to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and
the group as at the end of the ﬁnancial year and
of the proﬁt or loss and cash ﬂows of the group for
that period.
The directors consider that, in preparing
the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 March
2003, on pages 75 to 135 the company has used
appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied
and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements
and estimates. The directors also consider that all
applicable accounting standards have been followed
and conﬁrm that the ﬁnancial statements have been
prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for ensuring
that the company keeps accounting records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the ﬁnancial position of the company and which enable
them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are also responsible for taking such
steps that are reasonably open to them to safeguard
the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud
and other irregularities.
The auditors’ responsibilities are stated in their
report to the shareholders.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 73 Report of the independent auditors
to the shareholders of BT Group plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements which
comprise the group proﬁt and loss account, group and
company balance sheets, group cash ﬂow statement,
group statement of total recognised gains and losses
and the related notes which have been prepared under
the historic cost convention and the accounting policies
set out in the Accounting Policies section and
the United States Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles section. We have also audited the disclosures
required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies
Act 1985 contained in the directors’ remuneration
report (‘‘the audited part’’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual
report, the directors’ remuneration report and
the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and accounting standards and
the requirements of the US Securities and Exchange
Commission are set out in the statement
of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial
statements and the audited part of the directors’
remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing
Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board and
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether
the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the ﬁnancial statements and the audited
part of the directors’ remuneration report have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the directors’ report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial
statements, if the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information speciﬁed by law or the Listing
Rules regarding directors’ remuneration and
transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in
the annual report and consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the ﬁnancial statements. The other information
comprises only those sections set out in the table
of contents including Financial headlines, Chairman’s
message, Chief Executive’s statement, Business
and Financial reviews, Five-year ﬁnancial summary,
Report of the directors, Corporate governance and
Risk factors.
We review whether the corporate governance
statement reﬂects the company’s compliance with
the seven provisions of the Combined Code speciﬁed
for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report
if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the company’s or group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board and in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and
the audited part of the directors’ remuneration
report. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant
estimates and judgements made by the directors
in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to
obtain all the information and explanations which
we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the ﬁnancial statements.
UK opinion
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the company
and the group at 31 March 2003 and of the proﬁt
and cash ﬂows of the group for the year then ended;
the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and those
parts of the directors’ remuneration report required by
Part 3 of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 have
been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.
US opinion
In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated ﬁnancial
position of the group as at 31 March 2003 and
31 March 2002, and the results of its operations and
its cash ﬂows for the years ended 31 March 2003,
31 March 2002 and 31 March 2001 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United Kingdom.
Accounting principles generally accepted in
the United Kingdom vary in certain respects from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The application of the latter would have
affected the determination of consolidated net income
for the three years ended 31 March 2003, 31 March
2002 and 31 March 2001 and the consolidated
shareholders’ equity at 31 March 2003 and 31 March
2002 as shown in the summary of differences between
United Kingdom and United States generally accepted
accounting principles set out in the United States
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles section.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 75 Accounting policies
I Basis of preparation of the ﬁnancial statements
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared under
the historical cost convention and in accordance with
applicable accounting standards and the provisions
of the Companies Act 1985. The group ﬁnancial
statements consolidate those of the company and
all of its subsidiary undertakings. Where the ﬁnancial
statements of subsidiary undertakings, associates
and joint ventures do not conform with the group’s
accounting policies, appropriate adjustments are made
on consolidation in order to present the group ﬁnancial
statements on a consistent basis. The principal
subsidiary undertakings’ ﬁnancial years are all
coterminous with those of the company.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and
the reported amounts of income and expenditure
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Estimates are used principally
when accounting for interconnect income, provision
for doubtful debts, payments to telecommunication
operators, depreciation, goodwill amortisation and
impairment, employee pension schemes, provisions
for liabilities and charges and taxes.
II Turnover
Group turnover net of discounts, which excludes value
added tax and other sales taxes, comprises the value
of services provided and equipment sales by group
undertakings, excluding those between them.
Total turnover is group turnover together with
the group’s share of its associates’ and joint ventures’
turnover, excluding the group’s share of transactions
between the group and its principal joint venture,
Concert BV.
Turnover from calls is recognised in the group
proﬁt and loss account at the time the call is made
over the group’s networks. Turnover from rentals is
recognised evenly over the period to which the charges
relate. Turnover from equipment sales is recognised
at the point of sale. Prepaid call card sales are deferred
until the customer uses the stored value in the card
to pay for the relevant calls. Turnover arising from
the provision of other services, including maintenance
contracts, is recognised evenly over the periods in
which the service is provided to the customer. Turnover
from installation and connection activities is recognised
in the same period as the related costs. Turnover from
classiﬁed directories, mainly comprising advertising
revenue, is recognised in the group proﬁt and loss
account upon completion of delivery.
III Research and development
Expenditure on research and development is written
off as incurred.
IV Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged against the proﬁt
and loss account on a straight-line basis over the
lease period except where the contractual payment
terms are considered to be a more systematic and
appropriate basis.
V Interest
Interest payable, including that related to ﬁnancing
the construction of tangible ﬁxed assets, is written off
as incurred. Discounts or premiums and expenses on
the issue of debt securities are amortised over the term
of the related security and included within interest
payable. Premiums payable on early redemptions
of debt securities, in lieu of future interest costs,
are written off when paid.
VI Foreign currencies
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign
undertakings are translated into sterling at year end
exchange rates. The results of foreign undertakings are
translated into sterling at average rates of exchange
for the year.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation
at year end exchange rates of the net investment in
foreign undertakings, less exchange differences on
borrowings which ﬁnance or provide a hedge against
those undertakings, are taken to reserves and are
reported in the statement of total recognised gains
and losses.
All other exchange gains or losses are dealt with
through the proﬁt and loss account.
VlI Intangibles
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill, arising from the purchase of subsidiary
undertakings and interests in associates and joint
ventures, represents the excess of the fair value
of the purchase consideration over the fair value
of the net assets acquired.
For acquisitions completed on or after 1 April
1998, the goodwill arising is capitalised as an
intangible asset or, if arising in respect of an associate
or joint venture, recorded as part of the related
investment. Goodwill is amortised on a straight line
basis from the time of acquisition over its useful
economic life. The economic life is normally presumed
to be a maximum of 20 years.
For acquisitions on or before 31 March 1998,
the goodwill is written off on acquisition against
group reserves.
If an undertaking is subsequently divested,
the appropriate unamortised goodwill or goodwill
written off to reserves is dealt with through the proﬁt
and loss account in the period of disposal as part
of the gain or loss on divestment.
(b) Other intangibles
Licence fees paid to governments, which permit
telecommunication activities to be operated for deﬁned
periods, are amortised from the later of the start
of the licence period or launch of service to the end
of the licence period on a straight-line basis.
76 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Accounting policies
VllI Tangible ﬁxed assets
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at historical cost
less depreciation.
(a) Cost
Cost in the case of network services includes
contractors’ charges and payments on account,
materials, direct labour and directly
attributable overheads.
(b) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on tangible ﬁxed assets on
a straight line basis from the time they are available for
use, so as to write off their costs over their estimated
useful lives taking into account any expected residual
values. No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
The lives assigned to other signiﬁcant tangible ﬁxed
assets are:
Freehold buildings – 40 years
Leasehold land and buildings – Unexpired portion
of lease or 40 years,
whichever is
the shorter
Transmission equipment:
duct – 25 years
cable – 3 to 25 years
radio and repeater equipment – 2 to 25 years
Exchange equipment – 2 to 13 years
Computers and ofﬁce equipment – 2 to 6 years
Payphones, other network equipment,
motor vehicles and cableships – 2 to 20 years
Software – 2 to 5 years
IX Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings, associates
and joint ventures are stated in the balance sheet
of the company at cost less amounts written off.
Amounts denominated in foreign currency are
translated into sterling at year end exchange rates.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are
stated in the group balance sheet at the group’s share
of their net assets, together with any attributable
unamortised goodwill on acquisitions arising on or after
1 April 1998.
The group’s share of proﬁts less losses of associates
and joint ventures is included in the group proﬁt and
loss account.
Investments in other participating interests and
other investments are stated at cost less amounts
written off.
X Asset impairment
Intangible and tangible ﬁxed assets are tested for
impairment when an event that might affect asset
values has occurred. Goodwill is also reviewed for
impairment at the end of the ﬁrst ﬁnancial year
after acquisition.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent
that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either
by selling the asset or by the discounted future cash
ﬂows from operating the assets.
XI Stocks
Stocks mainly comprise items of equipment, held for
sale or rental, consumable items and work in progress
on long-term contracts.
Equipment held and consumable items are stated
at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value,
after provisions for obsolescence.
Work in progress on long-term contracts is stated
at cost, after deducting payments on account,
less provisions for any foreseeable losses.
XII Debtors
Debtors are stated in the balance sheet at estimated
net realisable value. Net realisable value is the invoiced
amount less provisions for bad and doubtful debtors.
Provisions are made speciﬁcally against debtors where
there is evidence of a dispute or an inability to pay.
An additional provision is made based on an analysis
of balances by age, previous losses experienced
and general economic conditions.
XIII Redundancy costs
Redundancy or leaver costs arising from periodic
reviews of staff levels are charged against proﬁt in
the year in which the group is demonstrably committed
to the employees leaving the group.
If the estimated cost of providing incremental
pension beneﬁts in respect of employees leaving
the group exceeds the total accounting surplus based
on the latest actuarial valuation of the group’s pension
scheme and the amount of the provision for pension
liabilities on the balance sheet, then the excess
estimated costs are charged against proﬁt in the year
in which the employees agree to leave the group,
within redundancy or leaver costs.
XIV Pension schemes
The group operates a funded deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme, which is independent of the group’s ﬁnances,
for the substantial majority of its employees. Actuarial
valuations of the main scheme are carried out by an
independent actuary as determined by the trustees
at intervals of not more than three years, to determine
the rates of contribution payable. The pension cost is
determined on the advice of the company’s actuary,
having regard to the results of these valuations. In any
intervening years, the actuaries review the continuing
appropriateness of the contribution rates.
The cost of providing pensions is charged against
proﬁts over employees’ working lives with the group
using the projected unit method. Variations from this
regular cost are allocated on a straight-line basis over
the average remaining service lives of current
employees to the extent that these variations do not
relate to the estimated cost of providing incremental
pension beneﬁts in the circumstances described
in XIII above.
Interest is accounted for on the provision or
prepayment in the balance sheet which results from
differences between amounts recognised as pension
costs and amounts funded. The regular pension cost,
variations from the regular pension cost, described
above, and interest are all charged within staff costs.
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 77 Accounting policies
The group also operates deﬁned contribution pension
schemes and the proﬁt and loss account is charged
with the contributions payable.
XV Taxation
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all
timing differences which have arisen but have not
reversed at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets
are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more
likely than not that there will be taxable proﬁts from
which the underlying timing differences can be
deducted. No deferred tax is provided in respect of any
future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries
or associates where no commitment has been made
to remit such earnings. The deferred tax balances
are not discounted.
XVI Financial instruments
(a) Debt instruments
Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net
proceeds adjusted to amortise any discount evenly
over the term of the debt, and further adjusted
for the effect of currency swaps acting as hedges.
(b) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments
to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks and
interest rate movements. The group does not hold
or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments for ﬁnancial
trading purposes.
Criteria to qualify for hedge accounting
The group considers its derivative ﬁnancial instruments
to be hedges when certain criteria are met. For foreign
currency derivatives, the instrument must be related to
actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or a probable
commitment and whose characteristics have been
identiﬁed. It must involve the same currency or similar
currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce
the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on
the group’s operations. For interest rate derivatives,
the instrument must be related to assets or liabilities
or a probable commitment, such as a future bond
issue, and must also change the interest rate or
the nature of the interest rate by converting a ﬁxed
rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Accounting for derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Principal amounts underlying currency swaps are
revalued at exchange rates ruling at the date
of the group balance sheet and, to the extent
that they are not related to debt instruments, are
included in debtors or creditors.
Interest differentials, under interest rate swap
agreements used to vary the amounts and periods
for which interest rates on borrowings are ﬁxed,
are recognised by adjustment of interest payable.
The forward exchange contracts used to change
the currency mix of net debt are revalued to balance
sheet rates with net unrealised gains and losses being
shown as part of debtors, creditors, or as part of net
debt. The difference between spot and forward rate
for these contracts is recognised as part of net interest
payable over the term of the contract.
The forward exchange contracts hedging
transaction exposures are revalued at the prevailing
forward rate on the balance sheet date with net
unrealised gains and losses being shown as debtors
and creditors.
Instruments that form hedges against future
ﬁxed-rate bond issues are marked to market. Gains or
losses are deferred until the bond is issued when they
are recognised evenly over the term of the bond.

84 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 1. Accounting for the reorganisation and demerger, changes in accounting policy and presentation
and discontinued activities
(a) Reorganisation and demerger
On 19 November 2001, the legal separation of the mmO
2
business from the rest of the former British
Telecommunications plc group was completed and BT Group plc (BT Group) became the ultimate parent
company of British Telecommunications plc (BT). The legal structure of the transaction was such that BT
transferred the mmO
2
business to mmO
2
plc and BT Group Investments Limited (BTGI) became the immediate
parent company of BT on 16 November 2001. On 19 November 2001, mmO
2
plc transferred the shares in BTGI
to BT Group, as consideration for the issue to former BT shareholders of one ordinary share of 115 pence in
the company, credited as fully paid, for each ordinary share in BT held on 16 November 2001.
On 21 November 2001, following the approval of the Court, the nominal value of BT Group shares was
reduced from 115 pence per ordinary share to 5 pence per ordinary share by way of a reduction of capital under
section 135 of the Companies Act 1985. The surplus of £9,537 million arising from this capital reduction has
been credited to the group proﬁt and loss reserve.
The transfer of BTGI to the company has been accounted for as a group reconstruction in accordance with
the principles of merger accounting set out in Financial Reporting Standard 6 (FRS 6) and Schedule 4A to
the Companies Act 1985. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are therefore presented as if the company had
been the parent company of the group throughout the year ended 31 March 2001 and up to the date of the
demerger. The results of mmO
2
have been included in discontinued activities in all three years.
The transfer of BT to BTGI on 16 November 2001 was a group reorganisation effected for non-equity
consideration. This transaction has been accounted for in these ﬁnancial statements using the principles of
merger accounting as if BT had been owned and controlled by BTGI throughout the year ended 31 March 2001
and up to 16 November 2001. This is not in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 since the group
reorganisation does not meet all the conditions for merger accounting. If acquisition accounting had been applied
to account for the reorganisation whereby BTGI became the parent company of BT, this would have resulted in all
the separable assets and liabilities of the BT Group as at 16 November 2001 being recorded at their fair values,
substantial goodwill and goodwill amortisation charges arising and only the post demerger results being reﬂected
within the BT Group consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The directors consider that to have applied acquisition
accounting in preparing these ﬁnancial statements would have failed to give a true and fair view of the group’s
state of affairs and results. This is because, in substance, BT Group is the successor to BT and its shareholders
have had a continuing interest in the BT business both before and after the demerger. The directors consider that
it is not practicable to quantify the effects of this departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
In the company’s ﬁnancial statements, its investment in BTGI is stated at the nominal value of shares issued.
In accordance with sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985, no premium was recorded on the ordinary
shares issued (see note 37). On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued and
the aggregate share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserve of BT at the date of the demerger
(the merger difference), has been debited to the other reserves (see note 28).
(b) Changes in accounting policy and presentation
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the group has made a number of changes in the presentation of its
ﬁnancial statements. Comparative ﬁgures have been restated accordingly. These are explained in the notes
where material. There have been no changes to accounting policies in the 2003 ﬁnancial year.
(c) Discontinued activities
On 1 June 2001, BT disposed of its interests in Japan Telecom and J-Phone Communications and, on 29 June
2001, its interest in Airtel. On 22 June 2001, BT sold Yell, its classiﬁed advertising directory businesses in the UK
and the USA. These activities, together with mmO
2
, are shown as discontinued operations in the proﬁt and loss
accounts. The eliminations are intra-group eliminations. The interest charge allocated to mmO
2
for all periods
presented up to the date of the demerger has been calculated assuming that mmO
2
’s net debt at the date of
the demerger of £500 million, had been in existence for the whole of the period, and had been bearing an interest
charge of 8% per annum.
The interest charge allocated to Yell for all periods presented up to the date of disposal represents
amounts payable on intercompany loans charged at an arm’s length rate of interest. The taxation charge
allocated to discontinued activities, for all periods presented up to the date of demerger or disposal, represents
amounts charged to these entities before recognising credit for group relief surrendered to entities within
continuing activities.
Notes to the financial statements
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 85 2. Segmental analysis
The group provides telecommunication services, principally in the UK and essentially operates as a unitary
business. Its main services and products are ﬁxed voice and data calls, the provision of ﬁxed exchange lines
to homes and businesses, the provision of communication services to other operators, the provision of private
services to businesses and the supply of telecommunication equipment for customers’ premises.
The turnover of each line of business is derived as follows:
& BT Retail derives its turnover from the supply of exchange lines and from the calls made over these lines,
the leasing of private circuits and other private services, the sale and rental of customer premises equipment
to the group’s UK customers and other lines of business and from its narrowband and broadband internet
access products.
& BT Wholesale derives its turnover from providing network services to BT Retail and other BT lines of business,
and from interconnecting the group’s UK network to other operators.
& BT Global Services (formerly BT Ignite) mainly generates its turnover from outsourcing and systems
integration work and from the ﬁxed network operations of the group’s European subsidiaries. The business
also derives revenues from providing web hosting facilities to end customers and through BT lines of business.
Segmented information on the lines of business is given below for the years ended 31 March 2003, 31 March
2002 and 31 March 2001 as required by the UK accounting standard SSAP 25 and the US accounting standard
SFAS No. 131 (SFAS 131).
There is extensive trading between the lines of business and proﬁtability is dependent on the transfer price
levels. These intra-group trading arrangements and operating assets have been subject to review and have
changed in certain instances. In addition, the group moved management responsibility of BT Openworld to
BT Retail. Comparative ﬁgures have been restated for these and other changes and in certain instances have
been determined using apportionments and allocations.

The directors believe that the nature of the group’s business is such that the analysis of operating costs
required by the Companies Act 1985 is not appropriate. As required by the Act, the directors have therefore
adapted the prescribed format so that operating costs are disclosed in a manner appropriate to the group’s
principal activity.

Current tax and total tax on proﬁt on ordinary activities, differs from the amount computed by applying
the corporation tax rate to proﬁt on ordinary activities before taxation. The differences were attributable to
the following factors:

the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, Germany and Spain.
As at 31 March 2003, the group had overseas corporate tax losses estimated to be £1.2 billion which are not
recognised as deferred tax assets. In addition, the group has unutilised capital losses estimated to be in excess
of £10 billion which were not recognised as deferred tax assets.

shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the company’s shares held by
employee share ownership trusts.
In calculating the diluted earnings (loss) per share, share options outstanding and other potential ordinary
shares have been taken into account.

to achieve the equal division of speciﬁed working capital and other liability balances. The results of the acquired
businesses, both pre and post acquisition, cannot be separately identiﬁed and, therefore, cannot be reported.

On 31 January 2002, one of the venture partners in Blu exercised a put option for BT to purchase a 9% interest
for £66 million. The cost of £66 million arising on this purchase was written off. In addition in the year ended
31 March 2002 the value of BT’s investment was reviewed and provision was made for the associated impairment
and exit costs. In December 2002 the group sold its interest in Blu (note 7).

On 8 May 2000, the group acquired a 40% interest in a company, with Japan Telecom owning the other 60%
interest, which holds a 74% interest in J-Phone Communications Co. Limited (JPC). JPC in turn acquired
controlling interests, averaging 51%, in nine regional Japanese mobile phone J-Phone companies. These J-Phone
companies merged into three larger regional companies during the year ended 31 March 2001. Japan Telecom
also held a direct 18% interest in the J-Phone companies.
During the year ended 31 March 2001, the group held an effective 23% interest in J-Phone. The impact
of the combined J-Phone/Japan Telecom ownership structure, however, led the group to reﬂect 63% of the
J-Phone results at the turnover and operating proﬁt levels and all items below including interest and taxation,
in accordance with the requirements of FRS 9. In June 2001, the group sold this interest (note 7).

The interest rate payable on these notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody’s or Standard and Poor’s (S&P) reduces the rating
ascribed to the group’s senior unsecured debt below A3 in the case of Moody’s or below A minus in the case of S&P. In this event, the interest rate
payable on the notes and the spread applicable to the ﬂoating notes will be increased by 0.25% for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings
agency. In addition, if Moody’s or S&P subsequently increase the rating ascribed to the group’s senior unsecured debt, then the interest rate then payable
on notes and the spread applicable to the ﬂoating notes will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency, but in no
event will the interest rate be reduced below the minimum interest rate reﬂected in the table above.

During the year ended 31 March 2002 the company issued shares at a market value of £154 million (2001 – £400 million) in respect of the exercise
of options awarded under its principal savings-related share option scheme. Employees paid £84 million (2001 – £145 million) to the group for the issue
of these shares and the balance of £70 million (2001 – £255 million) comprised contributions to the qualifying employee share ownership trust from group
undertakings. The movement relating to BT’s Employee Share Ownership Trust in 2001 included the writedown of shares held in trust.

The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse
effect on the ﬁnancial position or results of operations of the group.
Proceedings have been initiated in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection
with the Italian UMTS auction. Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
The ﬁrst hearing has been scheduled for 11 July 2003, in Rome. If the proceedings are successful, BT could be
held liable, with others, for any damages. The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a
provision in respect of any such potential claim.
Notes to the financial statements
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 111 31. Pension costs
Background
The group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice No. 24 ‘‘Pension Costs’’ (SSAP 24). In addition, disclosures have been presented in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard No. 17 ‘‘Retirement Beneﬁts’’ (FRS 17).
The group offers retirement plans to its employees. The group’s main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme
(BTPS), is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme where the beneﬁts are based on employees’ length of service and ﬁnal
pensionable pay. The BTPS is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund. This scheme has been
closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a deﬁned contribution scheme. Under this deﬁned
contribution scheme the proﬁt and loss charge represents the contribution paid by the group based upon a ﬁxed
percentage of employees’ pay.
The total pension costs of the group (including discontinued activities) expensed within staff costs in the year
was £322 million (2002 – £382 million, 2001 – £326 million), of which £314 million (2002 – £373 million,
2001 – £315 million) related to the group’s main deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the BTPS. The decline in
the pension cost reﬂects the reduction in the number of active members of the BTPS and the interest credit
relating to the balance sheet prepayment. This total pension cost includes the cost of providing enhanced pension
beneﬁts to leavers, which amounted to £60 million (2002 – £46 million, 2001 – £nil). In the year ended 31 March
2002 this proﬁt and loss charge of £46 million was not the full cash cost of £186 million because there was
a pension fund accounting surplus, including the provision on the balance sheet of £140 million that was fully
utilised before making a charge to the proﬁt and loss account.
The pension cost applicable to deﬁned contribution schemes in the year ended 31 March 2003 was £4 million,
(2002 – £5 million, 2001 – £nil), and £0.4 million (2002 – £0.3 million, 2001 – £nil) of contributions to the
schemes were outstanding at 31 March 2003.
The group occupies seven properties owned by the scheme on which an annual rental of £3 million is payable.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, ﬁxed interest and index
linked securities, deposits and short-term investments. At 31 March 2003, the UK equities included 37 million
(2002 – 55 million, 2001 – 51 million) ordinary shares of the company with a market value of £58 million
(2002 – £154 million, 2001 – £258 million).
BT Pension Scheme
Funding valuation
A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualiﬁed independent
actuary, using the projected unit method. The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that
present and future contributions should be sufﬁcient to meet future liabilities. The triennial valuation as at
31 December 2002 forms the basis of determining the group’s pension fund contributions for the year ending
31 March 2004 and future periods until the next valuation is completed. The funding valuation is performed
at 31 December because this is the ﬁnancial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows:
& scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date; and
& scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return
reﬂecting the assets of the scheme.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions:

Notes to the financial statements
112 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 31. Pension costs continued
The mortality assumption reﬂects improvements in life expectancy since the 1999 valuation and incorporates
further future improvements.
The assumed rate of investment return, salary increases and mortality all have a signiﬁcant effect on
the funding valuation. A 0.25 percentage point change in these assumptions would have the following effects
on the funding deﬁcit:
Impact on funding deﬁcit
Increase
£bn
Decrease
£bn
0.25 percentage point change in:
Investment return (0.9) 0.9
Wage and salary increases 0.2 (0.2)
An additional year of life expectancy would result in a £0.7 billion increase in the deﬁcit.
At 31 December 2002, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of £22.8 billion (1999 – £29.7 billion) and
were sufﬁcient to cover 91.6% (1999 – 96.8%) of the beneﬁts accrued by that date, after allowing for expected
future increases in wages and salaries but not taking into account the costs of providing incremental pension
beneﬁts for employees leaving under release schemes since that date. This represents a funding deﬁcit of
£2.1 billion compared to £1.0 billion at 31 December 1999. The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions
whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuary’s view of the median estimate basis, the funding deﬁcit
would have been reduced to £0.4 billion. Although the current market value of equity investments has fallen,
the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the beneﬁts paid by £0.3 billion in
the year ended 31 December 2002. As a result of the triennial funding valuation the group has agreed to make
employer’s contributions at a rate of 12.2% of pensionable pay from April 2003 and annual deﬁciency payments
of £232 million. This compares to the employer’s contribution rate of 11.6% and annual deﬁciency payments
of £200 million that were determined under the 1999 funding valuation. In the year ended 31 March 2003,
the group made regular contributions of £278 million (2002 – £303 million, 2001 – £308 million) and additional
special contributions for enhanced pension beneﬁts to leavers in the year ended 31 December 2001 of
£129 million in the 2003 ﬁnancial year (2002 – £400 million, 2001 – £100 million) and deﬁciency contributions
of £200 million (2002 – £200 million, 2001 – £200 million). The group will also pay a special contribution in
December 2003, which is expected to amount to approximately £100 million in respect of early leavers in the
year ended 31 December 2002 which has already been reﬂected in the proﬁt and loss account.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS the group is required to have a funding plan
that should address the deﬁcit over a maximum period of 20 years whilst the agreed funding plan addresses
the deﬁcit over a period of 15 years. The group will continue to make annual deﬁciency payments until the deﬁcit
is made good.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age proﬁle of active members will
consequently increase. Under the projected unit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active
members’ pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment proﬁle extends over more than 60 years.
SSAP 24 accounting valuation
The SSAP 24 valuation is broadly on the following basis:
& scheme assets are valued at market value; and
& scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate
of return reﬂecting the assets of the scheme.
For the purpose of determining the group’s pension expenses under SSAP 24 in the years ended 31 March
2003, 2002 and 2001, the same assumptions were used as set out above for the December 1999 funding
valuation, with the exception that, over the long term, it has been assumed that the return on the existing assets
of the scheme, relative to market values, would be a nominal 5.6% per annum (allowing for real equity dividend
growth of 1.25% per annum). This equates to a real return of 2.5% per annum rather than the more conservative
funding valuation, which used a real return of 2.4% per annum.
At 31 March 2000 there was a SSAP 24 deﬁcit of £0.2 billion and the regular cost for the 2003, 2002
and 2001 ﬁnancial years was 11.6% of pensionable salaries based on the 31 March 2000 SSAP 24 valuation.
The pension cost for the 2004 ﬁnancial year will be based upon the 31 March 2003 SSAP 24 valuation.
At 31 March 2003 there was a SSAP 24 deﬁcit of £1.4 billion, before taking account of the balance sheet
prepayment and the regular cost will be 11.3% of pensionable salaries. The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003
is based on the 31 December 2002 funding valuation rolled forward, and uses the same assumptions as set out
above, with the following exceptions:
& return on existing assets is assumed to be a nominal 7.1% per annum, which equates to a real return
of 4.7%;
& average increase in retail price index is assumed to be 2.25% per annum; and
& the average future increases in wages and salaries is assumed to include a short term reduction in the real
salary growth assumption to 0.75% for the ﬁrst three years, before returning to 1.5%.
Notes to the financial statements
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 113 31. Pension costs continued
The cumulative difference since the adoption of SSAP 24 between the cash contributions paid by the group
to the pension scheme and the proﬁt and loss charge is reﬂected on the balance sheet. The cumulative cash
contributions exceed the proﬁt and loss charge and the resulting difference is shown as a prepayment on the
balance sheet. At 31 March 2003 the prepayment was £630 million (2002 – £231 million) with the increase
being principally due to the additional special and deﬁciency contributions in the year.
The pension charge to the proﬁt and loss account will also include the amortisation of the combined pension
fund position and pension prepayment over the average remaining service lives of scheme members, which
amounts to 13 years, and the cost of enhanced pension beneﬁts provided to leavers.
FRS 17 – Retirement beneﬁts
The group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24. Full implementation of FRS 17 has
been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board until accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January
2005. The requirements for disclosure under FRS 17 remain in force between its issue and full implementation,
and the required information is set out below. FRS 17 speciﬁes how key assumptions should be derived and
applied. These assumptions are often different to the assumptions adopted by the pension scheme actuary
and trustees in determining the funding position of pension schemes. The accounting requirements under
FRS 17 are broadly as follows:
& scheme assets are valued at market value at the balance sheet date;
& scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return
on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability; and
& movement in the scheme surplus/deﬁcit is split between operating charges and ﬁnancing items in the proﬁt
and loss account and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
The ﬁnancial assumptions used to calculate the BTPS liabilities under FRS 17 at 31 March 2003 are:

114 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 31. Pension costs continued
The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the deﬁcit but does affect
the level of the expected return on assets within the net ﬁnance cost charged to the proﬁt and loss account
under FRS 17.
The net pension deﬁcit set out below under FRS 17 is as if this standard was fully applied. The fair value
of the BTPS assets, the present value of the BTPS liabilities based on the ﬁnancial assumptions set out above,
and the resulting deﬁcit, together with those of unfunded pension liabilities at 31 March 2003 are shown below.
The fair value of the BTPS assets is not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to signiﬁcant
change before it is realised. The present value of the liabilities is derived from long-term cash ﬂow projections
and is thus inherently uncertain.

34. Employee share schemes
The company has a share ownership scheme used for employee share allocations (proﬁt sharing), an employee
share investment plan, savings-related share option schemes for its employees and those of participating
subsidiaries, further share option schemes for selected group employees and an employee stock purchase plan
for employees in the United States. It also has several share plans for executives.
Share option schemes
The major share option scheme, the BT Group Employee Sharesave Scheme, is savings related and the share
options are normally exercisable on completion of a three or ﬁve year Save As You Earn contract. A similar savings
related scheme exists for group employees based outside the UK.
Following the scheme of arrangement and demerger in November 2001, all options under the savings related
schemes became exercisable for a period of six months. On expiry of this period, these options lapsed to the
extent to which they had not been exercised. Shortly before the scheme of arrangement, 57 million shares were
allotted to a special purpose trust to satisfy options which were likely to be exercised during that six month period.
Participants in the BT Share Option Scheme, the BT US Stock Option Plan, the BT Worldwide Share Option
Scheme, and the BT Global Share Option Plan (the Executive Option Plans) were given the opportunity to
(i) conditionally on the scheme of arrangement being sanctioned by the Court, release their options over British
Telecommunications plc shares in consideration for the grant of options in their employer’s new holding company
(BT Group plc or mmO
2
plc); or (ii) if their options were already exercisable, exercise their options over ordinary
shares irrespective of whether the scheme of arrangement was sanctioned by the Court; or (iii) if their options
were not already exercisable, conditionally on the scheme of arrangement being sanctioned by the Court, exercise
their options immediately following that time but prior to the reduction of BT Group’s share capital.
To the extent that they had not already been exercised, these options lapsed on 16 November 2001,
the effective date of the scheme of arrangement.
On 17 December 2001, replacement unapproved options over BT Group shares were granted under the
BT Group Legacy Option Plan to all participants in the Executive Option Plans who had released their options
over British Telecommunications plc shares. The value of the replacement options was determined by averaging
the combined prices of BT Group plc and mmO
2
plc shares over the 20 dealing days following the demerger
on 19 November 2001. This resulted in a factor of 1.3198 being applied to the former option over British
Telecommunications plc shares in order to give the number of BT Group shares under the new option. The option
prices of the original options were also adjusted to take account of the different number of shares under option.

The option prices of shares under the BT Group Legacy Option Plan were adjusted at the time of the demerger as detailed on page 117.
On the demerger, BT’s share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar BT Group Employee
Sharesave schemes and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year ended 31 March 2003 has been
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted average
assumptions were used in that model: an expected life extending one month later than the ﬁrst exercise date;
estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5% (2002 – 5%, 2001 – 2%); risk free interest rates
of approximately 5% (2002 – 6%, 2001 – 7%); and expected volatility of approximately 40% (2002 – 34%,
2001 – 41%).
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 March 2003 was 55p
(2002 – 55p, 2001 – 329p) for options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 72p
(2002 – 55p, 2001 – 424p) for options exercisable ﬁve years after the date of grant. The weighted average fair
value of options granted under the BT Group Global Share Option Plan has been estimated as 24p. The total
value of share options granted by BT in the year ended 31 March 2003 was £41 million (2002 – £88 million,
2001 – £168 million).
In accordance with UK accounting practices, no compensation expense is recognised for the fair value
of options granted where the exercise price equals the market price at date of grant or options granted under
approved Sharesave schemes. See United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles – IV Accounting for
share options for the treatment under US GAAP.

Incentive Share Plan and Retention Share Plan
The BT Incentive Share Plan (ISP) and the BT Retention Share Plan (RSP) were introduced for employees of
the group in 2000. Under the plans, company shares are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and are
conditionally awarded to participants. Under the ISP participants are normally only entitled to these shares in full
at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance
measure and if the participants are still employed by the group. If the company has exceeded the pre-determined
corporate performance measure the participants may be awarded up to double the shares conditionally awarded.
The corporate performance measure assesses the company’s overall performance against those top 100 companies
listed on the London Stock Exchange, as rated by the Financial Times (the FTSE 100 index), at the beginning of
the relevant performance period. Under the RSP the length of retention period before awards vest is ﬂexible.
Awards may vest in annual tranches. The shares are transferred at the end of a speciﬁed period, only if
the individual is still employed by the group. During the 2003 ﬁnancial year, 374,039 (2002 – 162,772) shares
vested in 11 (2002 – 12) participants in the RSP.
Executive Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan
The BT Executive Share Plan (ESP) was introduced for employees of the group in 1994. Under the ESP, company
shares are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and are conditionally awarded to participants.
Participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a ﬁve-year period under the ESP if, at the end
of the period, the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure. Awards of
shares were granted in each of the years from 1994 to 1999 under the ESP.
In 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 ESP participants could invest 50% of their annual bonus in the ESP for
the purchase of shares. These invested shares were matched by the company.
The corporate performance measure assesses the company’s overall performance against those top 100
companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, as rated by the FTSE 100 index, at the beginning of the relevant
performance period.
Notes to the financial statements
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 119 34. Employee share schemes continued
The fourth ﬁve-year performance cycle of the ESP ended on 31 July 2002 and on the basis of the corporate
performance measure, the company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target relative to the other companies in
the FTSE 100, 32.5% (2002 – 85%) of the shares vested on 1 August 2002 in 65 participants (1 August 2001:
62 participants) and 1.0 million shares (1 August 2001 – 1.2 million shares) were transferred to those participants.
The BT Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) was established in 1998 and awards were granted to employees of the
group in July 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and June 2002. Under this plan, shares in the company are acquired by
an employee share ownership trust and transferred to participants at the end of three years if he or she has
continued to be employed by the group throughout that period. On 1 August 2002, 657,592 shares (1 August
2001 – 303,326) were transferred to 223 participants (1 August 2001 – 154) at the end of the three-year
deferred period.

Of the total BT Group plc shares held, 6.8 million shares were held at 31 March 2003 in trust for future awards
under employee share schemes. These shares had a nominal value of £0.3 million and a market value of
£10.7 million at 31 March 2003.
The values of possible future transfers of shares under the plans were based on the BT Group plc share price
at 31 March 2003 of 157p (2002 – 280p). The provisions for the costs of the ISP, RSP and ESP were based on
best estimates of the company’s performance over the plans’ conditional periods, relating to those portions of
the plan conditional periods from commencement up to the ﬁnancial year end.
Employee Share Investment Plan
From December 2001 the BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan (ESIP) was in operation. The ESIP,
which has been approved by the Inland Revenue, gives UK employees an opportunity to purchase shares
(partnership shares) monthly out of pre-tax salary up to a maximum value of £125 per month. During the 2003
ﬁnancial year, 5.3 million shares (2002 – 0.7 million shares) were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf
of 12,092 employees at a total cost of £10.6 million (2002 – £1.8 million). The free shares element of the ESIP
allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for at least three years. A phantom plan,
which delivers cash awards equivalent to the value of the free shares, operates for employees outside the UK.
In 2003, 2% of pre-tax proﬁts, amounting to £36 million, was set aside for the ESIP and the phantom plan for
employees outside the UK (2002 – £25 million). The allocation of this sum was subject to two performance
targets, one of increasing earnings per share by 25% and the other of reducing customer dissatisfaction by 25%,
both of which were achieved. The ESIP replaced the BT Employee Share Ownership Scheme which operated for
employee proﬁt sharing until 2001.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) for employees in the US enables participants to purchase
ADSs quarterly at a price (the Base Option Price) which is 85% of the market price of an ADS at the start of the
offer (and in the case of employees who have joined the ESPP after the start of the offer, 85% of the market price
on the date of joining, whichever is higher). At 15 May 2003, 69,164 shares have been issued under the BT Group
ESPP. As the ADS price has been less than the Base Option Price since the date of the quarterly purchase in July
2002 the ESPP has been suspended until the ADS price rises above the Base Option Price.
Notes to the financial statements
120 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 35. Auditors
The auditors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2003 for the group was £2,943,000 (2002 –
£2,702,000, 2001 – £3,639,000). The audit fees payable to the company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (and formerly PricewaterhouseCoopers), for the company and UK subsidiary undertakings’ statutory accounts
were £1,910,000 (2002 – £1,656,000, 2001 – £2,100,000). The audit fee of the company was £31,000
(2002 – £44,000).
The following fees for non-audit services were paid or are payable to the company’s auditors,

In addition, fees of £1,586,000 were paid or are payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the year ended
31 March 2003 (2002 – £2,540,000, 2001 – £3,025,000) in respect of audit and other services to the company’s
subsidiary undertakings outside the UK.
Total fees paid or payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for all services in the year ended 31 March 2003
were £12,476,000 (2002 – £26,879,000, 2001 – £21,348,000).
In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what
non audit services can be provided by the company’s external auditors and the approval processes related to
them. Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there
are clear efﬁciencies and value added beneﬁts to the company.
Under the terms of BT’s main licence the group is required to publish audited regulatory ﬁnancial statements.
The fees for regulatory work principally reﬂect the audit fees associated with those regulatory ﬁnancial
statements. The fees for tax services include tax compliance and tax advisory services. The fees for systems advice
in the year ended 31 March 2003 related to advisory services provided in connection with the implementation
of certain billing systems. These services, which were provided by PwC Consulting, the consulting business
of PricewaterhouseCoopers that was sold to IBM in October 2002, commenced in the prior year and are
now completed.
36. Financial instruments and risk management
The group holds or issues ﬁnancial instruments mainly to ﬁnance its operations; for the temporary investment
of short-term funds; and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its
sources of ﬁnance. In addition, various ﬁnancial instruments – for example trade debtors and trade creditors –
arise directly from the group’s operations.
The group ﬁnances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained proﬁts, deferred
taxation, long-term loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes.
The group borrows in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies. Typically, but not exclusively,
the bond markets provide the most cost-effective means of long-term borrowing. The group uses derivative
ﬁnancial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in interest and foreign
exchange rates. The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, gilt locks, currency swaps
and forward currency contracts.
The types of ﬁnancial instrument used for investment of short-term funds are prescribed in group treasury
policies with limits on the exposure to any one organisation. Short-term investing in ﬁnancial instruments is
undertaken on behalf of the group by substantial external fund managers who are limited to dealing in debt
instruments and certain deﬁned derivative instruments and are given strict guidelines on credit, diversiﬁcation
and maturity proﬁles.
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the group’s net debt reduced from £13.7 billion to £9.6 billion.
£2.6 billion was realised from the disposal of the group’s interest in Cegetel Groupe SA in the year, and the group
has closed out £2.6 billion of associated ﬁxed interest rate swaps. The group’s ﬁxed:ﬂoating interest rate proﬁle
therefore remains at 88:12 at 31 March 2003.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 121 36. Financial instruments and risk management continued
During the year ended 31 March 2002, net debt was reduced from £27.9 billion to £13.7 billion mainly by
the group’s rights issue, disposal of its Yell business, its Japanese and Spanish interests, and the property sale
and leaseback transaction. The proceeds of the rights issue and sale of assets were applied mainly in reducing
short-term borrowings. The group repaid substantially all of its medium-term notes and commercial paper in that
year. As a result of the demerger of the mmO
2
business including its European operations, the group swapped an
additional e7 billion into ﬂoating rate sterling debt. This, in conjunction with the novation of £1 billion ﬁxed rate
swaps to Telereal for the property transaction, enabled the group to maintain its ﬁxed:ﬂoating ratio
at approximately 88:12 at 31 March 2002.
During the year ended 31 March 2001, net debt increased from £8.7 billion to £27.9 billion mainly as a result
of the group making acquisitions of businesses and third-generation mobile licences. This increase in debt was
funded primarily by the issuance of long-term debt together with use of the group’s medium-term note
programme. As a result of this, together with the group’s interest rate swap activity, the borrowing proﬁle
changed during that year from one mainly at ﬂoating rates to one with a ﬁxed: ﬂoating rate ratio of
approximately 70:30. This change was in line with the group’s intention to limit the group’s exposure to interest
rate increases given the substantial size of the group’s debt portfolio at the time. During the second quarter
of the year ended 31 March 2001, it was not practical for the group to issue longer-term debt in the global capital
markets. The group therefore pre-hedged its desired ﬁxed rate proﬁle by transacting £9.3 billion of interest rate
swaps with maturities ranging from ﬁve to 30 years at a weighted average ﬁxed interest payable rate of 6.2%.
The group uses ﬁnancial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from its non-UK assets,
liabilities and forward purchase commitments. The group also hedges some of its interest liabilities. The ﬁnancial
instruments used comprise borrowings in foreign currencies, forward foreign currency exchange contracts,
gilt locks and interest and currency swaps.
There has been no change in the nature of the group’s risk proﬁle between 31 March 2003 and the date
of these ﬁnancial statements.
The notional amounts of derivatives summarised below do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by
the parties and, thus, are not necessarily a measure of the exposure of the group through its use of derivatives.
The amounts exchanged are calculated on the notional amounts and other terms of the derivatives which relate to
interest and exchange rates.
(a) Interest rate risk management
The group has entered into interest rate swap agreements with banks and other institutions to vary the amounts
and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are ﬁxed. Under interest rate swaps, the group agrees with
other parties to exchange, at speciﬁed intervals, the differences between ﬁxed rate and ﬂoating rate interest
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. Under gilt locks, forward sales of UK
government long-dated treasury stock were entered into for periods of up to one year. This hedge effectively ﬁxed
in the interest on part of the group’s then future borrowings, all of which have now been taken on.
At 31 March 2003, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements having a total notional principal
amount of £5,170 million (2002 – £7,870 million).
(b) Foreign exchange risk management
Cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign
currency exposure on the group’s operations and the group’s net assets. The group also enters into forward
foreign exchange contracts to hedge investments, interest expense and purchase and sale commitments
denominated in foreign currencies (principally US dollars and the euro). The remaining terms of the currency
swaps are up to 30 years and the terms of currency forward exchange contracts are typically less than one year.
The purpose of the group’s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that
the eventual net inﬂows and net outﬂows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
At 31 March 2003, the group had outstanding foreign currency swap agreements and forward exchange
contracts having a total notional principal amount of £14,545 million (2002 – £16,670 million).
The fair values of forward foreign currency contracts at 31 March 2003 were £673 million (2002 – £864
million) for purchases of currency and £1,041 million (2002 – £1,582 million) for sales of currency. These fair
values have been estimated by calculating their present values using the market discount rates, appropriate to
the terms of the contracts, in effect at the balance sheet dates.
At 31 March 2003, the group had deferred unrealised gains of £2 million (2002 – £1 million) and losses of
£nil (2002 – £13 million), based on dealer-quoted prices, from hedging purchase and sale commitments, and in
addition had deferred realised net gains of £10 million (2002 – £20 million). These are included in the proﬁt and
loss account as part of the hedged purchase or sale transaction when it is recognised, or as gains or losses when
a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur.
Notes to the financial statements
122 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 36. Financial instruments and risk management continued
(c) Concentrations of credit risk and credit exposures of ﬁnancial instruments
The group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk. The group, however, is exposed
to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to ﬁnancial instruments, but does not
expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The group limits the amount of credit exposure to any
one counterparty. The group does not normally see the need to seek collateral or other security.
The long-term debt instruments issued in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants that
if the group credit rating was downgraded below A3 in the case of Moody’s or below A minus in the case of S&P,
additional interest would accrue from the next interest coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points for
each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency. In May 2001, Moody’s downgraded BT’s credit rating
to Baa1, which increased BT’s interest charge by approximately £32 million per annum. BT’s current credit rating
from S&P is A minus. Based upon the total debt of £12 billion outstanding on these instruments at 31 March
2003, BT’s annual interest charge would increase by approximately £60 million if BT’s credit ratings were to
be downgraded by one credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa1/A minus.
If BT’s credit rating with Moody’s was to be upgraded by one credit rating category the annual interest charge
would be reduced by approximately £30 million.
(d) Fair value of ﬁnancial instruments
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the group’s ﬁnancial instruments at 31 March
2003 and 2002. The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings,
with the exception of derivative amounts, which are included in debtors or other creditors or as part of net debt
as appropriate. The fair values of the ﬁnancial instruments are the amount at which the instruments could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in forced or liquidation sale.

Currency exposures
The table below shows the currency exposures of the group’s net monetary assets (liabilities), in terms of those

Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the group that are not denominated in
the operating (or ‘‘functional’’) currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings
treated as hedges of net investments in non-UK operations. At 31 March, these exposures were as follows:

value of £68 million.
Unused committed lines of credit
Unused committed lines of credit for short-term ﬁnancing available at 31 March 2003 totalled approximately

126 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 127
The United States Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles are divided into
the following sections:
128 Differences between United Kingdom and
United States generally accepted
accounting principles
130 Net income and shareholders’ equity
reconciliation statements
131 Minority interests
131 Accounting for share options
131 Consolidated statements of cash ﬂows
132 Current asset investments
132 Pension costs
134 US GAAP developments The group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the UK (UK GAAP), which differ in certain respects from those applicable in the US (US GAAP).
I Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles
The following are the main differences between UK and US GAAP which are relevant to the group’s
ﬁnancial statements.
(a) Sale and leaseback of properties
Under UK GAAP, the sale of BT’s property portfolio is treated as a ﬁxed asset disposal and the subsequent
leaseback is an operating lease. Under US GAAP, the transaction is regarded as ﬁnancing and the land and
buildings are recorded on the balance sheet at their net book value, an obligation equivalent to the cash proceeds
is recognised and the gain on disposal is deferred until the properties are vacated by BT. Rental payments made
by BT are reversed and replaced by a ﬁnance lease interest charge and a depreciation charge.
(b) Pension costs
Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice No. 24, costs being charged against proﬁts over employees’ working lives. Under US GAAP, pension
costs are determined in accordance with the requirements of US Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) Nos. 87 and 88. Differences between the UK and US GAAP ﬁgures arise from the requirement to use
different actuarial methods and assumptions and a different method of amortising surpluses or deﬁcits.
(c) Accounting for redundancies
Under UK GAAP, the cost of providing incremental pension beneﬁts in respect of workforce reductions is taken
into account when determining current and future pension costs, unless the most recent actuarial valuation,
combined with the provision for pension costs in the group balance sheet, under UK actuarial conventions, shows
a deﬁcit. In this case, the cost of providing incremental pension beneﬁts is included in redundancy charges in
the year in which the employees agree to leave the group.
Under US GAAP, the associated costs of providing incremental pension beneﬁts are charged against proﬁts
in the period in which the termination terms are agreed with the employees.
(d) Capitalisation of interest
Under UK GAAP, the group does not capitalise interest in its ﬁnancial statements. To comply with US GAAP,
the estimated amount of interest incurred whilst constructing major capital projects is included in ﬁxed assets,
and depreciated over the lives of the related assets. This included capitalisation of interest incurred on funding
the 3G licences up to the date of the demerger. The amount of interest capitalised is determined by reference
to the average interest rates on outstanding borrowings. At 31 March 2003 under US GAAP, gross capitalised
interest of £461 million (2002 – £330 million) with regard to the company and its subsidiary companies was
subject to depreciation generally over periods of 3 to 25 years.
(e) Goodwill
Under UK GAAP, in respect of acquisitions completed prior to 1 April 1998, the group wrote off goodwill arising
from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures on acquisition against retained
earnings. The goodwill is reﬂected in the net income of the period of disposal, as part of the calculation of the gain
or loss on divestment. All unamortised and pre-April 1998 goodwill will be brought back to the proﬁt and loss
account on disposal. Following the implementation of UK Financial Reporting Standard No. 10 (FRS 10), goodwill
arising on acquisitions completed after 1 April 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its
useful economic life.
Under US GAAP up to 31 March 2002, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint
ventures was capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful life. With effect from 1 April 2002
BT has adopted SFAS No. 142, and goodwill is no longer amortised but tested annually for impairment.
In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 transitional and annual impairment reviews were performed.
There was no transitional impairment charge recorded. As a result of the annual impairment review, a goodwill
impairment charge of £54 million has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2003. Goodwill of £20 million
amortised under UK GAAP is written back through the income statement.
(f) Mobile cellular telephone licences, software and other intangible assets
Certain intangible ﬁxed assets recognised under US GAAP purchase accounting requirements are subsumed
within goodwill under UK GAAP. Under US GAAP these separately identiﬁed intangible assets are valued and
amortised over their useful lives of 20 years.
(g) Financial instruments
Under UK GAAP, investments are held on the balance sheet at historical cost, and own shares held in trust for
share schemes are recorded in ﬁxed asset investments. Gains and losses on instruments used for hedges are not
128 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles I Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles continued
recognised until the exposure being hedged is recognised. Under US GAAP, trading securities and available-for-
sale securities are carried at market value with appropriate valuation adjustments recorded in proﬁt and loss and
shareholders’ equity, respectively.
Certain derivative ﬁnancial instruments which qualify for hedge accounting under UK GAAP do not qualify for
hedge accounting under US GAAP. Under US GAAP, ﬁnancial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting
due to the extensive documentation requirements. These ﬁnancial instruments, under US GAAP, are carried
at market value with valuation adjustments recorded in the proﬁt and loss account. The reassessment and
purchase of derivatives in the year ended 31 March 2003 gave rise to an adjustment increasing net income by
£610 million net of tax (2002 – reduction £20 million). The net unrealised holding gain on available-for-sale
securities for the year ended 31 March 2003 was £22 million (2002 – £271 million, 2001 – £8 million). SFAS 133
became effective for BT on 1 April 2001 and the unamortised transitional adjustment of £26 million net of tax
remains in shareholders’ equity at 31 March 2003.
(h) Deferred gain
Under UK GAAP, assets contributed to a joint venture by the group’s partners are measured at their net
replacement cost. Any difference between the group’s share of the joint venture’s resulting net assets and the net
book value of assets contributed by the group to the joint venture, including certain accrued start up costs, is
immediately reﬂected by adjusting the group’s investment in the joint venture and recording a deferred difference
in shareholders’ equity. Under US GAAP, the assets contributed by all joint venture partners are carried at their
historical net book value and any difference between the group’s share of the joint venture’s resulting net assets
and the net book value of assets contributed by the group to the joint venture is amortised over the life of
the items giving rise to the difference.
(i) Employee share plans
Certain share options have been granted under BT save-as-you-earn plans at a 20% discount. Under UK GAAP,
the share issues are recorded at their discounted price when the options are exercised. Under US GAAP, a plan
is considered compensatory when the discount to market price is in excess of 15%. Compensation cost is
recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market price
of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
Under UK GAAP, shares held by employee share ownership trusts are recorded as ﬁxed asset investments
at cost less amounts written off. Under US GAAP, those shares not fully vested are regarded as treasury stock
and recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity.
(j) Investments in associates
Under UK GAAP, the economic interest in the associates’ operating proﬁts before minority interest is reported as
part of the total operating proﬁt. For those associates in whom a minority interest is recognised in their respective
statements of proﬁt and loss, such minority interest is reported as minority interest in the consolidated proﬁt and
loss account. Under US GAAP, the minority interest in the associates is reclassiﬁed from minority interest and
reported within the share of results of associates.
(k) Deferred taxation
Under UK GAAP, provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability or asset arose as a result of transactions
that had occurred by the balance sheet date and give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right
to pay less tax in the future. Under US GAAP, deferred taxation is provided for on a full liability basis. Future
tax beneﬁts are recognised as deferred tax assets to the extent that their realisation is more likely than not.
As a result of changes in circumstances, previously recognised deferred tax liabilities have been released in
the 2003 ﬁnancial year. At 31 March 2003 total deferred tax liabilities were £2,806 million primarily in respect
of accelerated capital allowances and total deferred tax assets were £2,491 million, primarily in respect of
pension obligations.
(l) Dividends
Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the year in respect of which they are declared (in the case of interim or
any special dividends) or proposed by the board of directors to the shareholders (in the case of ﬁnal dividends).
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which dividends are declared.
(m) Impairment
Under UK GAAP, if there is an indication of impairment the assets should be tested for impairment and,
if necessary written down to the value in use, calculated based on discounted future pre-tax cash ﬂows related
to the asset or the income generating unit to which the asset belongs.
US GAAP requires that an entity assess whether impairment has occurred based on the undiscounted future
cash ﬂows. An impairment loss exists if the sum of these cash ﬂows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.
The impairment loss recognised in the income statement is based on the asset’s fair value, being either market
value or the sum of discounted future cash ﬂows.
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 129 I Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles continued
(n) Discontinued operations
Under UK GAAP, the disposal of certain lines of business and joint ventures and associates are shown as
discontinued activities. Under US GAAP, only the disposals of lines of business under SFAS No. 144 would be
reported as discontinued operations.
(o) Directories in progress
Under UK GAAP, the cost of classiﬁed advertising directories in progress deferred in stock represents direct ﬁxed
and variable costs as well as directly attributable overhead costs. Under US GAAP, the deferred costs associated
with directories in progress comprise only the incremental direct costs associated with selling and creating
the directories. Directories in progress acquired in a business purchase are valued at replacement value under
UK GAAP and at retail value under US GAAP. Under UK GAAP, this difference is included in goodwill.
(p) Disposals of businesses
There are timing differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP for recognition of gains on the sale of certain
businesses. Foreign exchange movements taken to reserves under UK GAAP are reported in the income
statement under US GAAP. Historical GAAP differences on disposed businesses are also shown under this
line item.
(q) Property rationalisation provision
Under UK GAAP in the 2003 ﬁnancial year, a provision in connection with the rationalisation of the Group’s
London ofﬁce property portfolio was recognised. Under US GAAP, in accordance with SFAS No 146, these costs
are not recognised until the group fully exits and therefore ceases to use the affected properties.
II Net income and shareholders’ equity reconciliation statements
The following statements summarise the material estimated adjustments, gross of their tax effect, which reconcile
net income and shareholders’ equity from that reported under UK GAAP to that which would have been reported
had US GAAP been applied.

In the 2003 ﬁnancial year all the adjustments relate to continuing operations (2002 – £2,009 million
reduction, 2001 – £823 million reduction). Net income from continuing operations was £4,134 million
(2002 – £1,680 million loss, 2001 – £809 million).
The adjustments to net income relating to discontinued operations are £nil (2002 – £282 million,
2001 – £276 million).

III Minority interests
Under US GAAP, the income to minority interests would have been reduced by £27 million (2002 – £26 million,
2001 – £122 million) after adjusting for goodwill amortisation and accounting for associates and joint ventures.
Net assets attributable to minority interests would have been unchanged (2002 – £26 million higher) after
adjusting for ﬁnancial instruments.
IV Accounting for share options
Under UK GAAP, the company does not recognise compensation expense for the fair value, at the date of grant,
of share options granted under the employee share option schemes. Under US GAAP, the company adopted
the disclosure-only provisions in SFAS No. 123 ‘‘Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation’’. Accordingly,
the company accounts for share options in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 ‘‘Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees’’, under which no compensation expense is recognised. Had the group expensed recognised
compensation cost for options granted in accordance with SFAS No. 123, the group’s pro forma net income
(loss), basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share under US GAAP would have been
£4,127 million (2002 – £792 million loss, 2001 – £2,419 million loss), 47.9p (2002 – 9.5p loss, 2001 – 33.2p
loss) and 47.6p (2002 – 9.5p loss, 2001 – 33.2p loss), respectively. The SFAS No. 123 method of accounting
does not apply to share options granted before 1 January 1995, and accordingly, the resulting pro forma
compensation costs may not be representative of that to be expected in future years. See note 34 for the SFAS
No. 123 disclosures of the fair value of options granted under employee schemes at date of grant.
V Consolidated statements of cash ﬂows
Under UK GAAP, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented in accordance with UK Financial
Reporting Standard No. 1 (FRS 1). The statements prepared under FRS 1 present substantially the same
information as that required under SFAS No. 95.
Under SFAS No. 95 cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term investments with maturities
of three months or less at the date of purchase. Under FRS 1 cash comprises cash in hand and at bank and
overnight deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
Under FRS 1, cash ﬂows are presented for operating activities; returns on investments and servicing
of ﬁnance; taxation; capital expenditure and ﬁnancial investments; acquisitions and disposals; dividends paid to
the company’s shareholders; management of liquid resources and ﬁnancing. SFAS No. 95 requires a classiﬁcation
of cash ﬂows as resulting from operating, investing and ﬁnancing activities.
Cash ﬂows under FRS 1 in respect of interest received, interest paid (net of that capitalised under US GAAP)
and taxation would be included within operating activities under SFAS No. 95. Cash ﬂows from purchases, sales
and maturities of trading securities, while not separately identiﬁed under UK GAAP, would be included within
operating activities under US GAAP. Capitalised interest, while not recognised under UK GAAP, is included in
investing activities under US GAAP. Dividends paid are included within ﬁnancing activities under US GAAP.

VI Current asset investments
Under US GAAP, investments in debt securities would be classiﬁed as either trading, available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity. Trading investments would be stated at fair values and the unrealised gains and losses would be
included in income. Securities classiﬁed as available-for-sale would be stated at fair values, with unrealised gains
and losses, net of deferred taxes, reported in shareholders’ equity. Debt securities classiﬁed as held-to-maturity
would be stated at amortised cost. The following analyses do not include securities with original maturities of
less than three months.
At 31 March 2003, the group held trading investments (as deﬁned by US GAAP) with fair values totalling
£935 million (2002 – £1,260 million). Held-to-maturity securities at 31 March 2002 and 2003 consisted
of the following:

VII Pension costs
The following position for the main pension scheme is computed in accordance with US GAAP pension accounting
rules under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 88, the effect of which is shown in the above reconciliation statements.
The pension cost determined under SFAS No. 87 was calculated by reference to an expected long-term rate
of return on scheme assets of 6.9% (2002 – 6.5%, 2001 – 6.25%). The components of the pension cost for
the main pension scheme comprised:

United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 133 VIII US GAAP developments
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143 ‘‘Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations’’ which is applicable to ﬁnancial years commencing after 15 June 2002. SFAS No. 143
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognised in the period in which it is
incurred if it is possible to make a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The associated asset retirement costs are
required to be capitalised as part of the carrying value of the long lived asset. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is
not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, ‘‘Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities’’ which is applicable to disposals initialised after 31 December 2002. The Statement requires costs
associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognised when the costs are incurred rather than at the date
of the commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Accordingly, we have reﬂected the impact of SFAS No. 146 in the
2003 ﬁnancial year. SFAS No. 146 may apply to future activities which are not currently envisaged and
accordingly it is not possible to assess the impact of SFAS No. 146 on any such activities at this time.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, ‘‘Accounting for Stock Based Compensation – Transition
and Disclosure – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123’’ which is applicable to ﬁnancial years beginning
after 15 December 2002. The Statement permits two additional transition methods for an entity voluntarily
adopting fair value based accounting for stock based compensation. It also amends the disclosure requirements to
require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity’s accounting policy decisions
with respect to stock based employee compensation. This Statement does not have a signiﬁcant impact on
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as SFAS No. 123 continues to be satisﬁed for disclosure purposes only.
In April 2003 the FASB issued SFAS No 149 ‘‘Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities’’. This Statement amends and clariﬁes ﬁnancial accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as
derivatives) and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, ‘‘Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities’’. BT is currently evaluating the impact of this change.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 45, ‘‘Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others’’. FIN 45
requires that certain guarantees must be recognised at fair value. FIN 45 also requires disclosure of detailed
information about each guarantee or group of guarantees. The disclosure requirements are effective for ﬁnancial
statements ending after 15 December 2002. The recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are
applicable to guarantees issued or modiﬁed after 31 December 2002. FIN 45 could have an impact on the future
results of BT depending on guarantees issued; however, at this time the adoption of this statement did not have
a material impact on BT’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, ‘‘Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities – an Interpretation
of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51’’. FIN 46 requires the primary beneﬁciary to consolidate a variable
interest entity (VIE) if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses if they
occur, receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns if they occur, or both. FIN 46 applies
immediately to VIEs created after 31 January 2003, and to VIEs in which the entity obtains an interest after
that date. This statement is not expected to have a material impact on BT’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF 00-21, ‘‘Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables’’. The consensus addresses how to account for arrangements that may
involve multiple revenue-generating activities, for example, the delivery or performance of multiple products,
services, and/or rights to use assets. In applying this guidance, separate contracts with the same party, entered
into at or near the same time, will be presumed to be a package, and the consideration will be measured and
allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair values. This consensus guidance will be applicable to
agreements entered into after 15 June 2003. BT is currently evaluating the impact of this new pronouncement.
In January 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF 02-18, ‘‘Accounting for Subsequent Investments in
an Investee after Suspension of Equity Method Loss Recognition’’. This consensus states that if the additional
investment, in whole or in part, represents the funding of prior losses, the investor should recognise previously
suspended losses. When appropriate to recognise prior losses, the amount recognised would be limited to
the amount of the additional investment determined to represent the funding of prior losses. The consensus
is effective for additional investments made after 5 February 2003. This consensus is not expected to have
a material impact on BT’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 139 The business of BT is affected by a number of factors, not all of which are wholly within BT’s control. Although many
of the factors inﬂuencing BT’s performance are macro economic and likely to affect the performance of businesses
generally, some aspects of BT’s business make it particularly sensitive to certain areas of business risk. This section
highlights some of those speciﬁc areas. However, it does not purport to be an extensive analysis of the factors
affecting the business and some risks may be unknown to us and other risks, currently believed to be immaterial,
could turn out to be material. All of these could materially adversely affect our business, turnover, proﬁts, assets,
liquidity and capital resources. They should also be considered in connection with the forward looking statements
in this document and the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 142 of this document.
If BT’s activities are subject to signiﬁcant price controls, its market share, competitive position and future
proﬁtability may be affected
Most of BT’s ﬁxed network activities in the UK are subject to signiﬁcant regulatory controls. The controls regulate,
among other things, the prices BT may charge for many of its services and the extent to which it has to provide
services to its competitors. In recent years, the effect of these controls has been to cause BT to reduce its prices.
BT cannot assure its shareholders that the regulatory authorities will not increase the severity of the price controls,
nor extend the services to which controls apply (including any new services that BT may offer in the future), nor
extend the services which it has to provide its competitors. These controls may adversely affect BT’s market share,
the severity of competition and its future proﬁtability. Further details on the regulatory framework in which
BT operates can be found in ‘‘Business Review – regulation, competition and prices’’ on page 18 of this document.
BT faces strong competition in UK ﬁxed network services
BT continues to have a signiﬁcant market share in some aspects of UK ﬁxed network services. In particular, in the
2003 ﬁnancial year we estimate we had a market share of 73% of consumer calls and 45% of business calls in the UK
and approximately 81% of exchange lines in the UK were in the BT network as at 31 March 2003. Regulators have
promoted competition in this area by allowing BT’s competitors to site equipment in or adjacent to its exchanges
(local loop unbundling) and to make it easier for BT’s customers to route some or all of their calls over competitors’
networks (carrier pre-selection) and by the introduction of a wholesale access product. Reduction in BT’s market
share in the ﬁxed network may lead to a fall in BT’s turnover and an adverse effect on proﬁtability. Unlike its
competitors, BT continues to be obliged by the current regulatory regime to serve customers in the United Kingdom,
whether or not such provision of service is economic, and the two competitive measures described above may have
the effect of accelerating the diversion of its more proﬁtable existing customers without it being able to reduce its
costs commensurately. These changes in the regulatory environment and ensuing increased competition on its ﬁxed
network may cause adverse effects on its business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and prospects.
BT’s business is dependent on the ability to exploit technological advances quickly and successfully
BT operates in an industry with a recent history of fast technological changes. It expects that new products and
technologies will emerge and that existing products and technologies will develop further. BT needs to continually
develop its services and products to exploit those next generation technologies. However, BT cannot predict the actual
effect of these technological changes on its business or on its ability to provide competitive services. For example,
presently there is evidence of substitution by customers using mobile phones for day-to-day voice calls in place
of making such calls over the ﬁxed network. Additionally, some calls are now being routed over the internet in place
of the traditional switched network. If these trends accelerate, BT’s ﬁxed network assets may be used uneconomically
and its investment in these assets may not be recovered through proﬁts on ﬁxed-network calls and line rentals.
Impairment write-downs may be incurred and margins may decline if ﬁxed costs cannot be reduced in line with
falling turnover.
BT has targeted signiﬁcant growth in new business areas, such as broadband technology. In view of the likely
level of competition and uncertainties regarding the level of economic activity, there can be no certainty that BT
will meet these growth targets, with a consequential impact on future turnover and proﬁtability.
BT’s businesses may be adversely affected if their networks or systems experience any signiﬁcant failures
or interruptions
BT’s businesses are dependent on their ability to transfer substantial volumes of data speedily and without
interruption. Any signiﬁcant failure or interruption of such data transfer due to factors outside their control could
have a material adverse effect on the businesses and their results from operations. BT has a business continuity
strategy designed to deal with such catastrophic events, including major terrorist action, industrial action, extreme
virus attack, hurricane or ﬂooding, that may impact the ability to maintain an effective service to customers.
Any such strategy can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material loss and there can
be no assurance that material adverse events will not occur.
Declining investment returns may result in the funding cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme
becoming a signiﬁcant burden on the ﬁnancial resources of BT
The deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS), was closed to new members on 31 March 2001
and has been replaced by a deﬁned contribution scheme (BTRP). The latest full triennial actuarial valuation of the
BTPS was completed as at 31 December 2002. As a result, the schedule of contributions has been agreed with the
scheme trustees under which BT will make normal contributions of 12.2% of pensionable pay and annual deﬁciency
payments of £232 million. This will apply until the next triennial actuarial valuation is completed as at 31 December
2005. The results of future scheme valuations will be impacted by the future investment market performance,
interest rates and the general trend towards longer life expectancy, all of which are outside the control of BT. In the
event that investment returns decline, the cash funding cost to BT may increase and may have a signiﬁcant effect on
the ﬁnancial resources of BT.

Background
Telephone services in almost all of the UK were, until 1981, provided by the Post Ofﬁce, which was
a government department until 1969 when it was established as a state public corporation. In 1981,
the postal and telecommunications services of the Post Ofﬁce became the responsibility of two separate
corporations, with British Telecommunications – under the trading name of British Telecom – taking over
the telecommunications business.
As a result of the Telecommunications Act 1984, British Telecommunications plc was incorporated in England
and Wales under the Companies Acts 1948 to 1981 on 1 April 1984 as a public limited company wholly owned
by the UK Government. The transfer of property, rights and liabilities of the corporation to British
Telecommunications plc was made on 6 August 1984.
In November 1984, the UK Government offered 3,012 million ordinary shares (50.2% of the total issued
ordinary shares) to the public. The share sale was fully subscribed. British Telecom shares made their debut on
the London Stock Exchange on 3 December 1984. From April 1991, British Telecommunications plc traded as BT.
In December 1991, the UK Government sold over half its remaining shares in BT, retaining a holding of about
22%. It sold this residual holding in July 1993. Subsequently, in September 1997, the UK Government redeemed
at par a special rights redeemable preference share to which certain special rights attached.
In 1985, Cellnet was launched as a joint venture between British Telecom and Securicor, which held 40%
of the company. BT acquired full control of Cellnet (now O
2
UK – part of mmO
2
plc) by acquiring Securicor’s
minority holding in November 1999.
In January 2000, BT and AT&T established Concert as a 50/50 joint venture serving customers around
the world and transferred their trans-border assets and operations to Concert. On 1 April 2002, BT completed
the unwind of Concert, which involved the return of Concert’s businesses, customer accounts and networks
to the two parent companies.
BT Group was formed when the mmO
2
business, comprising what had been BT’s mobile activities in the UK,
the Netherlands, Germany and the Republic of Ireland, was demerged on 19 November 2001. British
Telecommunications plc’s shares ceased trading on the London, New York and Tokyo stock exchanges on
16 November 2001. BT Group plc’s shares commenced trading on the London and New York stock exchanges
on 19 November 2001.
BT Group was incorporated in England and Wales on 30 March 2001 as Newgate Telecommunications
Limited with the registered number 4190816. The company changed its name to BT Group plc on 11 September
Additional information for shareholders
142 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 2001. Following the demerger of mmO
2
in November 2001, the continuing activities of BT were transferred to
BT Group.
BT Group’s registered ofﬁce address is 81 Newgate Street, London EC1A 7AJ.

The pre-19 November 2001 prices shown have been adjusted for the rights issue and demerger that occurred in the 2002 ﬁnancial year.
The prices are the highest and lowest closing middle market prices for BT ordinary shares, as derived from the
Daily Ofﬁcial List of the London Stock Exchange and the highest and lowest sales prices of ADSs, as reported
on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar affect the dollar equivalent
of the pound sterling price of the company’s ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange and, as a result,
are likely to affect the market price of the ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange.
Capital gains tax (CGT)
The rights issue in June 2001 and the demerger of mmO
2
in November 2001 adjusted the value for capital gains
tax purposes of BT shares.
Rights issue
An explanatory note on the effects of the rights issue on the CGT position relating to BT shareholdings is available
from the Shareholder Helpline (see page 155).
Additional information for shareholders

– capital gains tax calculation
The conﬁrmed ofﬁcial opening prices for BT Group and mmO
2
shares on 19 November 2001 following the
demerger were 285.75p and 82.75p, respectively. This means that, of the total (combined) value of 368.50p,
77.544% is attributable to BT Group and 22.456% to mmO
2
. Accordingly, for CGT calculations, the base cost
of your BT Group shares and mmO

Dividends
Since shortly after its incorporation in 1984, British Telecommunications plc paid interim dividends annually
in February and ﬁnal dividends in September. However, as part of BT’s debt reduction and restructuring plans,
neither a ﬁnal dividend for the year ended 31 March 2001 nor an interim dividend for the year ended 31 March
2002 was paid to shareholders.
A ﬁnal dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2002, was paid on 9 September 2002 to shareholders
on the register on 9 August 2002, and an interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2003 was paid
on 10 February 2003 to shareholders on the register on 31 December 2002.
The dividends paid or payable on BT shares and ADSs for the last ﬁve years are shown in the following table.
The dividends on the ordinary shares exclude the associated tax credit. The amounts shown are not those that
were actually paid to holders of ADSs. For the tax treatment of dividends paid on or after 6 April 1999 see
Taxation of dividends below. The dividends on the ADSs paid before 5 April 1999 include the associated UK
tax credit available to certain beneﬁcial owners who are resident in the United States or Canada for tax purposes,
but before deduction of UK withholding taxes. Dividends have been translated from pounds sterling into US dollars
using exchange rates prevailing on the date the ordinary dividends were paid.

Qualifying holders of ADSs on record as of 8 August 2003 are entitled to receive the ﬁnal dividend which will be paid on 15 September 2003, subject
to approval at the annual general meeting. The US dollar amount of the ﬁnal dividend of 42.5 pence per ADS to be paid to holders of ADSs will be based
on the exchange rate in effect on 8 September 2003, the date of payment to holders of ordinary shares.
As dividends paid by the company are in pounds sterling, exchange rate ﬂuctuations will affect the US dollar
amounts received by holders of ADSs on conversion by the Depositary of such cash dividends.
Dividend mandate
Any shareholder wishing dividends to be paid directly into a bank or building society account should contact
the Registrar for a dividend mandate form. Dividends paid in this way will be paid through the Bankers
Automated Clearing System (BACS). Alternatively, a form may be downloaded from the internet at
www.bt.com/investorcentre.
Dividend investment plan
The dividend investment plan replaced the share dividend plan for shareholders following the 1999 interim
dividend. Under the dividend investment plan, cash from participants’ dividends is used to buy further BT Group
shares in the market.
Shareholders could elect to receive additional shares in lieu of a cash dividend for the following dividends:
Date paid Price per share pence

Additional information for shareholders
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 145 Total shareholder return
Total shareholder return (TSR) is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders,
reﬂecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. It is, therefore, a good indicator of
a company’s overall performance.
Over the last ﬁve years (as shown in the TSR chart below), BT initially performed very strongly, but, like many
stocks in the telecoms, media and technology (TMT) sector, suffered falls in its share price during the decline of
the past three years. BT’s TSR (as adjusted for the rights issue and demerger) over the last ﬁve years was
negative 63% compared to a FTSE 100 TSR fall of negative 32%. Substantially all of the ﬁve-year negative FTSE
performance has occurred over the past year (negative 29%) whereas BT’s TSR in the last 12 months was
negative 43%.
In the period between the demerger on 19 November 2001 and 31 March 2003, BT’s share price was roughly
in line with the European telecommunications sector after outperforming for most of the period. BT and the
European telecommunications sector have both under-performed the FTSE 100 index by around 10% (as shown
in the share price performance chart), over the 16 month period.

Memorandum and Articles of Association
The following is a summary of the principal provisions of BT’s memorandum and articles of association
(‘‘Memorandum’’ and ‘‘Articles’’), a copy of which has been ﬁled with the Registrar of Companies.
Memorandum
The Memorandum provides that its principal objects are, among other things, to carry on any business of running,
operating, managing and supplying telecommunication systems and systems of any kind for conveying, receiving,
storing, processing or transmitting sounds, visual images, signals, messages and communications of any kind.
Articles
In the following description of the rights attaching to the shares in the company, a ‘‘holder of shares’’ and a
‘‘shareholder’’ is, in either case, the person entered on the company’s register of members as the holder
of the relevant shares. Shareholders can choose whether their shares are to be evidenced by share certiﬁcates
(i.e. in certiﬁcated form) or held in electronic (i.e. uncertiﬁcated) form in CREST (the electronic settlement
system in the UK).
(a) Voting rights
Subject to the restrictions described below, on a show of hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy
at any general meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote
for each share which they hold.
Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman
of the meeting or by at least ﬁve shareholders at the meeting who are entitled to vote (or their proxies), or by one
or more shareholders at the meeting who are entitled to vote (or their proxies) and who have, between them,
at least 10% of the total votes of all shareholders who have the right to vote at the meeting.
No person is, unless the Board decide otherwise, entitled to attend or vote at any general meeting or to
exercise any other right conferred by being a shareholder if he or any person appearing to be interested in
those shares has been sent a notice under section 212 of the Companies Act 1985 (which confers upon public
companies the power to require information with respect to interests in their voting shares) and he or any
interested person has failed to supply to the company the information requested within 14 days after delivery
of that notice. These restrictions end seven days after the earlier of the date the shareholder complies with
the request satisfactorily or the company receives notice that there has been an approved transfer of the shares.
(b) Variation of rights
Whenever the share capital of the company is split into different classes of shares, the special rights attached to
any of those classes can be varied or withdrawn either:
(i) with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares
of that class; or
(ii) with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class.
At any separate meeting, the necessary quorum is two persons holding or representing by proxy not less than
one-third in nominal amount of the issued shares of the class in question (but at any adjourned meeting, any
person holding shares of the class or his proxy is a quorum).
Additional information for shareholders
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 147 The company can issue new shares and attach any rights and restrictions to them, as long as this is not restricted
by special rights previously given to holders of any existing shares. Subject to this, the rights of new shares can
take priority over the rights of existing shares, or existing shares can take priority over them, or the new shares
and the existing shares can rank equally.
(c) Changes in capital
The company may by ordinary resolution:
(i) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger amount;
(ii) divide all or part of its share capital into shares of a smaller amount;
(iii) cancel any shares which have not, at the date of the ordinary resolution, been taken or agreed to be taken
by any person and reduce the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares cancelled; and
(iv) increase its share capital.
The company may also:
(i) buy back its own shares; and
(ii) by special resolution reduce its share capital, any capital redemption reserve and any share premium account.
(d) Dividends
The company’s shareholders can declare dividends by passing an ordinary resolution provided that no dividend
can exceed the amount recommended by the directors. Dividends must be paid out of proﬁts available for
distribution. If the directors consider that the proﬁts of the company justify such payments, they can pay interim
dividends on any class of shares of the amounts and on the dates and for the periods they decide. Fixed dividends
will be paid on any class of shares on the dates stated for the payments of those dividends.
The directors can offer ordinary shareholders the right to choose to receive new ordinary shares, which are
credited as fully paid, instead of some or all of their cash dividend. Before they can do this, the company’s
shareholders must have passed an ordinary resolution authorising the directors to make this offer.
Any dividend which has not been claimed for 10 years after it was declared or became due for payment will
be forfeited and will belong to the company unless the directors decide otherwise.
(e) Distribution of assets on winding up
If the company is wound up (whether the liquidation is voluntary, under supervision of the court or by the court)
the liquidator can, with the authority of an extraordinary resolution passed by the shareholders, divide among the
shareholders all or any part of the assets of the company. This applies whether the assets consist of property
of one kind or different kinds. For this purpose, the liquidator can place whatever value the liquidator considers
fair on any property and decide how the division is carried out between shareholders or different groups of
shareholders. The liquidator can also, with the same authority, transfer any assets to trustees upon any trusts for
the beneﬁt of shareholders which the liquidator decides. The liquidation of the company can then be ﬁnalised and
the company dissolved. No past or present shareholder can be compelled to accept any shares or other property
under the Articles which could give them a liability.
(f) Transfer of shares
Certiﬁcated shares of the company may be transferred in writing either by an instrument of transfer in the usual
standard form or in another form approved by the Board. The transfer form must be signed or made effective by
or on behalf of the person making the transfer. The person making the transfer will be treated as continuing to be
the holder of the shares transferred until the name of the person to whom the shares are being transferred is
entered in the register of members of the company.
The Board may refuse to register any transfer of any share held in certiﬁcated form:
& which is in favour of more than four joint holders; or
& unless the transfer form to be registered is properly stamped to show payment of any applicable stamp duty
and delivered to the company’s registered ofﬁce or any other place the Board decide. The transfer must have with
it the share certiﬁcate for the shares to be transferred; any other evidence which the Board ask for to prove that
the person wanting to make the transfer is entitled to do this; and if the transfer form is executed by another
person on behalf of the person making the transfer, evidence of the authority of that person to do so.
Transfers of uncertiﬁcated shares must be carried out using a relevant system (as deﬁned in the Uncertiﬁcated
Securities Regulations 1995 (the Regulations)). The Board can refuse to register a transfer of an uncertiﬁcated
share in the circumstances stated in the Regulations.
If the Board decide not to register a transfer of a share, they must notify the person to whom that share was
to be transferred no later than two months after the company receives the transfer or instruction from the
operator of the relevant system.
The Board can decide to suspend the registration of transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the register
of shareholders. The register must not be closed without the consent of the operator of a relevant system (as
deﬁned in the Regulations) in the case of uncertiﬁcated shares.
Additional information for shareholders
148 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 (g) Untraced shareholders
BT may sell any shares after advertising its intention and waiting for three months if the shares have been in issue
for at least 10 years, during that period at least three dividends have become payable on them and have not been
claimed and BT has not heard from the shareholder or any person entitled to the dividends by transmission.
The net sale proceeds belong to BT, but it must pay those proceeds to the former shareholder or the person
entitled to them by transmission if that shareholder, or that other person, asks for them.
(h) General meetings of shareholders
Every year the company must hold an annual general meeting. The Board can call an extraordinary general
meeting at any time and, under general law, must call one on a shareholders’ requisition.
(i) Limitations on rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders
The only limitation imposed by the Articles on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders is that
a shareholder whose registered address is outside the UK and who wishes to receive notices of meetings of
shareholders or documents from BT must give the company an address within the UK to which they may be sent.
(j) Directors
Directors’ remuneration
Excluding remuneration referred to below, each director will be paid such fees for his services as the Board
decide, not exceeding £50,000 a year and increasing by the percentage increase of the UK Retail Prices Index
(as deﬁned by Section 833(2) Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) for any 12-month period beginning
1 April 1999 or an anniversary of that date. The company may by ordinary resolution decide on a higher sum.
This resolution can increase the fee paid to all or any directors either permanently or for a particular period.
The directors may be paid their expenses properly incurred in connection with the business of the company.
The Board can award extra fees to a director who holds an executive position; acts as chairman or deputy
chairman; serves on a Board committee at the request of the Board; or performs any other services which
the Board consider extend beyond the ordinary duties of a director.
The directors may grant pensions or other beneﬁts to, among others, any director or former director
or persons connected with them. However, BT can only provide these beneﬁts to any director or former director
who has not been an employee or held any other ofﬁce or executive position in the company or any of its
subsidiary undertakings, or to relations or dependants of, or people connected to, those directors or former
directors, if the shareholders approve this by passing an ordinary resolution.
Directors’ votes
A director need not be a shareholder, but a director who is not a shareholder can still attend and speak
at shareholders’ meetings.
Unless the Articles say otherwise, a director cannot vote on a resolution about a contract in which the director
has a material interest (this will also apply to interests of a person connected with the director). The director
can vote if the interest is only an interest in BT shares, debentures or other securities. A director can, however,
vote and be counted in a quorum in respect of certain matters in which he is interested as set out in the Articles.
Subject to the relevant legislation, the shareholders can by passing an ordinary resolution suspend or relax,
among other things, the provisions relating to the interest of a director in any contract or arrangement or relating
to a director’s right to vote and be counted in a quorum on resolutions in which he is interested to any extent or
ratify any particular contract carried out in breach of those provisions.
Directors’ interests
If the legislation allows and the director has disclosed the nature and extent of the interest to the Board,
the director can:
(i) have any kind of interest in a contract with or involving BT (or in which BT has an interest or with or involving
another company in which BT has an interest);
(ii) have any kind of interest in a company in which BT has an interest (including holding a position in that
company or being a shareholder of that company);
(iii) hold a position (other than auditor) in BT or another company in which BT has an interest on terms and
conditions decided by the Board; and
(iv) alone (or through some ﬁrm with which the director is associated) do paid professional work (other than
as auditor) for BT or another company in which BT has an interest on terms and conditions decided
by the Board.
A director does not have to hand over to BT any beneﬁt received or proﬁt made as a result of anything permitted
to be done under the Articles.
When a director knows that they are interested in a contract with BT they must tell the other directors.
Additional information for shareholders
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 149 Retirement of directors
Provisions of the legislation which, read with the Articles, would prevent a person from being or becoming
a director because that person has reached the age of 70 do not apply to the company.
At every annual general meeting any director who was elected or last re-elected a director at or before
the annual general meeting held in the third year before the current year, shall retire by rotation. Any director
appointed by the directors automatically retires at the next following annual general meeting. A retiring
director is eligible for re-election.
Directors’ borrowing powers
To the extent that the legislation and the Articles allow, the Board can exercise all the powers of the company
to borrow money, to mortgage or charge its business, property and assets (present and future) and to issue
debentures and other securities, and give security either outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability
or obligation of the company or another person. The Board must limit the borrowings of the company and
exercise all the company’s voting and other rights or powers of control exercisable by the company in relation to
its subsidiary undertakings so as to ensure that the aggregate amount of all borrowings by the group outstanding,
net of amounts borrowed intra-group among other things, at any time does not exceed £35 billion.
Material contracts
The following contracts (not being contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business) have been entered
into in the two years preceding the date of this document by BT or another member of the group and are, or
may be, material to the group or have been entered into by BT or another member of the group and contain
a provision under which a member of the group has an obligation or entitlement which is, or may be, material
to BT or such other member of the group.
Airtel
A sale and purchase agreement dated 2 May 2001 between BT (Netherlands) Holdings BV, a subsidiary of BT
and Vodafone, under which the BT subsidiary agreed to sell its entire interest in Airtel Mo ´vil, S.A. to Vodafone.
The sale was completed on 29 June 2001 for a consideration of £1.1 billion (paid in Euros).
Yell
On 25 May 2001, the following agreements were entered into, under which BT agreed to sell its classiﬁed
advertising directory businesses in the UK and the USA:
(i) umbrella agreement between Yell Ltd, BT Holdings Ltd, Yellow Pages BV, Marchprobe Ltd, Castaim Ltd,
Yasmin Two (US) Inc. and BT;
(ii) UK share sale agreement between BT Holdings Ltd and Marchprobe Ltd under which BT Holdings Ltd agreed
to sell the share capital of Yellow Pages Sales Ltd to Marchprobe Ltd;
(iii) UK business sale agreement between Yell Ltd, Castaim Ltd and Yasmin Two (US) Inc. under which Yell Ltd
agreed to sell Yell Ltd’s business and assets to Castaim Ltd and to sell Yell Ltd’s US intellectual property
rights to Yasmin Two (US) Inc; and
(iv) US share sale agreement between Yellow Pages BV and Yasmin Two (US) Inc. under which Yellow Pages BV
agreed to sell the share capital of Yellow Book USA, Inc. to Yasmin Two (US) Inc.
The umbrella agreement sets out the common terms which apply to the UK share sale agreement, the UK
business sale agreement and the US share sale agreement. The umbrella agreement contains covenants
restricting any member of the group from carrying on a competing printed classiﬁed directories business for
twelve months from completion.
The share sale and business agreements contain standard warranties and indemnities in favour of Marchprobe
Ltd, Castaim Ltd and Yasmin Two (US) Inc. The warranties expired on 30 June 2002.
As part of the consideration under the UK business sale agreement, Castaim Ltd also assumed responsibility
for certain liabilities and obligations of the Yell business.
The sale of Yell was completed on 22 June 2001 for a consideration of £2.14 billion, comprising (i) £2 million
as consideration for the issued shares of Yellow Pages Sales Ltd; (ii) £1,288 million in cash plus £100 million in
interest bearing vendor loan notes and £100 million in deferred consideration (subject to reduction on
ascertainment of the net assets) as consideration for the assets of Yell Ltd; (iii) £1 as consideration for the US
intellectual property rights; and (iv) £650 million as consideration for the issued shares of Yellow Book USA, Inc.
(subject to adjustment in respect of certain intra-group indebtedness and pursuant to the terms of the ﬁrst
amending agreement).
Following completion, Yell Ltd agreed a net asset adjustment with Castaim Ltd in respect of the assets of
Yell Ltd, and Yellow Pages BV agreed a net asset adjustment with Yasmin Two (US) Inc. in respect of Yellow Book
USA, Inc, which together resulted in the total purchase consideration received being reduced by approximately
£140 million.

Group and also sets out an informal, non-binding dispute resolution procedure
which BT Group and mmO
2
have agreed shall be applied to resolve key disputes which may arise between them
and their respective groups in connection with their continuing relationship and the Demerger.
Under the Separation Agreement, BT Group and mmO
2
agreed that certain costs of the Demerger would be

Under a separate arrangement, BT Group and mmO
2
agreed that mmO

Property Sale and Leaseback
On 13 December 2001, BT sold to Telereal Group Limited (‘‘Telereal’’) a substantial part of BT’s property
portfolio together with the BT property division. Around 6,700 properties comprising ofﬁces, telephone
exchanges, vehicle depots, warehouses, call centres and computer centres were transferred. The transaction also
included the transfer of approximately 350 employees from BT to Land Securities Trillium (Telecom). Telereal will
be responsible for providing accommodation and estates management services to BT. In return, we pay Telereal
around £190 million of annual rental, increasing at 3% a year, for use of the freeholds. In addition, BT has
transferred the economic risk on a large portion of its leased properties to Telereal in return for an annual rental
commencing at approximately £90 million per annum.
BT will have the ﬂexibility to vacate approximately 35% by rental value of the estate over the contract term at
no extra cost.
Telereal, deﬁned above, is a 50/50 joint venture between Land Securities Trillium Limited (a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Land Securities plc) and William Pears Family Holdings Limited. The transaction raised
approximately £2.38 billion for BT.
Concert Unwind Agreement
On 15 October 2001, AT&T, BT and Concert entered into binding agreements to terminate the Concert joint
venture. The termination was completed on 1 April 2002, whereupon Concert ceased to exist as a joint venture.
In connection with the termination, the assets, liabilities, contracts, customers and other operational items were
allocated between BT and AT&T with appropriate true up payment mechanisms to reﬂect the allocation of assets.
The assets and liabilities were allocated between AT&T and BT with the majority of items originally contributed
by each of AT&T and BT in connection with the formation of the Concert joint venture being returned to the
relevant parent.
Following termination of the joint venture, Concert BV was renamed BT Global Networks Holdings
(Netherlands) BV.
Additional information for shareholders
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 151 BT has entered into a number of ongoing commercial agreements with AT&T in order to allow it to continue its
global operations, and offer telecommunication services, in various geographic regions where BT may no longer
have infrastructure as a result of the transfer of certain assets to AT&T.
In connection with the termination of the Concert joint venture, AT&T has acquired BT’s minority interest
in AT&T Canada and BT no longer has any interest or obligation in relation to AT&T Canada.
Cegetel
On 5 December 2002, Vivendi Universal (‘‘Vivendi’’) served a notice exercising its pre-emption rights under
the Shareholders’ Agreement in respect of Cegetel Groupe SA (‘‘Cegetel’’) to acquire BT’s entire shareholding –
a 26% interest – in Cegetel from Cegetel Holdings I BV Sarl (‘‘Cegetel Holdings’’), a BT group company for
e4.0 billion (£2.6 billion) in cash. This pre-emption right became exercisable as a result of Cegetel Holdings
having entered into a share purchase agreement for the sale of its shareholding in Cegetel to Vodafone AG for
e4.0 billion in cash, in October 2002.
Vivendi paid e2.7 billion of the consideration to Cegetel Holdings on 17 January 2003 and the transaction
was completed when Vivendi paid the balance of e1.3 billion on 22 January 2003.
Taxation (US Holders)
This is a summary only of the principal US federal income tax and UK tax consequences of the ownership and
disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs by US Holders (as deﬁned below) who hold their ordinary shares or ADSs
as capital assets. It does not address all aspects of US federal income taxation and does not address aspects
that may be relevant to persons who are subject to special provisions of US federal income tax law, including
US expatriates, insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, ﬁnancial institutions, securities broker-dealers,
persons subject to alternative minimum tax, investors that actually or constructively own 10% or more of our
outstanding share capital, persons holding their shares or ADSs as part of a straddle, hedging transaction or
conversion transaction, persons who acquired their shares or ADSs pursuant to the exercise of options or similar
derivative securities or otherwise as compensation, or persons whose functional currency is not the US dollar,
amongst others. Those holders may be subject to US federal income tax consequences different from those set
forth below.
For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘US Holder’’ is a beneﬁcial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that, for US
federal income tax purposes, is: an individual citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation or certain
other entities created or organised in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, an estate whose
income is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if a US court can exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons are authorised to control all
substantial decisions of the trust. If a partnership holds ordinary shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner
generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If a US Holder is a
partner in a partnership that holds ordinary shares or ADSs, such Holder is urged to consult its own tax adviser
regarding the speciﬁc tax consequences of owning and disposing of the ordinary shares or ADSs.
In particular, this summary is based on (i) current UK tax law and UK Inland Revenue practice and US law and
US Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) practice, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the ‘‘Code’’), Treasury regulations, rulings, judicial decisions and administrative practice, all as currently in
effect, (ii) the United Kingdom–United States Income Tax Convention that entered into force on 25 April 1980 as
in effect on 1 January 2003 (the ‘‘1980 Convention’’), and (iii) the United Kingdom–United States Convention
relating to estate and gift taxes as in effect on the date of this Annual Report, all of which are subject to change
or changes in interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.
US Holders should be aware that a new United Kingdom–United States Income Tax Convention entered into
force on 31 March 2003 (the ‘‘New Convention’’) and generally will have effect in respect of dividends paid on or
after 1 May 2003. However, a US Holder entitled to beneﬁts under the 1980 Convention may elect to have
the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue for an additional twelve months if the election to apply the 1980
Convention would result in greater beneﬁts to the Holder. If a US Holder were to make an effective election,
the discussion below with respect to dividend payments made pursuant to the 1980 Convention would continue
to apply to dividends paid by BT prior to 1 May 2004. The discussion below notes instances where the relevant
provisions of the New Convention will produce a materially different result for a US Holder. US Holders should
note that certain articles in the New Convention limit or restrict the ability of a US Holder to claim beneﬁts under
the New Convention and that similar provisions were not contained in the 1980 Convention.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of the Conventions and the
consequences under UK, US federal, state and local, and other laws, of the ownership and disposition of ordinary
shares or ADSs.
Taxation of dividends
For dividends paid on or before 5 April 1999, US Holders were generally entitled to receive the cash dividend plus
a Treaty payment from the Inland Revenue of one quarter of the dividend, subject to a UK withholding tax of 15%
of the aggregate amount paid. As an example for illustration purposes only, a US Holder who was entitled
to a dividend of £80 was also entitled to a Treaty payment of £20, reduced by the withholding tax of 15% on
Additional information for shareholders
152 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 the gross amount of £100, i.e. £15, leaving a net cash payment of £85. The full dividend plus the full Treaty
payment including the UK tax withheld was taxable income for US purposes, and the UK tax withheld generally
was available as a US credit or deduction.
For dividends paid on or after 6 April 1999 and subject to the 1980 Convention as described above, the
Treaty payment reduces to one ninth of the dividend (i.e. one tenth of the gross payment). As a result of the UK
withholding tax (which cannot exceed the amount of the hypothetical Treaty payment), US Holders will no longer
receive any Treaty payment. In the above example, the cash dividend would be £80, and the hypothetical Treaty
payment would be £8.89 (one ninth of £80). However, since the UK withholding tax (15% of £88.89), would
exceed the amount of the hypothetical Treaty payment, no Treaty payment will be made and the US Holder will
receive only the cash dividend (here, £80). A US holder will be taxable in the US on the full dividend and full
hypothetical Treaty payment (£88.89), and will be treated as having paid a foreign tax equal to the hypothetical
Treaty payment (here, £8.89).
The foreign tax deemed paid generally will be available as a US credit or deduction. A US Holder could elect
to receive a foreign tax credit or deduction with respect to any UK withholding tax on IRS Form 8833 (Treaty-
Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701(b)). A US Holder will be denied a foreign tax credit
(and instead allowed a deduction) for the hypothetical Treaty payment unless the US Holder has held the shares
upon which the dividend was received for at least 16 days during the 30-day holding period beginning on the date
which is 15 days before the ex-dividend date. Any days during which a US Holder has a substantially diminished
risk of loss on the shares are not counted toward meeting the 16-day holding period requirement. Also, a
US Holder that is under an obligation to make related payments with respect to the shares (or substantially similar
or related property) is not entitled to claim a foreign tax credit with respect to a foreign tax imposed on a dividend.
For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit, dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be
treated as income from sources outside the United States and generally will constitute ‘‘passive income’’ or,
for certain holders, ‘‘ﬁnancial services income’’. The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit
are very complex. US Holders who do not elect to claim a credit with respect to any foreign taxes paid in a given
taxable year may instead claim a deduction for foreign taxes paid. A deduction does not reduce US federal income
tax on a dollar for dollar basis like a tax credit. The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations
described above.
There will be no hypothetical Treaty payment and no notional UK withholding tax applied to a dividend
payment made under the New Convention. Therefore, it will not be possible for US Holders to claim a foreign tax
credit in respect of any dividend payment made by BT on or after 1 May 2003 (or 1 May 2004 in the case of a
Holder who effectively elects to extend the applicability of the 1980 Convention as described above).
The UK does not currently apply a withholding tax on dividends under its internal tax laws.
For US federal income tax purposes, a distribution (including any additional dividend income arising from a
foreign tax credit claim as described above) will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent paid out
of our current or accumulated earnings and proﬁts, as determined for US tax purposes, based on the US dollar
value of the distribution calculated by reference to the spot rate in effect on the date the distribution is actually or
constructively received by a US Holder of ordinary shares, or by the Depositary, in the case of ADSs. Distributions
by us in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and proﬁts will be treated ﬁrst as a tax-free return
of capital to the extent of the US Holder’s basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs, and thereafter as capital gain.
Dividends paid by us will not be eligible for the US dividends received deduction.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether the US Holder is eligible for beneﬁts
under the 1980 Convention and the New Convention, whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be
available with respect to dividends received from BT, whether it may be advisable in light of the Holder’s
particular circumstances to elect to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue in force until 1 May
2004, and the treatment of any foreign currency gain or loss on any pounds sterling received with respect to
ordinary shares that are not converted into US dollars on the date the pounds sterling are actually or
constructively received.
Taxation of capital gains
Unless a US resident carries on a trade through a branch or agency in the UK, and the disposal of ordinary shares
and/or ADSs is related to the activities of that trade, UK capital gains tax is not charged on US residents who
dispose of ordinary shares and/or ADSs.
For US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder generally will recognise capital gain or loss on the sale or
other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value
of the amount realised on the disposition and the US Holder’s adjusted tax basis (determined in US dollars)
in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Such gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss, and will be treated
as long-term capital gain or loss if the ordinary shares have been held for more than one year at the time
of disposition. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to signiﬁcant limitations. Capital gains of an individual
US Holder are subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates if speciﬁed holdings periods are met.
Additional information for shareholders
BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 153 US information reporting and backup withholding
Dividends paid on and proceeds received from the sale or disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject
to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a current rate of 30%. Certain exempt recipients
(such as corporations) are not subject to these information reporting requirements. Backup withholding will not
apply, however, to a Holder who provides a correct taxpayer identiﬁcation number or certiﬁcate of foreign status
and makes any other required certiﬁcation or who is otherwise exempt. US persons who are required to establish
their exempt status generally must furnish IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identiﬁcation Number and
Certiﬁcation). Non-US Holders generally will not be subject to US information reporting or backup withholding.
However, such Holders may be required to provide certiﬁcation of non-US status in connection with payments
received in the United States or through certain US-related ﬁnancial intermediaries.
Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a Holder’s US federal income tax liability.
A Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by ﬁling
the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.
UK stamp duty
A transfer of an ordinary share will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5%
of the amount or value of any consideration provided. A transfer of an ordinary share into a clearance service
or American depository system gives rise to a 1.5% charge of either the amount of the consideration provided
or the value of the share issued. No UK stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of an ADS (assuming it is not
registered in the UK), provided that the transfer documents are executed and always retained outside the UK.
UK inheritance and gift taxes in connection with ordinary shares and/or ADSs
Where an individual holder, who is not a UK national, of ordinary shares and/or ADSs falls within the scope
of the UK/US Estate and Gift Tax Convention, US-domiciled holders of ordinary shares and/or ADSs will not
generally be subject to UK inheritance tax on a gift of ordinary shares and/or ADSs if the gift is subject to US
federal gift tax. Similarly, ordinary shares and/or ADSs passing on the death of a US-domiciled shareholder, who
is not a UK national, will not generally be subject to UK inheritance tax if the estate is subject to US estate tax.
The rules and scope of domicile are complex and action should not be taken without advice speciﬁc to the
individual’s circumstances.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders
There are currently no government laws, decrees or regulations in the United Kingdom that restrict the export
or import of capital, including, but not limited to, UK foreign exchange control restrictions, or that affect
the remittances of dividends or other payments to non-resident holders of the company’s ordinary shares, except
as otherwise described in Taxation (US Holders) above and except in respect of the government of, or any resident
of, Iraq or any person treated as so resident. There are no limitations under the laws of the United Kingdom
restricting the right of non-residents to hold or to vote shares in the company.
