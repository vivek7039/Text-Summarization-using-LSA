Our story
The HSS Hire Group is a leading provider of tools, 
equipment and related services in the UK and 
Ireland. Our nationwide network ensures easy 
access to an extensive range that has grown to 
include specialist capabilities including power 
solutions business, ABird and powered access 
provider, UK Platforms.
Focused on delivering Safety, Value, Availability and Support, 
we work predominantly with ‘business-to-business’ customers 
in the ‘fit-out’, maintain and operate sectors. We are dedicated 
to helping them all work safely, efficiently and cost-effectively.
Our team of HSSers are the reason we are able to deliver a hire 
experience that, we believe, is the best in the industry so we are 
committed to making sure they have the skills and support they 
need to flourish.
We take a responsible approach to the way we conduct all 
business activities and we are ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 
18001, CHAS and SafeHire Certified. 
We are delighted to share our story with you.
Our network: 
UK and Ireland
During 2017 we closed a 
number of branches across 
the network due to lower 
Rental revenue growth 
and a loss of focus on 
our Tool Hire business. 
We now have branches in more than 
250 locations, and following recent 
network reconfiguration changes, 
we will now be able to provide a 
greater availability of services to our 
customers across the UK and Ireland. 
This will include the expansion of test 
and run into all HSS branches and 
customer distribution centres (CDCs) 
and more intensive repair into a 
number of strategically located 
workshop CDCs. In addition the 
workshop CDCs will link to a national 
cross dock centre in Oxford that will 
enable the overnight movement kit 
to service our customers delivery 
requirements between all of our 
CDCs in England and Wales.

Support
Safety is our priority and we work hard to ensure 
the safety of our customers and the equipment 
we hire to them as well as supporting their own 
progress towards ‘Zero Harm’ and ‘Target Zero’ 
goals. We drive safer product design throughout 
our supply chain – such as the unique anti-

that includes online and call centre ordering for 
delivery or collection as well as a strategically 
positioned branch network, stocked with the 
most popular kit ready to take away. 
To make sure our customers receive value from

true cost of hire’ – providing reliable equipment 
and an excellent service as well as helping them  
to understand, manage and control their costs. 
We continue to invest in our fully transactional 
e-commerce platform and Remote Fleet 
Management systems, which help customers 
to better manage hire volumes and durations 
as well as saving them time. In 2017 , we continued 
to underpin our commitment to value with a 
simplified pricing structure. 
Supporting our customers is about making life 
easier for them. We offer a range of hire-related 
services to help our customers and which 
includes a Managed Service Provider offer that 
enables us to manage the complex supply chains 
of some of our larger customers. We also support 
our customers by ensuring that – from recruiting 
the right people to providing them with ongoing 
training and development – our colleagues are 
better equipped with the skills and knowledge 
they need to provide an excellent hire service.

Chairman’s Statement
Board priorities 
for 2018 
Following on from the findings of our Strategic Review, 
we identified three areas of focus for 2018: reduce the 
Group’s debt to manageable levels; Repair and revitalise 
the Tool Hire business; and Strengthen our commercial 
proposition across the Group.
Alan Peterson
Chairman
Dear shareholder,
Following decisive action taken by the Group 
Board and senior management during 2017 ,  
we have seen a significant improvement in our 
performance in the second half of the financial 
year and we will now build upon this momentum 
by implementing our clear strategic priorities.
Delever the Group
Repair and revitalise the Tool Hire business
Strengthen the Group’s commercial proposition
HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 4 5
Strategic Review and progress made
We conducted a thorough, all-encompassing 
Strategic Review, reviewing the profitability of 
each customer, product and branch, as well 
as the most efficient operating model to 
support our business going forward. 
To this end there are three clear areas of 
focus for the year ahead:
1 Delever the Group
2
Repair and revitalise 
the Tool Hire business
3
Strengthen the Group’s 
commercial proposition
I am encouraged by the outcome of the 
Strategic Review, the findings of which we 
presented in December 2017 , and am 
confident that the delivery of these three 
priorities will improve Group profitability in 
2018 and beyond. 
We have already made good progress in 
the implementation of the strategy, and 
we are on track to deliver the annualised 
savings of £10m-£14m, which we 
presented in December. 
As we communicated as part of the 
Strategic Review in December 2017, an 
agreement was reached in principle with 
Unipart at the end of 2017 and was finalised 
on 13 February 2018. This allows us to 
make significant changes to our supply 
chain, in order to optimise our network. 
The National Distribution and Engineering 
Centre model was initially envisaged to 
support a much larger branch network. 
Based on the size of our current network, 
this model is no longer cost-effective. We 
therefore decided to move testing and 
some engineering back into the network 
and as a consequence, significantly reduce 
distribution costs. These changes have 
been positively received and will lead to 
improved product availability and contribute 
annualised cost savings of around £11m of 
the total anticipated cost savings stated 
above. These changes resulted in an 
exceptional cost of £41m, which includes 
various one off payments in 2018 and cash 
payments of £33.8m over the following 
seven year period.
Our results
We have seen an improving trend in our 
performance in the second half of the 
financial year, with strong Adjusted EBITA 
growth compared with the first half. These 
improving trends are demonstrated by our 
underlying rental revenue growth where 
we report 1.1% growth in H2 17 compared 
to H2 16. This underlying measure strips 
out the impact of branch closures in the 
two years, business divestments in 2017, 
the effect of week 53 in 2016, and rental 
revenues and disposal proceeds arising 
from the material asset disposals made in 
2016. This was augmented by continued 
growth in our services segment revenue 
and contribution which delivered 11.1% 
and 13.5% growth respectively in H2 17 
compared to H2 16. Our relentless focus 
on cost reduction led to our overheads 
in Q4 17 being £3.3m below the level in 
Q1 17. However, notwithstanding these 
improvements we have made, year on year 
revenue decreased by 2% to £335.8m, 
with a decline in rental, which was 
impacted by operating model changes 
in 2016 and branch closures, offset by a 
growth in services, generating an Adjusted 
EBITA of £1.8m and Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE) of 0.9%.
Our results are discussed in more detail in 
the Financial Review on pages 18 to 21.
Our Board and management team
In June we welcomed the appointment 
of Steve Ashmore as our CEO. He brings 
considerable leadership experience to bear 
and consistent delivery of growth and value 
in a range of industries. Steve previously 
held a number of senior roles at Exel, 
the supply chain and third party logistics 
provider, and was UK Managing Director 
at Wolseley, the £2.0bn revenue distributor 
of plumbing and heating products and 
supplier of building materials. More recently 
he was the UK Managing Director of 
Brammer, the specialist distributor of 
industrial products. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
John Gill, who stepped down as CEO in 
May, for his considerable contribution over 
more than eight years at the Company. 
Governance
We are committed to high standards 
of corporate governance and as such, 
I am pleased to announce that the Group 
has complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) during 2017.
During the year, and continuing into  
2018, the Group has assessed and is 
implementing changes as required  
in preparation for the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) becoming 
law. This year also saw the introduction  
of the Criminal Finances Act, placing 
increased emphasis on controls to prevent 
the facilitation of tax evasion. The Board 
has given top level commitment to this, 
including a new policy, a risk assessment 
and bespoke e-learning training modules. 
We also continued to monitor the Group’s 
policies and procedures in respect of the 
Modern Slavery Act.
Our people
I continue to be extremely impressed  
with the motivation, can-do attitude and 
achievement of HSS people across  
our Group, which is reflected in our 
consistently high customer satisfaction 
scores. I am very confident that with 
their support, HSS will be successful 
in delivering on our strategic priorities 
and building upon the momentum of 
the second half of 2017. 
Corporate responsibility 
Our primary responsibility is to always 
ensure the safety of HSS colleagues and 
customers, and the Board remains fully 
committed to providing a safe environment 
for all. We also pay close attention to 
reducing the impact we have on the 
environment and in the role that we play  
as a community business across the UK 
and Ireland. 
Refinancing
We announced in February 2018 that we 
had agreed with our lenders to extend 
the £80m Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), 
which will now expire on 6 July 2019. 
Under the terms of the agreement, if the 
Group has not completed a refinancing by 
30 September 2018, the facility will expire 
at the option of the lenders on 30 April 
2019. Management continues to make 
good progress towards refinancing the 
Group and expects to complete this  
during 2018. 
We have prepared the accounts on a 
going concern basis as the Board is 
confident that the Group will be able to 
refinance these debt facilities well in 
advance of their maturity dates. 
Dividend
The Board is focused on reducing net 
debt and, after careful consideration of the 
performance of the Group during the year, 
and in line with the clear priorities set out 
in our Strategic Review, believes it is in the 
best interests of the shareholders of the 
Group, to not pay a final dividend in 
respect of 2017.
Looking ahead
The positive trading momentum in the 
second half of the financial year has 
continued into 2018. Underlying revenue 
grew by 6% in the first quarter of 2018 
against prior year with underlying rental 
revenue growing 3% and our already 
actioned cost initiatives are delivering 
benefits as expected. Based on this 
positive start to the new financial year we 
expect the LTM Adjusted EBITDA at the 
end of March to be around £54m with the 
first quarter Adjusted EBITDA being more 
than 50% higher than the previous year. 
This clearly benefits the net leverage ratio 
of the Group, which has reduced to 4.3x 
as at the end of Q1 18. Looking forward 
we expect Net Leverage to reduce to 
3.2x following the implementation of the 
identified strategic actions.
Our focus will be on developing a leaner 
operation, improving product availability 
and enhancing customer service, and 
reducing our debt to manageable levels. 
We will continue to drive operational 
efficiency across the Group, improving 
profitability and returns, and growing  
a profitable share of the market.

My initial perceptions reaffirmed
We presented our findings of the Strategic 
Review on 7 December 2017. The review 
not only highlighted areas of focus, but 
also reaffirmed my initial perceptions. 
We have a strong brand having served 
our customers for 60 years and our NPS 
score is above market average. Within our 
chosen markets we are joint number 2 in 
the UK tool and equipment rental market 
by revenue, we have good national 
coverage and we operate primarily in the 
highly attractive ‘repair, maintain and 
operate’ segment of the market. The 
2,900 employees across the Group are 
committed and knowledgeable, and  
were named winners of the UK customer 
experience award in 2016. Our business 
model is innovative and forward thinking, 
with multi-channel digital technology, and 
a healthy network of branches which allow 
for high levels of utilisation of our stock 
across the Group.

Our new strategy
Upon completion of the review, we 
identified three key strategic priorities: 
Delever the Group, Repair the Tool Hire 
business and Strengthen the Group’s 
commercial proposition. 
Overview of my first year 
I was honoured to be asked to lead 
HSS Hire. It is a business with a strong 
brand and leading positions in its chosen 
markets across the UK and Ireland. 
Having worked in the industry for many 
years, I have always admired HSS, 
so when the opportunity arose to lead 
this fantastic organisation, it was an 
opportunity not to be missed.
I arrived at a challenging time for the 
Group, and it was evident that a lot of work 
needed to be done. In some areas within 
the business we were experiencing 
reduced margins, the new distribution 
network had led to lower rental revenue 
growth and there was a loss of focus on 
our Tool Hire business. Repairing each of 
these areas will take time and we must 
continue to remain focused on the task in 
hand, as we implement changes across 
the Group and our business evolves. 
Notwithstanding these challenges, I 
continue to strongly believe that there 
remains huge potential at HSS. Over the 
past few months I have spent a lot of time 
with different parts of the business, and 
have been incredibly impressed by the 
motivation, achievements and commitment 
of HSS people across our Group.
Our wide ranging strategic review
During the year, we engaged an 
independent third party to work with the 
HSS management team to undertake the 
most extensive Strategic Review of the 
business to date. The review was wide 
ranging in scope and involved the analysis 
of 20 million contract lines, more than 
Delever
During 2017 we took a number of cost 
reduction actions which resulted in us 
delivering annualised savings of £13m 
compared with the Q1 FY17 runrate. This 
was achieved through working with our 
suppliers to reduce costs, reducing our 
central headcount, closing 55 branches, 
and network efficiencies. 
The Strategic Review announced in 
December 2017 outlined initiatives to 
reduce costs by a further £10m-£14m 
on an annualised basis, including up to 
£10m related to changes in the supply 
chain model. We were therefore pleased 
to announce in February 2018 that 
agreement had been finalised to make 
these changes enabling c.£11m of cost 
benefit, £1m higher than the amounts 
originally communicated. The changes are 
expected to give rise to a net cash outflow 
of approximately £3m in 2018 followed by 
net cash savings of approximately £8m 
annually over the following seven years.
Last but not least, we will drive further 
efficiencies across the business through 
eliminating duplication in some areas and 
simplifying our processes. This should 
generate savings of between £3m-£4m. 
Full implementation of each of these cost 
saving initiatives will take time and is not 
going to happen overnight; however, we 
have a clear plan in place and are focused 
on executing these changes in order to 
reduce the leverage of our business.

HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Strategic Report
Chief Executive Officer’s Strategic Review 
continued
Repair
Three key areas to repair the Tool Hire 
business were identified: customer, 
product and branch. 
Customer
Taking customer first, we have identified 
several areas where we can work with 
our customers to look at ways in which 
we can improve the customer experience 
that we are able to offer them. We want 
to improve our utilisation rates and ensure 
that we are always in a position to fulfil 
the needs and requirements of each and 
every one of our customers. 
Product
On occasions, highly valuable 
products have been commodity-priced 
with certain customers. There has 
also been inconsistent pricing within 
product categories and we have seen 
circumstances where the stock profile 
does not match the profit opportunity.  
A lot of work has been done to introduce 
smart pricing to reflect asset utilisation 
and service, and we are looking at 
improving discount effectiveness and 
rationalising ranges, as well as ensuring 
that we optimise our fleet size. 
Branch
We closed a number of branches over 
the last year or so, and now feel that 
our network is of a size which is flexible 
and that we are comfortable with. It is  
a network which can be adapted and 
modified accordingly as we remain ever 
vigilant to market conditions. However, 
when we look at the branches, there is a 
variety of differing performance across the 
business which needs to be resolved. We 
are therefore looking at a number of areas 
where we can improve, to ensure that all 
our branches are contributing as efficiently 
and effectively as they possibly can. 
Strengthen
The third and final strategic priority is to 
strengthen the Group’s commercial 
proposition. The actions being taken 
here are around customer segmentation, 
geographic focus and sales channel 
development. Taking customer 
segmentation first, customers have different 
needs and therefore we have to respond in 
different ways. We have to ensure that the 
products we can offer are relevant for those 
customer segments. For geographic focus, 
we know the areas where driving initiatives 
will be much more advantageous for us. 
Our target areas have been identified, and 
we have begun working through these and 
will continue to do so over the medium to 
long term. Further progress has also been 
made on developing our sales channels, 
with investment having been made to 
improve our digital capabilities. This will 
help to enhance and improve the 
proposition and customer experience 
that we are able to offer.
Our market
The size of our addressable market for 
tool hire, powered access and power 
generation hire in the UK is in the region 
of £1.9bn. The market has grown by 1-2% 
CAGR since 2013 and is expected to grow 
at a similar rate over the next three years
1
. 
The market is highly fragmented with the 
vast majority of registered hire companies 
employing fewer than 50 staff and serving 
their local geography often from one, 
and usually from fewer than ten locations. 
The Group is one of a small number of 
‘nationals’. We are placed second or third 
in each of our three primary markets with 
between 9-14% market share.
The Group has a large and diverse 
customer base and operates across a 
diverse set of end markets. This provides 
us with some protection against cyclical 
trends that are evident in some sectors, 
such as construction. Our main customer 
groups are in the facilities management, 
retail operations, commercial fit-out, 
property, utilities and waste, infrastructure 
and energy supply services sectors. 
We also work with charities, government 
entities, house builders and 
construction contractors.
The European Rental Association notes that 
the ‘UK market is relatively concentrated’ 
but this is in contrast to the fragmented and 
less mature markets of continental Europe. 
It estimates that the larger rental players with 
between 50 and 250 employees are 50% 
of the UK market. In our view there is room 
for further market consolidation to create 
scale rental players able to deliver further 
efficiency benefits for customers, and 
enhanced returns to shareholders.
Management team
The executive team in place at HSS is 
relatively new in terms of tenure, with 
Paul Quested, Chief Financial Officer, 
being the longest-serving executive 
having joined the business in August 
2016. Notwithstanding this limited time 
within the executive team, I have been very 
encouraged since joining the business in 
June, by the dedication and commitment 
of the management team, and the strength 
and depth of the experience which 
we have across the Group. I am very 
confident that with their support, we 
will be successful in delivering on our 
strategic priorities set out in December.

The Strategic Review has been a massive 
step forward for us and gives us a real 
understanding of our business. We have a 
clear map forward, with steps identified to 
deliver significant change in performance 
within HSS. The strategy has been reset, 
with three levers: Delever the Group, 
Repair the Tool Hire business and 
Strengthen the Group’s commercial 
proposition. Our immediate focus in 2018 
is to undertake a number of cost reduction 
actions which will create a leaner 
operation, but we have to get the balance 
right and get this business working 
effectively and efficiently. We must get the 
branch optimisation right, lifting levels of 
profitability not only across the network, 
but also more widely across the 
entire business. 
Over the next few years, we will be 
examining our customer segmentation; 
deploying and working with our teams in 
areas where we see the most profitable 
opportunities is key. We will also continue 
to develop our sales channels, maximising 
our digital competitive advantage to 
increase the use and mix of innovative 
low-cost channels.

Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties
Managing risk
The Board sets the strategic priorities for the Group and the 
KPIs and performance monitoring relating to these priorities, 
and establishes the risk appetite. 
Overall responsibility for the Group’s risk management lies 
with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO), who have ownership of risk in reporting to the 
Board of Directors. 
The Group then manages its risk through a group risk register 
which is maintained by the Risk and Assurance Director. This is 
subject to quarterly review by both the Executive Management 
Team and the Audit Committee, where changes to the risk 
landscape, risk ratings and assurance activity are discussed 
and necessary action and changes agreed.
A risk-based internal audit programme is in place to ensure 
assurance activity is targeted at key risk areas, as identified 
below. Risk-based assurance work is then reported to the Audit 
Committee on a quarterly basis for review. In addition the Risk 
and Assurance Director reports to the Executive Board and 
the senior management team on a monthly basis to review 
the findings of risk-based assurance activity and investigation, 
provided by the internal audit and Health, Safety, Environment 
and Quality (HSEQ) teams.
2017 risk management developments
Through 2017 the Group has continued to improve its 
approach to the management of risk, which is now a 
quarterly agenda item for the Executive Management 
Team to review.
 → The Risk and Assurance Director held one-to-one 
sessions with the Executive Management Team and 
senior management to improve risk management 
culture in the Group.
 → Improvements in the monitoring of risk and 
identification of risk trends by enhancing the 
measurable indicators on the key risks.
 → Increased training to improve the ownership of risk 
at Executive Management level. This was noted in 
last year’s Annual Report.
2018 planned improvements 
to risk management process
In 2018 the internal audit team is working with 
individual departments to document risks and 
opportunities relating to their role in the  
corporate strategy.
 → A dedicated project management office has been 
set up to oversee strategy work streams, monitoring 
performance against plan and tracking and 
mitigating risks.
 → Assurance work will be revised in line with the 
new operating model, focusing on profitability, 
key controls and areas of risk.
 → Increased cross working of assurance teams to 
support the strategy and to ensure we are focused 
on quality, environment and health and safety. 
Principal risks and strategy
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
financial and operating risks facing the Group, based on its three 
strategic priorities:
 → Delever the Group
 → Repair the Tool Hire business
 → Strengthen the Group’s commercial proposition
These risks, how they have changed and how they are mitigated 
are shown in the table opposite.

Macroeconomic 
conditions
An economic downturn in the UK and Ireland 
may adversely affect the Group’s revenue and 
operating results by decreasing the demand for 
its services and the prices it may charge.
The Brexit referendum result has caused economic 
uncertainty with potential short-term and long-term 
effects on demand for services within the Group’s 
industry and broad customer base.
The Group focuses on the ‘fit-out, maintain 
and operate’ markets, which are less 
cyclical, less discretionary and have a larger 
proportion of recurring spend than the 
new-build construction sector. While the 
Group is not isolated from the construction 
sector, it focuses on the non-construction 
portion of the market, with specific 
exposure in the facilities management, 
operations, commercial fit-out, property, 
utilities and waste, infrastructure and energy 
services operations.
Unchanged
Competitor  
challenge 
The Group’s industry is highly competitive, and 
competition may increase. The equipment rental 
industry is highly fragmented, with competitors 
ranging from national equipment rental companies 
to smaller multi-regional companies and small, 
independent businesses operating in a limited 
number of locations. Competition in the market 
has led to frequent excess capacity and resultant 
pricing pressure.
The Group is ranked second or third in 
each of our three primary markets and 
the resulting economies of scale enable 
it to be highly competitive, whilst the 
fragmented nature of the market may 
offer consolidation opportunities.
The Group’s national presence, effective 
distribution service model and well-
maintained fleet provide improved 
customer availability.
Unchanged
Distribution 
Network
The provision of the Group’s expected service 
levels depends on its ability to transport its hire 
fleet across its network in a timely and cost-
effective manner, and on the successful operation 
of its Customer Distribution Centres “CDCs” and 
branch network.
The Group has a flexible distribution 
model incorporating CDCs which support 
the branch network. Performance is 
monitored continually to identify areas 
where we can improve the cost and the 
efficiency of the network.
Unchanged
IT infrastructure The Group requires an IT system that is appropriately 
resourced to support the business, Any IT system 
malfunction may affect the ability to manage its 
operations and distribute its hire fleet and service 
to customers, affecting revenue and reputation.
A cyber security attack on the business systems 
could lead to a potential loss of confidential 
information and disrupt the business’ transactions 
with customers and suppliers.
The current IT system has been fully 
reviewed to ensure that it is the best 
possible option to optimise the success 
of the Group’s strategy. 
Disaster recovery tests are carried out 
on a regular basis. Firewalls are in place 
to protect against malicious attempts to 
penetrate the IT environment. Penetration 
testing is carried out on a regular basis to 
detect weaknesses in our IT and cyber 
security. Software has been implemented 
to identify any malicious attack.

Key risk Description and impact Mitigation Risk change
Insufficient 
liquidity 
headroom
Some of the Group’s customers may have liquidity 
issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfil the 
terms of their rental agreements with the Group. 
Bad debts and credit losses can also arise due to 
service issues or fraud.
Unauthorised, incorrect or fraudulent payments 
could be made, leading to financial loss or delays 
in payment which could adversely affect the 
relationship with suppliers and lead to a 
disruption in supply. 
Continuing losses of the Group or delays in the 
implementation of cost savings may lead to a lack 
of liquidity. 
The Group is focused on working capital 
management and KPIs are reviewed 
regularly.
The Group runs extensive credit checking 
for its account customers and maintains 
strict credit control over its diversified 
customer base.
The Group’s investigation team conducts 
proactive and reactive work in order to 
minimise the Group’s exposure to fraud.
Payments and amendments should only 
be made in line with a regularly reviewed 
authorisation matrix.
The Group has a clear strategy, supported 
with detailed project plans, to return 
to historic levels of profitability. The 
successful implementation of these 
plans is underpinned by a Programme 
Management Office which has been set 
up to ensure each project is delivered on 
time and realises the expected benefits.
The management is working with 
appointed debt advisers, to ensure that 
the future capital structure, as part of 
the refinancing process, provides 
sufficient liquidity for the Group.
Increased  
in 2017 due  
to higher 
outstanding 
debtor days 
following the 
relocation of 
the credit

London to

and, looking 
forward to 
2018, an 
element of the 
cash costs 
associated 
with the 
network 
change arising 
before the 
benefits fully 
accrue.
Equipment 
supply, 
maintenance 
and availability
The reliable supply of safe and good-quality 
equipment is critical for delivering our customer 
promise; unavailable or unreliable equipment 
can reduce potential revenue and drive additional 
costs into the business.
The Group is dependent upon its relationships  
with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other 
services on acceptable terms. Any disruption  
in supply could affect its ability to provide its 
customers with expected service levels, increasing 
the risk of lost customers or reduced trading levels. 
The changes in the way we operate can impact 
the availability of supply during implementation.
The Group makes every effort to evaluate 
its counterparties prior to entering into 
significant procurement contracts and 
seeks to maintain a range of suppliers.
Refining the Group’s operating model 
during the year, and the right balance 
of centralised and decentralised 
responsibilities have been established.
The 2018 operational plan is based on 
improving the availability of equipment 
and the efficiency of our operating 
model to drive profitability.

Customer 
retention

A decline in the Group’s customer service 
levels could result in a loss of customers

The Group’s business depends on strong brands 
and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance 
its brands could have an adverse effect on its 
ability to grow the business.
The Group is looking to improve regional 
interaction in areas such as customer care 
in 2018.
The Group invests in areas such as 
marketing, community relations and 
colleague training, aimed at delivering 
the highest standards of customer 
service and colleague engagement.

Outsourcing  
of services
The Group outsources certain activities of its 
business to third parties.
If any third parties become unable or refuse to 
fulfil their obligations, or violate laws or regulations, 
there could be a negative impact on the Group’s 
operations or it could lead to adverse publicity and 
a decline in demand. 
Outsourcing of services by the Group 
is subject to stringent procurement 
and service criteria and all contracts 
are subject to demanding service level 
agreements which are closely monitored 
and enforced.
Performance and quality metrics and KPIs 
are tracked throughout the life of contracts.

Turnover of members of the Group’s management 
and colleagues and its ability to attract, train and 
retain key personnel may affect its ability to efficiently 
manage its business and execute its strategy.
The Group has established and maintains 
competitive pay and benefit packages, as 
well as the right working environment for 
its colleagues. Training for colleagues is

Overview
The first half of 2017 was heavily impacted 
by changes to the operating model in the 
prior financial year, with a higher cost base 
and reduced availability during these 
changes, adversely impacting Rental 
revenue. This led to an Adjusted EBITA 
loss of £7.3m in the first half of the year.
Decisive management action taken has 
delivered like for like Rental revenue 
growth of 1.1% in H2 17, and reduced 
annualised costs by £13m against the Q1 
17 run rate. This led to Adjusted EBITA 
profit of £9.1m in H2 17. 
We also completed our Strategic 
Review with the clear actions to 
Delever the Group, Repair the Tool 
Hire Business and Strengthen the 
Group’s Commercial proposition.
I am confident that these are the right 
steps to build on the momentum of H2 
17 performance and deliver sustainable 
and improved profitability.
Revenue
Group revenue declined by 1.9% to £335.8m 
(FY16: £342.4m) behind the anticipated UK 
tool and equipment hire market growth rate 
for 2017 as estimated by the ERA. The main 
drivers of this result were: 
 → FY17 was a normal 52 week year 
whilst FY16 was a 53 week period;
 → Another year of strong growth in our 
Services revenues, up 10.6% year 
on year to £88.0m, mainly driven by 
performance in our rehire business, HSS 
OneCall, augmented with further growth 
from our HSS Training business; and
 → A reduction of 5.7% in Rental and 
related revenues, to £247.8m which 
were negatively impacted by the 
establishment of the new operating 
model during the second half of FY16 
and the first half of FY17. Rental and 
related revenues were further impacted 
by the decision to close a total of 
73 branches since Q3 of FY16. 
Our performance on rental and 
related revenues improved in the 
second half of FY17.
Revenue and revenue growth are two of 
our KPIs as, combined with estimates of 
market size and growth rates, they provide 
us with a measure of our market share.  
We underperformed the UK tool and 
equipment hire market during the year  
for the reasons set out.
Segmental performance 
Rental and related revenues
Our Rental revenues were down 5.7% year 
on year at £247.8m (FY16: £262.8m) and 
accounted for 73.8% of Group revenue 
(FY16: 76.8%). Performance in the first half 
of the year, particularly amongst our small 
and medium customers in England and 
Wales, was affected by the implementation 
of our new operating model, including 
the set-up of the NDEC, which caused 
disruption to availability. This did not 
affect the second half of the year. 
Contribution, defined as revenue less 
cost of sales (excluding depreciation 
and exceptional items), distribution costs 
and directly attributable costs of £158.1m 
(FY16: £179.4m) was 11.9% lower year on 
year reflecting both a change in revenue 
mix, and a growth in operating cost 
coming from the new operating model 
which had been designed for a larger-
sized branch network. 
LTM core utilisation remained level at 50% 
(FY16: 50%) and LTM specialist brand 
utilisation was lower at 73% (FY16: 75%). 
These are both KPIs. As a consequence of 
management action taken, our utilisation 
rates have improved through the second 
half of 2017, being ahead of the same 
period in 2016 at 53% for core equipment 
and 75% for specialist brands.
Services
Services revenues increased by 10.6% to 
£88.0m (FY16: £79.6m) and accounted for 
26.2% (FY16: 23.2%) of Group revenues. 
This was principally due to strong growth 
in HSS OneCall and the continued 
development of HSS Training. Our 
Services revenues benefited from existing 
and new key account contracts where our 
one-stop-shop offering has provided clear 
market differentiation.
Contribution from Services grew by 15.1% 
to £11.9m (FY16: £10.3m), slightly ahead of 
the revenue growth rate, reflecting further 
margin improvement achieved using the 
existing teams and infrastructure to 
support increased levels of activity.

Costs
Our cost analysis set out below is on a 
reported basis and therefore includes 
exceptional investment associated with  
our operating model change. Year on  
year variances driven by such costs  
are identified in the commentary. 
Our cost of sales increased by £9.1m 
(6.2%) during the year to £154.3m, mainly 
reflecting the growth in our Services 
revenues (principally HSS OneCall and 
HSS Training) and the associated third 
party supply costs incurred to support  
this activity. This also included £0.2m of 
exceptional costs compared with £3.4m in 
2016. The high level of exceptional costs in 
2016 related to changes in our operating 
model and the identification as part of 
that process of some aged resale stock 
that required impairment. A change in 
depreciation rates on one class of product 
during the year has led to an increase in 
depreciation charge of £0.8m. Changes to 
depreciation rates made during FY 16 led 
to a decreased charge of £4.2m during 
that year.
Our distribution costs increased by £1.0m 
(2.3%) from £45.1m to £46.1m. Within this 
exceptional costs were £0.1m compared 
with £1.3m in FY16. The higher exceptional 
costs in FY16 relate largely to the dual 
running costs as the Group migrated its 
activities to the NDEC whilst running its 
existing network in parallel.
Our administrative expenses grew by 
£51.7m (33.1%) to £207.7m (FY16: 
£156.0m). Exceptional costs accounted 
for a £53.8m increase year on year. The 
current year exceptional items include 
£40.7m network reconfiguration costs 
relating to the agreement with Unipart to 
terminate the NDEC contract. Additionally, 
the cost of onerous leases increased by 
£2.4m to £6.9m reflecting an increased 
number of branch closures year on year. 
The onerous lease provisions represent 
the discounted value of future rent 
payments on properties we are not trading 
from until lease expiry. There was an 
impairment of property, plant & machinery 
in closed branches of £8.3m. Looking 
forwards the Group incurred £3.7m of 
costs relating to delivering a cost reduction 
programme, £1.0m on senior management 
changes, £1.2m conducting its Strategic 
Review and £0.7m on preparatory 
refinancing expenses. Administrative 
expenses also include the £4.9m loss  
on disposal of the Reintec and TecServ 
cleaning equipment and maintenance 
businesses which were sold in  
November 2017. 
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA
Our Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was 
£48.9m, 28.8% lower than in FY16 
(£68.6m) driven by the decline in Rental 
and related revenues and the increased 
costs associated with the NDEC. Whilst 
this was offset by Services revenue 
growth, this was at a lower margin.
As a result, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA 
margin for FY17 was 14.6% (FY16: 20.0%). 
Adjusted EBITDA and margin are included 
in our KPIs.
Our Adjusted EBITA declined to £1.8m 
(FY16: £20.5m). The significant reduction 
was driven by the higher costs of our 
operating network and our performance 
on rental and related revenue during the 
first half of the year. The business made an 
Adjusted EBITA loss in the first half of the 
year but returned to Adjusted EBITA profit 
in the second half.
This combined with a growth in lower 
margin Services revenue led to a reduction 
in EBITA margin to 0.5% (FY16: 6.0%) 
Adjusted EBITA and margin are included  
in our KPIs).
Other operating income
Other operating income reflects the income 
received from the sub-letting of non-trading 
stores. This decreased by £0.3m year on 
year as the portfolio of non-trading stores 
fully or partially sub-let reduced. We 
continually assess our portfolio to identify 
revenue opportunities or to pursue 
attractive lease surrender opportunities  
as and when they arise.
Operating loss
Our operating loss increased from £2.7m 
in 2016 to £71.9m in 2017, driven by lower 
revenue and increased operating costs 
including £66.6m of exceptional costs.
The £49.6m growth in exceptional items to 
£66.6m (FY16: £17.0m), and the reduction 
in Adjusted EBITDA from £68.6m to 
£48.9m driven by lower Rental revenue 
and the increased network costs accounts 
for the majority of this decline. 
Exceptional items
We have incurred significant one off 
expenditure in a number of areas of  
the business as we seek to make cost 
reductions in order to take the business 
forward in the coming years. These 
totalled £66.6m. The majority of these 
exceptional items had no cash flow impact 
during 2017.
Branch closures led to onerous lease 
provisions of £6.9m (FY16: £4.5m). The 
cost included adjustments to expected 
future sub-let income from these closed 
properties and other properties that the 
group has closed in previous years. 
Sub-let income from vacant properties 
declined from £1.1m to £0.9m.
Impairments of £8.3m were recorded in 
respect of closed branches (FY16: £nil).
In the first half of the year the Group 
started a cost reduction programme 
alongside the branch closures. This 
included making refinements to how the 
network operated and reductions in 
headcount. The total cost was £3.7m and 
this included a property impairment of 
£1.2m as head office functions were 
centralised in Manchester. Total average 
headcount across the Group reduced from 
3,254 to 3,006.
Following the appointment of Steve 
Ashmore in June 2017 we announced in 
August 2017 that we would be undertaking 
a Strategic Review and we engaged an 
independent third party to assist. We 
believe that this was the most extensive 
review and analysis of the business ever 
conducted. The costs of this were £1.2m. 
We announced the outcome of this review 
in December 2017. 
When we announced the outcome of our 
Strategic Review we identified significant 
cost savings that would be made. Principal 
to this was to save between £7m and 
£10m on an annualised basis from making 
changes to our supply chain model. In 
December 2017 heads of terms were 
agreed with Unipart to make significant 
changes to how we managed our 
centralised engineering at the NDEC. 
We will bring the Test and Run activity 
for high-volume products back into 
our branch network with repair and 
maintenance consolidated into regional 
distribution centres. Unipart will remain 
responsible for our spare parts 
warehousing and will provide cross-
docking space to enable us to rebalance 
our fleet across the network. A formal 
agreement with Unipart was announced 
in February 2018 and an exceptional cost 
of £40.7m is recorded in the year. This 
represents an impairment of fixed assets 
of £1.9m, an intangible asset impairment of 
£1.2m, the write off of a security deposit of 
£4.5m, and the provision for termination 
payments and an onerous contract of 
£32.6m. Of the total provision created 
£9.6m will be payable in 2018 with the 
balance payable between in broadly equal 
annual amounts each year to 2026.
In November 2017 we sold our non-core 
Reintec and TecServ cleaning equipment 
hire and maintenance businesses for 
proceeds net of costs of £1.2m giving 
rise to a loss on disposal of £4.9m.
HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 20 21
Finance costs 
Net finance expense (finance expenses 
less finance income) reduced to £13.7m 
(FY16: £14.7m). Drawings on our RCF 
increased during the year whilst our 
finance lease liability reduced. The 
reduction was driven by the financial 
period being one week shorter and a 
reduction in the interest unwind on 
discounted provisions.
Taxation
The Group generated a net tax credit of 
£5.2m compared with a credit of £0.1m in 
FY16. The Group made an overall loss for 
tax purposes in the UK, and the charge 
represents current tax suffered in Ireland 
offset by a £4.9m deferred tax credit 
arising from the offset of tax losses against 
the previously recognised deferred tax 
liability on intangible assets.
Reported and adjusted  
earnings per share
Our basic and diluted reported loss per 
share increased to 46.96p (FY16: loss of 
11.18p). This was due to the larger loss 
generated in the year, partially offset by an 
increase in the weighted average number 
of shares from 154.8m to 170.3m shares 
as a result of the share placing completed 
in December 2016.
Our basic adjusted earnings per share, 
being profit before amortisation and 
exceptional costs less tax at the prevailing 
rate of corporation tax divided by the 
weighted average number of shares, 
moved from 2.98p in FY16 to a loss of 
5.68p in FY17. Our diluted adjusted 
earnings per share, calculated in the same 
manner as basic adjusted earnings per 
share but with the weighted average 
number of shares increased to reflect LTIP 
and Sharesave options, was also a loss 
of 5.68p (FY16: 2.94p). These reflect the 
significant reduction in Adjusted EBITA in 
FY17 compared with FY16, which was 
driven by our performance in the first half 
of the year. Adjusted EPS (diluted) is one 
of our KPIs and is also used to assess 
Executive Director remuneration.
Capital expenditure
Fixed asset additions in the year were 
£34.5m, a £7.9m or 18.6% decline year on 
year. Within this £25.8m was spent on hire 
fleet (2016: £27.3m) reflecting another 
managed reduction of spend in these 
areas after two years of significant 
expenditure and including the capital 
efficiency benefit of centralising 
engineering activity into fewer locations. 
The remaining £8.7m was spent on 
non-hire additions (land, buildings, plant 
and machinery) (2016: £15.1m). The 
changes to the Group’s operating model 
centred on the NDEC were designed to 
support enhanced capital and operational 
efficiency across the Group. We do not 
anticipate a material increase in our 2018 
capital expenditure requirements due to 
efficiency gains through our fast moving 
products being tested in branches and 
more targeted investment using insight 
from the Strategic Review. Fleet 
investment is one of our KPIs. 
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
Our ROCE for FY17 was 0.9% compared 
with 9.7% for FY16. ROCE is calculated as 
Adjusted EBITA divided by the total of 
average total assets (excluding intangible 
assets and cash) less average current 
liabilities (excluding current debt items). 
Adjusted EBITA dropped by more than 
90% during the year whilst the average 
capital employed by the Group decreased 
by 10.0% from the level calculated at the 
end of 2016, reflecting depreciation and 
asset disposals being higher than capital 
expenditure. This is one of our KPIs and is 
also used to assess Executive Director 
remuneration.
Cash generated from/utilised  
in operations
Cash generated from operating activities 
was £10.1m for FY17, a decrease of 
£16.5m over the prior year (FY16: £26.6m). 
This reflects the reduction in profits which 
was offset by a planned reduction in hire 
fleet asset capital expenditure and an 
improvement in working capital compared 
with FY16.
Leverage and net debt
Net debt (stated gross of issue costs) 
increased by £13.4m to £232.8m  
(FY16: £219.4m). 
As at 30 December 2017 the Group had 
access to £29.8m of combined liquidity 
from available cash and undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities. Our 
leverage, calculated as net debt divided by 
Adjusted EBITDA, increased from 3.2x in 
FY16 to 4.8x at the end of FY17. This was 
primarily due to the lower Adjusted EBITDA 
generated in FY17. Leverage or Net Debt 
Ratio is one of our KPIs and is also used to 
assess Executive Director remuneration.
Use of alternative performance 
measures to assess and 
monitor performance
In addition to the statutory figures 
reported in accordance with IFRS, we 
use alternative performance measures  
(APMs) to assess the Group’s ongoing 
performance. The main APMs we use 
are Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITA, 
Adjusted profit before tax, Adjusted 
earnings per share, leverage (or Net Debt 
Ratio) and ROCE, all of which are included 
in our key performance indicators as set 
out on pages 12 and 13. 
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, a widely 
used and reported metric amongst listed 
and private companies, presents a 
‘cleaner’ view of the Group’s operating 
profitability in each year by excluding 
exceptional costs associated with 
non-recurring projects or events, 
finance costs, tax charges and non-cash 
accounting elements such as depreciation 
and amortisation.
Additionally analysts and investors 
assess our operating profitability using 
the Adjusted EBITA metric, which treats 
depreciation charges as an operating cost 
to reflect the capital-intensive nature of the 
sector in which we operate. This metric is 
used to calculate any annual bonuses 
payable to Executive Directors.
Analysts and investors also assess our 
earnings per share using an Adjusted 
earnings per share measure, calculated by 
dividing an adjusted profit after tax by the 
weighted average number of shares in 
issue over the period. This approach aims 
to show the implied underlying earnings of 
the Group. The Adjusted profit before tax 
figure comprises the reported loss before 
tax of the business with amortisation and 
exceptional costs added back. This 
amount is then reduced by an illustrative 
tax charge at the prevailing rate of 
corporation tax (currently 19%) to give an 
adjusted profit after tax. Adjusted earnings 
per share is used as a performance metric 
for the vesting of 2016 LTIP and 2017 
market value option awards.
The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA 
and Adjusted EBITA can vary between 
companies, and a reconciliation of Adjusted 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA to operating 
profit/(loss) and Adjusted profit before tax  
to loss before tax is provided on the face  
of the Group’s income statement. A 
reconciliation of reported loss per share  
to Adjusted earnings per share is provided 
in note 10 of the accounts. 
In accordance with broader market 
practice we comment on the amount of 
net debt in the business by reference to 
leverage (or Net Debt Ratio), which is the 
multiple of our Adjusted EBITDA that the 
net debt represents. This metric is also 
used in the calculation of any annual 
bonuses payable to Executive Directors.
We use ROCE to assess the return (the 
Adjusted EBITA) that we generate on the 
average tangible fixed assets and average 
working capital employed in each year. 
We exclude all elements of net debt from 
this calculation. This metric is also used 
as a performance metric for the vesting  
of 2016 LTIP awards.

Corporate Responsibility
As a large national company,  
we are aware that we have 
responsibilities to our customers, 
our colleagues and our local 
communities, as well as to  
the wider economy and the 
environment. We build on the 
sustainable nature of our business 
model with an equally responsible 
approach to how we conduct our 
business activities, both inside 
and outside of our organisation. 
Our primary responsibility is, as 
always, safety – of our colleagues, 
our customers and of the 
equipment we hire – and making 
sure that HSS is a safe place for 
people to work in and to hire from. 
We are also focused on ensuring 
that we operate with transparency 
and integrity, and on delivering a 
sound economic performance 
whilst reducing our impact on the 
environment, supporting our 
colleagues and our customers, 
and playing a positive role in our 
local communities.

Economic performance 
and governance
A responsible company generates and 
shares wealth in order to perform for its 
stakeholders – delivering a financial return 
for shareholders as well as ensuring 
continuity of supply and support for its 
customers and secure employment and 
development for its colleagues. As this 
Report details, HSS generated revenues  
of £335.8m which was shared amongst 
the various stakeholders in our business 
including our suppliers and their own 
supply chains, our colleagues and 
investors, the government and our local 
communities as well as a retained element 
to help fund future investment and growth.
We operate with integrity and transparency 
to ensure the highest levels of environmental 
and social governance with a strong 
management team and robust governance 
structures in place. We work to – and are 
audited against – a number of external 
accreditations, including the British ISO 
standards for health and safety and the 
environment. We are Safe Hire accredited 
and members of the British Safety Council. 
We are also FORS accredited for our 
commercial vehicle fleet.
 Full details of our corporate governance are set out

Listening to  
our customers 
We recognise that HSS plays an important 
and vital role in the supply chain and 
operations of our customers, so we take  
a responsible approach towards ensuring 
that we deliver a service which meets their 
expectations. Part of this commitment 
includes surveying our customers at all 
levels and industries on a regular basis to 
assess the service they receive from us, 
and where they believe there is scope to 
improve. For a number of years we have 
partnered with TNS to conduct thorough, 
impartial NPS interviews with our customer 
base twice each year. This insight has 
directly impacted our strategy and 
operations, and led to positive change 
which improves the hire experience we 
offer our customers. The NPS score we 
achieved this year is significantly higher 
than the industry benchmark of 21.

product lifecycle
There are environmental and social 
impacts at every stage of the product 
lifecycle of all the equipment in our fleet, so 
we are committed to sourcing, operating 
and disposing of our equipment in the 
most responsible way possible. Our 
innovative, purpose-built refurbishment 
centre in Manchester has provided the

Reducing 
environmental impact 
though our operations 
We work responsibly to limit potential 
negative environmental impacts which 
arise from our day-to-day business 
operations. We are committed to driving 
energy efficiency within our built 
environment as well as through our 
operational networks. We work to, and are 
accredited against, industry recognised 
environmental standards, and work hard 
to regulate our use of natural resources, 
reduce polluting emissions and minimise 
waste. 
We are accredited to ISO and OHSAS 
standards: 
 → 9001 Quality
 → 14001 Environment
 → 18001 Health and Safety Policy 
(OHSAS) 
From April 2018 the 9001 and 14001 
accreditations will be audited against the 
revised standards criteria. The OHSAS 
18001 standard is transferring to the new 
ISO 45001 standard later in 2018. We are 
currently working towards our 
reaccreditation. 
Greenhouse gas emissions
The Group reports on all of the emission 
sources required under the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
as amended in 2013. We use GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard data gathered to fulfil 
the reporting requirements under the CRC 
energy efficiency scheme and Defra 
conversion factors to calculate all building 
and transport emissions within the three 
reporting scopes: 
 → all direct greenhouse gas emissions 
from sources owned or controlled by 
the Company;
 → indirect greenhouse gas emissions from 
the consumption of purchased 
electricity, heat or steam; and
 → other indirect emissions; here we report 
business travel.
Unless otherwise stated all data is 
provided for the period 1 April 2016 to  
31 March 2017. This reporting period does 
not cover the same period covered by the 
Financial Statements, but has been 
adopted to allow the majority of data used 
to be actual recorded data rather than 
estimated consumption. 
The total emissions produced by the 
Group during this period were 27,853.8

Colleagues
Central to the successful delivery of our 
strategy are our people. Our colleagues 
make HSS, so we are committed to 
ensuring we create a diverse workforce, 
representative of the communities in 
which we operate. Colleague safety is 
our utmost priority, and we aim to provide 
for and protect their wellbeing and invest in 
their training and development to ensure 
that they are both appropriately skilled 
and motivated. In 2017 we were pleased 
to see a continued reduction in RIDDOR 
occurrences thanks in part to an increased 
internal focus on safe working practices. 
Our commitment to offering continued 
training and development for our 
colleagues at all levels saw us move 
to a blended approach to learning, 
encompassing training courses delivered 
online, through the management 
population, as well as more traditional 
classroom or depot-based learning. 
Colleagues involved in professional 
diploma or certification programmes 
are allowed time away from their roles 
to complete these each year. 
As at 30 December 2017, 15% of all of our 
colleagues were female. Despite this figure 
being in line with many other companies 
in our industry, we recognise the need 
to improve this. Our gender pay gap report 
has demonstrated our commitment to 
rewarding all colleagues at a fair and 
equal level regardless of gender.

Communities
Our extensive branch and operations 
network allows us to play a part in 
hundreds of communities across the UK 
and Ireland, and we are committed to 
making a positive impact wherever we can. 
Our head office in Manchester regularly 
holds dress down days to raise money 
for our charity partners, and we donate 
the 5p charge from all our carrier bags 
to Dementia UK. We are also committed 
to supporting educational efforts in our

Chairman’s Introduction
Ensuring good 
governance is 
an integral part 
of our business
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the corporate governance report 
for the 2017 financial year.
This part of the Annual Report provides an overview of the Group’s existing 
approach to corporate governance and how we continue to evolve our corporate 
governance structure(s) to better mitigate risk and ensure compliance with 
prevailing legislation on an ongoing basis. Reports from the Chairs of each 
of the sub-committees of the Board (the Audit, Nomination, Market Disclosure 
and Remuneration Committees) are included in the following pages and outline 
the work and initiatives each has undertaken during the year.
During the course of 2017 we saw a number of changes take 
place within the Company; however, our vision that corporate 
governance should form the backbone of our culture remains 
unchanged. We have strong governance structures through our 
Committees, systems and policies and together these contribute 
to our day-to-day activities, the protection of our assets and the 
delivery of our business plan.
Alan Peterson
Chairman
28 HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 29
The main corporate governance issues 
addressed by the Board or one of the 
four sub-committees of the Board during 
the year were as follows:
Strategic Review
During 2017 , the Board engaged with 
an independent party to work with HSS 
management, to undertake the most 
extensive review of the business to date. 
Three key Strategic priorities were identified; 
1 Delever the Group
2 Repair the Tool Hire business
3 Strengthen commercial proposition
As a result of our findings, a number  
of cost control initiatives have been 
implemented. This is to ensure that the 
business is operating as efficiently and 
effectively as possible, and that it is well 
placed to recover from its disappointing 
performance in the first half of 2017 and 
improve shareholder returns.
The Board remains confident that the 
changes implemented will position the 
business to drive improved earnings per 
share. Our focus in 2017 has been firmly 
on cost control, operational and capital 
efficiency and driving a clear competitive 
advantage from our enhanced customer 
proposition.
Board evaluation
We completed our 2017 internal Board 
and Committee evaluation in early 2018. 
Further details on this process and its 
findings are provided in the Nomination 
Committee report on pages 40 and 41. 
The Nomination Committee is 
recommending that all Board Directors  
are re-elected at our Annual General 
Meeting (AGM).
Senior management reorganisation
In early 2017, we made further 
appointments to our senior leadership 
team, including a Group HR Director and a 
Chief Commercial Officer, the latter being 
specifically focused on reinvigorating our 
core Rental and related revenue growth. In 
June 2017 we appointed Steve Ashmore 
as our new CEO, replacing John Gill who 
stepped down from the Group, having 
served for eight years in the Company. 
Legislative/regulatory change and 
related training for colleagues
The Directors and senior management are 
informed of notable legal and regulatory 
changes via a combination of internal 
legal and audit professionals and also 
via external advisers. During 2017 and 
continuing into 2018, the Group has 
assessed and is implementing changes 
as required in preparation for the GDPR 
becoming law in 2018. 2017 also saw the 
introduction of the Criminal Finances Act, 
placing increased emphasis on controls to 
prevent the facilitation of tax evasion. HSS 
has given top level commitment to this, 
including a new policy, a risk assessment 
and bespoke e-learning training modules. 
The Group has also continued to monitor 
its policies and procedures in respect of 
the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and will 
publish an anti-slavery and human 
trafficking statement for FY17 during 2018. 
The Group released its gender pay gap 
report which shows a gap of 8.2%, 
significantly lower than the national average 
of 18.1%. We are committed to creating a 
fair and equal reward structure across our 
workforce, regardless of gender. 
Equality and diversity policy
The Group’s equality and diversity policy 
applies across all levels of the business, 
including at Board level, and is designed 
to reflect the importance that we believe 
promoting equal opportunities and diversity 
plays in the long-term success of HSS.
Currently we have one female Non-
Executive Director, meaning 50% of our 
Independent Non-Executive Directors are 
female and 17% of the Board is female. 
Further detail on the gender split for senior 
management and employees is provided 
within the Strategic Report on page 25. 
Based on our annual Board evaluation 
we believe that the current mix of 
experience, background and perspectives 
amongst the Directors contributes to the 
effectiveness of the Board as a whole; 
however, we recognise that female 
representation and diversity at Board level 
remains limited and represents continuing 
development opportunities for the Group.
As and when Director or senior 
management appointments are being 
made or succession planning is being 
undertaken, all candidates are considered 
on merit and against objective criteria, 
with due regard for the benefits of diversity 
on the Board and amongst the senior 
management team, including gender.
Further details on our approach to equality 
and diversity can be found on page 25  
and within our Corporate Responsibility 
Report available for download at www.
hsshiregroup.com/corporate-responsibility.
Looking ahead
The implementation of the findings from our 
Strategic Review and the new management 
team give me great confidence that we have 
assembled a strong operational team and an 
experienced Board, both of which will drive 
the long-term success of the business. 
In December, the management team 
presented the findings of the Strategic 
Review, which determined that the current 
size of the network, 255 locations, was the 
appropriate level for the Group. This was 
much lower than originally envisaged when 
the NDEC was set up and therefore the 
network was no longer cost-effective. 
On this basis, the testing of fast moving 
core hire fleet has been moved back into 
the branch network with engineering 
consolidated into a number of CDCs, 
ensuring continued high product utilisation 
and capital efficiency. 
As a Board we remain confident that the 
changes we have implemented through 
this period, and continue to implement, will 
position the business to drive improved 
shareholder returns in what remains a 
competitive and fragmented marketplace.
I once again look forward to meeting 
shareholders at our next AGM, which will 
be held at 11.00am on 21 June 2018 at 
Hilton Garden Inn, Hatton Cross.

HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance
Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and as such has complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) during the FY17 reporting year, 
noting the following:
The Code recommends that at least half the Board of Directors 
of a UK-listed company, excluding the Chairman, should 
comprise Independent Non-Executive Directors. Independence 
is determined by ensuring that, apart from receiving their fees for 
acting as Directors, Non-Executive Directors do not have any other 
material relationship or transactions with the Group, its promoters, 
its management or its subsidiaries, which in the judgement of the 
Board may affect their independence of judgement.
Thomas Sweet-Escott, a Non-Executive Director, is not 
considered to be independent for the purposes of the Code 
as he represents Exponent Private Equity (Exponent) and 
related investors (the Exponent Shareholders), who currently 
control 50.3% of the Company’s issued shares. 
Code Provision B.1.2 provides that a smaller company should 
have at least two Independent Non-Executive Directors. A smaller 
company is one that is below the FTSE 350 throughout the year 
immediately prior to the reporting year, which is the case in 
respect of the Company. Therefore, as at 30 December 2017, the 
Company is compliant with the requirements of the Code in this 
respect. On 22 January 2015, the Company, Exponent and the 
Exponent Shareholders entered into a Relationship Agreement 
which regulates the ongoing relationship between them. The 
principal purpose of this agreement is to ensure that the Company 
and its subsidiaries are capable of carrying on their business 
independently of Exponent and the Exponent Shareholders and 
that any transactions and relationships between them are at arm’s 
length and on normal commercial terms.
The Code is publicly available at the following web address:

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Corporate Governance
All the individuals who were Directors as at 30 December 2017 
offer themselves for re-election at the next AGM of HSS Hire 
Group plc to be held at 11.00am on 21 June 2018 at Hilton 
Garden Inn, Hatton Cross.
The biographical details of each of the Directors, including details 
of their other directorships and relevant skills and experience, 
are on pages 30 and 31 of this Annual Report and are also set out 
in the Notice of AGM.
The Board recommends that shareholders approve the 
resolutions to be proposed at the AGM relating to the re-election 
of all of the Directors. 
Terms and conditions and time commitments
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are all appointed 
pursuant to formal letters of appointment which outline, 
amongst other details, the remuneration and term of 
appointment for each Director.
The Chairman devotes such time to the affairs of the Company as 
is required by his duties. In addition, in 2017, the Non-Executive 
Directors devoted their time in carrying out their duties, which 
included attendance at meetings as reflected in the above table. 
In order to facilitate proper debate and consideration, all Directors 
are expected to attend Board and Committee meetings to which 
they are invited in person.
The Executive Directors of the Company may attend certain 
meetings of the Committees at the invitation of the Chairman 
of the respective Committee. These attendances are not 
recorded in the table set out above. 
Conflicts of interest
Exponent and the Exponent Shareholders currently control 
50.3% of the Company’s issued shares.
Thomas Sweet-Escott is a partner at Exponent and Alan Peterson 
has a long-standing business relationship with Exponent and is 
chairman and/or a director of BBI Group Holding Limited, BBI 
Acquisition Limited, EAGLE SPV 2 Limited and EAGLE SPV 3 
Limited, all of which are Exponent portfolio companies. The 
Group trades on an arm’s length basis with certain Exponent 
portfolio companies.
Amanda Burton is a Non-Executive Director of the parent 
company of a customer of the Group. 
The Board has satisfied itself that such customer is not material 
enough to create a potential conflict of interest. In the event that 
HSS’s relationship with any customers or other companies where 
any of the Directors are also appointed as directors becomes 
material by virtue of their trade with the Group or another 
business reason, the relevant Director would be expected to 
declare their connection to the customer/company and the Board 
would assess whether a conflict of interest arises and the 
appropriate action to be taken. Save as set out above, there are 
no current or potential conflicts of interest between any duties 
owed by the Directors or senior management to the Company 
and their private interests or other duties.
Any Directors’ conflicts of interest are declared to the Board and 
recorded by the Company Secretary.
Effectiveness
Board composition
The Board and Committees are considered to have an 
appropriate range of experience, skills and knowledge to fulfil 
their duties. Profiles of each of the members of the Board are 
provided on pages 30 and 31.
The four Non-Executive Directors, Alan Peterson, Amanda 
Burton, Doug Robertson and Thomas Sweet-Escott, represent  
a majority of Board members and provide a broad range of  
skills and experience.
The two Executive Directors, Steve Ashmore and Paul Quested, 
bring a variety of sector experience to the Board. Amanda Burton 
and Doug Robertson are considered independent. They are 
members of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees 
of the Board. Both the Market Disclosure and Remuneration 
Committees are chaired by an Independent Non-Executive 
Director, Amanda Burton. The Audit Committee is chaired by  
an Independent Non-Executive Director, Doug Robertson. 
Appointments to the Board
The Nomination Committee, which is composed entirely of 
Non-Executive Directors, is responsible for any future 
appointments to the Board. The Nomination Committee is chaired 
by the Chairman of the Board, Alan Peterson. By virtue of the fact 
that the majority of its members are Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, the Nomination Committee is considered independent.

Board training
As part of induction, any new Directors receive training from the 
Company’s sponsors/brokers in relation to their responsibilities as 
a Director of a listed company. The Board also receives regular 
updates on legal and regulatory developments through the course 
of a financial year as reflected in the Chairman’s Introduction on 
page 29. 
Access to information and support
The Board is provided with an agenda and supporting papers and 
documentation ahead of each Board and/or Committee meeting to 
allow them time to read, review and consider the information and 
analysis presented. The Board also has access to the Company 
Secretary and can request independent advice at the Company’s 
expense where they believe it is appropriate and valuable to do so. 
Senior management are also frequently invited to present at Board 
meetings as deemed appropriate, and the Board can access such 
colleagues at any time.
Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations, and as set out in the Directors’ Responsibility 
Statement (see page 53), the Board considers that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess HSS’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the nature 
and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take to achieve 
its strategic objectives and for establishing and maintaining 
a sound system of risk management and internal control, and 
then reviewing its effectiveness.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company and 
how these are being managed/mitigated are detailed on pages  
14 to 17. 
The Group’s risk management and internal control system is 
designed to manage the risks facing the Group and safeguard 
its assets. No system of internal control can provide absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Group’s 
system is designed to provide the Directors with reasonable 
assurance that issues are identified on a timely basis and are 
dealt with appropriately. 
The Audit Committee (whose composition, remit and report are 
set out on page 33 and pages 37 to 39) assists the Board in 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems. This is carried out with 
the assistance of the Chief Financial Officer and the Risk and 
Assurance Director which is supported by the findings of 
specific projects/investigations completed by the internal 
audit team, the findings of which are presented to the Audit 
Committee during the financial year.
Whistleblowing
The Company has a formal whistleblowing process, whereby any 
colleague may, in complete anonymity, contact certain nominated 
members of senior management to raise any concerns. These 
concerns are then investigated independently and the results 
shared with the whistleblower for further discussion if appropriate/
possible. This process is communicated to all colleagues at least 
annually to their home addresses, and the policy and relevant 
details are also made available to colleagues on a dedicated 
section of the Group intranet, HSS World. 
Modern Slavery Act 2015
The Group published its Modern Slavery Act statement for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2016 on its website in 2017.
Going concern and long-term viability statement 
Note 1(g) of the Financial Statements sets out the basis on which 
the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
In summary, taking into account the adequacy of the Group’s 
debt facilities, current and future developments and the principal 
risks and uncertainties (see pages 14 to 17), and after making 
appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Financial Statements included within this Annual Report.
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a three-year period, taking into account the 
Group’s current position, strategic plans, and the potential impact 
of the principal risks and uncertainties documented on pages 14 
to 17. Based on this assessment, and all other matters considered 
and reviewed at Board level during the year, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period to 26 December 2020.
Whilst the Directors have no reason to believe the Group is not 
viable over a longer period they have determined that three years 
is the appropriate time over which to provide the viability 
statement because:
 → it reflects a period over which the Directors can have a 
reasonable view of the future in the context of the market 
environment in which the Group operates; and
 → it is consistent with the time covered by the Group’s current 
strategic plans and model.
The Group’s annual budgeting and forecasting process involves 
the preparation of an annual budget, and a rolling three-year 
strategic model that also includes planned strategic actions and 
other specific assumptions regarding revenue growth, cost trends 
and capital expenditure across the Group.
Where appropriate, sensitivity analysis is undertaken to test the 
resilience of the Group to various scenarios. Whilst all of the 
principal risks and uncertainties were considered, the following 
were considered in greater detail during the sensitivity analysis: 
macroeconomic conditions and competitor challenge, in addition 
to a changing cost profile. 
The principal effects assessed, together with their impact on the 
Group’s Financial Statements, were therefore:
 → reductions in Rental and related revenue growth rates (market 
or company specific) and the associated impacts on capital 
expenditure requirements and the Group’s variable cost base;
 → delays in the achievement of network change cost savings;
 → delays in achieving other planned cost reductions; 
 → increases in costs at a higher rate than currently planned;
 → lower liquidity levels due to an increase in debtor days; and
 → changes in finance cost – LIBOR increases, affecting the cost 
of the Revolving Credit Facility.

HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Corporate Governance
In addition to the mitigating factors identified on pages 15 to 17, the 
Board noted that: the Group has a diversified customer base; a 
history of winning new customers; and low customer concentration 
with only one customer currently accounting for more than 10% of 
revenues and the top 20 customers accounting for less than 30% 
of revenues. Alongside this the Group has a continuous profile of 
lease expiries that allows a material portion of the portfolio to be 
exited in any one year and the Group’s ability to match capital 
investment to customer demand acts to support cash generation. 
With regard to sources of finance, the Board has no reason to 
believe the Group will not be able to refinance the Group’s existing 
£136m senior secured notes and RCF before they become 
repayable in 2019. The Directors reiterate their intention to 
refinance these facilities before they become current in July 2018 
and to provide the Group with a capital structure with increased 
levels of liquidity.
Statement on disclosure of information to the auditor
The Directors who held office as at 5 April 2018 each confirm that:
 → a) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
 → b) he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Remuneration
The Remuneration and Audit Committees are composed exclusively 
of Independent Non-Executive Directors, able to judge and achieve 
an appropriate balance between incentivising Executive Directors 
and the potential impact on the Company’s risk profile.
The Remuneration Committee (whose composition, remit and 
report are set out on page 33 and pages 42 to 49) sets the policy 
for and terms of executive remuneration. 
Relations with shareholders and other capital providers
Shareholder engagement 
The Board remains committed to communicating with shareholders 
and stakeholders in a clear and open manner, and seek to ensure 
effective engagement through the Company’s website, its public 
announcements, the AGM and other investor relations activities.
In addition to its ongoing reporting obligations, the Company 
undertakes a programme of meetings with existing and/or 
potential institutional investors and equity analysts, led by the 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. These 
meetings, together with investor feedback collected via our 
brokers, enable the Company to assess prevailing analyst and 
investor sentiment and to obtain external feedback on how the 
Group’s performance and strategy are perceived and considered. 
A summary report on investor interaction and feedback is 
provided to each Board meeting through the year to keep the 
wider Board informed of these activities and findings.
During 2017 there have been a total of over 80 such meetings/
presentations, including quarterly results presentations and a 
Strategy Update presentation held in December. 
As well as such meetings and announcements, teleconference 
calls are held with institutional investors and analysts throughout 
the year; copies of relevant presentation materials are made 
available on the Company’s website to the extent they differ 
from the latest publicly released results presentations.
All Directors are expected to attend the AGM, providing 
shareholders with the opportunity to question them about issues 
relating to the Group, either during the meeting or informally 
afterwards. The Non-Executive Directors are available for 
discussion with shareholders on matters under their areas of 
responsibility either in person at the AGM or at any other time 
via the Company Secretary. 
The Company reports its financial results to shareholders twice 
a year, with the publication of its Annual and Half-Year Financial 
Reports. Shorter, less detailed trading updates are also provided 
to the market on a quarterly basis. 
The Company also produces quarterly financial reports 
consolidated at the Hero Acquisitions Limited group level to meet 
the reporting obligations of the Notes issued in February 2014. 
The Notes are held within HSS Financing plc, a wholly owned 
direct subsidiary of Hero Acquisitions Limited, itself a wholly 
owned subsidiary of HSS Hire Group plc. The quarterly reports 
are therefore principally of use to noteholders as they provide 
information on the financial performance of the Notes’ guarantor 
group rather than the Company and Group. To aid shareholders’ 
understanding of the difference between Hero Acquisitions 
Limited’s and HSS Hire Group plc’s consolidated results, the 
Company provides the afore mentioned trading updates for HSS 
Hire Group plc on a quarterly basis.
All of the above mentioned reports are made available for download 
to noteholders and shareholders in the investor relations section of 
the Company’s website, www.hsshiregroup.com/investor-relations.

Audit Committee Report
Doug Robertson
Committee Chairman
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Audit Committee (the Committee), I am pleased 
to present our report for the 2017 financial year. 
The Committee has reviewed the contents of the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts and advised the Board that it considers the 
Report to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.
Roles and responsibilities
The Committee has responsibility for overseeing the financial 
reporting and internal financial and risk management controls of 
the Company, as well as maintaining an appropriate relationship 
with the external auditor and reporting its findings and 
recommendations to the Board.
The Committee’s full terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website at www.hsshiregroup.com/investor-relations/
corporate-governance. A summary of its key responsibilities include:
 → receiving and reviewing the Annual Report and Accounts and 
half-yearly Financial Statements and all related public financial 
announcements, and advising the Board on whether the Annual 
Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable;
 → receiving and reviewing reports from the external auditor;
 → monitoring the external auditor’s effectiveness and 
independence and approving their appointment and  
their terms of engagement;
 → monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management system;
 → reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
financial controls and internal control and compliance systems, 
and advising the Board as appropriate; and
 → overseeing the Group’s procedures for detecting fraud and 
whistleblowing arrangements.
Core activities
The Committee met eight times in 2017. All members attended 
these meetings.
The Committee’s core activities during 2017 included, and will 
include in 2018:
 → reviewing and enhancing disclosure in areas of judgement 
of estimates within the notes to the Financial Statements;
 → reviewing internal control systems and policies;
 → regular review of the work and findings of the internal 
audit function;
 → considering risk management systems;
 → reviewing the risk register; and
 → meeting with the external auditors, agreeing their audit plan 
and assessing their findings.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Corporate Governance
Audit Committee Report 
continued
Ad hoc activities
Specific additional work streams undertaken by the Committee 
during the year included responding to a thematic review of the 
Group’s 2016 accounts by the Financial Reporting Council. 
Positive feedback on the presentation and disclosure in the 
accounts was received and minor recommendations for 
improvement have been noted and acted upon. Additionally, 
the Committee has considered the impact upon the Group  
of the Anti-facilitation of Tax Evasion implications of the 2017 
Criminal Finances Act which will come into force during 2018.
External financial reporting
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing  
the Financial Statements and reviewing compliance with legal, 
regulatory and statutory requirements, giving due consideration 
to the provisions of the Code.
The Committee reviewed the annual and interim Financial 
Statements and trading updates released during the year 
with particular focus on the following significant areas:
 → hire stock existence and valuation;
 → carrying value of goodwill and other intangible and 
tangible assets;
 → revenue recognition – cut-off, sales rebates and credit 
note provisions; 
 → onerous lease provisions
 → management assessment of going concern; and
 → exceptional items.
These areas are identified as significant due to their complexity, 
size, level of judgement required and/or potential impact on the 
Financial Statements and our strategy.
An overview of each of these areas is set out below:
Hire stock existence and valuation
Rental income earned on materials and equipment held for hire 
which is owned by the Group (hire stock) is a large component  
of the Group’s revenues. As such the existence of hire stock is 
important to the ongoing ability of the Group to generate revenue 
from its assets. Certain of the Group’s funding arrangements are 
also linked to specific assets or asset classes. The Committee 
has therefore given careful consideration to the controls in place 
to verify the physical existence and appropriate valuation of hire 
stock together with the processes for verifying the reliability of  
the accounting systems and records, and has concluded that 
appropriate systems are in place.
Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets
The carrying value of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets was 
reviewed at the year end. A consistent methodology is applied to 
each of the individual cash-generating units, taking account of 
market outlook, risk-adjusted discounted future cash flows, 
sensitivities and other factors which may have a bearing on 
impairment considerations. As a result of this work the Committee 
has concluded that no impairment provisions are required.
Revenue recognition – cut-off, revenue-related rebates  
and credit note provisions
The Committee examined the procedures and controls in place  
to ensure that the reporting and recognition of revenue, especially 
for open hires over the year end, and also whether the recognition 
of any revenue-related rebate accruals or credit note provisions is 
appropriate and complete.
Onerous lease provisions
The Committee reviewed with management the basis of property-
related provisions for properties that the Group no longer utilises 
(dark stores), including the estimates and judgements applied by 
management in assessing the existence and level of provision. 
The Committee assesses that the approach adopted is reasonable.
Going concern
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.  
The Group has made losses during the financial year and 
operated with a limited amount of headroom on its main banking 
facilities throughout 2017. The Senior Secured Notes and the 
Revolving Credit Facility are both due for repayment during 2019 
and the Committee has reviewed the cash flow forecasts and 
sensitivity analysis and has satisfied itself that the business will  
be able to refinance these obligations and that accordingly it  
is appropriate to adopt the going concern assumption in the 
preparation of the accounts.
Exceptional items
The Committee reviewed with management the expenses 
classified as exceptional during the year, which included the 
significant provision made in respect of the onerous agreement 
with Unipart following the decision to modify the NDEC 
agreement and to move the maintenance of fast moving products 
back into the branch and distribution centre network. The loss  
on sale of the TecServ and Reintec businesses has been included 
as an exceptional item. Additionally exceptional items included 
one off costs relating to cost reduction projects and preparatory 
work for the debt refinancing that the Group will complete during 
2018 and onerous leases on dark stores and associated asset 
impairments. The Committee assesses that the approach 
adopted in respect of exceptional items is appropriate.
External auditor
The Committee oversees the Group’s relationship with the 
external auditor (BDO) and formally reviews the relationship, 
policies and procedures to ensure its independence. BDO’s 
also reports to the Committee on the steps it has taken through 
the year to safeguard its independence and to comply with the 
relevant professional and regulatory requirements. The BDO 
partner in charge of the audit is Kieran Storan. He has held  
this role for three years. The maximum term for which he can 
perform this role is five years.
BDO has been auditor to certain companies within the Group for 
14 years since its appointment in respect of the 2004 year end, 
with the lead audit partner being rotated on a regular basis, most 
recently in 2015. The last tender for the audit of HSS Hire Service 
Group Limited and its subsidiaries occurred in 2005.
38 HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 39
BDO has been auditor to the Public Interest Entity, HSS Hire 
Group plc for three years, following its incorporation in January 
2015. It is the Group’s intention to put the audit of the Public 
Interest Entity out to tender at least once every ten years. The 
Company has therefore complied with the relevant provisions of 
the Competition and Markets Authority Final Order on the statutory 
audit market and the Statutory Auditors and Third Country 
Auditors Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/649) and the transitional 
arrangements therein for the year ended 30 December 2017.
During the year the Committee has reviewed and agreed the 
scope of BDO’s work, its audit fees and terms of engagement 
for the half-year interim results review and full-year FY17 audit. 
The fees for audit services paid to BDO are set out in note 6 of 
the Financial Statements.
The Committee also reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
audit process during the year. This assessment was based on 
the Committee’s interaction with BDO at Committee meetings 
and through feedback from the Group Finance team on its 
interaction with BDO. As a result of this exercise, the Committee 
has satisfied itself that BDO continues to provide an effective 
external audit service to the Company and its subsidiaries and 
the Committee has made a recommendation to the Board that 
a resolution for the re-appointment of BDO be proposed at 
the AGM.
Non-audit work and independence
The Committee maintains a policy for non-audit services provided 
by the Group’s external auditor which segregates services into 
Permitted Engagements, Excluded Engagements and Potential 
Engagements. The policy is available on the Group’s website at 
www.hsshiregroup.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance. 
The policy is designed to ensure that in the event the Group’s 
external auditor is engaged to provide non-audit services the 
provision of those services does not impair nor can it be seen  
to impair the external auditor’s independence and objectivity. 
During 2017, BDO provided non-audit-related services to the 
Group, principally to support the preparatory work undertaken 
for the debt refinancing project which will complete during 
2018. Notwithstanding this the Committee concluded that the 
independence of the auditor has not been compromised in any 
way. The fees for non-audit services paid to BDO are set out in 
note 6 of the Financial Statements.
Risk management and internal controls
An overview of the Company’s approach to risk, risk management 
and internal controls through 2017, together with a summary of 
the principal risks facing the Group, is provided on pages 14 to 17.
During 2017 the Committee reviewed the overall risk management 
and internal control framework, the work and role of the internal 
audit team and the underlying process for capturing and reporting 
risk and control data. This assessment was assisted through the 
provision of various documents through the year by the Chief 
Financial Officer, Risk and Assurance Director and other senior 
personnel in the head office functions. These documents include, 
but were not limited to: quarterly risk management summary 
documents, which assess any changes in risk profiles, descriptions 
and ratings through the year; and quarterly summaries of work 
completed and work planned by the internal audit team, 
assessing both areas of risk and the existing controls in place.
As a result of this review, and the work streams undertaken 
through the year, the Committee has satisfied itself that the 
Group has an appropriate risk management and internal 
control framework in place. This work will continue in 2018.
Whistleblowing
The Committee believes that appropriate arrangements and 
policies are in place to facilitate the proportionate and independent 
investigation of, and implementation of, appropriate follow-up 
action in relation to confidential concerns raised by staff via the 
whistleblowing process (see page 35).
Meeting schedule
The Committee meets at least three times a year at appropriate 
times in the financial reporting and audit cycle. Additional 
meetings can be scheduled where deemed necessary by the 
Chairman. The external auditor, Chief Financial Officer and Risk 
and Assurance Director are normally invited to attend a number  
of these meetings. Other members of the senior management 
team attend as invited and as appropriate to the content matter 
being discussed.

Roles and responsibilities
The Committee’s full terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website at www.hsshiregroup.com/investor-relations/

been considered by the Board.
Activities
The Committee met on one occasion in 2017 to carry out routine 
business. Otherwise, there were no occasions during the year

Our approach
The Committee’s primary purpose is to ensure that the Group  
has the best possible leadership and clear plans for Director 
succession. Its primary focus is therefore to concentrate upon the 
strength of the Board and the selection of the best candidates for 
posts, based on objective criteria.
Policy on diversity
In performing its activities through the year, the Committee has 
applied the Group’s equality and diversity policy, which it believes 
is appropriate for application at all levels of the business, including 
Board and senior management appointments and/or succession 
planning. Further detail on the Group’s equality and diversity 
policy is provided on page 29.
Activities
The Committee had two scheduled meetings in 2017 to deal  
with routine business, as well as liaising on ad hoc matters  
(such as directorate changes) arising over the course of the year. 
At the meeting held in March 2017, the findings of the internal Board 
evaluation in respect of FY16 were considered and resulting 
actions, as reported in the 2016 Annual Report, were agreed. 
At the meeting held in July 2017, senior management potential 
and succession planning were discussed, the Committee 
acknowledging that the new Chief Executive Officer has only 
been in the role since June 2017 and therefore needed some time 
to review matters. The Committee also undertook an annual 
review of its terms of reference and agreed that they remained 
appropriate for the business. The Committee’s terms of reference 
can be found on the Company’s website at www.hsshiregroup.
com/investor-relations/corporate-governance.
The Group engaged with Blackwood Recruitment LLP 
(Blackwood), an external search consultancy firm, to assist in  
the search for its new Chief Executive Officer. The Group has 
previously engaged with Blackwood in relation to other senior 
management roles and for the purposes of the external Board 
evaluation carried out in 2015. The Group continues to maintain 
an arm’s length relationship with Blackwood.
So far in 2018 one meeting has been held, in March, to  
discuss findings and agree actions following the 2017  
internal Board evaluation.
The actions for 2017 agreed by the Committee have been 
reviewed by the Committee and also by the Board, noting  
in particular as follows:
 → Composition of the Board – the Company remains 
compliant in terms of number of Independent Non-Executive 
Directors and it was agreed that the number of Directors and 
balance on the Board remains appropriate at the current time.
 → Board meetings – there had been a better balance of 
discussion between operational and strategic matters during 
2017, largely driven by the Strategic Review undertaken by  
the Company.
 → Communication – the Board members considered that  
the reporting and quality of information provided had 
significantly improved.
 → Succession planning – there had been a number of senior 
appointments and some new senior roles created in the 
Company during 2017, but no significant progress had been 
made as regards Director succession during 2017, partly as  
a result of recent changes at that level. It had been noted,  
in particular, that there were increased numbers of female 
colleagues in senior roles in the organisation, as a result of 
both promotions and external appointments.
Board evaluation
The FY17 Board evaluation comprised an internal evaluation of the 
Board using feedback collated from Board members’ responses 
to an evaluation questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed the 
key requirements of the Code in relation to the Board and its 
sub-committees, including each Committee’s terms of reference, 
composition and frequency of meetings. Additional questions 
focused on leadership, the relationship between the Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors, the role of the Chairman, issues  
of material importance concerning the Group and information  
on the Group’s risk management systems. The responses to the 
questionnaire were discussed by the Committee and the Board, 
with the Committee determining any required actions following 
the evaluation. 
Following a discussion of the responses, the Committee 
considered it appropriate to focus on the following actions 
areas during 2018:
 → Succession planning – the Committee determined that, 
since limited progress had been made in this area during 
FY17, it should remain an area of focus for the Committee 
during FY18. The Committee agreed to work proactively with 
the Chief Executive to progress this during the financial year 
and review further at the end of the year. 
 → Board meetings – the Committee agreed that there was 
now a better balance of discussion at Board level between 
operational matters and strategic matters. The Committee 
determined that it was important to continue to review 
progress on implementation of the Strategic Review in order 
to maintain momentum in this area.
 → Post-implementation reviews – the Committee 
determined the importance of looking back, as well as 
forwards, to review important decisions taken around 
acquisitions, material contracts and other matters in order 
to draw out what had been successful, what had been less 
so and to take those learnings forward.
Meeting schedule
In 2018, the Committee has scheduled meetings in March and 
September and any additional meetings will be arranged as required.

Directors’ Remuneration  
Report
No performance bonuses were 
awarded to Directors in a year 
where we missed our financial 
targets. Following the recruitment 
of Steve Ashmore as our CEO, the 
Company received shareholder 
approval to grant an exceptional 
Long Term Incentive Plan award 
to the Executive Directors and the 
wider leadership team outside of 
the approved policy. This award 
will vest over a four-year period  
to the end of FY20 and will require 
a significant turnaround in 
performance in order to vest.
Amanda Burton 
Committee Chair
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report in respect of the year ended 30 December 2017 . 
The Group’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved at the 
FY16 AGM with a vote in favour of 99.96% and can be reviewed in 
the FY15 Annual Report available at hssannualreport2015.com. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration, which provides details of the 
remuneration earned by Directors in FY17 and how we intend to 
apply the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in FY18, is available on 
page 44. At the FY18 AGM, to be held on 21 June 2018, the Annual 
Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote.
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website at www.hsshiregroup.com/investor-relations/
corporate-governance. 
How we link executive remuneration to our strategy
We take a disciplined approach to executive remuneration, 
ensuring that we incentivise and reward the right behaviours 
to support the overall strategy of the Group. Our executive 
remuneration arrangements are designed to support the Group’s 
strategic priorities. In the summary below, we have highlighted 
how certain elements of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy relate 
to those strategic priorities.
The culture of our business means that we seek to ensure we 
have the same approach to reward for all our colleagues where 
appropriate and therefore have designed a reward framework 
which we can cascade consistently and one which is relevant  
not only for our Executive Directors but also for our senior team 
who participate in the Annual Bonus and the Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP).
Annual bonus Focus on profitability and growth: The 
two principal performance measures for the 
annual bonus last year were Adjusted EBITA 
and Net Leverage Ratio (Net Debt/Adjusted 
EBITDA) reflecting our focus on cash-
generative profitable growth and a healthy 
balance sheet. For FY18 the Committee has 
introduced a third measure based on growth 
in core hire rental revenue. This new measure 
emphasises to our annual bonus participants 
the focus on a return to growing and 
developing an important part of our business. 
This will account for 30% of the bonus, 
balanced against a profit measure (30% of the 
bonus) and our Net Leverage Ratio measure 
(30% of the bonus), and the Committee 
considers that these provide a balanced 
and appropriate approach for FY18. The 
Committee has also changed the profit 
measure from EBITA to EBITDA to make it 
consistent with our Leverage Ratio measure. 
Finally recognising the importance of health 
and safety which is a key part of our values 
and how we operate, the Committee has 
introduced a specific health and safety 
measure relating to the reduction in RIDDORs 
which will equate to 10% of the bonus.
Executive Directors are required to defer the 
part of the award earned (if any) in excess of 
50% of the maximum award into shares over  
a two-year period. The additional two-year 
holding period provides further alignment 
with shareholders and a longer-term focus 
on creating sustained value for the business.
42 HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 43
LTIP Awards granted with three-year performance 
targets which reflect the Group’s focus on 
profitability, growth and operational efficiency. 
The additional two-year holding period 
provides further alignment with shareholders 
and a longer-term focus on creating sustained 
value for the business.
In FY17 we made special awards of market value options to our 
senior management team to directly align reward to our strategic 
plan. This was an exceptional award, which was in place of the 
LTIP, and for which we sought shareholder approval. Further 
details are provided below and on page 45.
FY17 performance and annual bonus outcome
The FY17 annual bonus was subject to Adjusted EBITA 
performance as regards 80% of the overall opportunity and 
Net Leverage Ratio (Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA) performance 
as regards 20% of the overall opportunity. The threshold Adjusted 
EBITA and Net Leverage Ratio targets were not achieved based 
on FY17 performance. Accordingly no element of the bonus has 
been earned. 
The Company’s first long-term incentive awards were granted 
under the LTIP in April 2016 and therefore there was no vesting 
during the year. 
FY17 long term incentive award
The Company received shareholder approval (support in favour 
was over 97%) via an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on 
10 August 2017 to grant an exceptional long term incentive award 
to the Executive Directors (and the wider leadership team) outside 
of the current Directors’ Remuneration policy. The awards, which 
are structured as market value share options, will vest subject to 
the achievement of a challenging EPS performance measures 
over a four year period through to the end of FY20. A one year 
holding period will apply post-vesting. The awards have been 
designed to align the variable remuneration of the Executive 
Directors (and the wider leadership team) with strong financial  
and business performance, promoting the long term success  
of the Company and the creation of long term shareholder value. 
Steve Ashmore and Paul Quested were granted awards with  
a face value equal to 460% and 320% of salary respectively. 
Further details are set out on page 45. 
Reward for FY18
Executive Director salaries
In line with the salary review timetable for all other employees, the 
Executive Directors’ base salaries were reviewed in June 2017. 
Paul Quested’s salary was maintained at the same level as in 
FY16 in line with salaries in the wider workforce which had no 
increase. Steve Ashmore was appointed as CEO on 1 June 2017 
and did not receive a salary increase in FY17. This timetable will 
be followed again in June 2018, with any changes taking effect 
from 1 July 2018. Any increase is expected to be modest and  
in line with the range of salary increases awarded to other 
employees in the Group. 
Annual bonus
No changes are proposed to the maximum opportunity or 
structure of the annual bonus although as outlined above the 
performance measures have been extended. The overall bonus 
opportunity will remain at 100% of salary. The annual bonus will 
be subject to core hire rental revenue growth (30% of the overall 
opportunity), Adjusted EBITDA performance (30% of the overall 
opportunity), Net Leverage Ratio (30% of the overall opportunity) 
and a reduction in RIDDORs (10% of the overall opportunity). The 
Committee considers that these measures are aligned with the 
key areas of focus for the senior team over the next 12 months. 
LTIP
It is the Committee’s intention to grant LTIP awards with a 
maximum opportunity of 125% of salary in line with our Policy. 
LTIP awards will vest subject to performance over a three-year 
period ending with FY20. The performance measures are 
currently under review. The Committee is mindful of the impact of 
the refinancing on the Group’s three-year plan numbers and has 
therefore decided to wait until this has been agreed before setting 
the targets for the FY18 LTIP. Full details of the targets will be 
provided in the FY18 Directors’ Remuneration Report. The LTIP 
awards will include a two-year holding period following the end 
of the performance period.
Conclusion
I hope that you will agree that these proposals are appropriate to 
the circumstances of the business and the challenges it has faced 
in FY17 and are fully aligned to the strategy over the next three 
years, and that you will support the resolution being proposed at 
the FY18 AGM in relation to the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

FY17 annual bonus 
Executive Directors were awarded a maximum bonus opportunity equal to 100% of base salary subject to Adjusted EBITA 
performance as regards 80% of the overall opportunity and Net Leverage Ratio (Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA) performance as regards 
20% of the overall opportunity. These performance measures aligned reward with the key areas of focus over FY17. 
In the event that Executive Directors are awarded an annual bonus in excess of 50% of the maximum annual bonus opportunity for that 
year, they are required to defer any annual bonus award earned in excess of 50% of the maximum award into shares over a two-year 
period. Deferred shares are not subject to any additional performance measures after the application of the performance measures

Payments made to former Directors during the year
John Gill resigned as a Director with effect from 23 May 2017. 
As announced by the Company on 22 May 2017, it was agreed that John Gill would receive a payment in lieu of notice of £381,849 
in accordance with his service agreement and £45,000 by way of compensation for the termination of his service agreement. The 
payment was made in instalments and would be reduced in the event that he commenced another role prior to the expiry of his notice 
period. The reduction is up to 50% of the basic salary or fee earned under the alternative role. John Gill subsequently advised the 
Company that he had commenced another role and this has reduced the potential amount payable by £4,811. Total payments under 
this arrangement made to John Gill up to 30 December 2017 were £285,122.
John Gill did not receive any annual bonus payment in respect of FY16 and will not receive any annual bonus payment in respect of 
FY17. His SAYE options have lapsed in full, but his FY16 LTIP awards did not and will vest if the performance conditions are satisfied, 
pro-rata for his period of service. 
The Company made a payment of £2,640 in respect of John Gill’s legal fees relating to his resignation as a Director.
Directors’ share interests
The Committee has adopted a shareholding guideline for Executive Directors in accordance with which the Chief Executive Officer 
is required to build up and maintain a shareholding in the Company at least equivalent in value to 200% of annual salary, and other 
Executive Directors are required to build up and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to 125% of annual salary. 
The Chief Executive Officer held no shares in the Company and has until 31 May 2022 to build his shareholding to 125% of his annual 
salary (and 200% of his annual salary as soon as possible following 31 May 2022). Since joining the Group in August 2016 the Chief 
Financial Officer has built his shareholding in the Company from 0% to 15% of annual salary and under the guidelines has until 
21 August 2021 to build his shareholding to 125% of his annual salary. 
The interests of the Directors and their connected persons in the Company’s ordinary shares as at 30 December 2017 (or, if earlier, the 
date on which the Director resigned from the Board) were as follows:

The table below sets out, in relation to salary, taxable benefits and 
annual bonus, the percentage change in pay for the CEO and the 
average percentage change for the wider workforce. For these 
purposes, the wider workforce includes all Group employees who 
were continuously employed by the Group during FY17 and FY16 
but excludes Executive and Non-Executive Directors. Whilst the 
table below shows a 6.1% increase in CEO pay, this reflects the 
differential in salary between the new and outgoing CEO. Steve

in FY17.
2 The wider workforce received no pay rises during the year except for where team 
members were promoted, took on additional responsibilities or received a rise in 
line with National Minimum Wage legislation.
3 Taxable value of benefits received in the year comprising medical insurance and 
company car or car allowance. 
4 No annual bonuses were awarded in respect of FY16 or FY17.
Spend on pay and distributions to shareholders
The following table sets out the overall expenditure on pay (as  
a whole across the organisation) and the amount of distributions 
to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks in 
respect of FY16 and FY17. No dividend was paid during FY17 
as the Board is focused on reducing net debt and, after careful 
consideration of significant cash investments made during 2016 
and the Strategic Review and associated cost reductions 
announced in December 2017, believes it is in the best interests  
of the shareholders to not pay dividends at the present time.

Implementation of Directors’ Remuneration Policy  
for FY18
Information on how the Company intends to implement the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy for FY18 is set out below.
Salary/fees and benefits
In line with the salary review timetable for all other employees, the 
Executive Directors’ base salaries will be reviewed during June 2018, 
with any changes taking effect from 1 July 2018. Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees will be reviewed during the year. Any increase to  
any Executive Director’s salary or Non-Executive Director’s fee is 
expected to be modest and will be in line with the range of salary 
increases awarded to other employees in the Group. 
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for FY18 will remain 
at 100% of salary. The bonus will be subject to stretching 
performance measures based on core hire rental revenue growth 
(30% of the overall opportunity), Adjusted EBITDA performance 
(30% of the overall opportunity), Net Leverage Ratio (30% of the 
overall opportunity) and a reduction in RIDDORs (10% of the 
overall opportunity).
The Committee considers that the performance targets should 
remain confidential to the Company as they give our competitors 
an insight into our plans and expectations. However, each of the 
targets (which have been set by reference to the FY18 budget 
and require outperformance of the budget for the maximum 
bonus to be earned) will be fully disclosed in the FY18 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on the same basis as the FY17 disclosure 
set out on page 45. 
LTIP
It is the Committee’s intention to grant FY18 LTIP awards on the 
same basis as the FY16 LTIP awards were made. The maximum 
opportunity will be 125% of salary which is set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The performance measures are 
currently under review. The Committee is mindful of the impact of 
the refinancing on the Group’s three-year plan numbers and has 
therefore decided to wait until this has been agreed before setting 
the targets for the 2018 LTIP. Full details of the targets will be 
provided in the 2018 Directors’ Remuneration Report. The LTIP 
awards will include a two-year holding period following the end 
of the performance period.

and Doug Robertson. 
The Remuneration Committee meets as often as is deemed 
necessary, but in any event at least three times a year. The 
Committee’s key responsibilities include:
 → reviewing the appropriateness of the Group’s  
Remuneration Policy;
 → considering all elements of individual remuneration for  
the executive management team, including base salary, 
bonuses and performance-related pay, discretionary 
payments, pension contributions, benefits in kind and  
share options or their equivalents;
 → formulating performance criteria in relation to performance-
related pay;
 → reviewing terms and conditions and ensuring clawback or 
other provisions are in place so as not to reward failure;
 → administering Company share schemes as required; and
 → ensuring compliance with Code and disclosure requirements.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
During FY17, the Committee received independent advice from 
Deloitte LLP in relation to the Committee’s consideration of 
matters relating to Directors’ remuneration. Deloitte’s fees for this 
advice during the year were £22,020 (FY16: £40,860), charged 
on a time and disbursements basis or fixed fee depending on 
the nature of the project. Deloitte also provided advice to the 
Company during the year in relation to share plans. Deloitte is a 
founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as 
such voluntarily operates under its Code of Conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration in the UK. The Remuneration Committee is 
satisfied that all advice received was objective and independent.

Directors’ powers
At the AGM to be held on 21 June 2018, shareholders will be 
asked to renew the Directors’ power to allot shares, grant rights  
to subscribe for or convert any security into shares or buy back 
shares in the Company and to renew the disapplication of 
pre-emption rights.
Directors’ indemnities
In addition to the indemnity provisions in their Articles of 
Association, the Company and other Group companies have 
entered into a direct indemnity agreement with each of the 
Directors and certain other officers or senior employees of the 
Group. These indemnities constitute qualifying indemnities for  
the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and remain in 
force at the date of approval of this Report without any payment 
having been made under them. The Company also maintains 
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance which gives appropriate 
cover for legal action brought against its Directors.
Political donations and expenditure
At the AGM held on 14 June 2017, the Company and its 
subsidiaries were authorised to make certain political donations or 
incur political expenditure. No political expenditure was made by 
the Company or its subsidiaries during the FY17 year (FY16: £nil).
Financial instruments
Information on the Group’s financial risk management objectives 
and policies and the exposure of the Group to market risk, credit 
risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk is provided in note 22 of the 
Financial Statements on pages 99 and 100.
Events and developments impacting the Company 
The likely future developments of the Company and Group are 
referred to in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review on page 9  
in the Strategic Report. 
Branches outside the UK
The Company has no branches outside the UK and Ireland, as 
defined in Section 1046(3) of the Act.
Acquisition of own shares
At the AGM held on 14 June 2017, the Company was authorised 
to make market purchases of up to 15,476,190 or 10% of the 
current ordinary shares in issue. The Company has made no 
purchases of its own ordinary shares pursuant to this authority. 
This authority expires at the close of the 2018 AGM of the 
Company on 21 June 2018. A special resolution will be proposed 
at this year’s AGM to authorise the Company to make market 
purchases of up to 17,020,714 (10% of issued share capital of 
170,207,142) ordinary shares.
Equality and diversity
The Group is committed to developing all colleagues and 
encourages everyone to progress and develop. All training is 
based on each colleague’s individual development needs and  
the requirements of the role. Provisions are made to ensure that 
all part-time colleagues have equal opportunities to undertake 
development and training. 
The Group’s policy is to recruit and promote based on an 
individual’s skills, qualifications, experience and ability to  
do the job. No applicant, whether internal or external, will be 
discriminated against in respect of age, sex, sexual orientation, 
disability, race, religion, or beliefs, or on any other criteria 
unrelated to an individual’s ability to perform in the role. 
If an employee becomes disabled during employment, the Group 
makes every effort to enable them to continue in employment by 
making reasonable adjustments in the workplace and providing 
retraining for alternative work where necessary.
The Group is committed to ensuring that the abilities of all of its 
colleagues are recognised and valued at all levels of the 
organisation through:
 → focusing on what people can do rather than on what 
they cannot;
 → challenging stereotypes about people with disabilities; and
 → making appropriate adjustments in the workplace to support 
colleagues with disabilities to achieve their full career potential.
Other Statutory
Disclosures
50 HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 51
The Group will not include any discriminatory or subjective criteria 
in job descriptions or job advertisements. All recruitment will be 
made solely on the basis of competence and skill. Where an 
applicant has a disability (as defined by the Disability Discrimination 
Act 1995) consideration will be given as to whether any adjustments 
can be made to accommodate individual requirements.
The Group is committed to ensuring that the diversity of the 
communities served is reflected at all levels within the workforce 
and that an understanding and awareness of diversity is 
promoted in all training and development material. 
Performance reviews are completed with every colleague and 
focus on measuring job performance and each individual’s 
training requirements.
Employee involvement
The Company uses a combination of ways to communicate with 
employees including, but not limited to: the intranet (HSS World) 
that is regularly updated and available on PCs at all locations;  
its internal newsletter (HIYA!), that reports on recent news, 
developments, initiatives and events in the business which is 
circulated a minimum of four times annually and delivered to  
all locations; and a weekly email ‘bulletin’ supplementing this  
with operational and functional information, that is required to be 
printed and displayed on all notice boards where colleagues may 
not have immediate access to email. Meetings and conference 
calls also form a regular communication channel across the 
Group. The method of information dissemination adopted 
depends on the information being made available to employees 
and the associated confidentiality requirements. The Company 
also sends correspondence of high importance by mail to 
employees’ home addresses. 
Employees are consulted formally on issues where their interests 
are affected via consultation processes led by management and 
are asked to give feedback. Colleagues are also invited to raise 
issues via the online communications forum ‘Yammer’ and 
receive feedback. 
Focus groups have also been carried out at key Group locations, 
to discuss employee engagement and gain more detailed 
feedback from employees.
The Company’s financial results and performance are regularly 
communicated via a number of mechanisms, for example the 
update and provision of information to senior colleagues on 
the same day that announcements are made to investors at 
the half-year and full-year and supplements in the Company 
newsletter HIYA! At the senior colleague conference calls, there  
is an opportunity to ask questions of the executive. Blogs and 
announcements ares also made Company-wide from our CEO  
via email providing the top-level results and factors contributing  
to our performance. 
Impact of change of control/takeover bid
There are no agreements between the Company and its  
Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a change of 
control/takeover bid.
A number of the Group’s funding agreements contain change 
of control provisions. These are summarised in the table below:
Funding agreement Summary of change of control provision
Senior secured notes Following a change of control the 
Group would be required to offer to 
repurchase all outstanding Notes 
at a purchase price in cash equal 
to 101% of the principal amount 
redeemed on the date of purchase 
plus accrued and unpaid interest,  
if any, to the date of purchase.
Revolving Credit Facility Following a change of control all 
outstanding amounts, together 
with accrued interest, would 
become immediately due  
and payable.
Finance leases (from various 
finance providers)
Certain of the Group’s finance 
leases have conditions where a 
change of control could lead to 
early repayment.
Restrictions on share transfers
Certificated shares
The Board may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to register the 
transfer of a certificated share which is not a fully paid share, 
provided that the refusal does not prevent dealings in shares in 
the Company from taking place on an open and proper basis. 
The Board may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated 
share unless the instrument of transfer is (i) lodged, duly stamped 
(if stampable), at the office or at another place appointed by the 
Board accompanied by the certificate for the share to which it 
relates and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably 
require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;  
(ii) is in respect of one class of share only; and (iii) is in favour of 
not more than four transferees.
Uncertificated shares
Subject to the provisions of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001, the Board may permit the holding of shares  
in any class of shares in uncertificated form and the transfer of 
title to shares in that class by means of a relevant system and  
may determine that any class of shares shall cease to be a 
participating security.
Shares with special rights with regard  
to control of the Company
There are no shares in issue with special rights with regard  
to control of the Company.
Shares related to employee share schemes
No shares have been issued in relation to employee share 
schemes, although options have been issued under the 
Sharesave scheme (as detailed earlier).
Voting rights and restrictions
Subject to the rights or restrictions set out below or detailed in the 
Notice of AGM, on a show of hands every member who is present 
in person shall have one vote and on a poll every member present 
in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which 
he is the holder.
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting in 
respect of a share unless all monies presently payable by him  
in respect of that share have been paid.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Corporate Governance
If at any time the Board is satisfied that any member, or any  
other person appearing to be interested in shares held by such 
member, has been duly served with a notice under Section 793  
of the Act and is in default for the prescribed period in supplying 
to the Company the information thereby required, or, in purported 
compliance with such a notice, has made a statement which is 
false or inadequate in a material respect, then the Board may,  
in its absolute discretion at any time thereafter by notice to such 
member, direct that, in respect of the shares in relation to which 
the default occurred, the member shall not be entitled to attend  
or vote either personally or by proxy at a general meeting or  
at a separate meeting of the holders of that class of shares  
or on a poll.
The Notice of AGM specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights 
and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions 
to be passed at the AGM. All proxy votes are counted and the 
numbers for, against or withheld in relation to each resolution are 
announced at the AGM and published on the Company’s website 
after the meeting.
Under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules, the election  
or re-election by the shareholders of an Independent Non-
Executive Director must be approved by an ordinary resolution  
of the shareholders and separately approved by those 
shareholders who are not controlling shareholders (the 
independent shareholders). 
As a result, by virtue of Exponent’s 50.3% shareholding in the 
Company, any votes by Exponent on any resolutions relating  
to the election or re-election of Independent Non-Executive 
Director(s) will not be counted for the purposes of approving  
those resolutions.
Agreements between holders of securities
The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders  
of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Unless otherwise determined by ordinary resolution, the number 
of Directors shall be not less than two but shall not be subject to 
any maximum in number. Directors may be appointed by ordinary 
resolution of shareholders or by the Board.
Under the Relationship Agreement, Exponent is able to appoint a 
Non-Executive Director to the Board for so long as the Exponent 
Shareholders are entitled to exercise or to control the exercise of 
10% or more of the votes able to be cast on all or substantially all 
matters at general meetings of the Company. Mr Sweet-Escott  
is the current appointee. In addition, in accordance with the 
Relationship Agreement, Exponent has appointed an observer  
to attend Board meetings.
At every AGM all Directors at the date of the Notice of AGM  
shall retire from office and resolutions for the re-appointment of 
those Directors who wish to be re-appointed shall be put to the 
meeting. All appointments are subject to the Company’s Articles 
of Association and the annual re-election by shareholders.
The Company may remove any Director from office, and appoint 
another person in place of a Director removed from office, both by 
ordinary resolution. 
A person ceases to be a Director as soon as:
 → he/she ceases to be a Director by virtue of any provision  
of the Act or is prohibited from being a Director by law;
 → he/she is subject to a bankruptcy order or compounds  
with his/her creditors generally;
 → he/she becomes physically or mentally incapable of acting as 
a Director and may remain so for more than three months;
 → he/she resigns or retires;
 → he/she is absent for more than six consecutive months 
without permission of the Board from meetings of the Board 
held during that period and the Board resolves that his/her 
office be vacated; or
 → he/she receives notice signed by not less than three-
quarters of the other Directors stating that that person 
should cease to be a Director.
Amendments to the Company’s Articles of Association

by the passing of a special resolution at a general meeting  
of shareholders.

Directors’ Responsibility 
Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial 
Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and Article 4 of the International 
Accounting Standards (IAS) Regulation and have elected to 
prepare the Company Financial Statements in accordance  
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and  
of the profit or loss for the Group for that period.
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are  
required to:
 → select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
 → make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
 → state whether IFRSs as adopted by the EU have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Financial Statements; 
 → prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
or parent Company will continue in business; and 
 → prepare a Directors’ Report, a Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Remuneration Report which comply with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report  
and the Financial Statements are made available on a website. 
Financial Statements are published on the Company’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of Financial Statements, which may vary from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The 
Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of 
the Financial Statements contained therein.
Directors’ responsibilities pursuant to  
Disclosure and Transparency Rule around  
Periodic Financial Reporting (DTR4)
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are detailed  
on pages 30 and 31, confirms that to the best of his or her 
knowledge:
 → the Group Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
and loss of the Group; and 
 → the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the financial position  
of the Group and the parent Company, together with a 
description or the principal risks and uncertainties that  
they face.

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of HSS Hire Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year 
ended 30 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
the Consolidated and Company statement of financial position, the Consolidated and Company statement of changes in equity, the 
Consolidated statement of cash flows, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and UK Accounting Standards including 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (“UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice”). 
In our opinion the financial statements:
 → give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 December 2017 and of the group’s 
loss for the year then ended;
 → the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 → the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
 → the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the parent company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the parent company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the parent company and the parent company’s members as a body, for our audit work,  
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to 
report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
 → the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 14 to 17 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
 → the directors’ confirmation set out on page 14 in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 → the directors’ statement set out on page 35 in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group and the parent company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements;
 → whether the directors’ statement relating to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) 
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 → the directors’ explanation set out on page 35 in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Independent Auditor’s Report to 
the members of HSS Hire Group plc
56 HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 57
Matter Our response
Existence and valuation of hire stock
Hire stock represents over 1 million items 
which have a high frequency of movement  
in individual assets through asset purchases, 
hires, disposals and transfers around the 
branch network. As such there is inherent 
difficulty in maintaining accurate fixed asset 
registers. Judgement is required in ensuring 
that depreciation charges are accurately 
calculated, having regard to economic useful 
lives and residual values, together with the 
impact of renovation work undertaken on 
specific classes of assets.
Refer to page 38 (Audit Committee Report), 
pages 68 and 69 (accounting policy) and  
page 90 (financial disclosures).
Our audit work in respect of this area included the identification and testing of the 
operating effectiveness of key controls in respect of the existence and value of hire 
stock, including the authorisation of additions, the use of unique asset identification 
numbers, and the reconciliation of the fixed asset registers to the accounting records.
We attended a sample of the hire stock asset counts to test the effectiveness of 
controls and performed test counts ourselves in order to ensure the accuracy of the 
counting performed, and therefore the existence of assets. We also tested that the 
records from the counts had been used to update both the fixed asset register and  
the accounting ledgers. 
We selected a sample of assets acquired in the year and agreed the amounts recorded 
on the fixed asset registers to invoices.
Using data analytical and reperformance techniques we recalculated the depreciation, 
additions and disposals in the fixed asset registers for the current year, and reconciled 
this to the charge included in the accounting ledgers. We reviewed for the principal 
asset classes the useful economic lives and residual values applied by management 
by reference to historic data on disposal values and the achieved lives of assets. 
We evaluated the capitalisation of the renovation work undertaken and tested for a 
sample of the assets that their useful lives had been extended by reference to their 
continuing hire.
We evaluated the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures of the judgements and 
estimates utilised in assessing the valuation.
Carrying value of goodwill  
and other intangible assets
Management performs an annual impairment 
review of goodwill, which also covers the 
carrying value of other intangible assets and 
property plant and equipment. The annual 
impairment review relies on significant 
estimation and judgement in selection of the 
key inputs which can have a significant impact 
of the calculated net present value for each 
Cash Generating Unit (CGU).
There is a risk that the estimates and 
judgements used in the impairment review  
for each CGU, which include areas such  
as forecast cash flows, discount rates, and 
growth rates are inappropriate and that an 
impairment charge may be required.
Refer to page 38 (Audit Committee Report), 
pages 69 and 70 (accounting policy) and 
pages 88 and 89 (financial disclosures).
Our audit procedures included detailed testing of the Directors’ impairment testing 
model for each CGU performed in the year. For each of the key inputs to the 
impairment model we reviewed managements’ assumptions by reference to Board 
approved budgets, historical trends, and reviewed the sensitivity analysis performed. 
We challenged management on their forecasts for revenue, costs and EBITDA in the 
impairment model particularly in light of the recent trading performance and 
operational model changes. In addition, we performed our own additional sensitivity 
analysis in respect of the key assumptions which included assessing by how much 
each assumption would need to change for an impairment to arise. We utilised our 
own valuation specialists, particularly around the appropriateness of the discount  
rates used by the directors comparing this against the cost of capital for the Group  
and other comparable companies in the industry.
We evaluated the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of the impairment 
testing, the inputs used and the sensitivity of the outcomes of the assessment to 
changes in key assumptions to validate that these adequately reflected the inherent 
risks in the valuations.

Revenue recognition
There is a risk that revenue is incorrectly 
calculated or recorded in the wrong period.
Revenue is accrued in the financial statements 
for hire equipment out on hire over the year 
end. There is a risk that accrued revenue may 
be incorrectly calculated.
There is also a risk that rebates payable to 
customers may be omitted or incorrectly 
calculated, and that credit note provisions  
may be incorrectly calculated.
In view of the potential for error or for 
management override of controls we consider 
this to be an area in which there is a significant 
risk of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. 
Refer to page 38 (Audit Committee Report), 
pages 70, 73 and 74 (accounting policies)  
and page 91 (financial disclosures).
Our audit work in respect of this area included the identification and testing of the 
operating effectiveness of key controls over revenue recognition. In respect of the front 
of house system we performed a reconciliation of revenue between that system and 
the accounting records.
We obtained the calculations of accrued revenue at the year end and the underlying 
data, and we recalculated a sample included in accrued revenue. For a sample of 
items we checked that there was a subsequent invoice to a third party and that the 
revenue recognition criteria used are in accordance with the stated accounting policy 
and in line with IFRS.
We tested the calculation of rebates payable for a sample of customers by reference  
to sales data and the underlying agreements, compared rebates by customer against 
those payable in previous years and investigated the reasons for significant variances, 
and considered the rebate arrangements in place with major new customers won in 
the year. 
We obtained the calculations of the credit note provisions at the year end and the 
underlying data for the credit notes issued in the year and the related invoices and 
confirmed the accuracy of the period taken to issue credit notes. We considered  
the credit note provision together with the bad debt provision which separately 
assesses the level of provision against receivables that are overdue for payment.  
We also considered the historic experience of trends in the issue of credit notes.  
Based on this we recalculated the credit note provision using our own estimates. 
We evaluated the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in relation to the estimation  
of the credit note provision.
Onerous lease provisions
The group has a significant number of 
property related provisions relating to the 
ongoing lease obligations of properties that 
the group no longer utilises in the business. 
The completeness and accuracy of the 
provisions involve management judgement 
and estimates in assessing the likelihood of 
mitigating future lease costs as a result of 
break clauses or sub-letting of the properties 
as well as other unavoidable costs and the 
appropriateness of discount rate used.
Refer to page 38 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 73 (accounting policy) and page 94 
(financial disclosures).
Our audit work involved checking a sample of the movements in provisions  
against prior years and obtaining and verifying explanations for material movements. 
For any newly created onerous lease provisions we reviewed and considered with 
management the basis of the provisions made, including a review of the lease terms  
in place.
We challenged management on the evaluation of future expected costs, assumptions 
used for break clauses and subletting and the basis of the discount rate applied.
We evaluated the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in relation to the judgements 
and estimates used in the estimation of the onerous lease provision.
Exceptional items
The group has classified a number of 
expenses as exceptional during the year, 
including the expected costs arising from the 
Network Reconfiguration, the cost reduction 
programme, onerous leases on non-trading 
stores and impairments of property, plant  
and equipment arising as a consequence, 
losses on sales of businesses, preparatory 
refinancing costs, Senior Management 
changes and costs of the strategic review.  
The identification and allocation of costs  
and income to exceptional items involves 
management estimation and judgement.
Refer to page 38 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 74 (accounting policy) and pages 78  
to 81 (financial disclosures).
We have obtained a breakdown of the costs classified by the group as exceptional  
and checked that they are in accordance with the accounting policy in respect of 
exceptional items. We have challenged management as to the basis of the allocation  
of these costs, and ensured that adequate disclosure was made of that basis within 
the financial statements. We have tested a sample of the costs to backing 
documentation and schedules.
In respect of restructuring provisions relating to the Network Reconfiguration we have 
assessed whether the criteria of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Assets and Contingent 
Liabilities, were met as at the year end, and reviewed the underlying contracts and 
agreements to evaluate the calculation of the onerous element of the provision. 
We have evaluated the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in relation to the 
exceptional items.
In addition, as in all our audits, we have addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Independent Auditor’s Report to the members  
of HSS Hire Group plc continued

Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements.  
We consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions  
of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.
We determined materiality for the group as a whole to be maintained at £1,000,000 (2016: £1,000,000) given the volatility of the  
results for the year and the similar levels of trading activities in 2016 and 2017 and having regard to the overall group loss. Materiality 
represents 5.4% of the group loss before tax and exceptional items disclosed in note 4. Materiality in 2016 was determined with 
reference to a benchmark of the group profit before amortisation of intangibles, interest and tax and exceptional items and  
represented 4.9% of that figure.
Materiality for the parent company was set at £900,000, being 90% of group materiality.
Performance materiality was set at 75% of materiality for the group audit, and 60% for the parent company. In setting the level of 
performance materiality we considered a number of factors including the expected total value of known and likely misstatements 
(based on past experience and other factors) and management’s attitude towards proposed adjustments.
Component materiality
We set materiality for each component of the group based on a percentage of between 19% and 90% of group materiality dependent 
on the size and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement of that component. Component materiality ranged from £190,000 
to £900,000. In the audit of each component, we further applied performance materiality levels of 60% to 75% of the component 
materiality to our testing to ensure that the risk of errors exceeding component materiality was appropriately mitigated.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all individual audit differences in excess of £50,000.  
We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The group’s accounting process is structured around a group finance function at its office in Heathrow, and at its head office in 
Manchester, which also act as a shared service finance centre for all of its UK companies. The group also maintains local finance 
teams for its Ireland operation and for part of one of its UK operations.
The group’s operating companies vary significantly in size, and we identified eleven reporting units at the year end which had non- 
trivial external transactions, seven of which, in our view required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size  
or risk characteristics. These seven units comprise over 90% of group turnover and over 90% of group gross assets.
All audit work on the seven units was performed by us, the group audit team. Our work on the other units comprised analytical 
procedures and certain tests of detail. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the group financial statements.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit  
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we  
are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information,  
we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other 
information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet  
the following conditions:
 → Fair, balanced and understandable (set out on page 35) – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual  
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary  
for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
 → Audit committee reporting (set out on pages 37 to 39) – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained  
in the audit; or
 → Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (set out on page 32) – the parts of the directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose  
a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial Statements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 → the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements and 
 → the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
 → adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 → the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
 → certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 → we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 53, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters which we are required to address
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the Board of Directors to audit the financial statements 
for the year ending 30 December 2015 and subsequent financial periods. In respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2017 we 
were reappointed by resolution of the members of the company at the annual general meeting held on 14 June 2017. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement is 3 years, covering the years ending 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2017 for the Company. 
Non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company and we remain 
independent of the group and the parent company in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.

Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows
For the year ended 30 December 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies
a) Reporting entity
The Company is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. These Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Company 
and its subsidiaries (the Group). The Group is primarily involved in providing tool and equipment hire and related services in the United 
Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. HSS Hire Group Limited was incorporated on 7 January 2015 as a private company limited by 
shares in the United Kingdom and re-registered as a public limited company on 19 January 2015. The Company listed its shares on 
the London Stock Exchange on 9 February 2015. The Group and Company Financial Statements were approved by the Board of 
Directors on 5 April 2018.
b) Statement of compliance
The Group Financial Statements of HSS Hire Group plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors have taken advantage of the option within section 390 of the Companies Act 2006 to prepare their Financial Statements 
up to a date seven days either side of the Company’s accounting reference date of 31 December, and these accounts therefore cover 
the period from 1 January 2017 to 30 December 2017 (2016: 27 December 2015 to 31 December 2016).
c) Functional and presentational currency
These Financial Statements are presented in pounds Sterling (£), which is the Group’s presentational currency. The functional currency 
of the parent and subsidiaries is pounds sterling, except for those that are incorporated in the Republic of Ireland, which have the euro 
as their functional currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.
d) Basis of preparation
These Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis with the exception of derivative financial instruments, which 
are measured at fair value on each reporting date. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these Financial Statements.
e) New accounting standards and accounting standards not yet effective
There were no new IFRSs or IFRICs that had to be implemented during the year that significantly affect these Financial Statements.
Standards effective in future periods
The following new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which are applicable to the Group, have been 
published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
 → IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance on the recognition, timing and measurement of revenue, 
and is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
 → IFRS 16 Leases, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, effective for 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
 → IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which replaces IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety, and is 
effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: This will replace IAS 18 which covers revenue arising from the sale of goods and 
the rendering of services and IAS 11 which covers construction contracts. The new standard is based on the principle that revenue 
is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer. The standard permits either a full retrospective or a modified 
retrospective approach for the adoption. The Group will adopt the new standard from 31 December 2017. The Group is of the opinion 
that IFRS 15 does not have any material impact on the financial statements as what is required by the standard is already applied as 
accounting policy by the Group. The Group also confirm that it does not expect to restate or recognise the cumulative effect to the 
previous year’s Financial Statements as at the date of the application of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases: The Group is in the process of assessing the impact that the application of IFRS 16 will have on the Financial 
Statements, but it is expected to be material given the number of operating leases the Group has entered into, as detailed in note 23. 
IFRS 16 will require the Group to recognise a liability and right of use asset for the majority of the leases currently treated as operating. 
This will affect fixed assets, current and non-current liabilities, and the measurement and disclosure of expenses associated with the 
leases (depreciation and interest expense compared to operating lease rentals currently). The standard will also impact a number of 
statutory measures such as operating profit and cash generated from operations and alternative non-IFRS financial performance 
measures used by the Group. It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effects of the adoption of IFRS 16 until a 
detailed review has been completed, given the complexity of the standard and volume of leases. The full impact of IFRS 16 will greatly 
depend on the facts and circumstances at the time of adoption. Accounting requirements for lessors are substantially unchanged from 
IAS 17. The group will adopt the standard from 30 December 2018.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, 
introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. The Group will adopt IFRS 9 from 
31 December 2017. The standard introduces:
 → New requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities
 → A new model for recognising provisions based on expected credit losses; and
 → Simplified hedge accounting by aligning hedge accounting more closely with an entity’s risk management methodology.
The adoption of IFRS 9 is unlikely to have a material impact on the consolidated results of the Group.
Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements

1. Accounting policies continued
f) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing these Financial Statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of 
the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and other disclosures. The estimates 
and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as 
a result of new or further information. Such changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.
Key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying value of assets and liabilities over the next year are set out below.
Estimates
Useful economic life and residual value of assets – see note 1(k)
Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment – see note 1(l)
Onerous lease provision – see note 1(y)
Dilapidations provisions – see note 1(y)
Restructuring provisions – see note 1(y)
Judgements
Recoverability of trade receivables – see note 1(o)
Onerous contract provision – see note 1(y)
Exceptional items – see note 1(cc)
g) Going concern
Note 22 includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for capital management and for financial risk management including 
market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and asset risk.
The directors have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s debt facilities with specific regard to the following factors:
 → there is no requirement to redeem any of the senior secured notes until 1 August 2019.
 → The borrowings under the revolving credit facility are not due for repayment until 6 July 2019, unless the Group has not refinanced 
the senior secured notes by 30 September 2018 when the revolving credit facility may become, at the option of the lenders, 
repayable on 30 April 2019.
 → the terms and financial covenants relating to the revolving credit facility secured by the Group, as detailed in notes 17 and 22.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, and senior debt and 
interest repayments falling due, as detailed in note 17, show that the Group is expected to be able to operate within the level of its 
current facilities for the foreseeable future.
After reviewing the above, taking into account current and future developments and principal risks and uncertainties, and making 
appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these Financial 
Statements.
h) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights 
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred.
Unless merger accounting has been adopted in specific circumstances, the Group applies the acquisition method to account for 
business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the 
liabilities incurred to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes 
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in 
the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised 
in the profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity 
then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

h) Basis of consolidation continued
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
i) Segment reporting
IFRS 8 Operating segments requires operating segments to be reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the management team, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer and Chief Commercial Officer. Details of the Group’s segments are given in note 2.
j) Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are translated into an entity’s functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign currency translation gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the income statement. Foreign currency translation gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash 
and cash equivalents are presented in the income statement within finance income or finance expense. All other foreign currency 
translation gains and losses are presented in the income statement within administrative expenses.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to 
the Group’s presentational currency, Sterling, at foreign currency exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. 
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period, which approximates the foreign 
currency exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations 
are reported in other comprehensive income. Where required, any translation into the Group’s presentational currency follows the 
policy for foreign operations.
k) Property, plant and equipment
Use of estimates – useful economic life and residual value of assets 
The Group’s policy for applying useful economic lives and residual values of assets has been determined through applying historical 
experience and taking into consideration the nature of assets and their intended use, and achieved values on sale when disposed.
The net book value of materials and equipment held for hire was £118.6 million at 30 December 2017 (2016: £133.9 million) and the 
related depreciation charge was £29.0 million (2016: £27.9 million). The majority of hire stock items are given no residual value. Certain 
plant (powered access and power generation) have residual values of between 10% and 20% of original cost.
No sensitivity analysis has been given in relation to the useful economic life and residual value of assets held for hire due to the volume 
of the items involved and the complexities of the current system used by the group to record property, plant and equipment. Instead, 
the directors regularly review useful economic lives and residual values to ensure that the depreciation charge is appropriate. The 
Group will also be introducing a new property, plant and equipment recording system during 2018 which will be able to capture 
additional data to the one that is currently in use. Land and buildings comprise leasehold and freehold branches, workshops and 
offices, and are stated at cost, less depreciation or provision for impairment where appropriate. Land is not depreciated and 
depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual 
values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Material and equipment held for hire:
Tools and general equipment Two to ten years
Powered access Five to ten years
Power generation Five to ten years
Climate control Two to ten years
Non-hire assets:
Leasehold properties with less than fifty years unexpired Over unexpired period of lease
Freehold buildings and long leasehold properties Over fifty years
Plant and machinery Two to ten years
The Group reviews its depreciation policy annually. The effect of changes in the depreciation rates applied to specific assets in 2017 
has resulted in an increase in depreciation charge of £0.8 million (2016: a reduction of £4.2 million).
Materials and equipment held for hire purposes are stated at cost, less depreciation or provision for impairment where appropriate. 
Materials and equipment are written off over their useful economic life to the asset’s residual value which is estimated at between 20% 
of cost and nil. Residual values are only applied to powered access and power generation assets. Profits or losses arising when 
customers are invoiced for loss of equipment held for hire purposes are calculated by reference to average written down values.

For the year ended 30 December 2017
68 HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 69
1. Accounting policies continued
k) Property, plant and equipment continued
Gains and losses on disposals of materials and equipment held for hire are calculated as the difference between the proceeds received 
and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss. 
Impairment reviews are undertaken whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of property, plant and 
equipment may not be recoverable. If the fair value of a tangible asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount is increased 
to the revised estimate, but restricted so that the increased amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Any impairment losses or reversals are recognised immediately 
in the income statement.
l) Intangible assets
Use of estimates – impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 
These assets are reviewed annually or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment to ensure that they are not carried above 
their estimated recoverable amounts. To assess if any impairment exists, estimates are made of the future cash flows expected to 
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Actual outcomes could vary from such estimates of discounted future cash 
flows. Such calculations require assumptions related to the appropriate discount rate, the long term growth rate and also short term 
performance and cash flows. The directors consider historic performance as well as referencing to external information to arrive at 
these assumptions. Further details of the impairment reviews undertaken, assumptions and sensitivities are given in note 11.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred 
and the fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Impairment of goodwill 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units 
(CGUs), or groups of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. A CGU is the smallest group of assets 
that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or CGUs.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is 
the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not 
subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets acquired on acquisition
When an acquisition is completed intangible assets are separately identified from goodwill and measured at fair value. Brands are 
valued using the relief from royalty method. Customer relationships are valued using the excess of earnings method.
The HSS brand was first established in the late 1950s, and therefore given its longevity the directors consider the HSS brand to 
have an indefinite life and it is not therefore amortised, but instead subjected to annual impairment testing using the relief from royalty 
methodology to calculate the fair value of the brand. 
All other brands and customer relationships are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life. The directors have 
assessed the brands of ABird, UK Platforms and Apex and estimated that they have useful economic lives of 20 years. The directors 
have estimated the customer relationship intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of Hero Acquisitions Limited and Apex 
Generators Limited as having useful economic lives of 10 years. Amortisation is charged to administrative expenses.
Software development costs
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that 
are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised 
as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
 → it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
 → management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;
 → there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
 → it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
 → adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product  
are available; and
 → the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed 
four years.

HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies continued
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses. Other intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic life, and the amortisation 
charge is included within administrative expenses. 
Impairment of intangible assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives)
Impairment reviews are undertaken whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. 
If the fair value of an intangible asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount is increased to the revised estimate, but restricted so 
that the increased amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised in prior years. Any impairment losses or reversals are recognised immediately in the income statement.
m) Derivative financial instruments
Historically the Group has used a derivative financial instrument to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Derivatives are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each 
reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the 
fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than one year 
and is not expected to be realised or settled within one year. Where this is not the case, derivatives are presented as current assets or 
current liabilities. The Group did not have any derivative financial instruments in the current or prior year.
n) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Provision is made for those inventory items where the net realisable value 
is estimated to be lower than cost. Net realisable value is based on both historical experience and assumptions regarding estimated 
future sales value.
o) Trade receivables
Judgements – recoverability of trade receivables 
Judgements are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a provision against 
those receivables is required. The Group monitors the risk profile of debtors and makes provisions for amounts that may not be 
recoverable based on past default experience and the directors’ assessment of the economic environment. The recoverability of 
overdue receivables is considered together with the sales credit note provision. The Group makes provision for credit notes raised and 
expected to be raised after the end of the reporting period that relate to customer invoices raised before the end of the period, net of 
any impairment charges relating to the customer invoices. The Group’s bad debt and credit note provision is disclosed in note 14.
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, which is deemed to be the transaction price. Subsequently, trade and 
other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts 
due under the terms receivable, the amount of such provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present 
value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivables. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be 
collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
p) Cash
In the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term 
highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the statement of financial position, bank 
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities. 
q) Share capital and reserves
Ordinary shares
Financial instruments used by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial 
asset or a financial liability. The Group’s ordinary shares and preference shares are classified as equity instruments. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
Retained earnings/accumulated deficit
Cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Foreign exchange reserve 
This is the amount of gains/losses arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into sterling. In prior years, the balance 
was included in retained earnings but the directors have decided to show it in a separate component of equity this year. The 2016 
comparative has been restated accordingly.

For the year ended 30 December 2017

1. Accounting policies continued
Dividends
Dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the period in which they are 
declared by the Company. In the case of interim dividends, these are considered to be declared when they are paid and in the case 
of final dividends these are declared when authorised by the shareholders. 
Merger reserve
The merger reserve is the amount arising on the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued on the merger and the 
carrying value of the interest in the subsidiary. The merger reserve arose in 2015 when the Group underwent a capital reconstruction 
in advance of its initial public offering on 9 February 2015, and increased during 2016 via acquisition of a ‘cash box’ company.
r) Trade and other payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade payables are classified as 
current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less, otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities.
s) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no 
evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity 
services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
t) Cost of sales, distribution costs and administrative expenses
Cost of sales includes direct costs associated with the Group’s principal business of equipment hire. Such costs include hire stock 
rehire, cost of reselling plant and equipment, maintenance, depreciation, amortisation and asset write-off and disposals. Distribution 
expenses comprise vehicle costs and transport wages. Administrative expenses comprise principally staff and property costs and 
costs of acquisitions.
u) Non-IFRS financial measures
Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA, earnings before interest, tax and 
amortisation (EBITA) and Adjusted EBITA
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITA and Adjusted EBITA are non-IFRS and non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) 
performance measures used by the directors and management to assess the operating performance of the Group. 
 → EBITDA is defined as operating profit before depreciation, and amortisation. For this purpose depreciation includes the net book 
value of hire stock losses and write offs, and the net book value of other fixed asset disposals less the proceeds on those disposals. 
Exceptional items are excluded from EBITDA to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. 
 → EBITA is defined by the Group as operating profit before amortisation. Exceptional items are excluded from EBITA to calculate 
Adjusted EBITA.
The Group discloses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA as supplemental non-IFRS financial performance measures because 
the directors believe they are useful metrics by which to compare the performance of the business from period to period and such 
measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA are broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing 
the performance of the Group. Accordingly, the directors believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA 
provides useful information to users of the Financial Statements.
As these are non-IFRS measures, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted operating profit measures used by other entities may not be 
calculated in the same way and are hence not directly comparable.
v) Finance income and expense
Finance income comprises interest receivable on cash balances.
Finance expense comprises interest payable on borrowings, interest payable on finance leases, amortisation and write-off of debt 
issuance costs and the unwinding of the discount on non-current provisions. 
Interest is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest rate. Interest payable on borrowings includes a charge in 
respect of attributable transaction costs, which are recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest 
basis. The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the lease’s implicit 
interest rate.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies continued
w) Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial 
position date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the 
tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the statement of financial position. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition 
of goodwill. Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than 
a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is 
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date and 
are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, except for 
deferred income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the 
extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which 
the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle 
the balances on a net basis.
x) Employee benefits
Short term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be 
paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee 
and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Pension obligations
The Group operates employee optional stakeholder retirement and death benefit schemes. Both employees and employers are 
required to make contributions, with the employer’s contributions for each employee determined by the level of contribution made by 
the employee and the employee’s length of service within the Group or subsidiary company. The employer’s contributions are charged 
to profit and loss in the year in which the contributions are due.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the 
following dates: (a) when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a 
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and involves the payment of 
termination benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based  
on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 1 year after the end of the reporting period 
are discounted to their present value.
Share based payments 
Share based payment transactions in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments 
are accounted for as equity-settled share based payments. The grant date fair value of the share based payment granted to 
employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employee 
becomes unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model 
where required, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted and is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of 
awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

y) Provisions
Use of estimates – onerous leases
Provisions have been made for onerous leases on non-trading stores associated with the Group’s property portfolio. The carrying 
amount of the onerous lease provision will be affected by changes in the discount rate. The discount rate used to calculate these 
provisions is based on UK gilt yields to approximate a risk free rate and as at 30 December 2017 was 0.752% (2016: 0.48 %). The 
interest rate used in discounting the cash flows is reviewed annually. Further details of the assumptions and sensitivities are given in 
note 18.
The need for provisions for onerous leases against non-trading stores, measured net of expected rental income, is assessed when 
the leased property becomes vacant and is no longer used in the operations of the Group or when a decision has formally been 
made to do so. These provisions are recognised on a lease by lease basis. The determination of the onerous lease provision requires 
management, in conjunction with its third party property advisers, to make estimates about the ultimate cost to the Group, including 
the nature, timings and cost of exiting a lease, and any additional unavoidable costs, and the level of sublease income, if applicable. 
The actual costs and timing of cash flows are dependent on future events and market conditions. Any difference between management 
estimates and actual costs is accounted for in the period when such determination is made. 
Provisions for onerous leases, restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when:
 → the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events;
 → it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
 → the amount has been reliably estimated.
Use of estimates – dilapidations provisions
Leasehold dilapidations relate to the estimated cost of returning a leasehold property to its original state at the end of the lease in 
accordance with the lease terms. The cost is recognised as depreciation of leasehold improvements over the remaining term of the 
lease. The main uncertainty relates to estimating the cost that will be incurred at the end of the lease. Provisions for dilapidations are 
estimated based on surveyors’ reports where available and remaining properties are covered by estimates based on gross internal 
area. The Group’s dilapidation provision is disclosed in note 18.
Provisions for dilapidation are recognised in full when the related facilities are installed. A corresponding amount equivalent to the 
provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related property. The timing and amounts of future cash flows related to lease 
dilapidations are subject to uncertainty. The provision recognised is based on management’s experience and understanding of the 
commercial retail property market and third party surveyors’ reports commissioned for specific properties in order to best estimate 
the future outflow of funds, requiring the exercise of judgement applied to existing facts and circumstances, which can be subject to 
change. The amount recognised is the estimated cost of dilapidations, discounted to its net present value, and since the cash outflow 
can take place many years in the future, the carrying amount of the provision is reviewed regularly and adjusted to take account 
of changing facts and circumstances, including, the age and condition of the property, experience of actual spending, third party 
surveyors’ reports commissioned for specific properties, the Group’s specific lease obligations, market practice generally and any 
agreements specifically reached with landlords in respect of any given property. Changes in the estimated timing of dilapidations or 
dilapidations cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment to the provision, and a corresponding adjustment 
to property, plant and equipment. The unwinding of the discount on the dilapidations provision is included as a finance expense.
Use of estimates – restructuring provisions
Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments. Provisions are not recognised for 
future operating losses. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 
using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
Judgements – onerous contract provisions 
Contracts are considered to be onerous when cash is paid to a third party but the Group derives no economic benefit. In the case 
of the Group’s relationship with Unipart, following the agreement to cease the NDEC in December 2017 and the subsequent revisions 
to the contracts between the parties, £33.8 million will be payable over the period 2018 to 2026 for which the Group will receive no 
services. Accordingly this has been treated as an onerous contract.
z) Revenue recognition
The Group’s activities consist of supplying hire and equipment services within the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Revenue is 
measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
supplied, including compensation for damaged or lost hire stock, stated net of discounts, rebates, returns and value added taxes.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies continued
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and when it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the entity. Revenue is recognised as follows:
 → hire and rehire activities: over the period of hire on a straight-line basis;
 → resale and ancillary revenue to hire  
including fuel and consumables:
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer;
 → ex-hire fleet asset sales: when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer;
 → damaged/lost hire stock compensation: when the loss or damage is identified; and
 → training course and support services: when a right to consideration arises on the delivery of the training course  
or support service.
aa) Leases
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have 
transferred to the Group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the shorter of 
useful life and lease term with any impairment being recognised in accumulated depreciation. Leased assets are recorded at an 
amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of finance leases. 
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included in liabilities in the statement of 
financial position and analysed between current and non-current amounts. The interest elements of the obligations are charged to the 
income statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Operating lease 
rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Lease incentives are recorded as a liability and then recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis in the income statement as 
a reduction of rental expense.
bb) Fair value measurement
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial 
assets and liabilities. Set out below is an analysis of the valuation method of the Group’s financial instruments. 
The different levels in the fair value hierarchy have been defined as follows:
 → Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 → Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, for the asset or liability, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 → Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair values have been determined for measurement purposes based on the following methods:
Derivative instruments (level 2)
The fair values of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on the terms and 
maturity of each contract and using market interest rates as applicable for a similar instrument at the measurement date. Fair values 
reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Group entity and counterparty 
where appropriate.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts are calculated by management based on external valuations received from the Group’s 
bankers and are based on anticipated future interest yields.
cc) Exceptional items
Judgements – exceptional items 
The Group has classified a number of income statement items as exceptional during the year because of their size or nature or 
because they are non-recurring. 
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the income statement where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of 
the underlying financial performance of the Group. Exceptional items are items of income or expense that have been shown separately 
due to the significance of their nature or amount. During the year ended 30 December 2017 these include the cost of onerous leases 
(net of sub-let rental income) and the impairment of fixed assets related to closed branches, the cost reduction programme, senior 
management changes, preparatory refinancing costs, the strategic review and the costs of the network reconfiguration. Additionally in 
2016 exceptional costs included the cost of the establishment of the National Distribution and Engineering Centre (NDEC), pre-opening 
costs, IPO fees and a resale stock impairment. 
These are more fully discussed in note 4 and in our Financial Review.

2. Segment reporting
The Group’s operations are segmented into the following reportable segments:
 → Rental and related revenue; and
 → Services.
Rental and related revenue comprises the rental income earned from owned tools and equipment, including powered access, power 
generation, cleaning and HVAC assets, together with directly related revenue such as resale (fuel and other consumables) transport 
and other ancillary revenues.
Services comprise the Group’s rehire business known as HSS OneCall and HSS Training. HSS OneCall provides customers with a 
single point of contact for the hire of products that are not typically held within HSS’ fleet and are obtained from approved third party 
partners and HSS Training provides customers with specialist safety training across a wide range of products and sectors.
Contribution is defined as segment operating profit before branch and selling costs, central costs, depreciation, amortisation and 
exceptional items.
All segment revenue, operating profit, assets and liabilities are attributable to the principal activity of the Group being the provision of 
tool and equipment hire and related services in, and to customers in, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The Group has 
one customer which accounts for more than 10% of Group turnover (2016: Nil).

4. Exceptional items 
Items of income or expense have been shown as exceptional either because of their size or nature or because they are non-recurring.
During the year ended 30 December 2017 the group has incurred a number of exceptional items.
In the first half of the year the Group identified the need to reduce its cost base. A cost reduction programme identified annualised 
savings of £13 million, based on the Q1 2017 run-rate, to be achieved through a number of initiatives including closing branches, 
making efficiencies in the network and reducing headcount. This led to redundancy costs and provisions being made for onerous 
leases and the impairment of property plant and equipment.
Following the appointment of the new CEO the Group carried out a strategic review. In December 2017 it was announced that this 
had identified further annualised savings of between £10 million and £14 million to be achieved through a network reconfiguration 
and further headcount savings. This led to the recognition of an onerous contract, asset impairments and redundancy costs. 
Additionally to this the Group sold a business which was not considered core to its new strategy and incurred costs relating to 
reviewing the available options ahead of the planned refinancing of the Group’s borrowings during 2018.
As a result, during the period ended 30 December 2017, the Group has recognised total exceptional items of £66.6 million analysed 
as follows:

An analysis of the amount presented as exceptional items in the consolidated income statement is given below.
Onerous leases: branch and distribution centre closure 
The number of branches has been reduced to remove less profitable locations with activity centralised into fewer locations. 55 
branches were closed during the year (2016: 30). An exceptional cost of £6.9 million relating to onerous leases and dilapidations costs 
has been recorded in the year ended 30 December 2017 (2016: £4.5 million). Sub-let rental income on onerous leases for the year 
amounted to £0.9 million (2016 £1.1 million).
Impairment of closed branch property, plant and equipment
Following the branch closures management have conducted an impairment review of property plant and equipment in closed branches 
to determine what can be reused across the network. During the year ended 30 December 2017 an impairment of £8.3 million has 
been recorded, (2016: £nil).

4. Exceptional items continued
Cost reduction programme
The Group announced plans in the first half of the financial year 2017 to deliver significant cost reductions primarily by reducing head 
office headcount by redundancy and restructuring costs at the NDEC to drive operational efficiencies in the supply chain. Included 
in these costs is an asset impairment relating to the closure of the former head office in Mitcham and associated relocation costs of 
transferring transactional activity to the new head office in Manchester. During the year ended 30 December 2017 costs of £3.7 million 
are included as exceptional items relating to the cost reduction programme (2016: £nil). 
Senior management changes
During the first half of the year a number of senior management changes happened including the recruitment of a new Chief Executive 
Officer. Termination costs, legal fees and recruitment costs totalled £1.0 million (2016: £nil).
Strategic review
Following the appointment of the new Chief Executive Officer, a thorough Strategic Review was carried out by the Group. Non-recurring 
third party consultancy costs of £1.2 million were incurred for the period ended 30 December 2017 to support this review (2016: £nil). 
Network reconfiguration
The Strategic Review identified operational efficiencies that could be achieved through reconfiguring the Group’s supply chain model. 
Potential annual savings of between £7 million and £10 million were identified by moving the testing and repair of all fast-moving 
products closer to HSS’s customers, using the Group’s existing network of distribution centres and branches. In addition to the cost 
savings, these changes are expected to improve asset utilisation and availability of product. 
To realise these benefits, agreement was reached with Unipart who operated the Group’s National Distribution and Engineering Centre 
(NDEC) to terminate the remaining 8 year term of the contract. In terminating this contract the Group will make cash payments of  
£33.8 million over the period 2018 to 2026 as compensation to Unipart. In aggregate a discounted provision of £32.6 million has  
been made for these payments. Included in the above are one off cash payments of £6.5 million which will be made in 2018 to  
cover the immediate restructuring costs associated with the change, including redundancy, site decommissioning and exit costs  
from operating leases. 
The Group has impaired fixed assets of £1.9 million and software intangibles of £1.2 million relating to the operation of the NDEC. The 
Group has also impaired a security deposit of £4.5 million paid to Unipart prior to the opening of the NDEC as this will not be repaid. 
The total provision for network reconfiguration, including £0.5 million of legal costs, recorded within exceptional items amounts to 
£40.7 million (2016: £nil).
Business divesture
The Group sold businesses not considered core to the strategy. The Reintec branded fleet of cleaning machines and the associated 
Tecserv equipment maintenance business were sold on 16 November 2017 for a consideration of £1.5 million. After transaction costs, 
net proceeds were £1.2 million. This gave rise to a loss of £4.9 million including goodwill written off of £0.8 million. Further details on the 
disposal can be found in note 24.
Preparatory refinancing costs
Included within exceptional items for the period ended 30 December 2017 is an exceptional cost of £0.7 million in respect of 
preparatory costs for the refinancing of the Senior Secured Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility which are due for repayment 
in 2019. The Group expects to complete this refinancing in 2018. 
Group restructuring costs
In parallel with the implementation of the NDEC the Group changed its operating model during 2016 to a new Divisional structure. 
This resulted in a reduction in headcount leading to a redundancy cost of £1.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2016 which 
was included within administrative expenses.
Resale stock impairment
As part of the NDEC set up and branch and distribution centre closures, inventory held for sale was centralised into fewer locations 
leading to an inventory impairment of £1.6 million which was included within cost of sales in the year ended 31 December 2016.
Pre-opening costs
Included in exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2016 were £0.2 million of costs relating to new branch openings and 
relocations. These amounts have been included within administrative expenses.
IPO fees
Included in exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2016 were £0.1 million of fees relating to the IPO in February 2015 and 
related to professional adviser and broker fees, which were included within administrative expenses.

4. Exceptional items continued
NDEC establishment
During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group incurred exceptional costs of £10.2 million establishing operations at the National 
Distribution and Engineering Centre (“NDEC”). The NDEC was a centralised engineering and replenishment centre set up to serve our 
branch and distribution network replacing the former hub and spoke model deployed by the Group.
A dedicated project team oversaw these changes. Associated costs incurred amounted to £3.1 million. 
As branches and distribution centres rolled into the NDEC, there was a period of increased costs due to the operation of both the new 
and old models in parallel. The Group determined that a reasonable approximation of these parallel running inefficiencies to be the total 
costs incurred in operating the NDEC up to the point where 50% of operational volumes were processed through the NDEC rather than 
the original branch and distribution network. Accordingly all related NDEC costs until October 2016 were treated as exceptional costs, 
which amounted to £6.2 million.
As part of the restructuring a number of branches and distribution centres were closed. This led to redundancy costs of £0.5 million.
Given the scale and complexity in the operational change, the decision was made in the 4th quarter 2016 to redesign certain aspects 
of the project. These non-recurring transitional engineering costs amounted to £0.4 million.

Impact of change in tax rates – (961)
Income tax credit (5,240) (104)
(c) Factors that may affect future tax charge
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017. The Group’s losses for the year 
ended 30 December 2017 were taxed at an effective rate of 19.25%.
The Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset relating to temporary timing differences on plant and equipment, intangible assets 
and provisions of £18.2 million (2016: £14.8 million) and relating to losses £6.9 million (2016: £1.4 million).
These potential deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the basis that it is not sufficiently certain when taxable profits that can

1 The ordinary shares issued on 28 December 2016 (see note 20) had no material impact on the weighted average number of shares for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the result attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue for that period. 
Diluted loss per share is calculated using the loss for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding assuming 
the conversion of its potentially dilutive equity derivatives outstanding, being nil cost share options (LTIP shares) and Sharesave 
Scheme share options, as disclosed in note 21. All of the Group’s potentially dilutive equity derivative securities were anti-dilutive 
for the year ended 30 December 2017 for the purpose of diluted loss per share. There were no potentially dilutive equity derivative 
securities outstanding during the year ended 30 December 2017 for the purpose of diluted loss per share.

The remaining life of intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite life brands is between three to seventeen years.
The Group tests goodwill and indefinite life brands for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indicators that impairment 
may have occurred. The recoverable amounts of the goodwill and indefinite life brands, which are allocated to cash generating units 
(CGUs), are estimated from value in use (VIU) calculations which model pre-tax cash flows for the next four years (2016: four years) 
together with a terminal value using a long term growth rate. The key assumptions underpinning the recoverable amounts of the 
CGUs tested for impairment are those regarding the discount rate, forecast revenue, EBITDA, and capital expenditure.
The key variables applied to the value in use calculations were determined as follows:
 → Cash flows were derived assuming future Group growth rates in the short to medium term (up to four years) of 2.5% for each of the 
CGUs (2016: between 6% and 4%). The directors believe that it is appropriate to lower the growth rate assumptions from previous 
years to reflect the focus of the business on cost reduction. The cash flow calculations are based upon the achievement of the cost 
savings identified from the network reconfiguration identified in the Strategic Review. The majority of the cost saving initiatives have 
already been both identified and implemented and the directors are confident of their delivery.
 → Cash flows beyond 2021 (ie after four years) have been determined based on a long term growth rate of 2.5% (2016: 2.5%).
 → A pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% (2016: 9.1%), calculated by reference to a market based weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
Whilst the delivery of the identified cost savings is critical to the cash flow projections that have been used, additionally, the directors’ 
cash flow projections are based on key assumptions about the performance of the Group, the UK tool hire market and the general 
UK macro-economic environment. An impairment may be identified if changes to any of these factors were significant, including 
underperformance of the Group against forecast, negative changes in the UK tool hire market, or a deterioration in the UK economy, 
which would cause the directors to reconsider their assumptions and revise their cash flow projections.
Based on this VIU modelling and impairment testing, the directors do not consider the goodwill and indefinite life brands assets carried 
in the balance sheet at 30 December 2017, for any of the CGUs, to be impaired.
For the CGU groupings listed in the table above in respect of goodwill and brands, excluding HSS Core, the directors’ sensitivity 
analysis does not result in an impairment charge. Given the level of headroom in VIU they show, the directors do not envisage 
reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions that would be sufficient to cause an impairment at this time.
In respect of HSS Core, at 30 December 2017, the headroom between VIU and carrying value of the related assets was £89.9 million. 
The directors’ sensitivity analysis with regard to HSS Core shows that an increase in the discount rate by 2.5%, to 12.5%, or a reduction 
in the long term growth rate to a decline of 2.2%, or a reduction in the short to medium term growth rate to a decline of 3.3% would 
eliminate the headroom shown. Additionally if planned cost savings from the Strategic Review are £6.2 million less than anticipated on 
an annual basis the headroom would be eliminated. The short to medium term growth rate reduction equates to a reduction in EBITDA 
of between £3 million to £6 million annually over the medium term.

The provision for impairment of trade receivables is estimated based upon past default experience and the directors’ assessment of 
the current economic environment, including provisions for credit notes raised and expected to be raised after year end for customer 
invoices issued before year end (see note 1(o)). The overall provision for bad debts and credit notes amounts to 5.2% of trade 
receivables at 30 December 2017 (2016: 4.5%). A 0.5% increase in the rate of provision required would give rise to an increased 
provision of £0.4 million. The creation and release of bad debt receivables provision is charged/(credited) to administrative expenses 
in the income statement, and the credit note provision is charged/(credited) to revenue.

Onerous leases
Provisions for onerous leases relate to the current value of contractual liabilities for future rent and rates payments and other 
unavoidable costs on leasehold properties the Group no longer operationally uses. These liabilities, assessed on a lease by lease 
basis, are expected to arise over a period of up to 12 years with the weighted average being 3.5 years (2016: 2.8 years). They are 
stated net of existing and anticipated sub-let income based on management’s experience of the commercial retail property market 
in conjunction with specialist third party advice. The onerous lease provision has been discounted at a rate of 0.752% (2016: 0.478%). 
A 1% increase in the discount rate at 30 December 2017 would reduce the onerous lease provision by £0.1 million.
The amount of anticipated sub-let income for vacant properties included in the onerous lease provision amounted to £0.9 million at 
30 December 2017 (2016: £2.3 million). Variations in the actual timings or amounts of sub-let income will lead to a commensurate 
increase or decrease in the amount of provision required in the future. If the Group failed to dispose of or sub-let any of these vacant 
properties prior to their lease expiry the provision would increase by £0.9 million at 30 December 2017 (2016: £2.3 million).

18. Provisions continued
Dilapidations
The dilapidations provision represents dilapidation costs in respect of the Group’s leasehold properties and will therefore arise over the 
lease lives of the Group’s properties, and comprises specific amounts based on surveyors’ reports on a property by property basis, 
where available. The remaining properties are covered by an estimate based on gross internal area. The weighted average dilapidations 
provision at 30 December 2017 was £5.10 per square foot (psf) (2016: £3.10 psf). Estimates for future dilapidations costs are regularly 
reviewed, and the increase in the cost of the provision psf reflects a change in the estimate of future cost based upon experience 
during the year ended 30 December 2017. A £0.50 psf increase in the dilapidations provision would lead to an increase in the provision 
at 30 December 2017 of £1.3 million.
The dilapidations provision has been discounted at a rate of 1.19% (2016: 1.45%) at 30 December 2017 based on 10 year UK gilt yields. 
A 1% increase in the discount rate at 30 December 2017 would decrease the dilapidations provision by £0.6 million and associated 
dilapidation fixed asset by £0.6 million, respectively.
Onerous contract
The onerous contract represents amounts payable in respect of the agreement reached between the Group and Unipart to terminate 
the contract to operate the NDEC. The Group will make total cash payments to Unipart of £33.8 million of which £9.6 million is payable 
in 2018. The obligations under this agreement will unwind over the period to 2026. The provision has been discounted at a rate of 
1.19% at 30 December 2017 based on 10 year UK gilt yields. A 1% increase in the discount rate at 30 December 2017 would decrease 
the provision by £0.9 million.

At 30 December 2017 £2.8 million (2016: £7.6 million) of the deferred tax liability is expected to crystallise after more than one year.
At 30 December 2017 the Group had an unrecognised deferred tax asset relating to trading losses of £6.9 million (2016: £1.4 million). 
Tax losses generated in the year have been offset against the previously recognised deferred tax liability on intangible assets resulting 
in a net credit to the income statement of £4.9 million (2016: £nil).
The Group also has an unrecognised deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences on plant and equipment, intangible assets 
and provisions of £18.2 million (2016: £14.8 million).
These potential deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the basis that it is not sufficiently certain when taxable profits that can 
be utilised to absorb the reversal of the temporary difference will occur in the future.

In December 2016, the Company issued 15,445,238 new ordinary shares of 1p each on 28 December 2016 at a placing price of 
83.875p per share. The placing raised £13.0 million and the Company received cash proceeds of £12.78 million on 28 December 2016, 
net of expenses. The proceeds of the share issue were parcelled into the ‘cash box’ company which was then acquired by way of a 
share exchange in circumstances which qualified for merger relief and so avoided the need to recognise a share premium on the share 
issue. After additionally accounting for directly attributable expenses, the net amount booked to share capital and reserves was  
£12.55 million; £0.15 million allocated to nominal share capital and the excess of £12.4 million was recorded in the merger reserve 
account in equity. All shares are fully paid up.
21. Share based payments
The key points of each of the Group’s share schemes for grants up to 30 December 2017 are summarised below. All schemes are 
equity-settled. All disclosure relates to both the Group and the Company. 
The Black-Scholes valuation model was used to determine the fair value of the share based payments issued by the Company. The 
expected volatility measured at the standard deviation of continuously compounded share returns was based on statistical analysis 
of the Company’s historical share price taking into account the Company’s historical volatility since Admission to the London Stock 
Exchange in 2015, and the historical volatility of a comparator group of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange operating 
in similar markets. 
The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans during the year ended 30 December 2017 was £4,000 
(2016: £103,000), all of which related to equity settled share-based payment transactions.
Market Value Options
On 31 August 2017 share awards were granted to eligible employees based on a maximum of 460% of base salary in the form of 
market value options over ordinary shares in the Company in accordance with the Company’s 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 
“LTIP”). This was following approval by shareholders at a General Meeting on 10 August 2017. The Market Value Options were awarded 
on 31 August 2017 and will vest subject to performance conditions based on Earnings per Share and Return on Capital Employed 
measured over the period ending with the Company’s 2020 financial year. To the extent it vests, each award will, ordinarily, be released 
to the participant at the end of a further one year holding period. 
On the same date, tax qualifying share options were granted as part of the Market Value Option awards (‘CSOP options’) via a 
Company Share Option Plan approved by HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”). Each CSOP is subject to the same performance 
targets as the Market Value Options apply to the CSOP options and they will vest and be released at the same time as them. 
As such the total award to each individual comprises a bundled HMRC approved option in respect of the first £30,000 worth of an 
award, and an unapproved Market Value option award for amounts in excess of this HMRC limit. The table on page 96 reconciles 
the options outstanding.

Long Term Incentive Plan
No awards were made during 2017.
On 7 April 2016, share awards were granted to eligible employees based on a maximum of 100% of base salary in the form of nil-cost 
options over ordinary shares in the Company in accordance with the Company’s 2015 Long Term Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’). The LTIP 
awards will vest subject to performance conditions based on Earnings Per Share and Return on Capital Employed measured over the 
period ending with the Company’s 2018 financial year. To the extent it vests, each award will, ordinarily, be released to the participant at 
the end of a further two-year holding period. 
On the same date, tax qualifying share options were granted as part of the LTIP awards (‘CSOP options’) via a Company Share Option 
Plan approved by HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’). Each CSOP is subject to the same performance targets as apply to the nil-cost 
options part of the LTIP and will vest and be released at the same time as the nil-cost options. If a CSOP option is exercised as a gain, 
the number of shares that may be delivered under the associated LTIP award will be reduced at exercise by the same value to ensure 
that the total pre-tax value of the original LTIP award delivered to the participant is not increased by the grant of the CSOP option. 
As such, the LTIP comprises a bundled HMRC approved option in respect of the first £30,000 worth of an award, and an unapproved 
LTIP award for amounts in excess of this HMRC limit. Therefore, the fair value of the award in aggregate is determined by reference to 
the market value of the original LTIP share awards at the date of grant.

2016 3-year Sharesave Scheme (‘SAYE Plan’)
On 4 November 2016, the Group offered all employees the opportunity to participate in the 2016 Sharesave Scheme, an SAYE plan 
(the ‘SAYE Plan’). The SAYE Plan enables participating employees to save anything from £5 to £250 per month over three years. At 
the end of the three years, the employee may use the amount saved to purchase HSS Hire Group plc shares at a discounted price 
(compared to the price on the date of issue) of 57.7p per share. Alternatively, the employee may, at their request, withdraw their savings 
and leave the SAYE Plan at any time. Participants will be eligible to exercise their awards between 3 and 3.5 years from the grant date.
No awards were made under the SAYE Plan during 2017.

22. Financial instruments
Financial risk management
The Group holds and uses financial instruments to finance its operations and to manage its interest rate and liquidity risks. The Group 
primarily finances its operations using share capital, revenue and borrowings.
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. 
Risk management is carried out under policies approved by the board of directors. Financial risk management is carried out by the 
Chief Financial Officer under a policy approved by the board. The board approves written principles for overall risk management, as 
well as written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk and receives regular reports on 
such matters. The Group does not engage in trading or speculative activities using derivative financial instruments.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that may change prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. They will affect the Group’s income 
or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk of a change in the Group’s cash flows due to a change in interest rates. 
The Group’s fixed rate borrowings are now principally the Senior Secured Notes. In addition the Group enters into finance leases in 
respect of hire stock assets and these carry a fixed rate of interest set at lease inception. 
The Group is only exposed to interest rate risk on its variable interest borrowings, such as the Revolving Credit Facility, the Group’s 
overdraft and other short term borrowings. The most recent inflation report from the Bank of England (February 2018) indicates that the 
market-implied path for the UK Bank Rate is now higher than reported in the February 2017 report, with base rates now at 0.5% and 
expected to reach 1% by the end of 2019. A year ago rates were not expected to reach 0.7% before Q1 2020. Despite this increase in 
the forecast the directors do not consider this to be a significant risk to the Group. The directors will continue to monitor developments 
in market interest rates on a regular basis. The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates on the Group’s variable loans would be to 
increase the interest charge by £0.7 million.
Interest rate sensitivity
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on income and equity for the year when 
this movement is applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.

Refinancing risk
The Group manages its refinancing risk by not letting its borrowings run to their maturity. There is a risk that market conditions might 
preclude a refinancing if this is not done. The existing Senior Secured Notes mature in 2019 and the Revolving Credit Facility expires 
shortly before. The Group maintains good relations with debt investors and has incurred £0.7m of exceptional expenses during the year 
exploring its options ahead of these refinancing obligations.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 30 December 2017
22. Financial instruments continued
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk of a change in the Group’s cash flows due to a change in foreign currency exchange rate. The Group 
is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the cash flows and carrying values of its Republic of Ireland subsidiaries. Given 
the relative small size of the Republic of Ireland operations compared to the Group the directors do not consider this to be a significant 
risk to the Group.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
The directors consider the Group’s credit risk from cash, cash equivalents and deposits to be low as the Group only enters 
transactions with banks or financial institutions with a credit rating of A or above.
The Group has policies in place to manage potential credit risk from trade receivables. Customer credit terms are determined using 
independent ratings agency data and regularly updated to reflect any changes in customer circumstances or trading conditions. If no 
independent rating is available an internal assessment is made of the credit quality of the customer, taking into account their financial 
position and past trading history of the Group. The directors do not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been 
provided for as shown in note 14.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group finance department 
regularly monitors forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while 
maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities (note 17) at all times so that borrowing limits or 
covenants on borrowing facilities are not breached.
The financial covenant in place on the Group’s revolving credit facility at 30 December 2017 is a minimum Adjusted EBITDA of 
£35 million on a rolling twelve month basis.
Asset risk
Asset risk is the risk of loss or damage to an asset adding to financial loss to the Group. Customers may damage hire equipment if 
they don’t have the appropriate skills to use the equipment or lack a duty of care while using it. The cost of repairing or replacing 
the equipment can be substantial depending on the type of asset and in turn can lead to a loss of revenue until the asset is again 
available to be hired.
Capital management
The Group relies on capital for organic and acquisitive growth, the purchase of rental equipment to replace equipment that has 
reached the end of its useful economic life and to secure and establish new rental locations and branches. 
The Group defines capital as equity as shown in the statement of financial position plus net debt (total borrowings less cash) and seeks 
to achieve an acceptable return on gross capital.
The Group manages its capital structure using a number of measures and taking into account its future strategic plans. Such measures 
include ensuring the Group maintains sufficient liquidity and compliance with a bank covenant. In addition to the cash that the Group 
has generated from its operations, over recent years it has renegotiated its debt structure including the issue of a fixed interest rate 
bond, fixed term loan notes and secured shorter term bank borrowing through a revolving credit facility.
The principal bank covenant is to maintain an adjusted rolling EBITDA of £35.0 million. For the year ended 30 December 2017, Adjusted 
EBITDA was £48.9 million (2016: £68.6 million).
Fair value
All financial assets at the balance sheet date which comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents are classified as 
loans and receivables.
All financial liabilities which comprise trade and other payables, obligations under finance leases and borrowings are classified as 
financial liabilities at amortised cost.
The following table shows the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities within the Group, including their level in the fair value 
hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets or financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying

On 11 January 2018 the sale of the former Mitcham Head Office, which closed in September 2017 as part of the cost reduction 
programme was completed for proceeds of £1.5 million. The property was an asset held for resale at 30 December 2017.
On 13 February 2018 the Group agreed an extension of the maturity date of its £80 million Revolving Credit Facility from 6 February 
2019 to 6 July 2019. This resulted in an increase in the margin payable under the facility from 2.50% to 3.00%. There were no changes 
in covenants.
If the Group has not refinanced its senior secured notes by 30 September 2018, the £80 million revolving credit facility will become 
repayable at the option of the lenders on 30 April 2019.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
HSS Hire Group plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies
HSS Hire Group Plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Company’s registered office 
is 76 Talbot Road, Old Trafford, Manchester, M16 0PQ.
a) Reporting entity
HSS Hire Group Limited was incorporated on 7 January 2015 as a private company limited by shares in the United Kingdom and 
re-registered as a public limited company on 19 January 2015. The Company listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange on 
9 February 2015.
The Company’s principal activity is to act as ultimate holding company for a group of companies whose principal activities are the 
supply and hire of equipment and associated services.
b) Statement of compliance
The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 100 Application of Financial 
Reporting Requirements (“FRS 100”) and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”) and the 
Companies Act 2006.
Disclosure exemptions adopted
In preparing these financial statements the Company has taken advantage of all disclosure exemptions conferred by FRS 101. 
Therefore these financial statements do not include:
 → certain comparative information as otherwise required by EU endorsed IFRS;
 → certain disclosures regarding the company’s capital;
 → a statement of cash flows;
 → the effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted;
 → the disclosure of the remuneration of key management personnel; and
 → disclosure of related party transactions with other wholly owned members of the HSS Hire Group Plc group of companies.
In addition, and in accordance with FRS 101, further disclosure exemptions have been adopted because equivalent disclosures 
are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements. These financial statements do not include certain disclosures in 
respect of:
 → share based payments;
 → financial instruments (other than certain disclosures required as a result of recording financial Instruments at fair value); or
 → fair value measurement (other than certain disclosures required as a result of recording financial instruments at fair value).
The directors have taken advantage of the option within section 390 of the Companies Act 2006 to prepare their financial statements 
up to a date seven days either side of the Company’s accounting reference date of 31 December, and these accounts therefore cover 
the period from 1 January 2017 to 30 December 2017 (2016: 27 December 2015 to 31 December 2016).
The Company complies with the accounting policies defined in Note 1 to the Group consolidated statements on pages 66 to 103 
except as noted below.
c) Merger reserve
The merger reserve is the amount arising on the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued on acquisition of the 
subsidiary companies and the Company value of the interest in subsidiaries. The merger reserve arises where more than 90% of the 
shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, and therefore the 
Company adopts merger relief under the Companies Act 2006.
Notes to the Company 
Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 December 2017

1. Accounting policies continued
d) Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are included in the statement of financial position at cost less amounts written-off, representing impairment 
in value. Impairment charges are recorded if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable.
As the investment in subsidiaries arose from a reorganisation of the group structure that satisfies the criteria set out in IAS 27 ‘Separate 
Financial Statements’, the cost of interest has been measured as the carrying amount of its share of the equity items shown in the 
separate financial statements of the original parent at the date of reorganisation.

Share fraud and boiler room scams
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders 
have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. Share scams are often run from 
‘boiler rooms’ where fraudsters cold-call investors offering them 
worthless, overpriced or even non-existent shares.
These operations are commonly known as ‘boiler room fraud’. 
The ‘brokers’ (callers) can be very persistent and extremely 
persuasive. They often have websites to support their activities, 
their advice and the companies they purport to represent. A 2006 
survey by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) reported that the 
average amount lost by an investor is around £20,000. It is not 
just novice investors that have been duped in this way; many of 
the victims have been successfully investing for several years. 
Shareholders are cautioned to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, sell your shares at  
a premium or offers of free company reports. 
If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted 
shares, a premium price for shares you own, or free company  
or research reports, you should take these steps before handing 
over any money:
 → record the name of the person and organisation  
contacting you; 
 → check the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA )Register  
at www.fca.org.uk/register to ensure they are properly 
authorised;
 → use the details on the FCA Register to contact the firm;
 → call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there 
are no contact details on the Register or you are told they 
are out of date;
 → if you receive telephone calls, emails, letters purporting to 
be from HSS Hire Group plc or from companies endorsed by 
HSS Hire Group plc and you are unsure if they are legitimate, 
please contact our shareholder helpline for clarification 
(0371 384 2030 or +44 (0)121 415 7047 (overseas)); and
 → if the caller persists, hang up. 
Please note that should you use an unauthorised firm to buy  
or sell shares or other investments, you will not have access  
to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong. 
If you are approached about a share scam you should tell the 
FCA using the online share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.
uk/consumers/report-scam-unauthorised-firm where you can 
find out about the latest investment scams. You can also call the 
FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. 
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters  
you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or  
online at: www.actionfraud.police.uk/

This document contains certain forward-looking statements 
concerning the Group’s business, financial condition, results  
of operations and certain of the Group’s plans, objectives,

on forward-looking statements.
By their nature, forward-looking statements relate to events and
