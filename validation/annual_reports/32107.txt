CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
Consort has delivered another 
year of underlying growth and  
further enhanced its margins.
DR PETER FELLNER
Consort Medical has delivered another 
year of underlying growth and further 
enhanced its margins. It has made great 
progress in developing future growth 
prospects with a strong development 
portfolio and innovation pipeline.
TRADING
The Group’s revenue increased by 
6.2% to £294.0m (FY2016: £276.9m) with 
underlying sales growth delivered in 
both divisions. Group EBIT before special 
items increased by 8.3% to £40.0m 
(FY2016: £37.0m) demonstrating good 
operating leverage. Adjusted basic EPS 
increased by 13.1% to 65.1p per share 
(FY2016: 57.6p).
EBITDA before special items grew by 
9.1% to £52.7m (FY2016: £48.3m) and we 
made further investment in the business 
including £18.1m in capital expenditure 
(FY2016: £21.5m). 
We have continued to reduce gearing 
in line with our expectations with a 
year-end net debt of £92.6m (FY2016: 
£97.0m), representing Net debt:EBITDA 
of 1.7x.
INNOVATION AND

BOARD CHANGES
The Board appointed Paul Hayes as 
the Group’s Chief Financial Officer 
with effect from 1 May 2017. Paul is an 
experienced CFO in multi-national high 
technology manufacturing, consumer 
goods and retail businesses. Paul was 
previously the Group Finance Director 
of Vitec Group plc for the last six years. 
Paul is a Chartered Accountant and 
has a first class Master’s degree in 
Mechanical Engineering, Manufacture 
and Management. 
Paul replaced Richard Cotton who left 
the Board on 13 December 2016. The 
Board would like to thank Richard for his 
contribution to the Group and wish him 
well as he embarks on the next stage of 
his career. The Board would also like to 
thank David Tilston for acting as interim 
CFO to ensure a smooth transition prior 
to Paul’s arrival.
PEOPLE
I wish to thank our employees for their 
contributions and commitment over the 
last year, which has been important in 
delivering the Company’s continued 
growth. I also thank our shareholders for 
their ongoing support of the Company.
OUTLOOK
Consort has again delivered further 
growth in revenue and profit ahead 
of its expectations with both divisions 
performing well. Bespak has continued 
to grow and develop its diverse pipeline 
of product opportunities in this high 
margin business. Aesica continues to 
improve its operating performance and 
its margins in line with our expectations 
and assisted by recent contract wins. 
Group performance is expected to 
be broadly in line with our near-term 
expectations for the current financial 
year, despite some headwinds from 
contract phasing. The Board remains 
confident about the prospects for  
the Group.
DIVIDEND
The Board has reviewed the dividend 
and is proposing an increased final 
dividend of 13.21p (FY2016: 12.56p) 
making a total dividend for the year of 
20.30p (FY2016: 19.31p). The dividend 
will be paid on 27 October 2017 to 
shareholders on the register at  
22 September 2017, following our AGM 
on 6 September 2017.

OUR BUSINESS
Strategic Report
WHY INVEST?
Core business demand 
is typically stable, 
predictable and often 
recurring, thereby 
providing relatively 
high visibility of future 
revenues.
Consort Medical is a leading 
global contract development and 
manufacturing organisation (CDMO), 
providing advanced delivery 
technologies, formulation and 
manufacturing solutions for drugs. 
The Group’s customers include  
some of the world’s largest 
pharmaceutical companies.
THE GROUP COMPRISES TWO 
INTEGRATED OPERATING 
DIVISIONS:
Bespak (Devices) – a global market 
leader in the development and 
manufacture of drug delivery devices, 
serving pharmaceutical companies with 
inhaler, auto-injector, nasal and ocular 
technologies and development and 
manufacturing services.
Aesica (Drugs) – a leading 
pharmaceutical CDMO serving 
pharmaceutical companies with  
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient 
(API) and finished dose formulation 
development and manufacturing 
services.
Optimising world-class drug delivery 
device development and manufacture, 
together with drug API and finished 
dose formulation and manufacture, 
within the Group, streamlines and 
accelerates our pharmaceutical 
customers’ drug route to market.
Here are some of the key motivations for 
investment in Consort Medical plc:
1 LONG-TERM CONTRACTS
Consort Medical serves pharmaceutical 
and Life Sciences customers with drug/
device development, formulation and 
manufacturing services, all of which, 
typically, have long life cycles. Devices 
and drug manufacturing sites are 
defined and licensed as part of the 
drug master file and, hence, sourcing is 
protected. Pharmaceutical customers 
invest significant resources in launching, 
marketing and building the treatment 
franchises which often have high rates 
of repeat prescription. Accordingly, 
Consort Medical is typically heavily 
embedded in our customers’ supply 
chains and our core business demand is 
typically stable, predictable and often 
recurring. This provides relatively high 
visibility of future revenues.
2
PREMIUM QUALITY AND 
REGULATORY EXPERTISE
Consort Medical operates in a highly 
regulated environment and the 
quality standards required are world 
class. Aesica has made significant 
investments in facilities and technology 
with the aim of ensuring “best in 
class” quality and reliability. Aesica’s 
manufacturing capabilities include high 
capacity, high potency and innovative 
semi-continuous manufacturing. 
Bespak manufactures over 2.6 billion 
components, assembled into more 
than 500 million devices, annually. 
Furthermore, Bespak is one of only a 
handful of operators globally who have 
the process know-how and expertise 
to consistently deliver Six Sigma quality 
on such a high volume of medical 
components and devices.
The Group leverages this significant 
process and production know-how, 
operating a dual strategy of the 
contract manufacturing of customer 
products and, through Bespak, the 
supply of its own proprietary delivery 
device technologies, the IP for which 
is heavily protected. This value delivery 
to the customer yields attractive 
margins, whilst affording protection 
from potential new market entrants. In 
many cases, Consort Medical is heavily 
embedded within the supply chains of 
its customers.
3
DIVERSIFIED PHARMA  
SERVICES OFFERING AND 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
PORTFOLIO EXPERTISE
A key feature of Consort Medical’s 
strategy is the diversification of its 
pharmaceutical services offering. 
In Bespak’s devices arena, this 
diversification strategy has taken the 
business from respiratory into injectables, 
nasal, ocular and point of care (POC) 
diagnostics (horizontal). The acquisition 
of Aesica in 2014 extended the Group’s 
pharmaceutical services offering 
into the highly complementary areas 
of drug formulation, manufacture, 
handling and packaging (vertical). 
This deeper, integrated, single source 
pharmaceutical services offering allows 
the Group to capture greater value 
from the supply chain in a market where 
customers are increasing their level of 
outsourcing. Such an offering is highly 
differentiated from Consort Medical’s 
competitors. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR BUSINESS
Strategic Report
Bespak and Aesica’s commercial teams 
work closely together, enhancing each 
other’s capabilities and strengths. They 
have the joint mission to support their 
core divisional activities, to facilitate 
introductions for their sister division’s 
commercial teams to access their core 
customer relationships, and to work 
together jointly to secure combined 
formulation and device contracts.
4
HIGH LEVEL OF 
INNOVATION
The Group remains at the leading edge 
of innovation and is committed to 
investing in patient and customer driven 
innovation with the potential to create 
new treatments, new markets and new 
opportunities.
Bespak’s Innovation team in Cambridge 
continues to develop novel drug 
delivery device offerings which are 
expected to evolve into specific 
commercial opportunities. Following 
on from the launch of the first liquid 
gas powered auto-injector (Syrina
®
) 
and the first dual product injector 
(Lila
®
) in 2013, a new bolus injector 
platform (Lapas
®
) in 2014, and the 
new Syrina
®
 2.25, this financial year 
saw the unveiling of the new Syrina
®
 
AR 2.25 auto-injector, suitable for 
delivering volumes of up to 2.0ml using 
a standard 2.25ml pre-filled syringe. 
Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 provides patients with 
a fully-automatic two-step, compact 
device for the self-administration of 
viscous drug formulations smoothly and 
safely in less than 15 seconds. Designed 
with a hidden needle, Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 
offers automatic needle insertion and 
retraction, as well as drug delivery 
with a single push-on-skin operation. 
Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 has been tailored 
specifically for higher viscosities while still 
enabling the safe use of glass syringes. 
The Innovation Centre’s novel IP-
protected product offerings are 
proceeding through commercialisation 
and present significant organic  
growth opportunities for the Group.  
The innovation pipeline contains several 
other candidates with the potential  
to create further shareholder value in 
the future.
During FY2017 Aesica has been routinely 
supplying commercial product using 
the first semi-continuous processing 
line and technology installed at the 
Queenborough site and we anticipate 
using this line for additional third party 
development work in the future. 
A changing regulatory requirement 
within the pharmaceutical industry is for 
products to be uniquely identifiable at 
the individual pack level. This process 
is known in the industry as serialisation. 
Aesica has been an early provider 
of serialisation services to the industry 
including China and Latin America that 
have adopted this process. It is also well 
advanced in developing the service 
for the next wave of territories adopting 
serialisation including the EU. We believe 
Aesica is in a strong position relative 
to the sector in general and we have 
been actively promoting this offering 
with marketing and industry events 
such as a recent webinar series. Further 
capital expenditure is being committed 
to enhance our capabilities in this area.
5
INORGANIC GROWTH 
OPPORTUNITIES
Following the acquisition and successful 
integration of Aesica, the Group is 
a leading global CDMO, providing 
advanced delivery technologies, 
formulation development and 
manufacturing solutions for drugs. 
Consort Medical has a clear strategy 
for growth and whilst this will be mostly 
organic in focus, the Group can also 
develop in its chosen strategy through 
further selective, relevant and value-
enhancing acquisitions.
The management team regularly 
evaluates acquisition and investment 
opportunities in complementary 
adjacent markets and technologies 
which have the potential to leverage 
the Group’s core competencies in drug 
formulation, manufacturing and delivery 
and capture additional value in the 
drug/device supply chain.
The acquisition of Aesica, and its 
successful integration, has increased 
the scale of the Group, expanding 
its capabilities and providing further 
opportunities to facilitate growth, 
both organically and through further 
acquisitions, in the future. With a 
conservative capital structure, the 
Group has financial resources available 
to realise this.
6
STRONG  
MANAGEMENT TEAM
Consort Medical’s management 
team has executed successfully the 
chosen strategy of sustained/diversified 
organic growth, selective investments 
and acquisitions, and operating 
leverage. Consort Medical has been 
transformed under this strategy, with the 
Group strengthening its base of core 
competencies and leveraging them in 
strategic growth initiatives.
The management team has significant 
M&A experience, acquiring (in 2014) 
and successfully integrating Aesica 
into the Group; realising 19.0x EBITDA 
for the King Systems disposal in 2013; 
making key equity investments into Atlas 
Genetics and Oxular; and acquiring, 
and subsequently commercialising, 
injectables technology through the 
acquisition of The Medical House. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR BUSINESS MODEL
BESPAK DIVISION
Bespak’s business model is built to 
support two principal goals: 
1 Helping our customers succeed in 
commercialising their own designs of 
drug delivery devices; and
2 Developing proprietary designs of 
drug delivery devices for sale to 
blue-chip pharmaceutical and Life 
Sciences customers.
To this aim, Bespak has and will, 
continue its diversification of the  
drug delivery segments in which it 
operates, as well as increasing its share 
of the value-added content in the 
supply chain. 
To date, Bespak has evolved the range 
of drug delivery opportunities from its 
origins in the respiratory segment to 
that of injectables, nasal, ocular and 
POC diagnostics. Bespak has also 
further enhanced its share of the value 
added in the supply chain beyond 
that of product design, development, 
industrialisation and commercial 
manufacturing operations, and into the 
handling of drugs for the purposes of 
clinical trials and commercial market 
release on behalf of its customers.
Bespak has developed significant 
core capabilities, competencies and 
processes developed through strategic 
investments in skills, technologies and 
infrastructure that provide for the best 
long-term growth and profitability 
prospects based on the value they 
deliver to our customers, whether based 
on either customer-owned or Bespak-
owned Intellectual Property.
AESICA DIVISION
Aesica’s business model has, historically, 
been built on four key pillars:
1 Strategic partners;
2 Geography;
3 Technology; and 
4 Organic growth.
Aesica considers strategic partners to 
be those where there is potential to 
create significant revenues across the 
Aesica network. As the industry is shifting 
towards supply chain consolidation, 
Aesica focuses on the retention and 
formation of strong partnerships with 
global pharmaceutical companies, 
generics companies  
and regional players through new 
business development and key  
account management.
Our intention is to continue to 
achieve organic growth by building 
on Aesica’s foundations of new 
business development, key account 
management, project management 
and continuous improvement as well 
as broaden our technology offering 
through both acquisition  
and innovation.
The combination of 
Bespak and Aesica 
allows the Group to 
provide a broad, clear 
and integrated drug/
device service offering 
to pharmaceutical 
customers. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Strategic Report
GROUP
Both Aesica and Bespak are 
pharmaceutical services businesses 
with virtually identical target customer 
bases. Whilst the divisions have several 
customers in common, currently, a 
number are exclusive to either Aesica 
or Bespak. The combination of two 
such complementary pharmaceutical 
services providers allows the Group to 
provide a significantly broader, deeper 
and more integrated drug/device 
contract manufacturing and supply 
chain solution to its customers.
As well as driving the individual Aesica 
and Bespak divisions, as a larger 
pharmaceutical services company, 
the Group’s business model is to offer 
existing and prospective new customers 
a single source supply chain solution for 
drug and delivery device development, 
formulation, manufacturing and 
packaging. Optimising drug and 
device services in a single group 
streamlines and accelerates the 
route of drugs to market and reduces 
the cost and complexity of drug/
device development for the Group’s 
pharmaceutical partners. 
CONSORT MEDICAL’S

STRATEGIC  
EXECUTION
Measured against all four elements, we 
continue to deliver on our strategy: 
1
SUSTAINED ORGANIC  
REVENUE GROWTH
• Continued progress in existing 
development pipelines of both 
Bespak and Aesica.
• In injectables, we signed a significant 
new master development agreement 
for our proprietary Vapoursoft
®
  
Syrina
®
 auto-injector technology  
with a leading global 
biopharmaceutical company.
• Bespak’s second injectable device, 
UCB’s Cimzia
®
 AutoClicks
®
 pre-filled 
pen, was successfully launched in the 
UK and other European markets.
• In respiratory, AstraZeneca’s Bevespi 
Aerosphere
®
 was launched in the 
USA. Bespak has been awarded a 
significant new multi-year agreement 
for the scale-up and supply of 
its proprietary pMDI valves and 
actuators.
• Aesica has been routinely supplying 
commercial product using the 
first semi-continuous processing 
line and technology installed at 
the Queenborough site and we 
anticipate using this line for additional 
third party development work in  
the future.
• Aesica has been working with a 
leading Japanese pharmaceutical 
company to provide the active 
ingredient for an anti-inflammatory 
formulation containing S+ flurbiprofen. 
The patch received market approval 
with the Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare in Japan for the indication of 
osteoarthritis. During FY2017 Aesica 
moved from validation to routine 
commercial supply of S+ flurbiprofen 
to this customer.

INNOVATION
• The commercial and innovation 
teams continue to generate very 
strong interest in our new technology 
platforms on a range of opportunities. 
The innovation funnel has progressed 
broadly during the period across a 
number of therapeutic areas and 
technologies 
• Vapoursoft
®
 powered Syrina
®
 and 
Lapas
®
 auto-injectors, and our Lila 
Mix
TM
 and Duo
TM
 technologies have 
continued to generate widespread 
interest as innovative and novel drug 
delivery systems and devices, with 
several biotech and pharmaceutical 
companies initiating feasibility and 
development programmes for their 
injectable drug portfolios 
• This rapidly expanding innovation 
funnel includes an active schedule 
of early stage development 
programmes, feasibility programmes, 
and programmes awaiting initiation
• In October 2016, Bespak unveiled its 
latest addition to the Syrina
®
 range 
of auto-injectors: The new Syrina
®
 
AR 2.25 auto-injector, suitable for 
delivering volumes of up to 2.0ml 
using a standard 2.25ml pre-filled 
syringe. Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 provides 
patients with a fully-automatic 
two-step, compact device for the 
self-administration of viscous drug 
formulations smoothly and safely in 
less than 15 seconds. Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 
has been tailored specifically for 
higher viscosities while still enabling 
the safe use of glass syringes 
• A changing regulatory requirement 
within the pharmaceutical industry is 
for product to be uniquely identified 
to the individual pack level. This 
process is known in the industry as 
serialisation. Aesica has been an 
early provider of serialisation services 
to the industry including China and 
Latin America that have adopted 
this process. It is also well advanced 
in developing the service for the 
next wave of territories adopting 
serialisation including the EU. We 
believe Aesica is in a strong position 
relative to the sector in general and 
we have been actively promoting this 
offering with marketing and industry 
events such as a recent webinar 
series. Further capital expenditure is 
being committed to enhance our 
capabilities in this area
4 ENHANCEMENT
• Successful integration of Aesica
• The acquisition, and subsequent 
successful integration, of Aesica 
allows the Group to offer 
pharmaceutical and Life Sciences 
customers a single source for 
drug and device development, 
formulation, manufacturing and fill/
finish – a highly differentiated offering 
compared to our competitors
• A core objective of the acquisition 
of Aesica was to harness, over time, 
significant cross-selling opportunities, 
and to secure development and 
manufacturing opportunities for 
combined formulation and device 
services. The Bespak and Aesica 
commercial teams are working 
closely together, enhancing each 
other’s capabilities and strengths. 
They have a joint mission to support 
their core divisional activities, to 
facilitate introductions for their sister 
division’s commercial teams to  
access their core customer 
relationships, and to work together 
jointly to secure combined 
formulation and device contracts
• Since the acquisition, a number of 
joint Bespak and Aesica meetings 
have been held with customers, 
and the consequent reaction has 
been encouraging. In addition, 
cross-selling introductions have led to 
firm enquiries in a variety of device 
opportunities for Bespak, for both 
customer and Bespak IP platforms
• In FY2016, the Group was awarded 
a new strategic development and 
manufacturing agreement with retinal 
therapeutics company, Oxular. The 
contract is related to novel ocular 
device and drug applications 
designed to access specific small 
spaces in the eye and to provide 
unique drug distribution to treat 
retinal diseases. This is the Group’s 
first drug and device development 
and manufacturing contract and 
will leverage both Bespak’s device 
development and manufacturing, as 
well as Aesica’s manufacturing and 
filling, capabilities
• This contract is an important 
demonstration of the value of  
Consort Medical’s single solution for 
device and drug combinations.  
A significant attraction for Oxular was 
Consort’s ability to offer a “one stop 
shop” for development and eventual 
commercial manufacture of the final 
filled, finished and packaged product
• The Group continues to pursue new 
opportunities that will leverage both 
Bespak’s device development and 
manufacturing, as well as Aesica’s 
formulation, manufacturing and  
filling, capabilities  25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Future Development
The global pharmaceutical contract 
manufacturing market is forecast to 
reach US$79 billion in 2019, growing at 
an estimated compound annual growth 
rate (CAGR) of 7.5% between 2013 and 
2019. If the trend towards outsourcing  
in the pharmaceutical market continues 
as expected, we believe that the 
demand for an integrated service 
offering from a single provider  
will increase. 
Bringing Aesica’s drug formulation, 
manufacturing and packaging 
capabilities into the same group as 
Bespak’s delivery device development 
and manufacturing has created a 
leading, global, single source drug and 
device contract manufacturing partner 
for pharmaceutical customers.
The Group can now provide a 
significantly broader, deeper and 
more integrated drug/device 
contract manufacturing and supply 
chain solution to our customers in 
this growing market. The Group’s 
strategy is to continue building on, and 
strengthening, our core Aesica and 
Bespak divisions through increased 
market reach; innovation in new 
products, processes and technologies; 
and by capturing more of the drug/
device value chain. In addition, as 
a larger pharmaceutical services 
company, we will offer existing and 
prospective new customers a single 
source supply chain solution for drug 
and delivery device development, 
formulation, manufacturing  
and packaging. 
Optimising drug and device services 
in a single group will streamline and 
accelerate the route of drugs to market 
and reduce the cost and complexity 
of drug/device development for the 
Group’s pharmaceutical partners. We 
believe that such an offering is highly 
differentiated from Consort Medical’s 
current competitors. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR STRATEGY BY MARKET
The global market for inhaled drug 
delivery devices is forecast to reach 
US$43 billion in 2024, growing at an 
estimated CAGR of 3.3% between 2016 
and 2024. 
The respiratory sector is one of the 
most highly regulated, resulting in 
high barriers to entry. A number of key 
drugs are shortly coming “off patent”, 
resulting in a number of new generic 
entrants and associated opportunities 
for Bespak to supply both metered dose 
inhaler (MDI) and dry powder inhaler 
(DPI) devices. Although sales remain 
relatively flat in the traditional Western 
economies, significant volume growth 
is being seen in emerging markets, 
with the Brazilian, Russian, Indian and 
Chinese (BRIC) markets becoming more 
important to Bespak.
Strategy
The Group intends to increase its share 
of the respiratory market through 
the development of new drug 
delivery devices; selling into new and 
developing geographical markets; 
and offering customers finished dose 
formulation and manufacturing 
services as well as integrated drug/
device development, formulation and 
manufacturing services. The Group 
intends to maintain its competitive 
position by continuing to leverage 
continuous improvement activities as 
products move into the mature stage 
of their product life cycle. Endorsing 
this strategy, in FY2017 we signed a 
significant new commercial supply 
agreement for Bespak’s proprietary 
respiratory devices with AstraZeneca. 
This is a multi-year agreement for 
the scale-up and supply of Bespak’s 
proprietary pressurised metered dose 
inhaler (pMDI) valves and actuators 
for AstraZeneca’s Bevespi Aerosphere
®
 
inhalation aerosol which was approved 
by the US FDA in April 2016 and 
launched in the USA in January 2017.
The global injectable drug delivery 
market is forecast to reach US$625 
billion in 2021, growing at an estimated 
CAGR of 11.5% between 2016 and 
2021. Growth is being driven by a large 
number of new drugs coming to the 
market for the first time that require 
delivery by injection. Whilst Bespak 
currently has a negligible share of 
this market, it is estimated that c.40% 
of all new drugs in development will 
be delivered parenterally and may, 
therefore, require some form of  
auto-injector. 
Many of these new “large molecule” 
biologic drugs are highly viscous and 
require specialist devices to enable 
them to be effectively administered, 
often by patients themselves in a non-
clinical environment. The continued 
drive to greater self-administration 
with the associated improvements to 
patient compliance, patient outcomes 
and healthcare economics will create 
significant opportunities for the Group 
to develop and manufacture auto-
injectors to meet these needs. 
In 2013, Consort Medical commercially 
unveiled the Syrina
®
, Vapoursoft
®
 and 
Lila
®
 injection technology ranges. In 
2014, Consort Medical commercially 
unveiled Lapas
®
, a new range of 
innovative wearable bolus injection 
devices powered by Vapoursoft
®
. In 
FY2016, Bespak unveiled the Syrina
®
 
2.25, one of the most compact versions 
of auto-injector available today 
utilising a standard 2.25ml pre-filled 
syringe. In FY2017, Bespak unveiled its 
latest addition to the Syrina
®
 range of 
auto-injectors: the new Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 
auto-injector, suitable for delivering 
volumes of up to 2.0ml using a standard 
2.25ml pre-filled syringe. Syrina
®
 AR 
2.25 provides patients with a fully-
automatic two-step, compact device 
for the self-administration of viscous 
drug formulations smoothly and safely 
in less than 15 seconds. Designed 
with a hidden needle, Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 
offers automatic needle insertion and 
retraction, as well as drug delivery 
with a single push-on-skin operation. 
Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 has been tailored 
specifically for higher viscosities while still 
enabling the safe use of glass syringes. 
All of these technologies leverage 
Bespak’s expertise and IP in gas 
propulsion and, using IP acquired 
through the acquisition of The 
Medical House, combine them into a 
family of innovative next-generation 
auto-injectors. These innovative 
drug delivery devices demonstrate 
Bespak’s capabilities from device 
feasibility, concept and initial design 
through device development and 
also demonstrate the ability of the 
Innovation team to deliver product 
diversification opportunities in the drug 
delivery sector.
Strategy
Consort Medical’s Syrina
®
, Lila
®
 
and Lapas
®
 range of auto-injectors 
positions the Group well to participate 
in this growing market. Our strategy 
is focused on the commercialisation 
of the existing pipeline in conjunction 
with the development of further IP 
and the exploitation of “innovation 
on demand” opportunities through 
the growing Innovation team in 
Cambridge. Endorsing this strategy, 
in FY2017 we signed a significant new 
master development agreement for 
our proprietary Vapoursoft
®
 Syrina
®
 
auto-injector technology with a leading 
global biopharmaceutical company. 
Consort Medical intends to continue to 
move up the value chain by offering 
assembly and drug handling and will 
continue to look for additional, selective 
acquisitions in this area.
The global nasal drug delivery 
technology market is forecast to reach 
US$64 billion in 2021, growing at an 
estimated CAGR of 6.5% between 2016 
and 2021. Growth is being delivered 
from two main areas. Firstly, a number 
of existing branded drugs are coming 
off patent leading to generic entrants, 
all requiring their own delivery system as 
the original device associated with the 
branded drug is normally unavailable 
to them. Secondly, the nasal drug

Strategic Report
delivery route is extremely effective and 
a number of existing and new drugs are 
being reformulated to enable delivery 
in this way, increasing demand for this 
type of drug delivery product. This is now 
a strategic market for Consort Medical 
and it currently has two development 
pipeline opportunities. 
Strategy
The Group’s strategy for the nasal 
market is focused on the delivery 
of Bespak’s existing development 
programmes plus further exploitation 
of the Group’s growing IP portfolio via 
a number of “innovation on demand” 
opportunities. In addition, the Group 
intends to offer customers finished 
dose formulation and manufacturing 
services as well as an integrated drug/
device development, formulation and 
manufacturing services.
The global ophthalmic drugs market is 
forecast to reach US$21 billion in 2022, 
growing at an estimated CAGR of 5.2% 
between 2016 and 2022. The global 
ophthalmic drugs market is driven by 
key factors such as rising prevalence 
of ocular disorders such as diabetic 
retinopathy and macular degeneration, 
largely driven by the rising percentage 
of ageing population in the world. 
Strategy
In FY2016, the Group was awarded 
a new strategic development and 
manufacturing agreement with retinal 
therapeutics company, Oxular Limited. 
The contract is related to novel ocular 
device and drug applications designed 
to access specific small spaces in 
the eye and to provide unique drug 
distribution to treat retinal diseases. 
As well as representing the Group’s 
first combined device/ formulation 
contract, it also extended the 
Group’s competencies into the ocular 
therapeutic area, in line with our  
stated strategy.
Aesica’s oral delivery capabilities and 
drug formulation and manufacturing 
services are highly complementary to 
Bespak’s business. The global oral drug 
delivery market is forecast to reach 
US$100 billion in 2018, growing at an 
estimated CAGR of 9.4% between 
2013 and 2018. The implementation 
of different technologies for oral 
drug delivery is changing the market 
scenario, with this area receiving high 
levels of attention from pharmaceutical 
companies due to the advantages 
that research can provide, such as 
reformulations, which can reposition 
drugs and delay patent expiry.
Strategy
The Group’s strategy is to continue 
to drive organic growth in oral drug 
formulation and manufacture by 
building on Aesica’s foundations of new 
business development, key account 
management, project management 
and continuous improvement.
Consort Medical’s approach to 
the nicotine delivery sector was 
to industrialise and commercialise 
Nicovations Limited (Nicovations) 
Voke
®
 device, an MHRA approved 
nicotine inhaler for harm reduction 
in smoking. Inevitably, not all of 
Consort’s development projects reach 
commercial launch, and on 3 January 
2017 we announced that Nicovations 
had terminated its supply agreements 
with Bespak for Voke
®
, exercising its 
contractual right in the event that 
Voke
®
 was not commercially launched 
before 31 December 2016. Confidential 
settlement terms have since been 
agreed with Nicovations.
The global point of care diagnostics 
market is forecast to reach US$37 billion 
by 2021, growing at an estimated 
CAGR of 9.8% between 2016 and 
2021. Market growth is being driven by 
the combined benefits of increased 
patient compliance, improved patient 
outcomes and lower cost of provision. 
Pharmaceutical companies are looking 
to exploit POC systems as part of a 
companion diagnostics strategy where 
drugs and tests are sold as combined 
“test and treat” packages.
Strategy
The Group’s POC Diagnostics strategy 
is focused on the commercialisation of 
the Atlas Genetics device as a first stage 
penetration of the market. Substantial 
progress has been made in the last 
year in the POC card development, 
in conjunction with Bespak who 
separately provide development and 
manufacturing services to Atlas, and 
with the development of the card 
reader and assay tests. In FY2016, 
Atlas announced that it had received 
approval to CE Mark its Chlamydia 
Trachomatis (CT) test to be launched 
on the Group’s io
®
 platform. By meeting 
the requirements of the IVD Directive 
(98/79/EC), the CT test is now cleared 
for sale within the European Union. In 
January 2017 Consort subscribed £3.1m 
alongside existing shareholders and 
a new investor, Wondfo Biotech, in a 
£28.4m Series D equity financing by 
Atlas. The funds will be used to finance 
the continued development of Atlas’ 
combined Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea 
(CT/NG) assay and test cartridge, which 
is planned for regulatory approvals in 
the US and Europe around the end 
of 2017. The equity raise also provides 
funding to expand manufacturing 
capacity at Bespak. Following a 
successful outcome to this programme, 
Consort Medical intends to leverage the

SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE
Group revenue increased by 6.2% to 
£294.0m (FY2016: £276.9m). Bespak 
delivered growth of 3.3% to £121.1m 
(FY2016: £117.2m) while Aesica 
revenue grew by 8.2% to £172.9m 
(FY2016: £159.7m). The Group achieved 
underlying growth of 2.0% at constant 
exchange rates.
EBIT before special items increased by 
8.3% to £40.0m (FY2016: £37.0m) and 
by 4.1% at constant exchange rates. 
This included 3.9% growth from Bespak 
to £26.1m (FY2016: £25.2m) which 
continues to deliver strong operating 
leverage on higher revenues. Bespak 
EBIT margin increased by 10bps to 
21.6%. Aesica EBIT increased 17.7% to 
£13.9m, with EBIT margin growing 60bps 
to 8.0% reflecting improved underlying 
operating performance. 
Special items before tax were £13.7m 
in the year (FY2016: £21.0m), largely 
comprising charges associated with the 
acquisition of businesses with: £13.0m 
of amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangibles (FY2016: £13.1m); £0.2m of 
advisory and acquisition costs (FY2016: 
£1.4m) and £0.5m of reorganisation 
costs (FY2016: £6.5m).
Finance costs were £4.5m (FY2016: 
£4.7m) benefiting from a reduction in 
interest on borrowings. Group earnings 
before tax and special items increased 
by 10.4% to £35.6m (FY2016: £32.3m). 
Adjusted basic EPS increased by 13.1% 
to 65.1p (FY2016: 57.6p). Basic EPS 
increased by 50.5% to 46.2p  
(FY2016: 30.7p).
Cash generated from operations before 
special items decreased by £2.6m 
to £51.5m (FY2016: £54.1m). EBITDA 
before special items grew £4.4m (9.1%) 
to £52.7m (FY2016: £48.3m). Bespak 
EBITDA grew 5.6% to £32.1m, with Aesica 
growing 15.0% to £20.6m. Working 
capital decreased by £0.5m to £13.5m 
(FY2016: £14.0m). Capital expenditure of 
£18.1m (FY2016: £21.5m) included £6.6m 
from Bespak (FY2016: £12.7m) and 
£11.5m from Aesica (FY2016: £8.8m).
The Group balance sheet closed with 
a net debt position of £92.6m (FY2016: 
£97.0m), representing gearing of 
1.7x Net debt: EBITDA. This reduction 
in gearing is in line with our strategy 
and comfortably within the banking 
facility covenant (maximum 3.0x). The 
Group has comfortable cash resource 
availability with total committed 
facilities of £166.6m.
The Board is proposing an increased 
final dividend of 13.21p (FY2016: 12.56p), 
making a total dividend for the year of 
20.30p (FY2016: 19.31p).
FURTHER INVESTMENT IN  
ATLAS GENETICS
In January 2017, Consort subscribed 
for a further £3.1m equity investment 
in Atlas Genetics Ltd (“Atlas”) as part 
of a £28.4m Series D funding. Atlas is a 
diagnostic company developing ultra-
rapid point of care tests for a range of 
infectious diseases. Consort now holds 
a 15.2% shareholding in Atlas (13.4% on 
a fully diluted basis) having invested a 
total to date of £9.4m in the company.
This investment followed Atlas 
Genetics’ successful CE marking for the 
Chlamydia Trachomatis (CT) io
®
  
test cartridge and the funding was 
raised to finance the continued 
development of the combined 
Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea (CT/NG) 
assay and test cartridge. This is planned 
for regulatory approvals in the US and 
Europe around early 2018. The equity 
raise also provides funding to expand 
manufacturing capacity at Bespak, 
which is Atlas’ development, and 
manufacturing partner. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR PERFORMANCE
Strategic Report
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
CONTINUED
Bespak has a well-established and 
diverse core business of products in 
volume manufacturing with a strong 
pipeline of innovative products. 
These products include: respiratory, 
nasal, ocular and injectable drug 
delivery, as well as point of care 
diagnostics. Once again, the business 
has grown in the year supported by 
the commercialisation of two of its 
development pipeline projects.
Revenue grew 3.3% to £121.1m with 
Bespak’s leading respiratory products 
continuing to perform well and strong 
growth of the injectables business. 
The Group’s diversification strategy to 
reduce its dependence on respiratory 
products has made good progress with 
non-respiratory sales now at 21% of 
revenue (compared to 8% in 2012). 
Bespak grew revenue despite the 
impact of a lower level of activity with 
Nicovations due to the termination 
of the supply agreement. This 
demonstrates the strength of the 
business through its broad range of 
programmes. Service revenue also 
continued its strong contribution 
given the growing development and 
innovation pipelines.
The good revenue performance 
translated to EBIT growth, which 
increased 3.9% to £26.1m, as EBIT margin 
increased 10bps to 21.6%.
In October 2016, Bespak exhibited 
alongside Aesica at the CPHI exhibition 
in Barcelona. This was the second  
time both companies have shared a 
major industry exhibition platform,  
and the event drew increased interest 
in the joint service offering of device 
and drug.
Product Development
In line with our strategy we have 
assembled a full and broad product 
development pipeline of underlying 
growth opportunities, which 
supplements the strong core business 
going forward. Successful conversion 
of these opportunities will provide 
progressive revenue and profit growth, 
in both contract manufacturing and 
products with our own proprietary IP. 
This is across a range of therapeutic 
areas, including commercial  
drug handling.
Our published development portfolio 
provides an update on the key business 
development projects in the business. 
We guide that for inclusion in the 
published portfolio, projects must have 
a reasonable expectation of success, 
though timescales are difficult to 
predict, and are expected to produce 
peak annual sales of at least £3m  
per annum. 
In the period, UCB received regulatory 
approval from the European Medicines 
Agency for INJ570, an auto-injector  
for UCB’s Cimzia
®
, which was 
successfully launched in the UK. The 
product has also been launched in 
other European markets.
Bespak also entered into a landmark 
commercial supply agreement for 
Bespak’s proprietary respiratory devices 
with AstraZeneca AB (referred to as 
project VAL100). This is a multi-year 
agreement for the scale up and supply 
of Bespak’s proprietary pressurised 
metered dose inhaler (pMDI) valves and 
actuators. These have been assembled 
with AstraZeneca’s Bevespi Aerosphere
®
 
(glycopyrrolate and formoterol 
fumarate) inhalation aerosol indicated 
for the long term maintenance 
treatment of airflow obstruction in 
patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), including 
bronchitis and/or emphysema. 
AstraZeneca announced that its device 
was approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) on 25 April 2016 
and the Bevespi Aerosphere
®
 has now 
been launched in the US.
We have also signed a significant new 
master agreement for our proprietary 
Vapoursoft
®
 Syrina
®
 auto-injector 
technology (project SYR075) with a 
leading global biopharmaceutical 
company. Initially there is a single 
drug/device combination, but the 
agreement allows for the addition of 
others, and contains outline terms for 
commercial supply.
Bespak has made good progress on 
DEV610 where it is working with Mylan in 
developing a generic Advair product. 
Mylan has announced that they are in 
discussion with the FDA following receipt 
of a Complete Response Letter as part 
of the regulatory process. 
Inevitably, not all of Consort’s 
development projects reach 
commercial launch, and on 3 January 
2017 we announced that Nicovations 
had terminated its supply agreements 
with Bespak for Voke
®
, exercising its 
contractual right in the event that 
Voke was not commercially launched 
before 31 December 2016. Confidential 
settlement terms have since been 
agreed with Nicovations.

 AR 2.25 auto-injector. This 
innovative auto-injector is the latest 
addition to the Vapoursoft
®
 powered 
Syrina
®
 range and is suitable for 
delivering volumes of up to 2.0ml using 
a standard 2.25ml pre-filled syringe. The 
Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 provides patients with 
a fully-automatic two-step, compact 
device for self-administration of viscous 
drug formulations.
Bespak’s proprietary Vapoursoft
®
 
compact energy source is able to 
deliver 2.0ml of viscous drug solutions 
smoothly and safely in less than 15 
seconds. Designed with a hidden 
needle, Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 offers automatic 
needle insertion and retraction, as well 
as drug delivery with a single push-on-
skin operation. Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 has  
been tailored specifically for higher 
viscosities while still enabling the safe 
use of glass syringes.
Using Vapoursoft
®
 at its core allows 
a compact design and, with quiet 
operation, provides a discrete solution 
for patients. Syrina
®
 AR 2.25 is clinical 
trial ready, enabling a fast track 
implementation process once paired 
with a specific drug formulation. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR PERFORMANCE
Strategic Report
Aesica revenue grew 8.2% to £172.9m, 
which included underlying growth of 
£1.6m (1.0%) at constant exchange 
rates. The division has continued to 
make solid progress in the year in 
improving its operating performance 
and EBIT margin. EBIT in FY2017 grew 
by 17.7% to £13.9m, with EBIT margin 
growing by 60bps to 8.0%. Underlying 
profit growth was £0.5m (4.5%) at 
constant exchange rates.  
This includes improvements in 
operational performance across the 
network from upgrades to teams and 
processes as well as an improvement in 
the product mix. 
We are now routinely supplying 
commercial product using the first 
semi-continuous processing line 
and technology installed at the 
Queenborough site and we anticipate 
using this line for additional third party 
development work in the future.
Aesica has moved from validation to 
routine supply of S+ flurbiprofen to a 
leading Japanese pharmaceutical 
company to provide the active 
ingredient for an anti-inflammatory 
formulation.
Aesica attaches a very high priority 
to maintaining a solid track record of 
compliance in an evolving regulatory 
environment. During the year two sites 
were subject to routine FDA audits and 
the observations raised have been 
addressed and shared across other 
sites. Aesica continues to focus on 
safety in the work environment and 
there has been a further reduction in its 
lost time accident rate over the last  
12 months.
Business Development  
and Innovation
We are beginning to see the benefits 
of restructuring our sales and marketing 
activities, although the lead times in 
our industry can be long. We recently 
signed a contract extension with one 
of our major customers and have seen 
some diversification of our customer 
base in some geographies towards 
speciality pharma which is providing 
further opportunities for growth. 
We are in receipt of significant orders 
from a European speciality pharma 
customer to manufacture proprietary 
API following a technically challenging 
validation exercise. 
Recent contract wins with regional 
pharma companies demonstrate 
that our commitment to operational 
performance, customer focus and a 
more targeted business development 
effort across Europe is beginning to 
generate returns. The increase in the 
number of potential opportunities 
we are seeing provides us with an 
encouraging backdrop to secure 
further growth.
A changing regulatory requirement 
within the pharmaceutical industry is for 
products to be uniquely identifiable at 
the individual pack level. This process 
is known in the industry as serialisation. 
Aesica has been an early provider 
of serialisation services to the industry 
including China and Latin America that 
have adopted this process. It is also well 
advanced in developing the service 
for the next wave of territories adopting 
serialisation including the EU. We believe 
Aesica is in a strong position relative 
to the sector in general and we have 
been actively promoting this offering 
with marketing and industry events 
such as a recent webinar series. Further 
capital expenditure is being committed 
to enhance our capabilities in this area.
Pipeline
Aesica is primarily focused on two pools 
of business development: development 
services and manufacturing services, 
with some overlap between the two.
• Development services applies 
to know-how in API/formulation 
development to a wide range of 
project opportunities for a wide range 
of customers at differing stages of the 
clinical trial cycle
• Manufacturing services revenue 
mainly comes from the application 
of its process technology and know-
how to specific API and drug product 
manufacturing opportunities. Many 
of these may be different from 
those API/formulation development 
opportunities
The Aesica commercial team is focused 
on a growing pipeline of API/formulation 
development opportunities supported 
by our ability to meet customer needs 
across a number of technology 
offerings. This includes an opportunity for 
API and formulation development that 
could lead to commercial manufacture 
and packaging of finished products  
for patients.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Consort has again delivered growth 
against the prior year with revenue and 
EBIT up in both divisions and margins 
benefiting from further operating 
leverage. The Group reduced Net 
debt whilst continuing to invest in the 
business to support its development 
opportunities.
INCOME STATEMENT
Group revenue grew by £17.1m (6.2%) 
to £294.0m (FY2016: £276.9m), driven 
by underlying growth in Bespak and 
Aesica as well as the translation of 
our overseas revenues results at more 
favourable exchange rates. EBIT before 
special items increased by £3.0m 
(8.3%) to £40.0m (FY2016: £37.0m) 
due to underlying growth, improved 
productivity and the benefit from 
favourable exchange rates. Group EBIT 
margin increased to 13.6% (FY2016: 
13.4%). Further analysis of Bespak and 
Aesica revenue, EBIT and margins is 
provided in the Business Reviews.
Finance costs were lower at £4.5m 
(FY2016: £4.7m) as a result of lower 
interest payable on borrowings. 
Increased EBIT and lower finance costs 
led to an increase in earnings before tax 
and special items of £3.3m (10.4%) to 
£35.6m (FY2016: £32.3m).
Earnings before tax and after special 
items increased by £10.6m to £21.9m 
(FY2016: £11.3m) as a result of profitable 
growth and a lower level of acquisition 
related costs. Earnings after tax before 
special items increased 13.3% to £31.8m 
(FY2016: £28.1m). Adjusted basic EPS 
increased by 13.1% to 65.1p (FY2016: 
57.6p). Basic unadjusted EPS increased 
by 50.5% to 46.2p (FY2016: 30.7p). 
Consort has grown EBIT and margins  
in both divisions and reduced the level 
of net debt while continuing to invest  
in the business.

Strategic Report
TAXATION 
The tax charge before special items was 
£3.8m (FY2016: £4.2m) resulting in an 
effective rate of 10.7% (FY2016: 13.0%). 
This included the benefit of prior year 
adjustments on final tax computations 
following the Aesica acquisition. There 
was a tax credit on special items of 
£4.5m (FY2016: £8.9m). The total tax 
credit was £0.7m (FY2016: £4.7m).
Following the introduction in 2013 
of the Research and Development 
Expenditure Credit (RDEC), the Group 
has realised an R&D tax credit of £1.8m 
in the year (FY2016: £2.4m) that was 
recognised through EBIT in the period, 
benefiting both Bespak and Aesica.
Bespak continues to benefit from the 
progressive implementation of the UK’s 
Patent Box regime on earnings from its 
patented products. The benefit in the 
year was £1.7m in its cash tax  
(FY2016: £1.2m).
The Group’s effective tax rate (ETR) 
has decreased to 10.7% from 13.0%. 
This reflects a combination of factors, 
including the benefits of the Patent Box 
and some prior year tax adjustments 
including the utilisation of brought 
forward tax losses. The outlook for the 
ETR for FY2018 is expected to increase to 
c.16%, subject to the mix of Bespak sales 
(IP and non-IP protected), and the mix 
of Aesica sales between UK, Germany 
and Italy.
The Group’s tax strategy continues to 
follow the commercial development of 
the business, whilst taking advantage 
of government tax incentive policies 
where available in the jurisdictions within 
which it operates. The Group continues 
to be rated low risk by HMRC.
DIVIDEND
The Board has reviewed the dividend 
and is proposing an increased final 
dividend of 13.21p (FY2016: 12.56p) 
making a total dividend for the year of 
20.30p (FY2016: 19.31p). The dividend 
will be paid on 27 October 2017 to 
shareholders on the register at  
22 September 2017, following our AGM 
on 6 September 2017. The shares will 
go ex-dividend on 21 September 2017. 
Dividend cover, based on earnings 
before special items, was 3.2 times 
(FY2016: 3.0 times).
SPECIAL ITEMS FROM  
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Special items are those items which the 
Group considers to be non-repetitive 
or are not part of the underlying 
performance of the business. Often 
a material cost or credit is incurred in 
one year to deliver a future benefit. 
In FY2017 special items amounted to 
£13.7m (FY2016: £21.0m) and mainly 
comprise of charges associated with 
the acquisition of businesses with: 
£13.0m of amortisation of acquisition-
related intangibles (FY2016: £13.1m); 
£0.2m of advisory and acquisition 
costs (FY2016: £1.4m); and £0.5m of 
reorganisation costs (FY2016: £6.5m). 
INVESTMENT IN ATLAS  
GENETICS LIMITED
On 23 January 2017, Consort subscribed 
£3.1m as part of a £28.4m series D equity 
issue by Atlas Genetics Limited. Atlas is a 
diagnostic company developing ultra-
rapid point of care tests for a range of 
infectious diseases. Consort has now 
invested a total £9.4m in Atlas Genetics 
and holds an equity share of 15.2% 
(13.4% on a fully diluted basis).
Following the successful CE marking for 
the Chlamydia Trachomatis (CT) io
®
 test 
cartridge, the funding is being used to 
finance the continued development 
of the combined Chlamydia and 
Gonorrhoea (CT/NG) assay and test 
cartridge. This is planned for regulatory 
approvals in the US and Europe around 
early 2018. The equity raise also provides 
financing to expand manufacturing 
capacity at Bespak. More information 
about Atlas Genetics is available via 
their website www.atlasgenetics.com.
The Group will continue to account for 
Atlas Genetics as an equity investment 
in the accounts of Consort.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED
BALANCE SHEET
The Group had Net debt of £92.6m at 
the year end (FY2016: £97.0m). At  
30 April 2017 it had drawn £113.0m of 
its committed revolving credit facility, 
leaving undrawn facilities of £53.6m. 
In addition, it has a further £65m 
potentially available under its accordion 
facility as described below. Net assets 
at the year-end were £212.1m (FY2016: 
£209.1m) after continuing to invest 
across the business to drive growth and 
carefully manage working capital. The 
pension deficit increased to £44.6m 
(FY2016: £27.2m) while provisions at 
30 April 2017 were £2.8m following 
settlement of prior year balances  
(30 April 2016: £6.2m).
CASH FLOW, FINANCING  
AND LIQUIDITY
Cash generated from operations before 
special items decreased by £2.6m to 
£51.5m (FY2016: £54.1m). EBITDA before 
special items increased by £4.4m (9.1%) 
to £52.7m (FY2016: £48.3m). Working 
capital
1
 decreased by £0.5m to £13.5m 
(FY2016: £14.0m).
Capital expenditure of £18.1m was 
lower than the previous year (FY2016: 
£21.5m) with Bespak completing 
planned investments in facilities 
and production capacity to fulfil 
its development pipeline contracts 
and Aesica investing in enhancing its 
operations including investments in 
serialisation capabilities.
The Group has a £160m multi-currency 
revolving committed credit facility with 
Barclays, Lloyds, RBS and Santander 
which expires in September 2019. 
Margins are between 1.2% and 2.2% 
over LIBOR depending upon the ratio 
of Net debt to EBITDA prevailing at the 
time. A non-utilisation fee of the  
interest margin on the undrawn 
balance applies.
1 Working capital is defined as total 
inventory, trade and other receivables, 
trade and other payables and derivatives.
The facility has two covenants: Net debt 
to EBITDA less than 3.0x and Interest 
Cover over EBITDA being greater than 
three times. The Group continues to 
operate within its covenants at 30 April 
2017: Net debt to EBITDA was 1.7x, and 
Interest Cover was 17.0 times.
The Group also has a £65m “accordion” 
facility, by which further funding may 
be made available by the participating 
banks under the current terms to 
support significant investment or 
acquisition opportunities which  
may arise.
The Group maintains levels of Sterling 
cash sufficient to meet imminent 
obligations and to be a reserve in case 
of an adverse event. These funds are 
held with a range of reputable financial 
institutions approved by the Board.
The Company’s articles of association 
(“Articles”) impose a limit on the 
amount of borrowings that may be 
undertaken by the Company and its 
subsidiaries. Shareholders approved 
certain resolutions at an EGM on 27 April 
2017 which amended the Articles by 
increasing the borrowing limit to three 
times adjusted capital and reserves (the 
definition of which was amended so as 
not to require the deduction of goodwill 
and intangibles).

OUR PERFORMANCE
Strategic Report
FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE
The Group monitors its foreign currency 
exposures carefully and seeks to 
mitigate all material transactional 
exposures. Bespak currently has low 
exposure to movements in the Euro and 
US Dollar. Aesica has wider exposure to 
the Euro. Where appropriate we buy or 
sell forward foreign currency to protect 
transaction margin exposure.
As a result of the Group’s German and 
Italian Euro denominated operations, 
foreign currency translation sensitivity 
for the Euro is such that a Eur 1c 
strengthening in the Euro:GBP exchange 
rate increases revenue by £0.8m and 
EBIT by £0.1m. 
PENSIONS
The IAS 19 pension valuation at 30 April 
2017 was a total deficit of £44.6m  
(30 April 2016: £27.2m). The defined 
benefit pension obligations of the 
Group comprise both Bespak and 
Aesica schemes.
Bespak Scheme
In 2002, the Bespak Retirement Benefits 
Scheme (a defined benefit pension 
scheme) was closed to new members. 
From 31 March 2016 the Scheme was 
closed to further accrual via a deed of 
amendment between the Group and 
the Trust. Following the Scheme closure, 
all former active members became 
deferred members, and the provision 
of pension benefits was migrated to a 
defined contribution pension scheme 
which is also available to  
new employees. 
As at 30 April 2017, the Bespak IAS 
19 deficit was £40.6m compared 
with £23.4m as at 30 April 2016. The 
significant increase in the deficit was 
primarily due to a marked reduction in 
the discount rates which has increased 
the defined benefit obligation. The last 
triennial actuarial valuation was as at 
30 April 2014 and in September 2015 
an actuarial valuation of the deficit 
was agreed at £13.8m. The Company 
agreed to make deficit recovery 
contributions at the rate of £1.5m per 
annum until 2028. An updated actuarial 
valuation is due to take place as at 
30 April 2017 and as discount rates 
have reduced since the last triennial 
valuation, it is expected that this in 
particular may have a material effect 
on the updated valuation. 
Aesica Schemes
Aesica operates a number of different 
pension schemes, including defined 
benefit schemes in Italy and Germany. 
These are in a net IAS 19 deficit  
position of £4.0m at 30 April 2017  
(30 April 2016: £3.8m).
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group is exposed to a number 
of risks and considers effective risk 
management to be a high priority. We 
have an established framework for 
assessing these risks and processes and 
procedures to partly mitigate them. 
We are pleased to report that the 
Group incurred no material financial or 
business losses in the year.

New contracts (development portfolio) with existing and new customers – the 
Group maintains a healthy portfolio of opportunities and monitors their progression 
towards commercial launch.

During FY2017 we successfully added two new projects to Bespak’s development portfolio – one 
respiratory project and one injectable. Bespak’s development portfolio has grown to 15 live 
programmes.
In the injectables space, we signed a significant new master agreement for our proprietary 
Vapoursoft
®
 Syrina
®
 auto-injector technology (project SYR075) with a leading global 
biopharmaceutical company. Initially, there is a single drug/device combination, but the 
agreement allows for the addition of others, and contains outline terms for commercial supply.
In respiratory, we signed a significant new commercial supply agreement for Bespak’s 
proprietary respiratory devices with AstraZeneca. This is a multi-year agreement for the scale-
up and supply of Bespak’s proprietary pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) valves and 
actuators for AstraZeneca’s Bevespi Aerosphere
®
 inhalation aerosol which was approved by the 
US FDA in April 2016 and launched in the USA in January 2017.
Also in the period, UCB received regulatory approval from the European Medicines Agency 
for INJ570, an auto-injector for UCB’s Cimzia
®
, which was successfully launched in the UK. The 
product has also been launched in other European markets.
Market and product diversification
Bespak revenue from non-MDI products is reviewed to assess the extent to which 
Bespak has diversified revenues from the core respiratory MDI business.
£59.9m £57.3m
Bespak’s revenue from non-MDI products increased by £2.6m in FY2017 as a result of its growing 
dry powder inhaler business; a significant increase in revenue from other sources, including  
75% increase in injectables sales. Group revenue has continued to diversify with Aesica’s growing 
contribution.

Higher value business models
The Group’s strategy is to help sustain organic growth through increased 
capabilities and the development of the innovation pipeline to generate  
future revenues.
4 4 Following on from the award, in FY2016, of the Group’s first drug and device development and 
manufacturing contract with Oxular, the Group continues to pursue new opportunities that will 
leverage both Bespak’s device development and manufacturing, as well as Aesica’s formulation, 
manufacturing and filling capabilities. 
During FY2017 Aesica has been routinely supplying commercial product using the first semi-
continuous processing line and technology installed at the Queenborough site and we anticipate 
using this line for additional third party development work in the future.
Growth and investment
The Group reviews operating cash flow (defined as cash from operations less 
capital expenditure) as a percentage of operating profit (both before special 
items) in order to generate a cash conversion metric and understand the 
relationship between trading, cash and capital investment.
83% 91%
In the current year, the Group’s conversion of operating profit into cash inflows reduced to 83%. 
This was mainly driven by adverse working capital variances as a result of releases/utilisation of 
deferred income and provisions balances.

EBIT growth vs. revenue growth
The Group reviews the level of EBIT growth against the level of revenue growth at 
both the Group, and divisional levels, to evaluate operating leverage.
4 4 EBIT before special items increased by 8.3% to £40.0m and by 4.1% at constant exchange rates. 
This included 3.9% growth from Bespak to £26.1m (FY2016: £25.2m) which has continued to 
deliver strong operating leverage on higher revenues. Bespak EBIT margin increased by 10bps to 
21.6%. Aesica EBIT increased 17.7% to £13.9m, with EBIT margin growing 60bps to 8.0% reflecting 
improved underlying operating performance during the period.

A changing regulatory requirement within the pharmaceutical industry is for products to 
be uniquely identifiable at the individual pack level. This process is known in the industry 
as serialisation. Aesica has been an early provider of serialisation services to the industry 
including China and Latin America that have adopted this process. It is also well advanced in 
developing the service for the next wave of territories adopting serialisation including the EU. 
We believe Aesica is in a strong position relative to the sector in general and we have been 
actively promoting this offering with marketing and industry events such as a recent webinar 
series. Further capital expenditure is being committed to enhance our capabilities in this area.

as falling within the following key  
focus areas: 
• Health and Safety – ensuring the 
safety and well-being of our staff
• Environment – managing our 
environmental impact areas of waste, 
energy and water
• Employees – supporting our people  
to develop and flourish within  
the business
• Community – positive interaction with 
the communities in which we operate 
• Ethical Standards – operating to the 
highest ethical standards
We remain committed to ensuring these 
activities become embedded in how 
we operate and contribute towards the 
success of our business. This includes not 
only identifying and managing business 
risk but exploring opportunities to add 
value to the business.
GOVERNANCE 
We hold three meetings of our 
Corporate Responsibility (CR) 
Committee, chaired by non-executive 
director Ian Nicholson, each year. 
These meetings are attended by senior 
leaders from across the Group, with the 
aim to review current performance, and 
challenge the business in meeting future 
targets and objectives in each of our 
key focus areas.  25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR PERFORMANCE
Strategic Report
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
We continue to enhance our 
performance through active 
engagement with our key stakeholders. 
This includes working with our 
employees to integrate responsible 
business practices into everyday 
business activity, encouraging 
innovative solutions and a shared 
ownership of this agenda. We also 
extend this engagement out to our 
customers, suppliers and communities 
to ensure we maintain a two-way 
dialogue which feeds back into building 
a sustainable future for our business.
As an example, with respect to 
safety and the environment, Bespak 
continues to actively promote safe 
ways of working with all visitors and 
contractors coming onto any Bespak 
site. Regular forums to discuss safety 
and environmental impacts have been 
established with the wider King’s Lynn 
community to also share best practice 
with our industrial neighbours and 
regulatory bodies (local council).
OUR PERFORMANCE 
The business is continually challenged to 
enhance performance across our focus 
areas. Each year we set a number of 
targets and key performance indicators. 
Progress against these are then 
reviewed throughout the year by our CR 
Committee. The sections below provide 
a summary of performance across the 
Group against each of our focus areas. 
HEALTH AND SAFETY
The safety and well-being of our staff 
and all visitors to our facilities remains a 
priority for everyone within the business. 
We continue to focus on all aspects 
of health and safety, with a special 
emphasis on those areas with the 
potential to cause serious harm. 
The number of RIDDORs (Reportable 
Incident leading to seven day Lost Time 
Accident) reported across the Group 
totalled 11, against a target of seven. 
The internal targets set for RIDDOR 
performance were not met during 
FY2017. Consequently in the coming 
year we will be engaging in a number 
of new initiatives as detailed below.
Sharing EHS Learning and Best 
Practise – Safety Pause 
Sharing of best practice and learning 
from near misses and incidents has 
further developed between the Aesica 
and Bespak divisions. Closer integration 
of the Environmental Health and Safety 
(EHS) resources within the divisions 
continues with, for example,  
sharing of the EHS improvement 
planning structure. 
Additionally a quarterly review has 
been established to ensure that the 
heads of EHS across Bespak and Aesica 
meet to discuss safety programmes and 
initiatives, share information including 
data around accidents, near misses etc. 
and agree any standard approaches  
to progressing safety agendas across 
both divisions. 
Bespak – Behavioural Safety 
Programme
Following the employee safety 
survey, Bespak have engaged with a 
“behavioural safety training company” , 
Lattitude Safety. This collaboration 
has seen circa 90 leaders of people 
receiving a one day behavioural safety 
training course focused on leadership 
responsibilities in behavioural safety 
and how to undertake effective 
conversations on behaviours and safe 
conduct. To support this training, a 
simple tool has been developed and 
introduced to capture conversations 
and a target of four safety-related 
conversations per month minimum has 
been set. 
In February 2017, Bespak formally 
launched its Behavioural Safety 
Programme company-wide by inviting 
Ken Woodward to the Bespak town 
hall meeting as the event’s inspirational 
speaker. Ken spoke about the 
workplace accident which cost him his 
eyesight and the impacts this had on 
him, his family, friends and colleagues. 
The key message was that he took 
responsibility for the events that led to 
his accident and that if he had followed 
correct procedures and thought about 
the implications of his actions, the 
accident would not have occurred.
This sent a powerful message to the 
Bespak organisation and provided an 
excellent starting point to phase one 
of the colleague Behavioural Safety 
training which commenced in March 
2017. This phase focuses on personal 
safety. Phase two, which focuses on the 
safety of others, will commence in  
FY2017.
Aesica
Aesica have continued to promote 
the health and safety message with 
the introduction of health and safety 
specific site improvement plans which 
are developed by the individual 
sites. The timing and review process is 
coincident with the financial budgeting 
and performance review to support the 
message that strong health and safety 
performance underpins everything else 
in the business. 
To support the EHS improvement 
planning and delivery process, the 
business has aligned EHS efforts with a 
holistic approach in combination with 
the principles of lean manufacturing 
and continuous improvement. The 
vision builds upon the core foundations 
of “Environmental Compliance” , 
“Contained and Reliable Plant” , 
“Competence and Discipline” and 
finally that “Safety is our Priority” .

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
CONTINUED
ENVIRONMENT
Activity to reduce our environmental 
impact across the Group is focused 
on environmental management, 
energy reduction, minimisation of 
waste, diversion of waste from landfill/
incineration and water conservation. 
The Environmental Management 
System ISO14001 enables effective 
management of these impacts with 
all Bespak sites and Aesica’s two UK 
manufacturing sites and Pianezza, Italy 
certified to this Standard. 
For the first year we have reported 
against combined Group targets for 
energy and waste reduction, whilst 
also resetting the baseline year to 
FY2016. This creates the necessary 
accountability at Group level and 
benchmarks performance against more 
recent baseline data.
FY2017 has seen an increased 
emphasis by the Aesica business 
on environmental compliance. This 
is demonstrated by the significant 
investment in both infrastructure  
and expertise. 
Due to legacy issues regarding 
Environmental Permit compliance 
dating back to 2008, the 
Environment Agency issued the 
Aesica Queenborough site with an 
Enforcement Notice in July of FY2017. 
The site has worked closely with the 
Agency to close out this notice, 
completing all requirements within the 
allocated deadline.
ENERGY
The Group’s energy consumption, 
as measured in kWh/£’000 sales, has 
decreased from 630.5 kWh/£000 in 
FY2016 to 581.3 in FY2017. This represents 
a percentage reduction of 7.8%, 
thereby meeting the annual Group 
reduction target of 4%.
Bespak’s energy consumption as 
measured in kWh/£’000 sales has 
decreased by 2.9% from the FY2016 
baseline year. Further improvement was 
inhibited by delays to manufacturing 
operations, however, this was partially 
mitigated through pro-active controls 
to minimise energy consumption of 
operations in construction. In addition, 
the Nelson operations experienced 
a change in the mix of products 
produced which had an adverse 
impact on the energy metric.
Investment in refurbishment of the 
offices at the King’s Lynn site will 
introduce more energy efficient air 
conditioning (heating and cooling) 
to the main office areas. In addition, 
evaluations of capital investment 
opportunities are ongoing to further 
reduce energy consumption. Specific 
opportunities under consideration are:
• more widespread introduction of LED 
lighting; and 
• replacement of less energy efficient 
plant such as steam humidifiers, pump 
systems, chillers and transformers.
Aesica’s energy consumption as 
measured in kWh/£’000 sales has 
decreased by 10.4% from the FY2016 
baseline year. Aesica has made good 
progress on environmental projects in 
the area of energy efficiency. Examples 
of successes that has and continue to 
provide benefit are:
• Replacing traditional lighting with  
LED bulbs at Queenborough  
and Monheim
• Compressed air leak checking at 
both the German sites, this project has 
been in association with Chemintiz 
University of Technology
• Air compressor replacement and 
improvements at Pianezza and 
Queenborough providing both 
business contingency and  
energy reduction
• HVAC control improvements allowing 
dynamic switch on/ switch off for the 
ventilation system in Pianezza
• Chiller replacement and full electricity 
sub-metering at Queenborough 
has involved 1km of wiring and ten 
new sub-meters installed. These 
projects have both reduced energy 
consumption and provided details of 
usage across site

WASTE
In FY2017 the Group diverted 97.4% of 
waste from landfill/incineration. This has 
remained constant against the 97.4% 
diversion levels recorded in FY2016. 
Unfortunately this was 0.1% below our 
97.5% waste diversion target.
Bespak continues to increase the 
quantity of waste diverted from landfill/
incineration, showing ongoing progress 
from the prior year (where 98.5% was 
diverted). The business continues to 
focus efforts on waste segregation 
at source and waste minimisation 
activities delivered through a number 
of quality management initiatives. We 
are pleased to report that initiatives 
at the King’s Lynn site have resulted in 
achieving zero waste to landfill at the 
end of FY2016. This has been achieved 
by all non-hazardous waste being 
recovered in the form of Refuse Derived 
Fuel (RDF). Significant reduction in waste 
to landfill/incineration at the Nelson site 
has continued which has contributed to 
a very strong performance overall  
for Bespak.
In FY2017 Aesica diverted 97.2% of 
waste from landfill/incineration.  
This was achieved through numerous 
improvements in waste management 
throughout FY2017. Like Bespak, 
improved segregation has been key 
in impacting recycling/recovery rates.
Purchasing new bins for office and 
manufacturing areas, waste awareness 
sessions and improved signage has 
helped reduce the quantity of waste 
sent to landfill and helped push Aesica 
further up the waste hierarchy. A 
project at Queenborough looking to 
neutralise a high tonnage hazardous 
waste stream from one of the Active 
Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) 
processes will divert >99% waste from 
landfill. It is anticipated this project will 
be complete by the end of FY2018.
WATER
Bespak’s water reduction opportunities 
are most significant at the Nelson site, 
which accounts for more than 90% of 
all water consumed. Efforts to reduce 
water consumption over recent years 
has contributed to a breach in consent 
limits on the water quality discharged, 
defined under the Water Act, enforced 
by United Utilities. As a result, Nelson has 
modified the existing effluent treatment 
process and improved its effectiveness 
which has resulted in increased water 
consumption. A focus on long-term 
improvement entails evaluation of 
chemical treatment plants to address 
the issue. Current performance 
however, still demonstrates a 28.1% 
improvement vs FY2011 baseline for 
Bespak.
Aesica have implemented numerous 
water reduction initiatives at the 
manufacturing sites. This has helped 
to deliver a 15.5% reduction in water 
consumption for FY2017 as measured 
by m
3
/£’000 sales from FY2016 levels. 
Projects have included reducing 
the vacuum drying on one of the 
Cramlington processes, saving four 
tonnes of water per batch. This has in 
turn reduced the quantity of water  
requiring heating and subsequent 
disposal. Changes to the recirculating 
water cooling system at Pianezza 
have also seen dramatic water usage 
reductions. In Queenborough work 
has involved addressing mains water 
leakages with full site drainage surveys/ 
repairs along with full effluent system 
refurbishment. These projects have 
helped reduce overall water usage at 
the Aesica business.
EMPLOYEES
The Group remains focused on 
supporting and developing people 
through training and development, 
communications and two-way 
engagement channels.
Training and Development 
In total the Group has delivered 5,730 
training days during the year. This shows 
a strong commitment to developing our 
people and providing the necessary 
skills for individuals to excel in their roles.
Of this total, Bespak has delivered a 
total of 4,487 training days during the 
year. This training has included creative 
thinking; planning, prioritising and using 
time effectively; project management; 
recruitment and selection; and  
personal resilience.
Aesica has delivered a total of 1,243 
training days during the year. This 
number includes internally delivered 
training which accounts for 817 of the 
total days delivered and covered topics 
such as Performance Development 
Review training, Line Leader training 
and Values workshops.
Bespak’s Aspire  
Development Programme
Bespak’s Aspire Development 
Programme launched in October 2016 
and provides development  
for new line managers in the 
behavioural skills required to manage 
a team effectively and replaces 
the previous Bespak Management 
Development Programme. 
Bespak’s Inspire Leadership 
Development Programme
To build a values led culture and 
support Bespak, being a great place 
to work, all the Operational Board 
members and Senior Leadership Team 
completed a Leadership Development 
Programme. The content includes 
topics such as High Performing Mindset, 
Resilience, and Building Trust, all of 
which support leading through values 
and high performing teams. 
Aesica Academy
The Aesica Academy is an internal 
employee development programme. 
Every year employees can apply 
to participate in the nine-month 
programme and historically this  
has been open to all disciplines and 
levels. 21 delegates completed 
the 2015/16 scheme, resulting in an 
accreditation from the Institute of 
Leadership & Management.
Aesica First Line Leader Training
Aesica’s German sites have initiated 
first line leader training which aims to 
equip our leaders with some of the 
fundamentals of people management. 
A similar modular programme will 
be rolled out in the UK and Italy in 
September/October 2017. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Mentoring
Mentoring is applied across the 
Group and is a core component of 
developing our people. This helps to 
share knowledge and experiences to 
support the growth of individuals across 
the business. 
Bespak has introduced mentoring for 
apprentices to support them as they 
build their knowledge of skills and 
the business they work in. An Aesica 
mentoring programme was launched 
in March 2016 which piloted 11 mentors 
and mentees. A number of reviews 
have been carried out and feedback 
thus far has been positive with many 
mentees stating that they enjoyed their 
first experience of being developed in 
this way.
360 Feedback
The Group continues to use 360 
feedback incorporating the 
Company values to provide insight 
to our employees in support of their 
development. 
Bespak Health, Safety  
and Well-being
A health and well-being programme 
was established at Bespak during the 
year which highlights a specific topic 
each month. Topics addressed to date 
include blood pressure and stroke 
awareness, smoking cessation and care 
in the community.
Apprenticeship Scheme 
Currently Bespak has 20 apprentices on 
the Apprenticeship Training Programme. 
The Apprenticeship Qualification is also 
offered as an internal development 
programme, with 12 individuals 
provided with the opportunity to grow 
their skills and knowledge further. This 
has effectively increased the overall 
number of apprentices at Bespak to 32. 
Aesica currently has 15 apprentices on 
an Apprenticeship Training Programme, 
predominantly within the Engineering 
and Quality departments. A total of 
eight apprentices are located within the 
UK and seven at Aesica’s German sites. 
Bespak has been successful in 
achieving IMechE (Institute of 
Mechanical Engineers) accreditation 
for its Engineering Apprenticeships. 
This means that anyone completing 
one of the engineering apprenticeship 
programmes is able to register as an 
Engineering Technician. Moreover, 
Bespak’s apprenticeship scheme is now 
listed on the EngTech section of their 
website (www.imeche.org).

Apprenticeship 
Programme Pathway:
E&I Engineer
Start Date: Jan 2014
Completion Date: Jan 2018
From the middle of secondary school 
my heart fell towards the subject of 
Engineering. All this stemmed from 
coming home from school and talking 
to my Dad about his day, as he is also 
an Engineer, and wondering what it 
would be like to be one. In school I 
always loved the problem solving on 
the mechanical side as well as the 
maths on the electrical side. 
When school finished, I decided 
to write to Aesica to ask if they 
were offering any apprenticeships. 
Apprenticeships, to my mind, seemed 
to be the better way forward in 
Engineering, as you are learning the 
theory and putting into practice what 
you have learnt at the same time. 
As part of my apprenticeship, I 
spent my first six months at college 
learning the basic skills that I would 
need to set me up ready to enter 
the world of Engineering. It was 
here that I discovered Electrical 
and Instrumentation was the trade 
that I felt strongest in. At the end of 
the year there was a presentation 
evening for our year intake at college. 
I discovered, on the day of the 
presentation, that I had been selected 
by the tutors as “Electrical Apprentice 
of the Year 2014” . 
After being at college full time, I then 
dropped down to a day release 
system, where I would spend a day at 
college for two years learning all the 
theory knowledge I’d need to help set 
me up for my training and then putting 
this into use the rest of the week 
when I was on site working at Aesica. 
After the two years passed, another 
presentation evening was held for 
us all to collect our certificates. After 
being rewarded with a D*D* (Double 
Distinction, or 100%) I received an 
award for the Top Student for the  
two years. 
After receiving this award I was 
offered to then push on to take on a 
Foundation Degree in Electrical and 
Electronic Engineering, enabling me  
to gain my HNC. 
With the skills and knowledge I have 
gained from this apprenticeship I 
would like to see myself on shift being 
part of the engineering team and  
then in the future leading an 
engineering team, helping to  
support the next generation  
of apprentices  
at Aesica.  25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

I HOPE TO ENCOURAGE MORE GIRLS 
INTO STEM CAREERS
After undergoing my first year at 6th 
Form I knew it wasn’t right for me, 
and University no longer appealed to 
me, so I attended the open evening 
here at Bespak to get an insight into 
apprenticeships. It really interested 
me because I had got a taste for 
Engineering during high school but 
thought an apprenticeship would 
suit my style of learning well, which 
it certainly does. I love maths and 
science and so Engineering was a 
great combination of the two with 
added elements of design and 
development. 
As part of my apprenticeship, 
I complete allocations and 
objectives across various different 
departments; these include key 
areas such as Tooling, Moulding, 
Quality, Development, Metrology, 
Manufacturing and Continuous 
Improvement. This year I was 
also fortunate enough to do a 
week placement at the Aesica 
Queenborough site where I gained 
understanding of the manufacturing 
and packing processes, and the 
activities that support them. It was 
incredibly useful and informative as I 
got to experience a different side to 
the pharmaceutical industry that I had 
not yet participated in.
I love the fact that the Engineering 
Technical Support apprenticeship 
offers a wide range of Engineering 
roles to experience and develop skills 
in, and it gives you the opportunity 
to find an area that you particularly 
love and exceed in. I am also keen 
to promote the fact that Engineering 
isn’t always dirty and greasy or 
needs to be hands on, and would 
like to encourage more girls to get 
involved in this industry. As a Science, 
Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics (STEM) ambassador I 
actively take part in career events 
and STEM promotion because I am 
passionate about the fact that girls 
should get more exposure to the 
amazing opportunities available in the

Bespak has also recently achieved 
IMechE accreditation for the

Strategic Report
Technology Tournament
For the past three years Bespak has 
supported a Technology Tournament 
organised by the Priory Rotary Club 
including all secondary schools in the 
area. The last event took place in March 
2017 with Bespak providing a number of 
the judges and a contribution of £1,000 
towards the purchase of materials and 
awards for the participating students.
Grand East Anglia Run
Bespak has, for the past 11 years, since 
its inception, been the sole sponsor 
and supporter of the Grand East Anglia 
Run. This year the King’s Lynn Borough 
Council has decided to completely 
outsource the event and it has awarded 
the management and running of the 
event to the Jane Tomlinson “Run for 
All” charity. Bespak will continue its 
lengthy association with the event, now 
the official sponsor of the MINI GEAR 
and the GEAR Corporate events.
Charitable Support
Consort Medical’s charities policy aims 
to promote education and opportunity 
and encourage the involvement 
of employees in community and 
charitable activities and organisations. 
Over the past 12 months Consort 
Medical has supported Gaddesden 
Place Riding for the Disabled, a charity 
based in Hertfordshire, providing a 
donation of £30,000. The Corporate 
Team also donated time by attending 
the Centre and assisting with side 
walking with the riders and undertaking 
small maintenance jobs on the facility.
Bespak’s Charity Steering Group 
continues to raise the profile of 
fundraising events within the business, 
supporting numerous charities and 
employee sponsorship activities 
including Breathe Easy, Macmillan 
Coffee Morning, and the Toy Appeal for 
Freebridge Santa Grotto. 
Bespak’s Charity of the Year for FY2017 
was Friends of the Stroke Unit, on the 
West Raynham Ward, Queen Elizabeth 
Hospital, King’s Lynn, and over the year 
we have supported their Beat the Tide 
event, volunteered at a local event 
and the financial support has helped 
with the refurbishment of their day room 
on the ward. Over the year we have 
seen the ward rating change from an E 
to an A and the unit is now one of the 
top rated in the UK. By holding raffles, 
Christmas Jumper Days and cake sales 
alongside other donations Bespak have 
raised £10,000.
Each Aesica site has now appointed a 
Charity Committee with a dedicated 
budget and a number of “employee 
off site” days to allow employees the 
opportunity to provide volunteering 
support during working hours. The five 
sites have selected a “chosen charity” 
with various fundraising activities having 
taken place throughout the year, raising 
over £10,000.
ETHICAL STANDARDS
We emphasise the importance 
of operating a business in both a 
responsible and ethical manner. Bespak 
and Aesica have set appropriate 
standards and policies to uphold all 
laws relevant to the prevention of 
bribery and corruption in all jurisdictions 
in which we operate. The Group has 
in place policies and procedures 
covering Anti-Corruption and Bribery; 
Gifts and Hospitality; Business Ethics; and 
Whistleblowing.
The Group operates a zero tolerance 
policy for Bribery and Corruption of  
any kind and gives training to all 
relevant employees via an online 
training module.
During the year the Group has reviewed 
and updated its whistleblowing policy 
and has established an independent 
whistleblowing reporting service which 
encompasses a hotline and online 
reporting process. An awareness 
campaign for the new service took 
place at the time of introduction and 
all new employees are introduced 
to the arrangements as part of their 
induction. Any matters reported will be 
investigated and escalated to the Audit 
Committee, as appropriate. During the 
year no incidents have been reported.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
CONTINUED
The Group recognises that the strength 
of its business relies heavily on a stable 
and ethical supply base. To that end, 
we continue to roll out a code of 
ethical standards to our existing and 
new suppliers. This standard aims to 
ensure our entire supply base operates 
with the highest ethical standards. It 
ensures our suppliers are compliant with 
all appropriate laws and regulations, 
treat their employees with dignity 
and respect and take active steps 
to protect against modern slavery. In 
addition our code of conduct ensures 
our suppliers are respectful and 
protective of the environment, and 
compliant with health and safety laws 
and regulations at all times and that 
they never participate in acts of bribery 
and corruption. As part of our supplier 
approval process, all new suppliers are 
required to adhere to this standard.
Modern Slavery Statement
The Group welcome and support the 
introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 
2015. We have taken appropriate steps 
to ensure slavery and human  
trafficking are not taking place in our  
business or supply chain. The Group’s  
formal Modern Slavery Statement  
can be found on our website at  
www.consortmedical.com.

OUR PERFORMANCE
Strategic Report
PRINCIPAL RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES
Risk Controls and Mitigating Actions Trend
Reliance upon key customers/products: Both 
Aesica and Bespak have a degree of reliance 
on a relatively small number of key customers/
products and the loss of one such customer/
product could lead to a significant reduction  
in revenues. 
The Group has significant Intellectual Property with 
associated barriers to entry. Regulatory licensing reduces 
customers’ ability to transfer business elsewhere so a loss 
of business once approved on a customer programme 
is unusual. The Group maintains a close dialogue with all 
of its customers and seeks to enter into long term supply 
agreements where appropriate. The Group’s strategy 
of diversification has opened up a broader range of 
products and customers, and is progressively diluting  
customer/product concentration.
Major operational incident: A major incident 
(e.g. fire) at a manufacturing site may result  
in the closure of a site causing disruption to  
key supply chain and loss of assets, revenues 
and profit. 
Where possible, manufacturing is split into discrete 
buildings for separate operations providing some level 
of isolation for certain products. The Group carries out 
critical plant risk and remediation assessments at each of 
its manufacturing sites. High-profile near-miss reporting is 
performed to raise awareness of potential risks. Business 
continuity plans are also in place at major sites. 
Growth risk: The Group’s growth strategy is 
achieved through four key elements: sustained 
organic revenue growth, operating leverage, 
innovation and enhancing acquisitions/
investments. Delivery of growth carries the risk 
of execution due to allocation of resources and 
new areas of expertise.
The Group has well-honed programme planning and 
management processes. These provide good visibility 
of resource requirements, whether capital, space, 
equipment or people, and enable timely fulfilment on 
multiple parallel programmes. Programme management 
techniques are risk based and highlight risks and 
challenges for increased management focus. 
Acquisition risk: Failure to successfully execute 
or attain strategic objectives from the Group’s 
acquisitions may adversely affect the Group’s 
financial performance and position. Despite 
due diligence, changes in circumstances could 
mean that initial expectations are not met in 
whole or in part. 
The Group uses a clear set of criteria for making 
acquisition decisions while also engaging a long 
standing set of advisors who provide advice throughout 
an acquisition process. Appropriate due diligence is 
performed on all potential mergers and acquisitions. All 
acquisition plans are reviewed and sanctioned by the 
Board. Warranties and indemnities are also sought from 
the seller, which act to further reduce risk/exposure in 
certain areas.
Legal risk: As an international enterprise, the 
Group must comply with differing laws in 
different jurisdictions. This can result in a wide 
range of risks relating to contract, competition, 
trademark, patent and anti-bribery/corruption 
laws. Significant penalties, such as fines, the 
requirement to comply with monitoring or self-
reporting obligations could materially adversely 
affect our reputation, business or financial 
performance. 
The Group limits such risks by means of review by the 
Legal department and, where appropriate, by consulting 
external specialists on national laws in the jurisdictions 
concerned. There is a specific anti-corruption and anti-
bribery policy which all employees are required to comply 
with and confirm their understanding. There is also a 
whistleblowing policy in place and Bribery Act training is 
given to employees. The Group is not aware of any risks 
from legal disputes that could have a significant impact 
on its financial results or net assets. 
Political/Socio-economic risk: The Group has 
operations and customers in a number of 
countries worldwide. As a result, it is subject to 
political and socio-economic risks both globally 
and in individual countries. Political or economic 
instability may impact the performance of our 
business both operationally and financially. 
The Group maintains open relationships with its customers 
and suppliers to ensure that we are up to date on any 
political/economic conditions which may impact the 
business. The Group continually reviews any economic 
policy changes in both the UK and global markets and 
assesses if there is any impact on the business.

Strategic Report
PRINCIPAL RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES 
CONTINUED
Risk Controls and Mitigating Actions Trend
Development risk: Bespak is developing a 
range of medical device products. Aesica is 
providing pharmaceutical product formulation 
development, analytics and manufacturing 
services to pharmaceutical and biotech 
companies. At any time, any of the products 
may fail in clinical trials, be withdrawn by the 
customer or may not become commercially 
successful once launched. 
The Group follows rigorous processes for the development 
of new products. Where possible, Bespak is developing its 
device technology as a platform for multiple programmes 
to reduce the exposure to any individual trial. Aesica’s 
development services are on a fee per project basis, 
with the large majority of its revenues coming from 
manufacturing services.
Product quality failure: The Group operates 
in highly regulated markets with strict quality 
requirements. Any quality failure involving 
the Group’s products could lead to loss of 
reputation, reduction in revenues, recall costs or 
sanction by the regulators. 
The Group has rigorous quality management and 
assurance systems and processes. Incoming raw materials 
are analysed, production processes are controlled and 
products are sampled for testing prior to release. Any 
issues are tracked and reported to ensure that there is 
early communication with customers and regulatory 
bodies regarding any quality audits. 
Corporate Social Responsibility: Our 
manufactured products or other activities/
decisions of the Group may not be judged by 
the public, governments or other stakeholders 
as being socially responsible, leading to 
reputational harm. 
The Group continually reviews and explores ways to 
ensure that its business operates in a responsible manner 
across the key focus areas of: health and safety, 
environmental management, our people, ethical business 
practices and how it interacts with and supports local 
communities. The Corporate Responsibility Committee 
meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the 
divisions’ new programmes, assisting with resourcing and 
ensuring alignment to the overall Group strategy. 
Regulatory risk: The operations of the Group 
are subject to various stringent regulatory 
requirements which carry an element of 
compliance risk (e.g. environmental, health and 
safety). 
A strong regulatory compliance regime is in place and 
the Group has invested heavily in ensuring compliance 
with health, safety and regulatory requirements. Regular 
reviews and audits take place, not only by regulatory 
bodies such as the FDA and MHRA but also by customers. 
Bespak is ISO13485 accredited and operates SAP in all 
its main processes. Aesica’s API facilities are inspected 
and approved by the FDA and all manufacturing sites 
are approved by the MHRA and comply with cGMP 
manufacturing standards and requirements. 
IT/Cyber risk: The Group is dependent on 
information technology: its systems and 
infrastructure face certain risks, including service 
disruptions and the loss or theft of sensitive 
or confidential information. Cyber crime is 
increasing in sophistication, consequences and 
incidence, with risks including virus “infection”, 
unauthorised access (hacking), and email-
based phishing frauds. 
The Group adopts a risk based approach in responding to 
cyber risks. The Group has a dedicated IT department who 
monitor and review access security, ensure that there are 
regular back-ups of confidential information and data, 
perform disaster recovery procedures when required 
and manage investment in the Group’s IT infrastructure. 
Continuous vigilance and training are required to mitigate 
cyber security risks, as perpetrators are creative and 
dynamic on a wide spectrum of strategies. 
Human resources: The Group relies heavily on 
recruiting and retaining talented employees 
with a diverse range of skills and capabilities to 
meet its strategic objectives. A lack of training, 
recruitment, securing the long-term loyalty 
of sufficient numbers of qualified personnel, 
demographic change and any resulting skills 
shortages could have a considerable impact 
on our success. 
Remuneration packages are reviewed on an annual 
basis in order to ensure that the Group can continue to 
attract, retain, incentivise and motivate its employees. 
The Group is also committed to working on improving 
drivers of engagement, such as increasing our employees’ 
understanding of our strategy, performance and  
core values.

OUR PERFORMANCE
Strategic Report
Risk Controls and Mitigating Actions Trend
Currency risk: As the Group is headquartered 
in the UK, its functional currency is Pounds 
Sterling. As the Group conducts a large part of 
its business in Europe (Euro) and also contracts 
in other currencies including USD and Japanese 
Yen, exchange rate fluctuations can have an 
impact on earnings. 
Currency exposures are reviewed on a monthly basis. 
The Group has a currency hedging strategy in place 
to cover known transactional currency exposures. The 
Group’s European operations are naturally hedged 
whereas its UK operations hedge contracted non-GBP FX 
flows. The Group hedges its Balance Sheet FX exposure 
by structuring its debt currency composition in line with 
the base currency of its assets. The City and analysts are 
aware of our currency exposures and the Group’s results 
are reported in constant currency. 
Interest rate risk: The Group is subject to  
interest rate risk on its revolving credit facility 
which is currently based on LIBOR/EURIBOR plus 
a margin. 
The terms of the facility are reviewed by the Board on a 
regular basis. In the current low interest rate environment, 
the Group has decided not to hedge its floating rate debt 
into fixed rate for the time being. However, the Group 
actively monitors interest rates and debt markets and 
will manage any floating rate interest rate exposure, as 
appropriate. 
Liquidity and leverage risk: Whilst the Group 
has comfortable borrowing facilities and strong 
cash flows, there is a risk of unforeseen short 
term working capital fluctuations which it may 
not be able to meet, or which may breach 
covenants on its borrowing facilities. 
The Group has strong cash flows, and good earnings 
visibility ensures that its margins are sufficient to exceed 
normal operating costs. The business is cash-generative, 
and there are well-embedded cash and working capital 
management processes. Current borrowing levels and 
financial covenants can be supported comfortably 
by forecast profit and cash flows. Covenant tests 
are performed bi-annually to determine whether the 
covenant tests are being met. Committed facilities are in 
place until September 2019. 
Pension risk: The Group operates a number of 
defined benefit pension schemes which are 
valued based upon a number of actuarial 
assumptions. Fluctuations as well as errors or 
misstatements in these assumptions may result 
in the pension schemes being underfunded or 
valued incorrectly. 
The Group has full open dialogue with the Pension Trustees 
and works closely with them to ensure that the Defined 
Benefit Schemes are adequately funded and that the 
assets are invested appropriately. The Bespak Scheme 
was closed to future accrual in March 2016 and has been 
closed to new members since 2002. The total deficit on 
the Bespak pension scheme was £40.6m at 30 April 2017. 
Aesica has three defined benefit schemes in Germany 
and Italy, two of which are closed to new members. The 
total deficit on the Aesica pension schemes was £4.0m at 
30 April 2017 (see note 21). 
Distributable reserves: Following the Brexit 
vote and subsequent changes in UK monetary 
policy, corporate bond yields have fallen 
sharply, leading to substantial increases in the 
Bespak pension deficit. The Group continues to 
monitor the impact of this on its ability to pay 
dividends in future periods.
The Group monitors distributable reserves prior to key 
reporting periods and in an amplified update provided 
within the Board dividend paper. The Group’s tax advisors, 
Ernst & Young LLP have also completed our strategy for 
repatriation of profits in overseas subsidiaries.
Impact of Brexit: The vote to leave the EU 
has resulted in some uncertainty, including 
currency volatility and a significant weakening 
of Sterling. Whilst the weakening of Sterling 
has had a beneficial translation impact on the 
Group’s Sterling results, it continues to monitor 
the impact of Brexit on its principal risks and any 
direct or indirect resultant complexities this  
may bring.
We will continue to monitor any impact on the Group by 
monitoring any decisions made by the UK Government, 
maintaining regular interaction with tax colleagues  
and providing legal updates to the Board and the 
Executive Committee.
Our internal controls include risk management processes to identify key risks and, where possible, to manage those risks through 
systems and processes and by implementing specific mitigation strategies. The most significant risks identified through our 
progressive review of the risk register that could materially affect the Group’s ability to achieve its financial and operating 
objectives are summarised in this section. Other risks are either unknown or deemed less material. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Consort 
Medical’s Corporate Governance Report for the year ended 
30 April 2017.
MANAGING GOVERNANCE
As a Board, we are committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and believe that such standards are integral 
to the Group’s success and form the basis for the delivery of 
long-term, sustainable shareholder value.
As previously stated, we continue to believe that strong 
governance is founded on the core values and behaviours 
which are expressed throughout the Group. In this regard, 
in March 2017, we held our first Group Senior Leadership 
Conference and employees with leadership roles from 
across the Group were invited to attend. A key focus of the 
Conference was on the Group values and how effectively 
they are embedded in the culture of the business. The 
discussions resulted in a number of recommendations to 
improve such embedding and the Group plans to take 
appropriate actions based on such recommendations 
moving forward.
LEADERSHIP
We have a strong and balanced Board with a range of skills 
and experience. There has been one change to the Board 
composition during the year as Richard Cotton stood down in 
December 2016 after four years’ service as the Chief Financial 
Officer. We are delighted to confirm that, following our 
announcement of 25 November 2016, Paul Hayes has joined 
the Company as his replacement and brings with him the 
relevant financial and business experience to complement 
the existing Board members. Paul’s biographical details can 
be found on page 42. Throughout the intervening period the 
Company has been assisted by David Tilston who has fulfilled 
the position of interim Chief Financial Officer.
BOARD EVALUATION AND EFFECTIVENESS
As Chairman, I am responsible for the leadership of the Board 
and ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role. During 
the current financial year we undertook an internal evaluation 
of the Board, its committees and individual directors. I 
am pleased to report that the overall outcome from the 
evaluation was that the Board and its individual directors 
are performing effectively and demonstrate commitment to 
their roles. The findings from this evaluation can be found on 
page 49.
2017 AGM
Our AGM will be held on 6 September 2017 at our registered 
office, and as always I look forward to meeting you and 
answering any questions that you may have.
DR. PETER FELLNER
CHAIRMAN
THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Group is committed to practising good corporate 
governance of its affairs as part of its management of 
relationships with its shareholders and other stakeholders. 
The Group seeks to uphold and to report on compliance in 
accordance with best practice in corporate governance.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The directors are satisfied that the Group has complied with 
the principles and provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) which was published in April 
2016 (available from www.frc.org.uk) as updated and was 
compliant throughout the financial year under review.
The principles of the Code cover five areas: leadership, 
effectiveness, accountability, remuneration and relations 
with shareholders. With the exception of the directors’ 
remuneration (which is dealt with separately under the 
Remuneration Report), the following sets out how the Board 
has applied the principles.
The Board is committed to establishing and maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance. Its policy is to appoint 
directors with appropriate skills who have sufficient time 
to carry out their duties adequately. The Board provides 
opportunities through site visits and regular access to senior 
management to permit directors to familiarise themselves with 
the Company and the markets in which it operates.
Good governance is essential to the 
way Consort does business and in 
order to ensure effective, sound and 
transparent management we work hard 
to continually strengthen our corporate 
governance structure.

EFFECTIVENESS
The Board’s Composition
As at 30 April 2017, the Board of the Company consisted of 
the non-executive Chairman, one executive director and 
five non-executive directors. From 1 May 2017, following 
the arrival of Paul Hayes, there are two executive directors. 
The profiles of the Board members are set out on pages 42 
and 43. No individual or group of individuals dominates the 
Board’s decision-making process. The non-executive directors 
occupy, or have occupied, senior positions in industry and 
together they constitute a valuable body of relevant industry 
experience and expertise.

Board Diversity
The Board believes in the importance of diversity (including 
but not limited to gender) and the benefits that it can 
bring to the operation of an effective Board. The female 
representation on the Board constitutes 12.5%.
The Board does not have a formal diversity policy and 
believes that appointments should be made on merit, the 
principal consideration being whether or not the appointee 
can add or complement to the existing range of skills and 
experience on the Board.
Appointment of non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed to the Board following 
a formal, rigorous and transparent process, involving external 
recruitment agencies, to select individuals who have a depth 
and breadth of relevant experience, thus ensuring that the 
selected candidates will be capable of making an effective 
and relevant contribution to the Board. The process for the 
appointment of non-executive directors is managed by the 
Nomination Committee, whose responsibilities are outlined  
on page 50. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

INDUCTION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Upon joining the Board, newly appointed directors receive 
a tailored induction comprising site visits, background 
information on the operation and activities of the Group, 
the role of the Board and its committees and those matters 
reserved for the Board’s decision, and the latest financial 
information on the Group. Training and development needs 
of directors are reviewed regularly. The directors are kept 
apprised of developments in legal, regulatory and financial 
matters affecting the Group from the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Company Secretary, and the Group’s external auditors 
and advisers. 
INFORMATION AND SUPPORT
Board members are provided with all relevant documentation 
in advance of each Board and committee meeting. Senior 
executives are invited to attend Board meetings periodically 
for the purpose of making presentations on their areas of 
responsibility. During the year Bespak senior management 
presented a Digital Health market update and an Employee 
Survey results overview was provided by the Bespak and 
Aesica divisional HR directors. In addition to formal Board 
meetings, the Chairman and Chief Executive meet frequently 
and make regular contact with other Board members. The 
Board and the senior executives meet formally once during 
each financial year to discuss corporate strategy.
INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE
The Board has approved a procedure whereby directors 
may consult the Company’s advisers and, if necessary, take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, 
although not in respect of a director’s personal interests. 
Before seeking advice, the director concerned must notify the 
Chairman, or in his absence, the Senior Independent Director. 
No such advice was sought by any director during the year.
COMPANY SECRETARY
Board members have access to the Company Secretary,  
who attends all Board meetings. The appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary is subject to the approval 
of the Board.
BOARD EVALUATION
A Board evaluation was carried out during the year ended 
30 April 2017 and the process allowed the Board to assess 
how effectively it sets the tone from the top. A rigorous and 
formal review required completion of a questionnaire relating 
to the performance of the Board and its committees and 
with regard to compliance with the Code. The evaluation 
was wide ranging and focused on the various aspects of 
the Code. The results of the questionnaire were reported to 
the Board in a manner that did not identify any individual 
responses. The evaluation concluded that there were no 
areas of significant weakness and that overall the Board, 
its committees and individual directors were operating 
effectively. Outcomes from the evaluation process included 
requests that senior managers be invited to present to the 
Board on relevant business topics and arranging Board 
meetings at operational sites.
ELECTION AND RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Company’s Articles of Association require all directors to 
retire and submit themselves for re-election at the first AGM 
after appointment and thereafter at least every three years. 
The Notice of AGM will give details of those directors seeking 
re-election.
MEETINGS OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Led by the Senior Independent Director, the non-executive 
directors meet informally, without the Chairman being 
present, principally to appraise the Chairman’s performance 
and to review his remuneration. The Chairman holds meetings 
at least annually with the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors present.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has the three main committees listed below.

Steve Crummett 
Dr Andrew Hosty 
The Chairman is invited to attend all meetings, but does not 
attend any part of any meeting at which his own terms of 
appointment are discussed. The Chief Executive attends 
by invitation where appropriate except where his own 
remuneration is being considered.
The Remuneration Committee is primarily responsible 
for determining the structure, components (including 
pension rights and compensation payments) and level 
of the remuneration packages of the Chairman, the 
executive directors and designated members of the senior 
management team. Details of the role of the Remuneration

• Jonathan Glenn
• Dr Andrew Hosty
• Dr William Jenkins 
• Ian Nicholson 
The Nomination Committee is primarily responsible for 
reviewing the membership of the Board and identifying 
suitable candidates for appointment and reappointment as 
directors. In addition, the Board has delegated responsibility 
to the Nomination Committee for succession planning both 
at Board and senior management level. The inclusion of 
the Chief Executive in the membership of the Nomination 
Committee ensures that a balanced view is taken regarding 
the needs of the Group as a whole. 
The Committee ensures that the search for Board members 
is undertaken against objective criteria and with due regard 
to the benefits of diversity, including gender. Appointments 
continue to be made on merit, taking into account the 
importance of maintaining a balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge. Two meetings were held 
during the year. At the first meeting the appointment of 
the new Chief Financial Officer was approved, succession 
planning was discussed and the terms of reference of the 
Committee were reviewed and approved; and at the second 
meeting the appointment of the new Managing Director, 
Aesica was approved.
Following the decision of Richard Cotton to leave the 
Company after the announcement of the Company’s  
Interim results, Spencer Stuart, an executive search agency, 
was appointed to identify a replacement with relevant 
financial and business expertise. Following this process, Paul 
Hayes was appointed as Chief Financial Officer with effect 
from 1 May 2017.
Spencer Stuart has no other connection with the Company.

OTHER COMMITTEES
The Executive Committee
This Committee is responsible for the executive management 
of the Group. It comprises the Chief Executive, the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, the Managing Director of Bespak, the Managing 
Director of Aesica and the Director of Human Resources. This 
Committee meets regularly to review and make decisions on 
operational matters not reserved for Board decisions.
The Corporate Responsibility Committee
The Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for 
reviewing and prioritising the Group’s corporate responsibility 
activities, further details of which can be found in the 
Corporate Responsibility review on pages 30 to 38 of this 
report. The Committee is chaired by non-executive director 
Ian Nicholson. Other members include the Chief Executive, 
the Managing Director of Bespak, the Managing Director of 
Aesica, the Director of Human Resources and the Bespak 
Continuous Improvement Director. The Company Secretary 
acts as secretary to the Committee.
Risk Committee
The role and responsibilities of the Risk Committee are outlined 
under the Risk Management section.
ACCOUNTABILITY
Internal Controls Review
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The Board has received regular 
reports on areas of any significant risk and on the related 
internal controls. The Board reviews the framework of internal 
controls annually and has reviewed the effectiveness of its 
internal systems of control as they have been operated within 
the year in accordance with relevant guidance. This system 
has been in place for the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
The review covers all material controls including financial and 
financial reporting processes, operational, compliance and 
risk management systems.
Controls over the financial reporting process and preparation 
of the consolidated accounts consist of extensive reviews 
by qualified and experienced individuals that ensure that 
all elements of the financial statements and appropriate 
disclosure are considered and accurately stated.
Risk Management
The Board accepts responsibility for determining the nature 
and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives.
There is an ongoing internal process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing significant risks faced by the Company that 
is regularly reviewed by the Risk Committee, the Executive 
Committee, the Audit Committee and then by the Board. This 
process has been in place throughout the year and up to the 
date of this report.
The Risk Committee is responsible for advising the Executive 
Committee and the Audit Committee on the co-ordination 
and prioritisation of risk management issues throughout the 
Group and developing a risk management strategy; ensuring 
that the Board’s risk policy is implemented throughout 
the Group through effective development and review of 
risk registers, mitigation plans and insurance policies; and 
promoting risk awareness at all levels.
A risk management strategy encompassing risk assessment 
and risk treatment has been adopted with the key objective 
to ensure that risk management is an integral part of the 
strategic and operational management decision-making, 
planning and implementation process. Risk appetite and 
tolerance has been reviewed and agreed by the Board and 
will be considered annually and monitored as appropriate.
The Company’s strategic plan is reviewed annually at an 
off-site meeting involving the Board and the Executive 
Committee. An annual budget is prepared by each of  
the operating divisions of the Company and this is 
consolidated into a Group Plan, which is reviewed and 
approved by the Board.
Further information on how we manage our business risks is set 
out in the Risk section on pages 39 to 41, which contains a list 
of the principal risks and uncertainties.
Control Procedures
Progress against budget is monitored at operating business 
and Group levels throughout the Company via monthly 
reporting of actual financial performance against budget 
and prior period actual results. The Executive Committee also 
reviews the key measures of operating performance.
The Group has clear authority limits deriving from the list of 
matters reserved for decision by the Board, including capital 
expenditure approval procedures. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the directors have assessed the viability 
of the Company over the three year period to 30 April 2020. 
The directors have determined that a three year period to  
30 April 2020 constitutes an appropriate period over which to 
provide its viability statement as this is the period focused on 
during the strategic planning process (see Risk Management 
section above for further details) and is appropriate for the 
Group’s business cycle. The Group’s strategic plan considers 
the Group’s profit and loss, cash flows, debt and other key 
financial ratios over the period. 
A robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company 
as well as the controls and mitigating actions to address 
these are set out in the Risk section on pages 39 to 41. 
The viability assessment takes into account the potential 
impact of each of these principal risks arising over the 
assessment period. Furthermore, it has considered severe but 
plausible scenarios which illustrate the potential impact of a 
combination of these risks crystallising during the period. A 
number of reasonable assumptions are included within these 
assessments including:
• the assumption that funding facilities will continue to be 
available and that the facility which expires in September 
2019 will be renewed on the same or similar basis; 
• the assumption that in the event of several risks occurring 
simultaneously and having a severe impact on the Group, 
all potential mitigating actions including adjusting capital 
management to preserve cash would be taken on a timely 
basis; and
• the assumption that implausible scenarios where multiple 
risks occur all at the same time, or are unable to be 
appropriately mitigated, do not occur.
The result of this analysis has allowed the directors to 
reasonably conclude that the risk to the Group’s viability  
is low. 
Therefore the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due in the three-year period of 
assessment to 30 April 2020.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The directors’ responsibility for preparing the accounts is set 
out in the Statement of Director’s Responsibilities on page 78.
GOING CONCERN
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
and the Company have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future as the Group 
has net debt of £92.6m at 30 April 2017 (2016: £97.0m) and 
total banking facilities (including available overdrafts and 
using year end exchange rates) of £166.6m, of which £53.6m 
is undrawn as at 30 April 2017 and available up to September 
2019. The Company has therefore adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
REMUNERATION
Our Remuneration Report, which describes the level and 
components of the remuneration of the directors, is set out on 
pages 56 to 63.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board regards relationships with shareholders as very 
important and it aims to encourage open dialogue with 
them through regular meetings with the Group’s institutional 
shareholders, including regular meetings following the 
announcement of the Company’s interim and annual 
results. Meetings are also held at other times with institutional 
investors and other shareholders at their request. Shareholders 
may meet with any new non-executive director if they wish. 
The Chairman ensures that views expressed at these meetings 
are reported to the Board as a whole. The Company’s brokers 
also attend Board meetings at the request of the Chairman to 
provide feedback on shareholder opinion.
Presentations given to analysts are available on the 
Company’s website.
The Senior Independent Director is available to meet with 
shareholders as required.
SHAREHOLDER MEETING – GENERAL MEETING
A General Meeting was held on 27 April 2017 at the 
Company’s Registered Office to approve the following: 
• Ratification of borrowings in excess of borrowing powers 
and directors’ limited release from liability
• Amendments to the borrowing powers article in the Articles

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
As Audit Committee Chair, I am pleased to present the Audit 
Committee’s report for the year ended 30 April 2017. This 
report details the work of the Committee over the past year, 
fulfilling our responsibilities to provide effective governance 
over the Group’s financial activities. Our role is to assist the 
Board in carrying out its oversight responsibilities in relation to 
financial reporting, internal controls and risk management, 
as well as maintaining an appropriate relationship with the 
external auditor.
During the year, the Audit Committee discussed the following 
key items:
• Risk assurance
• Treasury, including foreign currency hedging
• Accounting policies
• Financial results and budgets
• Carrying value of goodwill
• Alternative performance measures and the treatment of 
special items
• Revenue recognition 
• Engagement and review of external auditors
• Review of audit and non-audit services and fees
• Review of reimbursed expenses
• Committee terms of reference
• Cyber risk and disaster recovery procedures
• Taxation
• Going concern review
• Viability review
• Pensions
• Whistleblowing policy
• Non-audit policy
Key Developments in Accounting,  
Corporate Reporting and Taxation
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing, on behalf of 
the Board, the Group’s financial and reporting practices and 
disclosures, reviewing the integrity of the financial statements, 
the Group’s system of internal controls, the work of the 
external auditors and the Group’s compliance with financial 
policies, laws and regulations. The Audit Committee’s terms of 
reference may be obtained from the Company’s website.
The annual and half-yearly financial reports are reviewed by 
the Committee through a process which includes discussion 
with the Chief Financial Officer and the external auditors. 
The external auditors prepare reports to the Committee on 
significant accounting policies and issues and judgements 
applied in the preparation of the financial reports. The 
Audit Committee gives its recommendation to the Board 
concerning the adoption and publication of all financial 
reports to shareholders.
In addition to the Board, the Audit Committee has conducted 
its annual review of the system of internal controls based on a 
review of significant risks identified, internal reviews, external 
audits and reports from management.
Viability Review
We provided support to the Board in responding to the 
amendments to the updated 2014 Corporate Governance 
Code, including assessment of risk appetite and the 
statement on the Group’s viability. We reviewed the longer 
term assessment of the viability of the Group, including its 
financial and operational position and the potential impact of 
the principal risks and uncertainties. The Viability Statement is 
included on page 52 of the Corporate Governance Report. 
Financial Reporting and Significant Financial Matters
In carrying out its duties, the Committee is required to assess 
whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted 
and to challenge the robustness of significant management 
judgements reflected in the financial results. This process 
involves reviewing relevant papers prepared by management 
in support of the policies adopted and judgements made. 
These papers are discussed with management and the 
external auditors. In addition, the Committee reviews the  
year end report to the Audit Committee from the external 
auditors based upon its work performed and findings from the 
annual audit.
During the year, the Committee considered the following 
key financial and internal control matters in relation to the 
Group’s financial statements and disclosures, with input 
from management and the external auditor. The significant 
accounting issues considered by the Committee during the 
year were areas where management was required to use 
significant judgement. These issues are listed below:
Carrying Value of Goodwill
The value of goodwill is supported by a value in use model 
prepared by management. This is based on cash flows 
extracted from the Group’s budget and strategic plan, which 
have both been approved by the Board. The Committee 
debated the performance of the operating segments, 
considered the cash flow models in the Group’s strategic 
plan, and evaluated sensitivities in relation to that plan. The 
Committee concurred with management’s conclusion that 
the carrying value of goodwill was fully supported.  25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED
Alternative performance measures and the treatment 
of Special Items and their Presentation in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Special items have been separately disclosed within the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements. The Committee 
has reviewed papers prepared by management showing 
how these costs have been identified and calculated. It 
has challenged both the quantum of the charge and its 
presentation in the consolidated income statement and is 
satisfied that these costs have been treated appropriately. 
The Committee specifically evaluated the appropriateness of 
the treatment of those items relating to the Aesica acquisition 
and considered the adequacy of the related disclosures.
Revenue Recognition
The Group’s policy for revenue recognition is set out in note 1 
to the financial statements. Management prepares a paper 
for the Committee setting out any key judgements applied 
in respect of revenue recognition and in the accounting for 
major manufacturing contracts or material amendments to 
contracts where significant judgements have been applied. 
The Committee has reviewed the papers presented and 
challenged management on the judgements applied 
ensuring they are in line with the Group’s policy.
Auditor Independence and Effectiveness
The Audit Committee last conducted a tender process in 2015 
and KPMG LLP was subsequently appointed as the Group’s 
auditors in November 2015.
The Committee had discussions with the external auditor 
on audit planning, fees, accounting policies, audit findings 
and internal control. The external auditor attended all of this 
year’s Committee meetings. The Committee assessed the 
effectiveness of the external audit through the review of audit 
plans, reports and conclusions and through discussions with 
management (both with and without the external auditor 
present) and the external auditor (both with and without 
management present). The Committee was satisfied that 
the audit was effective. In addition, the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee meets with the Audit Partner outside formal 
meetings. The Committee is satisfied that KPMG continued 
to possess the skills and experience required to fulfil its duties 
effectively and efficiently during the financial year. 
Non-audit Services
In accordance with its policy on non-audit services provided 
by the Company’s auditors, the Committee reviews and 
approves the award of any such work. The Audit Committee 
refers to the Board for approval of any non-audit services 
where the fees for such work may represent a significant 
proportion of the annual audit fee.
The following non-audit services were provided by KPMG LLP 
during the year: 
• An agreed upon procedures engagement delivering an 
auditor’s certificate as required for an awards submission
• Provision of IFRS 15 workshops as a technical update for the 
Group
• Review of calculations concerning the borrowing powers 
established in the Memorandum & Articles of Association
Details of non-audit services provided to the Company  
by the external auditors are shown in note 3 to the  
financial statements.
Internal Audit
The Audit Committee has from time to time considered the 
requirement for a separate dedicated internal audit activity. 
Having previously determined that this was not required, 
the Group determined in the prior year that the scale and 
nature of the Group’s operations are sufficiently large and 
complex that such a dedicated resource would be required. 
Additional Group resource has been in place in the current 
year and continues to support internal audit activities.  
This is being supplemented as and where appropriate through 
the engagement of internal audit services from suitably 
qualified external providers. The Audit Committee keeps this 
under review.
Whistleblowing
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed and 
approved the internal procedures whereby employees can 
raise concerns about possible financial or other irregularities. 
The Whistleblowing (Public Disclosure) policy gives guidance 
on the type of matters that staff may wish to disclose, and a 
means of doing so via an independent organisation in the 
event that any staff member feels that he or she cannot 
make a disclosure via the usual management channels.
The Group is committed to the highest standards of openness, 
integrity and accountability and the prevention of bribery 
and corruption. As noted above, the Group operates 
a whistleblowing policy so that employees can report 
confidentially any matter giving rise to concerns about the 
operation of the Group’s business.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Consort 
Medical’s FY2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
This report details the remuneration outcomes in respect of 
FY2017 and outlines how we intend to apply the remuneration 
policy in FY2018.
FY2017 incentive outcomes
The business continued to deliver underlying growth during 
FY2017 and made progress towards certain key strategic 
priorities. Further details are set out in the Strategic Report. 
Profit before tax and special items increased by 10.4% to 
£35.6m. Taking into account performance against targets 
at the start of the year, the Committee determined that the 
annual incentive scheme for the CEO would pay-out at 79% 
of maximum. As Paul Hayes was appointed at the start of 
FY2018 he will not receive a bonus for FY2017.
Over the last three years, the Company has delivered 
sizeable returns for shareholders and the Company’s TSR 
has significantly outperformed the FTSE SmallCap over the 
period. This has been delivered alongside strong financial 
performance, with EPS growth of 36% over the last three 
years. Although the performance period for the 2014 share 
awards is not yet complete at the time of writing, the current 
expectation is that this award will vest in full.
Taking into account the sustained strong company and share 
price performance, the Committee is confident that these 
outcomes are fully justified.
Board changes during FY2017
After four years of service, Richard Cotton left Consort 
Medical during the year. 
In line with best practice, all of Richard Cotton’s outstanding 
share awards, including his deferred bonus awards, lapsed on 
his departure from the Company. He also did not receive any 
additional termination payments and he was not eligible for a 
bonus for FY2017.
Paul Hayes joined the Company as CFO on 1 May 2017. His 
salary will be £320,000, which reflects his experience as a CFO, 
and his proven track record of delivering profitable growth 
and leading commercial, well controlled finance functions. 
His incentive opportunities are consistent with his predecessor.
Approach for the coming year
In last year’s remuneration report we set out certain changes 
which were made in response to shareholder feedback. It 
was pleasing to see that this approach subsequently received 
strong support from our shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
The overall remuneration structure continues to provide an 
effective link between pay, performance and the experience 
of shareholders. The Committee has therefore concluded that 
no major changes are proposed for the coming year. 
The key points to note in respect of the pay arrangements for 
the coming year are:
• The CEO’s salary will be increased by 2.5% in line with 
employees in the wider organisation
• Maximum incentive opportunities for the annual and long-
term incentives will remain unchanged
• The 2017 awards under the Performance Share Plan will 
continue to be based on TSR and EPS
The Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy was last 
approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, and is therefore 
next due for renewal in 2018. 
Over the coming year, the Committee will consider  
whether changes are required as part of the new 2018 
policy. The Committee is mindful of evolving market and best 
practice and intends to take these into account as part of 
the review. This review will include consideration of alternative 
incentive structures which have been debated by many 
stakeholders over recent months. Ultimately, the policy will 
need to be aligned with both the needs of the business and 
shareholders’ interests.
The Committee will seek to appropriately consult  
with shareholders regarding any changes which are 
subsequently proposed.
I trust you will find this report informative and I look forward to 
receiving your support.

ANNUAL REMUNERATION REPORT
The following report summarises how the remuneration policy was applied in FY2017 and how the Committee intends to apply 
the policy for FY2018. The report will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM in September 2017.
HOW THE REMUNERATION POLICY WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS IN FY2017
The following information is audited.

financial years:

1 These awards are due to vest in June 2017. The shares estimated to vest have been valued based on the latest vesting forecasts and using the 
average share price during the final quarter of the financial year of £10.21. Richard Cotton’s award lapsed in full following his departure and 
therefore a nil value is shown.
2 Valued using the share price on the date of vesting of £9.95.
3 Richard Cotton left the Company on 13 December 2016 and therefore the amounts for FY2017 have been pro-rated to reflect the period he 
was employed by the Company.
NOTES TO THE TABLE
The following paragraphs set out details of how the numbers included in the single figure table above have been prepared.
Base Salary 
With effect from 1 August 2016, salaries for Mr Glenn (CEO) and Mr Cotton (CFO until December 2016) were £484,260 and 
£314,675 respectively. 
Benefits
Benefits include a car allowance, life assurance, private medical insurance and personal health insurance. The CEO also 
received a fuel card. 
Annual Bonus 
The following section summarises the annual bonuses paid to the CEO based on performance delivered in FY2017. Due to his 
departure from the Company in December 2016, the CFO was not eligible for a bonus in FY2017.
The annual bonus opportunity for the CEO is split between cash and deferred shares, as set out in the table below.
Cash element – 
maximum opportunity (% of salary)
Deferred share element –  
maximum opportunity (% of salary)
CEO 100% 50%
For 80% of the cash element of the annual bonus, the payout is based on the Company’s Profit Before Tax (“PBT”) performance 
during the financial year. The remaining 20% of the cash element and 100% of the deferred share element depend on the 
Committee’s assessment of individual performance against strategically important goals at a corporate and personal level.
In addition, for the deferred share element, the following PBT hurdles must be achieved before shares are awarded.
Profit before tax Below £31.5m £31.5m Below £35m Above £35m
Maximum deferred shares vesting 
(based on achievement of strategic targets)
No deferred
shares may 
be awarded
CEO – 
up to 7% 
of salary
CEO – 
up to 29% 
of salary
CEO –
 up to 50% 
of salary
This combination of financial performance and personal performance ensures that the overall level of bonus paid is 
appropriate and reflective of the Company’s performance during the year. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Level of vesting –

Profit before tax £31.5m £35.0m £36.8m £35.6m 86% of element
As the PBT outcome exceeded £35m, a maximum up to  
50% of salary could be awarded to the CEO for the deferred 
share element.
For FY2017, the factors considered when assessing 
performance against objectives set for the CEO at the start of 
the year included the following:
• EBIT margin improvement – the Group delivered improved 
EBIT margin in Aesica in line with guidance to shareholders 
(to reach at least 10% within two years)
• Launch of generic Advair - good progress has been  
made during the year to facilitate a successful launch 
of generic asthma treatments by Mylan (a global 
pharmaceutical company)
• Nicovations Voke device – despite progress made by the 
Company, British American Tobacco opted to terminate 
the agreement during the year
• People and development – excellent progress has been 
made on implementing succession plans for senior roles 
across the business and a number of key appointments 
have now been made to business critical roles
• Integration – the business continues to make strides towards 
further delivery of joint opportunities for drug device 
combinations between the Bespak and Aesica divisions
• Overall financial performance – despite challenging 
headwinds, the business delivered another strong  
year of financial results with outperformance of  
consensus forecasts
Taking into account the above factors, the Committee 
determined that the personal portion of the cash element 
and the deferred share element should each pay out at 70% 
of maximum.
The total bonuses awarded to the CEO was therefore as 
follows: 
Role
Total 
bonus
£’000
Cash

£’000
Deferred

until June 2020)

LTIP Awards – 2014 Awards vesting based on 
Performance to FY2017 
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) awards granted in 2014 
were subject to Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) performance (50% 
of the award) and Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) compared 
to the FTSE SmallCap excluding investment trusts and finance, 
property and insurance companies (50% of the award) in line 
with the following performance schedule:
TSR
Vesting
(% of element)
Less than the mean annualised comparator TSR 0%
Equal to the mean annualised comparator TSR 25%
TSR greater than the lower of: (i) mean 
annualised comparator TSR +7%; or (ii) upper 
quartile annualised comparator TSR 100%
EPS (aggregate over the three year 
performance period)
1
Vesting
(% of element)
Less than 142.4p 0%
142.4p 25%
164.8p 100%
1 Adjusted to reflect the acquisition of Aesica. For full details see the 
FY2015 Annual Remuneration Report.
Cumulative EPS performance delivered over the period was 
170.5p, which exceeds the stretch hurdle required for full 
vesting and therefore 100% of the EPS element is expected 
to vest. As the performance period for the TSR element runs 
until 19 June 2017, the final level of vesting has not yet been 
determined. However, based on annualised TSR performance 
to date of c.14% p.a., the TSR element is also expected to vest 
in full. 
Although this award is currently expected to vest in full, this 
will be confirmed following the assessment of actual TSR 
performance at the end of the performance period. Given 
the strong performance of the business, as demonstrated by 
both the growth in EPS and share price performance over 
the period, the Committee is comfortable that a vesting level 
towards the upper-end of the scale is fully warranted.
For the purpose of the single figure table, the value of the 
awards have been estimated based on the three month 
average share price during the final quarter of the financial 
year (£10.21). 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

(16 June (£9.41), 17 June (£9.87) and 20 June (£9.95)).
4 PSP awards will vest in June 2019 subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria. Awards are 50% subject to TSR performance compared 
to the FTSE SmallCap, excluding investment trusts, finance, property and insurance companies; and 50% subject to EPS performance. For 
threshold performance, 25% of the award may vest. 
5 Deferred Share awards are not subject to any further performance conditions and vest in June 2019. 
6 Richard Cotton’s awards lapsed following his departure from the Company in December 2016.
HOW THE REMUNERATION POLICY WILL BE APPLIED 
TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS IN FY2018 (UNAUDITED)
Salary and Benefits 
It is expected that with effect from 1 August 2017, the CEO’s 
salary will be increased by 2.5%, which is in line with the 
increases awarded to other employees within the Group. His 
salary will therefore be £496,350. The salary for the new CFO 
will be £320,000.
Benefits for FY2018 will remain unchanged.
Annual Bonus 
The maximum opportunities (as a percentage of base salary) 
for the executive directors are 150% for the CEO (unchanged 
from FY2017) and 110% of salary for the newly appointed CFO 
(in line with the maximum for the previous CFO). These awards 
will be split between the cash element and the deferred 
share element as follows:
• For the cash portion of the bonus, 80% will continue to be 
based on underlying PBT (before special items) and 20% 
will be based on the Committee’s assessment of success 
against personal strategic objectives. Awards under the 
deferred share element will continue to be subject to 
the Committee’s assessment of performance against the 
Group’s strategic goals, but subject to the achievement of 
underlying PBT (before special items) performance hurdles. 
• The strategic measures for the bonus have been selected 
on the basis that they represent areas that are important for 
the long-term success of the Group.
The Committee considers that this combination of measures 
provides an appropriate balance of focus on improving 
financial performance and wider business strategic goals. 
The Committee considers that when taken together, the 
cash and deferred elements strengthen the alignment 
between shareholders’ and executive directors’ interests, 
and encourage a longer-term focus on shareholder value, 
by requiring a three-year deferral of a portion of the annual 
bonus which is payable in shares.
Note: The performance targets for the FY2018 annual bonus 
have not been disclosed on a prospective basis as they are 
considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they 
could reveal details of our budgeting and our strategic goals 
to competitors. The Committee will seek to provide expanded 
retrospective disclosure in due course. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2017

OUR GOVERNANCE
Long-term Incentives – Performance Share Plan
Awards to executive directors will remain unchanged at 
100% of salary. The awards will continue to be subject to TSR 
performance (50%) and EPS performance (50%).
TSR will be measured against the TSR performance compared 
to the FTSE SmallCap, excluding investment trusts, finance, 
property and insurance companies.
Consort’s relative TSR performance – 
over three years following grant date
Vesting 
(% of element)
Less than median TSR of the Comparator 
Group 0%
Equal to median TSR of the Comparator Group 25%
Equal to upper quartile TSR of the Comparator 
Group 100%
EPS will continue to be measured on a cumulative basis. The 
targets for 2017 awards are:
Cumulative EPS between 
1 May 2017 to 30 April 2020
Vesting 
(% of element)
Less than 207p 0%
207p 25%
228p 100%
The Committee believes this combination of measures 
continues to provide an appropriate balance between 
measuring performance against the Company’s peers and 
incentivising management to grow earnings for shareholders 
over the long-term.
Exceptionally, the Committee may make adjustments to 
the calculation of performance measures (e.g. following 
a transaction or for currency movements) to ensure 
performance is measured on a fair and consistent basis.
Clawback
In line with best practice, the Committee has determined that 
from FY2016, variable incentives will be subject to malus and 
clawback provisions, as described in the Policy Report.
Departure of Richard Cotton and Appointment  
of Paul Hayes
Richard Cotton ceased to be a director and employee in 
December 2016. He received salary and benefits up to this 
date. As noted above he did not receive an annual bonus in 
respect of the year ending 30 April 2017, and all outstanding 
share awards (deferred bonus and long-term incentives) 
lapsed in full on his departure from the Company. He did not 
receive any additional termination payments.
Paul Hayes was appointed as CFO with effect from 1 May 
2017. His salary was set on appointment at £320,000 and he 
will not be eligible for a salary increase on 1 August 2017. He 
receives a pension allowance equivalent to 17.5% of salary (in 
line with the previous incumbent).
Paul Hayes will participate in the FY2018 annual bonus plan 
(maximum 110% of salary) and PSP (maximum 100% of salary), 
in line with the potential for the previous CFO. No share 
awards or buyouts were made to him on his appointment to 
the Company.
External Appointments 
With the specific approval of the Board in each case, 
executive directors may accept external appointments as 
non-executive directors of other companies. The directors are 
entitled to keep the fees from external appointments. 
During the year, Jonathan Glenn undertook the role of non-
executive director for Tissue Regenix Group PLC and his fees 
for the year to 30 April 2017 were £25,833.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDING AND 
SHARE INTERESTS (AUDITED SECTION)
Executive directors are expected to accumulate and 
maintain a significant shareholding. The vesting of awards 
from the Company’s various equity related incentive 
arrangements can provide a means to develop this 
shareholding. Only ordinary shares that are beneficially  
held by the executive director (or their spouses, civil partners,

THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Role
The Remuneration Committee’s principal role is to determine 
and make recommendations to the Board regarding the 
policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the CEO, the 
executive directors, the Company Secretary and other 
members of the senior executive management of the Group. 
It also determines the policy for, and scope of, pension 
arrangements and approves the design of performance-
related pay schemes, sets the targets for such schemes, and 
approves payments under such schemes.
The Committee reviews the design of all share incentive 
plans for the approval of the Board and the shareholders. It 
determines each year whether awards will be made and, 
if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual 
awards to be made to executive directors and other senior 
executives, and the performance targets to be used. The 
terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are 
published on the Company’s website.
Activities during the Year
The Remuneration Committee met four times during the year. 
Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table 
on page 50. The key matters discussed at these meetings 
included: 
• Remuneration of executive directors and senior executives
• Determining bonus payouts and setting bonus targets
• Determining LTIP award vesting and consideration of LTIP 
performance criteria
• Granting of share awards and setting performance targets 
for awards
• Corporate Governance updates
• Committee terms of reference and
• Directors’ Remuneration Report
In discussing the above matters, the Remuneration 
Committee considered the remuneration policies of the 
Company as a whole. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Dr William Jenkins Chairman (since 1 March 2013)
Steve Crummett Member (since 6 November 2012)
Dr Andrew Hosty Member (since 14 July 2014)
Advisers
The Chairman, the CEO, the Director of Human Resources, 
and the Company Secretary were invited to attend some 
or all of the meetings to provide advice to the Committee. 
They did not attend when any matter related to their own 
remuneration was discussed.
During the period, the Committee has received advice 
from its independent remuneration advisers, Deloitte LLP 
(“Deloitte”). Deloitte were appointed by the Committee. The 
Remuneration Committee considers that the advice provided 
by Deloitte is objective and independent. Deloitte  
is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and adheres to its Code in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee is 
comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner and team 
that provide remuneration advice to the Committee do not 
have connections with Consort Medical that may impair their 
independence. 
Separate teams within Deloitte also provided the Company 
with advice on the valuation of share awards for IFRS 2 
purposes and in connection with the Company’s risks and 
controls. Total fees for advice provided to the Committee 
during the year under review amounted to £18,500.
The Committee also received advice in relation to its share 
schemes from the Company’s lawyers, Eversheds Sutherlands 
LLP and Ashurst LLP.

SUMMARY OF REMUNERATION POLICY
The following sets out a summary of our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”). The Remuneration Policy 
was last approved by shareholders in 2015. The full policy 
currently applicable is available on the Company’s website 
(www.consortmedical.com). 
CONSORT MEDICAL’S EXECUTIVE  
REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES 
Our key principle remains to provide remuneration packages 
for executive directors which:
• are sufficiently attractive to enable the Company to recruit 
and retain talented individuals with the necessary skills and 
expertise to support the development of Consort Medical 
and grow long-term value for our shareholders
• contain levels of performance-related variable pay such 
that they are aligned with the long-term interests of our 
shareholders and
• provide appropriate motivation for executives to execute 
the strategy agreed by the Board and to develop and 
grow the Company and shareholder value, whilst taking 
account of internal and external risks
The following outlines the Company’s remuneration policy, 
which the Committee believes achieves this objective. 
The key features are:
• providing a remuneration opportunity that is market 
competitive compared to relevant peers reflecting 
individuals’ experience, performance and responsibilities
• operating an annual bonus, with a long-term deferred 
share element to align interests with shareholders over 
the longer term, where annual performance targets are 
aligned with business strategy and financial performance
• offering participation in a long-term incentive plan which 
rewards executives for delivering shareholder value 
creation and achievement of long-term objectives and
• expecting executive directors to build up and maintain a 
holding of Company shares, thus promoting alignment of 
directors’ interests with those of shareholders 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary
The core element 
of a competitive 
remuneration 
package.
The Committee sets base salary taking 
into account:
• the individual’s experience, 
responsibility and performance
• salary levels at relevant comparators 
and at companies of a similar size 
and complexity
• remuneration of different groups of 
employees within the Company
Where appropriate, it is the policy of 
the Committee to pay upper quartile 
base salaries where the incumbent 
is of a proven calibre, along with 
demonstrable and sustained success in 
the role.
Base salary is normally reviewed 
annually with changes effective from 
1 August although salaries may be 
reviewed more frequently or at 
different times of the year if the 
Committee determines this is 
appropriate.
In determining salary 
increases the Committee 
considers the factors outlined 
in the “operation” column. 
While there is no maximum 
salary level, salary increases 
will normally be in line with 
the typical level of increase 
awarded to other employees 
in the Group. 
However, the Committee 
retains the discretion to make 
increases above this level in 
certain circumstances, for 
example, but not limited to: 
an increase in the individual’s 
scope of responsibilities; in 
the case of new executive 
directors who are positioned 
on a lower initial salary whilst 
they gain experience in the 
role; where the Company 
has significantly increased in 
size; or where the Committee 
considers that the current 
salary does not reflect the 
Company’s policy of upper 
quartile salary positioning for 
experienced executives.

SUMMARY OF REMUNERATION POLICY 
CONTINUED
Purpose and  
link to strategy
Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Annual Incentive Scheme
To motivate and 
reward superior 
performance 
measured against 
annual financial, 
strategic and 
operational goals 
of the Company 
which reflect critical 
success factors.
The deferred share 
award element of 
the annual bonus  
ensures that part of 
the value of  
payments earned 
remains tied to the 
Company’s share 
price for a three 
year period, thus 
embedding long-
term alignment with 
the interests of our 
shareholders within 
the annual bonus 
plan.
The Committee 
considers that when 
taken together, the 
cash and deferred 
share elements 
strengthen the 
alignment between 
shareholders’ 
and executive 
directors’ interests 
and encourages a 
longer-term focus on 
shareholder value.
The Committee determines the 
maximum incentive opportunity 
taking into account the responsibilities 
of the role and market practice at 
comparable companies.
Performance is assessed over a 
financial year.
The Committee determines the level 
of bonus paid at its discretion taking 
into account performance against 
targets, the underlying performance of 
the business and executive directors’ 
management of, and performance 
in, all of the business issues that arose 
during the year.
The Annual Incentive Scheme 
incorporates malus and clawback 
provisions. Further details are set out 
below.
Deferred share element:
The deferred share element may be 
structured as a nil-cost option or a 
conditional award of shares. Awards 
structured as nil-cost options may 
normally be exercised within 40 days of 
vesting.
The deferred share awards will normally 
vest three years from award (unless the 
Committee determines an alternative 
vesting period is appropriate).
The vesting of deferred share awards 
will normally be subject to continued 
employment.
Dividend equivalents may be awarded 
during the vesting period. Dividend 
equivalents may be determined by the 
Committee on a cumulative basis and 
may assume reinvestment of dividends 
in the Company’s shares.
CEO – Maximum opportunity 
of up to 150% of base salary 
(100% cash, 50% deferred into 
shares).
CFO – Maximum opportunity 
of up to 110% of base salary 
(75% cash, 35% deferred into 
shares).
For the cash element of  
the bonus, payments start 
being earned for entry 
level performance from 25% 
of maximum if 
targeted levels of 
performance are delivered, 
with the full incentive  
being paid for delivering 
maximum levels of 
performance.
For the deferred share 
element, the Committee 
determines the level of  
pay taking into account 
performance in the round.
Cash element:
The cash element of the bonus is 
determined based on performance 
against financial performance metrics 
and personal objectives.
Currently 80% of the bonus is based 
on financial measures with 20% based 
on individual personal objectives. The 
Committee may adjust this weighting 
in future years to ensure executives are 
appropriately incentivised to deliver key 
strategic goals. In any year financial 
performance metrics will always 
account for at least 70% of the bonus.
The Committee sets targets each year 
to ensure that they are appropriately 
stretching in the context of the business 
plan.
Deferred share element:
The award of the deferred shares is 
subject to the Committee’s assessment 
of performance against the strategic 
goals of the Group. The deferred share 
element will not be awarded unless the 
Committee is satisfied that a minimum 
level of financial performance has been 
achieved. 
The strategic measures for the bonus 
are assessed each year and represent 
areas that are important for the 
long-term success of the Company, 
including but not limited to matters 
such as growth, new value creation, 
broadening the depth and range of 
products portfolios, innovation and 
diversification into adjacent markets 
while keeping a tight control on costs. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
To reinforce the 
alignment of the 
interests of executive 
directors and 
shareholders.
To motivate  
long-term business 
performance and 
shareholder value 
creation. 
To help retain our 
critical executive 
talent.
Award of shares which normally vest 
based on performance over a period of 
three years or such other period as the 
Committee may determine. 
Under the PSP rules awards may be 
granted in the form of a nil-cost option 
(or economic equivalent) subject to 
performance conditions as determined 
by the Committee.
The Committee may grant awards as 
“Approved PSP” awards (granting a 
PSP award in conjunction with a tax 
advantaged Company Share Option 
Plan award) to enable the director and 
the Company to benefit from HMRC-
approved tax treatment on part  
of their award without increasing the 
pre-tax value delivered to participants. 
When a director has been granted 
an option under the Company Share 
Option Plan 2010, a director may  
at the same time receive an  
award of a set value of shares to fund 
the exercise price for that option or the 
value of an award on vesting may be 
reduced if the HMRC tax advantaged 
option is exercised.
The Committee shall determine the 
extent to which the performance 
measures have been met, which may 
include making adjustments to the 
metrics used to assess the performance 
conditions to reflect any relevant 
factors. 
Dividend equivalents may be 
awarded. Dividend equivalents may 
be determined by the Committee on 
a cumulative basis and may assume 
reinvestment of dividends in the 
Company’s shares. 
The Performance Share Plan 
incorporates malus and clawback 
provisions. Further details are set out 
below. 
As set out in the recruitment policy 
below, the 2015 PSP may be used to 
grant buyout awards.
Long-term share awards prior to the 
2015 AGM were granted under the 2005 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Awards 
after the 2015 AGM are made under 
the 2015 Performance Share Plan.
Under the plan rules, awards 
can be made up to 150% of 
salary.
For 2016, awards for the CEO 
and CFO will continue to be 
up to 100% of salary.
In future years, where the 
Committee determines there 
are circumstances which 
merit varying current award 
levels, the Committee would 
appropriately consult with 
shareholders.
Any shares subject to an 
HMRC-approved option do 
not count towards these 
limits.
Awards currently vest based on relative 
total shareholder return and earnings 
performance measures. These measures 
will normally be equally weighted but 
the Committee may determine that an 
alternative weighting is appropriate. It is 
currently envisaged that either measure 
will have no less than a 25% weighting.
For threshold levels of performance up 
to 25% of the award vests, increasing 
to 100% of the award for maximum 
performance. There is straight-line vest 
of awards between these points.
The Committee determines targets 
each year to ensure that targets are 
stretching and represent value creation 
for shareholders while remaining 
motivational for management. Where 
appropriate, alternative metrics may 
be used for future awards to ensure 
they remain aligned with the corporate 
strategy.
If events happen which cause 
the Committee to consider that a 
performance condition has become 
unfair or impractical, it may amend that 
performance condition provided that 
the amended performance condition is 
not materially less difficult to satisfy. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Pension
Part of a competitive 
package by 
providing a 
retirement benefit.
The Company may provide executive 
directors with a pension benefit through 
participation in the Group Personal 
Pension Plan and/or a taxable cash 
payment. 
The Committee may determine that 
alternative pension provisions will 
operate for new appointments to the 
Board. When determining pension 
arrangements for new appointments 
the Board will give regard to the  
cost of the arrangements, market 
practice and the pension arrangements 
received elsewhere in the Group.
The Company’s maximum 
contribution/cash supplement 
for the executive directors is 
as follows:
CEO – 20% of base salary
CFO – 17.5% of base salary
None
Benefits
Part of a competitive 
package.
Benefit policy is to provide an 
appropriate level of benefit taking into 
account market practice at similar sized 
companies and the level of benefits 
provided for other employees in  
the Group.
Core benefits – Benefits currently 
include car allowance, fuel card, life 
assurance, private medical insurance 
(for the executive and his family) and 
personal permanent health insurance.
All-employee share plans – Executives 
are eligible to participate in the 
Company’s all-employee share 
schemes on the same terms as UK 
colleagues up to HMRC-approved 
limits. The Company currently operates 
the Savings Related Share Option Plan 
and Share Incentive Plan.
Relocation policy – In the event 
that an executive were required to 
relocate from their home location to 
undertake their role, the Committee 
may provide an additional reasonable 
level of benefits to reflect the relevant 
circumstances (on a one-off or  
ongoing basis).
Benefits are reviewed by the 
Committee in the context of market 
practice from time to time and the 
Committee may introduce or remove 
particular benefits if it is considered 
appropriate to do so.
The cost of benefit provision 
will depend on the cost to 
the Company of providing 
individual items and the 
individual’s circumstances 
and therefore there is no 
maximum value.

FURTHER DETAIL
The Company also operates a shareholding guideline – 
details of this policy can be found on page 59 of the Annual 
Remuneration Report.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy 
set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or 
administrative purposes or to take account of a change in 
legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for that 
amendment. Awards granted under the Company’s share 
plans will be operated in accordance with the relevant plan 
rules. The Committee may adjust awards only in accordance 
with the provisions of the relevant plan rules. This includes 
making adjustments to awards to reflect one-off corporate 
events, such as a change in the Group’s capital structure. 
Where possible under the plan rules, awards may be settled  
in cash rather than shares, where the Committee considers 
this appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make 
any remuneration payments and payments for loss of 
office (including exercising any discretions available to it in 
connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they 
are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms 
of the payment were agreed: (i) before 4 September 2014 
(the date the Company’s first directors’ remuneration policy 
approved by shareholders came into effect); (ii) before the 
policy set out above came into effect, provided that the 
terms of the payment were consistent with the directors’ 
remuneration policy in force at the time they were agreed; or 
(iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director 
of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the 
individual becoming a director of the Company. For these 
purposes “payments” includes the Remuneration Committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation 
to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are 
“agreed” at the time the award is granted.
MALUS AND CLAWBACK
The Annual Incentive Scheme and Performance Share Plan 
incorporate malus and clawback provisions. 
For Deferred Share awards granted since 1 June 2013, in 
the event of a material misstatement in Consort Medical’s 
financial results the Committee may, at its discretion, apply 
malus to outstanding awards. The Committee may reduce 
the number of outstanding shares to reflect the number of 
shares that would have vested if the misstatement had  
not occurred. 
For Annual Incentive Scheme awards granted in respect 
of FY2016 and subsequent years, in the event of (i) a 
material misstatement in Consort Medical’s financial results; 
or (ii) serious reputational damage to the Company, the 
Committee may:
• apply malus to reduce an award before the award is paid 
to the participant; or
• clawback payments for up to two years following the end 
of the relevant performance period
For LTIP awards granted since 1 June 2013, in the event 
of a material misstatement in Consort Medical’s financial 
results, the Committee may, at its discretion, apply malus to 
outstanding share awards. The Committee may reduce the 
number of outstanding shares to reflect the number of shares 
that would have vested if the misstatement had not occurred. 
For long-term incentive awards granted from FY2016 onwards, 
in the event of (i) a material misstatement in Consort 
Medical’s financial results; or (ii) serious reputational damage 
to the Company, the Committee may:
• apply malus to an unvested award; or
• clawback a vested or exercised award or equivalent value 
at any time prior to the fifth anniversary of grant
SELECTION OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The annual bonus contains two elements – the cash element 
and the deferred share element. The cash portion is based 
on financial performance and personal objectives for the 
individual executive directors. The Committee selected these 
measures to ensure continued focus on delivery of financial 
performance compared to budget and the achievement of 
key personal goals which are considered important to drive 
the performance of the business in the long-term. The level of 
a deferred share award is based on the achievement of key 
strategic milestones. In a business such as ours it is important 
that there is a constant focus on innovation, development 
and meeting strategic objectives today which will deliver 
value for shareholders in the future. 
The Committee considers that the combination of measures 
used for the cash and deferred share element provides an 
appropriate balance of focus on financial and wider business 
and strategic goals.
Since 2013, the long-term share awards have been based 
on total shareholder return and earnings performance. 
Total shareholder return measures share price improvement 
and dividend returns and therefore is a direct measure of 
the value we have returned to shareholders compared 
to the wider market. The earnings measures incentivise 
management to grow earnings for shareholders over the 
long-term. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

SUMMARY OF REMUNERATION POLICY 
CONTINUED
REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS THROUGHOUT 
THE GROUP
The Committee generally considers pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group when considering pay 
for executive directors and senior management. When 
considering base salary increases, the Committee reviews 
overall levels of base pay increases offered to other 
employees in the Group.
When assessing remuneration, the Committee takes care 
to ensure that individuals are not overpaid in relation to 
their roles and responsibilities, and that packages for senior 
individuals are appropriate in comparison to the remuneration 
of other employees within the Company. Remuneration policy 
throughout the organisation is based on the same principles 
— that reward should be sufficient to retain and motivate 
individuals of a sufficient calibre without paying more than is 
necessary and should encourage individuals to deliver their 
own objectives and ultimately create value for shareholders. 
At Consort Medical our employees have a variety of different 
roles and responsibilities and therefore the reward opportunity 
and structure of reward necessarily is different to reflect this.
Senior executives who are members of the Group Executive 
Committee participate in the same reward structure as the 
executive directors. 
Managers across the Group participate in the bonus plan with 
the most senior and key employees participating in the same 
PSP as the executive directors. The majority of employees are 
eligible to earn a bonus each year based on their site specific 
performance. We also offer employees the opportunity to 
save and buy shares through the Sharesave Plan, thus giving 
them the opportunity to be shareholders. 
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS
The Board is responsible for determining the policy on 
remuneration of non-executive directors. The Company 
aims to attract non-executive directors who, through their 
experience, can further the interests of the Company and 
make an effective contribution to its strategic development.
Approach to setting fees Basis of fees Other items
The fees of the non-executive directors 
are agreed by the Board.
The fee for the Chairman is agreed by 
the Committee.
Fees are normally reviewed every two  
years but may be reviewed more 
or less frequently if it is considered 
appropriate.
Fees are set taking into account the  
level of responsibility, relevant 
experience and specialist knowledge 
of each non-executive director and 
fees at other companies of a similar 
size and complexity. 
Non-executive directors are paid a 
basic fee for membership of the Board 
with additional fees being paid for 
being the Senior Independent Director 
or Chairman of a Board committee 
to take into account the additional 
responsibilities and workload. 
Additional fees may also be paid for 
other Board responsibilities or roles if this 
is considered appropriate.
The non-executive Chairman receives 
an all-inclusive fee for the role.
Fees are paid in cash.
Annual bonuses or share-based 
incentives are not awarded to non-
executive directors, but they are 
encouraged to hold shares in the 
Company.
Non-executive directors do not 
currently receive any benefits. 
However, benefits may be provided in 
the future if, in the view of the Board 
(for non-executive directors, or the 
Committee for the Chairman), this is 
considered appropriate.
Travel and other reasonable expenses 
(including fees incurred in obtaining 
professional advice in the furtherance 
of their duties and any associated 
taxes) incurred in the course of 
performing their duties are reimbursed 
to non-executive directors.
Non-executive directors are included 
on the directors’ and officers’ 
indemnity insurance.  25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR GOVERNANCE
The non-executive directors have appointment letters, the 
terms of which recognise that their appointments are subject 
to the Company’s Articles of Association and their services 
are at the direction of the shareholders.
All non-executive directors submit themselves for election 
at the AGM following their appointment and at subsequent 
intervals of no more than three years.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to any payment  
in lieu of notice. The letters of appointment are available  
for shareholders to view from the Company Secretary  
upon request. 
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NEW HIRES
When determining the remuneration package for a newly 
appointed executive director, the Committee would seek to 
apply the following principles: 
• The package should be market competitive to facilitate the 
recruitment of individuals of sufficient calibre to lead the 
business. At the same time, the Committee would intend 
to pay no more than it believes is necessary to secure the 
required talent
• The structure of the ongoing remuneration package would 
normally include the components set out in the policy table 
for executive directors
• In addition, the Committee has discretion to include any 
other remuneration component or award which it feels is 
appropriate taking into account the specific commercial 
circumstances, and subject to the limit on variable 
remuneration set out below. The key terms and rationale for 
any such component would be appropriately disclosed
• Where an individual forfeits outstanding variable pay 
opportunities or contractual rights at a previous employer 
as a result of appointment, the Committee may offer 
compensatory payments or awards, in such form as the 
Committee considers appropriate taking into account all 
relevant factors including the form of awards, expected 
value and vesting timeframe of forfeited opportunities. 
When determining such “buy-out” the guiding principle 
would be that awards would generally be on a “like-for-
like” basis unless not appropriate
• Consistent with the policy table, the maximum level of 
variable remuneration which may be awarded (excluding 
any compensatory payments or awards referred to 
above) is 300% of salary (this reflects the current maximum 
opportunity for the CEO i.e. a bonus of 150% of base salary 
and a PSP award of 150% of base salary). This maximum 
level of variable remuneration includes awards made as 
part of the ongoing package. As noted in the policy table, 
the current intention is to grant PSP awards of 100% of salary
• Where an executive director is required to relocate from 
their home location to take up their role the Committee 
may provide reasonable assistance with relocation (either 
via one-off or ongoing payments or benefits)
• In the event that an internal candidate was promoted to 
the Board, legacy terms and conditions would normally 
be honoured, including pension entitlements and any 
outstanding incentive awards
To facilitate buy-out awards outlined above, in the event 
of recruitment, the Committee may grant awards to a new 
executive director under Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for the 
granting of awards, to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, 
the recruitment of an executive director, without seeking 
prior shareholder approval or under any other appropriate 
Company incentive plan (including the 2015 Performance 
Share Plan).
The remuneration package for a newly appointed non-
executive director would normally be in line with the structure 
set out in the policy table for non-executive directors. 
Remuneration for newly appointed non-executive directors 
may be paid in the form of cash or shares. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE CONTRACTS AND POLICY ON PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
When determining leaving arrangements for an executive director, the Committee takes into account any contractual 
agreements including the provisions of any incentive arrangements, typical market practice and the performance and 
conduct of the individual.
The service agreements are available to shareholders to view on request from the Company Secretary. 
Notice period
Executive directors have service contracts with the Company which can be terminated on 12 months’ 
notice by the Company and six months’ notice by the executive directors. 
Jonathan Glenn was appointed on 26 July 2006 and Paul Hayes was appointed on 1 May 2017.
Payment in 
lieu of notice
The Company may at its discretion terminate any executive director’s contract by making a payment in 
lieu of notice equal to the base salary, and benefits which would have been received during the notice 
period. The current executive directors are also entitled to an amount in respect of bonus for their notice 
period (or remainder of the notice period). The Committee has the discretion to determine the level of 
such bonus. Previously, when directors have left the business the Committee determined that no bonus 
should be due for the notice period. The Committee’s policy going forward is that when new contracts 
are agreed with new executive directors that any entitlement to bonus as part of any payment in lieu of 
notice will be removed. Executive directors are also entitled to a payment in respect of any accrued but 
untaken holiday at the time of termination of employment.  25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

to be an effective member of the Board who demonstrates 
the requisite level of commitment and acts in the long term 
interests of the Company while having regard to other 
stakeholders. Accordingly, the Board recommends their 
reappointment to shareholders.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
CONTINUED
The Group is committed to achieving the highest levels 
of quality. Bespak is certified to ISO13485, which is the

in Bespak operate within this system and are also trained 
in the regulatory requirements of pharmaceutical “Good 
Manufacturing Practice”. Bespak holds the appropriate 
licences from the MHRA to assemble, pack and release 
commercial pharmaceutical products. Aesica manufacturing 
sites are licensed to manufacture medicinal products by the 
appropriate Competent Authority of the country in which

export products to the United States they are appropriately 
approved by the US FDA. 
The Group takes a proactive approach to consultation with 
employees on a variety of work-related issues through the use 
of consultative forums whose members are elected by staff. 
Regular briefings are given to staff to keep them informed 
of matters concerning the business, including financial and 
economic factors affecting the Group.

exist for employees of the Group who become disabled to 
continue in their employment or to be considered for other 
open positions in the Group and generally their training, 
career development and promotion.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS –  
CHANGE OF CONTROL
There are a number of significant agreements containing 
provisions that take effect (including provisions permitting 
counterparties to terminate agreements) upon a change 
of control of the Company. These include both commercial 
and bank loan facilities agreements. Maintaining strong 
relationships with all counterparties is an important element in 
the risk management of the business and to help safeguard 
the Company’s interests to help mitigate against any impact 
resulting from any change of control of the Company should 
it occur.
SHARE CAPITAL AND CONTROL
Details of the Company’s issued share capital are set out 
on page 120. All of the Company’s issued share capital 
comprises ordinary 10p shares which are fully paid up and 
rank equally in all respects.
The ordinary shares are listed on the Official List of the London 
Stock Exchange and are included in the techMARK index. In 
addition, the Company has entered into a Level 1 American 
Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme with the Bank of New 
York Mellon, under which the Company’s shares are traded 
on the over-the-counter market in the form of American 
Depositary Shares (ADS).
81,037 (FY2016: 56,018) new shares were issued during the 
year under the Company’s SAYE Scheme. No new ordinary 
shares have been allotted under the Company’s share  
option schemes since the end of the year and up to the date 
of this report.
RIGHTS ATTACHING TO SHARES
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, 
in addition to those conferred by law, are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which can be 
obtained from Companies House in England and Wales or 
from the Company Secretary. The holders of ordinary shares 
are entitled to receive the Company’s reports and accounts, 
to attend and speak at general meetings of the Company, 
to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights, and to 
participation in any distribution of income or capital.
TRANSFERS OF SHARES
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or 
on the exercise of voting rights attached to them save where 
the Company has exercised its rights to suspend their voting 
rights or to prohibit their transfer following the omission of 
their holder or any person interested in them to provide the 
Company with information requested by it in accordance 
with Part 22 of the Companies Act 2006 or where their holder 
is precluded from exercising voting rights by the Financial 
Services Authority Listing Rules or the City Code on Takeovers 
and Mergers. None of the shares carry any special rights with 
regard to the control of the Company.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of ordinary 
shares where such transfer documents are not lodged by 
acceptable means or proof of title is required. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

OUR GOVERNANCE
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’
RESPONSIBILITIES
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; 
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the parent company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN 
RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
GENERAL INFORMATION
Consort Medical plc is a public limited company listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled 
under the laws of England and Wales, registered number 
406711. The address of the registered office is given on  
page 139. The nature of the Group’s operations and its 
principal activities are set out in the operating review on 
pages 16 to 21.
1. PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to those companies 
reporting under IFRS, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and 
International Accounting Standards and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (collectively referred to as 
“IFRS”) and related interpretations, as adopted for use in the 
European Union in all cases.
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared using the 
historical cost convention, as modified by certain financial 
assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) 
at fair value. The specific accounting policies adopted, which 
have been approved by the Board and which have been 
applied consistently in all years presented, are described 
within this note.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
and the Company have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future as the Group 
has net debt of £92.6m at 30 April 2017 (2016: £97.0m) and 
total banking facilities (including available overdrafts and 
using year end exchange rates) of £166.6m, of which £53.6m 
is undrawn as at 30 April 2017 and available up to September 
2019. The Company has therefore adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Consolidation
The financial statements include the financial statements 
of the Company and all the subsidiaries during the years 
reported for the periods during which they were members of 
the Consort Medical plc group (“the Group”).
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s 
business that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations that has been disposed of 
or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with 
a view to resale. Classification of a discontinued operation 
occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria 
to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation 
is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative 
income statement is presented as if the operation had 
discontinued from the start of the prior year. 
Segmental reporting
The Group’s chief operating decision maker is considered to 
be the Executive Committee. This committee is responsible 
for the executive management of the Group and comprises 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Company Secretary/Group General Counsel, the General 
Managers of the Group’s Bespak and Aesica businesses 
and the Director of Group Human Resources. The Executive 
Committee meets regularly to make decisions on operational 
and strategic matters, other than those reserved for the 
Board, including allocation of resources and assessment 
of the performance of the Group. The Group’s operating 
segments are determined with reference to the information 
that is supplied to the Executive Committee in order for 
it to allocate the Group’s resources and to monitor the 
performance of the Group. Following the acquisition of 
Aesica Holdco Limited (“Aesica”) on 12 November 2014, the 
Executive Committee focuses on the operations of the Group 
by the Bespak and Aesica divisions as individual operating 
segments and, as a result, the Group has two reportable 
segments at the end of the current financial year.
Subsidiaries 
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial 
statements of the parent company and all its subsidiaries 
made up to 30 April 2017. Subsidiaries are entities which are 
directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. The Group 
controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that 
control ceases. The acquisition method of accounting is used 
to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the 
assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred 
or assumed at the date of completion. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of 
acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the 
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly 
in the income statement. Costs of acquisition are charged 
to the income statement in the period in which they are 
incurred. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group 
is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration 
that is deemed to be an asset or liability are recognised in 
accordance with IAS 39, either in profit or loss or as a change 
in other comprehensive income. Inter-company transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions 
between Group undertakings are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment 
indicator of the asset transferred. Uniform accounting policies 
have been adopted across the Group. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

1. PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
In the parent company financial statements, investments 
in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less any provision  
for impairment.
Investments
Equity investments in entities that are neither associates nor 
subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment. 
As there is no quoted price in an active market, fair value 
cannot be reliably measured.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of  
Consort Medical plc’s entities are measured using that  
entity’s functional currency, which is the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
Sterling, which is the parent Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions 
and from the translation at period-end exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash 
flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
The results and financial position of all Group undertakings 
that have a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated into the presentation 
currency with: (i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet 
translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance 
sheet; (ii) income and expenses for each income statement 
translated at average exchange rates for the period;  
and (iii) all resulting exchange differences recognised as  
a component of other comprehensive income. In the  
case of subsidiaries acquired during the prior year, the 
average exchange rate takes into account the period of 
ownership only.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the 
net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and 
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such 
investments, are recognised in the translation reserve within 
other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The principal exchange rates applied in the preparation of 
the financial statements were as follows: 
2017 2016
GBP : EUR at the end of year 1.19 1.28
GBP : USD at the end of year 1.29 1.46
GBP : EUR average for the year 1.18 1.36
GBP : USD average for the year 1.29 1.50
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for the sale of goods and services. 
Revenue from sales of products is recognised when the 
risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, and 
is stated net of value added tax and other sales taxes. 
The point at which risk and reward is transferred is usually 
determined from shipping terms, which vary from customer 
to customer. Revenue from sales of services is recognised in 
the period in which the related chargeable costs are incurred 
or when revenue is earned under contractual obligations. 
Revenue from sales of tooling is recognised on a net basis, 
having regard to the transfer of risks and rewards. Revenue 
is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Advance payments received from customers are credited to 
deferred income and the related revenue is released to the 
income statement in accordance with the recognition criteria 
described above.
Where a manufacturing contract includes variable 
consideration (such as a minimum order guarantee),  
the transaction price includes management’s best estimate 
of the variable consideration receivable at the balance  
sheet date.
On occasions, the Group receives cash in advance of 
delivering goods and services to customers to compensate 
for costs incurred in design and development activities 
including the acquisition of development assets. Where such 
amounts are received and the risk and rewards of ownership 
over the development assets remain with the customer, the 
amounts received are deferred on the balance sheet and 
taken to revenue as the Group delivers products or services to 
the customer in accordance with its contractual obligations.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received and all attached 
conditions will be complied with. Grants received are revenue 
related and are credited to the income statement, within 
operating profit, so as to match them with the expenditure 
to which they relate to the extent that it is probable that all 
conditions have been complied with.  25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Post-employment benefits
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, 
including both defined benefit and defined contribution 
pension plans.
(a) Pension obligations
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which 
the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. 
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay 
further contributions once the contributions have been 
paid. The Group pays contributions to publicly and privately 
administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The contributions are 
recognised as an employee benefit expense when they 
are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset 
to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future 
payments is available.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined 
contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an 
amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive 
on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors 
such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability 
recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit 
pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value 
of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be 
paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the 
terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where 
there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates 
on government bonds are used. Actuarial gains and losses 
arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial 
assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-
service costs are recognised immediately in income.
(b) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is 
terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, 
or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy 
in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises 
termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) 
when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those 
benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a 
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves  
the payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer 
made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination 
benefits are measured based on the number of employees 
expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more 
than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are 
discounted to their present value.
(c) Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses 
and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into 
consideration the profit attributable to the Company’s 
shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises 
a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a 
past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives services 
from employees as consideration for equity instruments 
(options) of the Group. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the options is 
recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed 
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted:
• including any market performance conditions (for example, 
an entity’s share price);
• excluding the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, 
sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the 
entity over a specified time period); and
• including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for 
example, the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to vest. 
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, 
which is the period over which all of the specified vesting 
conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting 
period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to vest based on the non-market 
vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision 
to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity 
instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the 
Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of 
employee services received, measured by reference to the 
grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as 
an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a 
corresponding credit to equity. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

1. PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost including any 
incidental costs of acquisition less accumulated depreciation. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and 
the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use. Assets acquired through 
business combinations are initially recognised at their fair 
value. Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost 
of property, plant and equipment (less the current expected 
residual value) on a straight-line basis over their expected 
useful lives as follows:
• Freehold buildings and leasehold buildings with original 
lease terms over 50 years – 50 years
• Leasehold buildings with original lease terms less than 
50 years – Remaining period of lease
• Cleanrooms – 20 years
• Building services – 10 to 20 years
• Mould and assembly machines – Utilisation basis
• Plant, equipment and vehicles – 3 to 10 years
Cleanrooms and building services are categorised within 
plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing 
the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised 
in the income statement. The method of depreciation for 
mould and assembly machines is a utilisation basis reflecting 
the amount a machine is used during an accounting period. 
This method is considered to better reflect the economic 
consumption of the value attributable to these machines.
Assets which have been transferred from or funded by a 
customer are not capitalised if the Group does not obtain 
control of these assets. If the Group has obtained control of 
an asset that has been contributed or funded by a customer, 
then the asset is recognised and the contribution released 
to income over an appropriate term in accordance with the 
Group’s policy on revenue recognition.
Assets under construction
The costs of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as 
incurred and are not depreciated until such time as the assets 
are commissioned, when the total costs are transferred to the 
appropriate asset category.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as 
an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition 
date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of:
• the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of 
the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the 
entity; over 
• the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at 
least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances 
give indicators of an impairment. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to 
which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication 
that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then 
to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent 
period.
Internally generated intangible assets – research and 
development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an 
expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the 
Group’s product development is recognised only if all of the 
following conditions are met:
• An asset is created that can be identified;
• It is probable that the asset created will generate future 
economic benefits; 
• It is technically feasible that the intangible asset can be 
completed so that it will be available for use or sale and 
there are sufficient available resources to complete it; and
• The development cost of the asset can be measured 
reliably. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

1. PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Where a product requires regulatory approval prior to launch, 
it is presumed that there is insufficient certainty over the 
product’s technical feasibility to recognise an intangible asset 
prior to that approval being obtained.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful 
economic life of capitalised development costs is five to ten 
years. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be 
recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an 
expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets, including purchased patents, know-
how, trademarks, software licences, customer contracts and 
relationships and distribution rights are capitalised at cost 
and amortised on a straight-line basis or sum of digits basis 
over their estimated useful economic lives through operating 
expenses. The estimated useful lives of other intangible assets 
are as follows:
• Computer software: 4 to 5 years
• Patented and unpatented technology and know-how: 10 
years
• Trademarks and trade names: 10 years
• Customer contracts and relationships: 
 – 11 to 13 years on a sum of digits method (Aesica related) 
 – 5 to 10 years on a straight line basis (other) 
• Licences and distribution agreements: 2 to 11 years
The amortisation method applied to the Aesica intangible 
assets on acquisition is deemed to better reflect the pattern in 
which the future economic benefits are expected to  
be consumed.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets excluding goodwill
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss. 
Where it is not possible to identify separate cash flows relating 
to individual assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. 
Where tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
have suffered an impairment, they are reviewed for possible 
reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Leasing commitments
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are 
charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the relevant lease.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially 
all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated 
as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are 
recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if 
lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
each determined at the inception of the lease. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance 
sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are 
apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the 
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability.
When acting as lessor, under a finance leasing arrangement, 
the Company recognises assets held under a finance lease 
in the balance sheet as a receivable equal to the net 
investment in the lease. The recognition of finance income 
is based on a constant periodic rate of return on the net 
investment in the finance lease.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are stated at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises the direct cost 
of production and the attributable portion of overheads 
based on normal operating capacity appropriate to location 
and condition. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out 
basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling 
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is 
made if necessary for any slow-moving, obsolete or defective 
inventory. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
In the consolidated and Company statements of cash 
flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, 
deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less, 
and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated and Company 
balance sheets, bank overdrafts are shown within trade and 
other payables in current liabilities.
Finance income and costs
Interest receivable and payable on bank deposits and 
borrowings is credited or charged to finance income and 
expenses as it falls due.  25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. The expense 
relating to any provision is presented in the income statement 
net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where 
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as other finance expenses.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of an 
obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where 
the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with 
reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised, 
but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is 
probable.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value 
and subsequently held at amortised cost. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at 
fair value, net of direct issue costs and subsequently stated 
at amortised cost. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income 
statement and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period 
in which they arise. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are 
recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent 
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be 
drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until drawdown 
occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee 
is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and 
amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Dividends
Dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the 
period in which they are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the period in 
which they are approved and paid.
Taxation
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for 
the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or 
disallowed. It is calculated using rates that have been 
enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet 
date. Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
relevant taxation authorities.
Tax that relates to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income or in equity is recognised in other comprehensive 
income or equity respectively.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in full using the balance 
sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences 
arising from differences between the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of  
taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences except in respect of investments in 
subsidiaries where the Company is able to control the reversal 
of the temporary difference and it is probable  
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary difference can be utilised. Their carrying 
amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the 
same basis.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. 
It is recognised in the consolidated income statement except 
when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income 
taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or 
different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle 
the balances on a net basis.
Research and Development Expenditure Credit (“RDEC”) 
has been available to UK companies on qualifying 
expenditure incurred since 1 April 2013 and is of the 
nature of a government grant. Where UK companies 
expect to elect for RDEC the amount receivable is 
recorded as income and is included in profit before tax, 
netted against research and development expenses. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Share capital, share premium and share issue costs
Share issue costs are incremental costs directly attributable 
to the issue of new shares or options and are shown as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Any excess of the 
net proceeds over the nominal value of any shares issued is 
credited to the share premium account.

equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, 
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of 
income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled 
or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently 
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
Derivative financial instruments and  
hedging activities
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at 
fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at 
each reporting date. Any gain or loss on re-measurement is 
recognised in the income statement.
Net investment hedges
Where the Group has entered into borrowings which form 
part of a net investment in a foreign operation, including a 
hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the 
net investment, these are accounted for in a way similar to 
cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the hedging instrument 
relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised 
in OCI while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective 
portion are recognised in the income statement through profit 
or loss. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative 
value of any such gains or losses recorded in equity is 
transferred to profit or loss.
The Group uses a loan as a hedge of its exposure to foreign 
exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries. Refer to 
note 26 for more details.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which 
are described in this note, the directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and other factors that  
are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the 
revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
Judgements
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those 
involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), 
that the directors have made in the process of applying 
the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the  
financial statements.
A Carrying value of goodwill 
The Group tests, at least annually, whether goodwill has 
suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting 
policy above. Goodwill recognised as part of the Aesica and 
The Medical House acquisitions have been subject to an 
impairment test in the current year. The recoverable amounts 
are determined based on value in use calculations. The use of 
this method requires the estimation of future cash flows  
and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the present value of these cash flows. Actual 
outcomes could vary.
B Equity investments
The Group makes investments in certain early stage, start up 
entities and has taken an equity stake in those entities (see 
note 16). In assessing these investments, the directors are 
required to assess whether they are able to exert significant 
influence as well as the carrying value of these investments 
with reference to their stage of development and progress 
against key milestones.
C Revenue recognition
The Group’s revenue recognition policies require 
management to make key judgements in respect of revenue 
recognition and in the accounting for major manufacturing 
contracts or material amendments to contracts.  25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

1. PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below.
A Post-employment benefits 
The determination of the pension cost and defined benefit 
obligation of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes 
depends on the selection of certain assumptions which 
include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, 
mortality and expected return on scheme assets. Differences 
arising from actual experiences or future changes in 
assumptions will be reflected in subsequent periods (see 
note 21).
B Carrying value of property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not 
be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, 
the recoverable amount is determined based on value in 
use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s 
assumptions and estimates.
C Provisions and related assets
In determining the amount to recognise for any provision or 
related asset, management consults with suitably qualified 
and experienced Group personnel, considers the Group’s 
experience of similar matters and communications with 
potential counterparties and the Group’s legal advisers. 
Alternative Performance Measures and the treatment 
of special items
In addition to statutory measures, a number of alternative 
performance measures are included in this Annual Report 
and Accounts to provide a clear understanding of the 
Group’s performance. These measures assist investors in 
gaining a balanced view of the Company’s performance 
and in the comparison of performance across the industry. 
The alternative performance measures used include the 
statutory EBIT, EBT and EPS performance adjusted to eliminate 
special items that are costs relating to acquisitions or 
significant one-off items. Constant exchange rate measures 
eliminate the impact of currency movements by comparing 
the current measure against the comparative restated at this 
year’s average exchange rate. Where we provide adjusted 
performance measures, they are compared to the equivalent 
measures in the prior year. 
The directors believe that the “adjusted” profit and earnings 
per share measures provide additional useful information for 
shareholders on the underlying performance of the business. 
These measures are consistent with how business performance 
is measured internally.
Further detail on the special items in the year can be 
found in note 6. The directors also refer to EBITDA (earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) as a 
performance indicator. EBITDA also adds back any profit or 
loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment.

Special tax item  –  deferred tax credit as a result of the UK corporate rate change 0.5  1.1 
Special items after taxation from continuing operations (9.2) (12.1)
• Reorganisation costs are in relation to employee and property or move-related activities. In the prior year these costs were in 
relation to the restructuring activities following the completion of the integration programme at Aesica.
• Advisory and acquisition costs include advisory costs in relation to the evaluation of potential transactions and in the prior 
year also included costs in respect of the closure of the Bespak pension scheme.
• Amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets represents the charge for other intangible assets within Aesica (acquired 
in 2014) of £12.2m (2016: £12.3m) and £0.8m (2016: £0.8m) in relation to The Medical House acquired in 2009.
• A special tax item of £1.1m was recognised in the prior year as a result of the recognition of deferred tax on capital losses 
which are available for offset against deferred tax liabilities arising from the upward revaluation of land.
• A special tax item of £1.0m was recognised in the prior year as a capital allowance review was carried out in that year which 
resulted in assets being reclassified from non-qualifying to qualifying.
• A special tax item of £0.4m (2016: £0.5m) was recognised as the impact of a number of prior year adjustments made.
• A special tax item of £0.5m (2016: £1.1m) arises in respect of a significant tax credit as the Group’s deferred tax assets and 
liabilities were recalculated using the lower rate of UK Corporation Tax of 17% from 1 April 2020 (reduced from 18%). In the 
prior year, the calculation was based on the lower rate of UK Corporation Tax of 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 
2020 (reduced from 20%).

The adjustments in respect of prior periods above are mainly as a result of a review of the utilisation of Group losses, particularly 
those arising in FY2015 following the acquisition of Aesica.
Factors affecting future tax charge
The standard rate of Corporation Tax in the UK reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017. Accordingly, the UK 
profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 19.92%. Further reductions in the standard rate to 17% with 
effect from 1 April 2020 were enacted during the year and any deferred tax balances have been stated at the rate at which 
they are expected to reverse. 
Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of £22.8m (2016: £21.9m) that are available for offset against future 
chargeable gains in the UK group. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is not 
reasonably foreseeable that these will be utilised.
Deferred tax assets of £2.0m (2016: £3.4m) in respect of tax losses carried forward have not been recognised due to insufficient 
certainty over their recoverability. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

11. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share ownership trust, which are 
treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share 
options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares 
during the year and contingently issuable shares under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

The carrying value of goodwill is made up of balances arising on acquisition of The Medical House and Aesica.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to Bespak and Aesica CGUs (cash-generating units) for 
impairment testing. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. Value in use calculations are utilised to 
calculate the recoverable amounts. Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected, risk-adjusted, pre-tax 
cash flows of the cash-generating unit in which the goodwill is contained.
The discount rate applied comprises the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital which is adjusted to reflect the 
impact of the time value of money, tax effects and risks associated with the CGUs. This was calculated at 8.0% (2016: 7.5%) 
in respect of The Medical House and Aesica. This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount to pre-tax cash flows. The 
movement in the discount rate in comparison to the prior year is due to macroeconomic factors. The value in use calculations 
for each CGU are based on the Group’s strategic plan incorporating three years from FY2018 to FY2020 which was approved 
by the Board and takes into account both past performance and expectations for future market development. Cash flows 
beyond this period were extrapolated using an annual growth rate of approximately 2% (2016: 2%), which was selected as 
prudently below the Group’s estimate of the long-term average growth rate in the UK and does not exceed the long-term 
average growth rate for the sectors in which the CGUs operate. 
In respect of The Medical House goodwill, the injectables business is now a key part of the Bespak division. The goodwill 
contributes to the cash flows of the Bespak operating segment as a whole. As a result, the key assumptions include product 
sales from existing customers in FY2018, product launches and revenues from as yet unidentified customers from 2019 for the 
Bespak division as a whole. In respect of the Aesica goodwill review, the key assumptions include product sales from existing 
customers and contingencies to reflect risks in the cash flows. 
The directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill 
and are confident that the amount of goodwill carried for The Medical House and Aesica as well as the assumptions used in 
estimating their fair values are appropriate. 
Critical judgements around goodwill impairment are disclosed in note 1. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

During the year, the Group operated four pension schemes: one in the UK, one in Italy and two in Germany. Pension benefits 
are provided by defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remuneration 
and length of service, and by defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds 
arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
The Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme, the Bespak plc Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme (“Bespak”) was closed to 
new entrants with effect from 30 June 2002. As at 30 April 2017, the IAS 19 “Employee benefits” deficit was £40.6m compared 
with £23.4m as at 30 April 2016. The movement was primarily due to the reduction in the yields on 25 year UK government 
bonds when compared with April 2016, primarily as a result of the EU referendum result in June 2016. The scheme was closed 
with effect from 31 March 2016 via a deed of amendment between the Group and the Trust. Following the scheme closure, 
all former active members became deferred members, and the provision of pension benefits was migrated to a defined 
contribution pension scheme which is also available to new employees. The accrued pension for active members will remain 
linked to their future salary, and so the closure did not have any impact on the accrued benefit obligation.
The Group also operated three additional defined benefit pension schemes during the year, two of which were operated by 
Aesica Pharmaceuticals GmbH in Germany and one which was operated by Aesica Pharmaceuticals Srl in Italy. The three 
schemes are the Retirement Benefit Obligations Scheme (the “RBO”), the Long Term Service Scheme (the “Jubilee”) and 
the Aesica Italy Scheme. The ATZ Scheme is now closed as there are no further liabilities. The RBO Scheme is closed to new 
members whereas the Jubilee Scheme continues to be open to all employees of Aesica Pharmaceuticals GmbH. The Aesica 
Italy Scheme is open to all employees of Aesica Pharmaceuticals Srl and Consort Medical Srl. These overseas schemes had a 
total net IAS 19 deficit of £4.0m at 30 April 2017.
In relation to Bespak, increases to pensions in payment and in deferment in respect of future service are capped at 2.5% p.a. 
The members’ share of the cost of the scheme is 8% of pensionable salaries which is generally paid via a “salary sacrifice” 
arrangement. The Group meets the full cost of accrual, but members receive a reduction in their salary equal to their share of 
the cost of the scheme. Members have the right to opt out of this arrangement if they wish to receive their full salary and not 
contribute to the scheme, in which case the Group’s contributions to the scheme are reduced.
Contributions to each of the Group’s defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of an 
independent, professionally qualified actuary. Pension costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been 
assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, using the projected unit method. Liabilities are assessed annually 
in accordance with the advice of an independent actuary. Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Group’s defined 
benefit scheme are undertaken, normally every three years. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Explanation of the relationship between Consort Medical plc and the trustees of the schemes
The assets of each scheme are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and 
present employees. The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interests of the schemes’ beneficiaries. The 
Bespak scheme has a policy that one-third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the scheme whilst there is no 
such provision for the Aesica GmbH or Italy schemes. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

* Applies to the RBO scheme only.
The IAS 19 accounting standard “Employee benefits” requires that the discount rate used be determined by reference to 
market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality fixed income investments. The currency and term of these should be 
consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment obligations.
Bespak
The discount rate has been developed from a spot yield curve based on UK Government bonds, adjusted to reflect the credit 
spread between AA-rated corporate bonds and Government bonds.
The expected rate of inflation is an important building block for the salary growth and pension increase assumption. A rate of 
inflation is “implied” by the difference between the yields on fixed-interest and index-linked Government bonds.
For the majority of members, pension accrued before 6 April 1997 does not receive any guaranteed increases and it is assumed 
that no discretionary increases will be awarded. Pension accrued between 6 April 1997 and 30 April 2009 receives increases in 
line with inflation subject to a maximum of 5% per annum (for which the Company has assumed future increases will be 3.0% 
per annum). Some members receive fixed increases of 3% per annum on pension accrued before 6 April 1997 and increases in 
line with inflation subject to a minimum of 3% per annum and a maximum of 5% per annum on pension accrued between  
6 April 1997 and 30 April 2009 (for which the Company has assumed future increases will be 3.4% per annum). For all members, 
pension accrued after 1 May 2009 receives increases in line with inflation subject to a maximum of 2.5% per annum (for which 
the Company has assumed future increases will be 2.2% per annum).
One of the key assumptions made in valuing the pension scheme’s liabilities are the mortality rates used to assess how long 
pensions will be paid for. The mortality rates used to calculate the scheme’s liabilities were updated as part of the scheme’s 
actuarial valuation in 2014 to reflect the results of surveys. These mortality tables are referred to as 95% (males)/85% (females) 
of the S2PA tables with improvements assumed to be in line with the CMI_2013 model with a 1.25% p.a. long-term rate of 
improvement.

Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the Bespak and Aesica scheme liabilities
The sensitivity of each scheme’s liabilities to changes in the principal assumptions used to measure these liabilities is illustrated 
below. The illustrations consider the single change shown with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged. In practice, 
changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption (this is not always the case).
The Group liability is the difference between the schemes’ liabilities and the schemes’ assets. Certain changes in the 
assumptions will be as a result of changes in market yields. Where this is the case, the market value of schemes’ assets may 
change simultaneously, which may or may not offset the change in assumptions. For example, a fall in interest rates will 
increase each scheme’s liability, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value of assets so that the net effect 
on the Group liability is reduced.

How the liabilities arising from the Bespak scheme are measured
The Group provides retirement benefits via the Bespak scheme to some of its former employees and approximately 30% 
of current UK employees. The level of retirement benefit is principally based on salary earned in the final three years of 
employment and period of service as a scheme member.
The projected liabilities of the scheme are apportioned between members’ past and future service using the projected unit 
actuarial cost method. The deficit in the consolidated balance sheet is the difference between the projected liability allocated 
to past service (the defined benefit obligation) and the market value of the assets of the scheme. The defined benefit 
obligation makes allowance for future earnings growth. 
An alternative measure of liability is the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer. This 
amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than 
the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the scheme. The latest estimate of the amount required to settle the 
scheme’s liabilities was calculated as part of the triennial valuation at 30 April 2014. This indicated that the amount required 
was £66.3m in excess of the assets held by the scheme. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

21. PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
Future funding obligations in relation to the Bespak scheme
The trustees have selected a funding target based on the scheme being closed to new members, with the link to final salaries 
being maintained. The agreed funding objective is to reach, and then maintain, assets equal to 100% of the value of the 
projected past service liabilities, assessed on an ongoing basis, allowing for future salary increases for active members.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was performed by an independent actuary for the 
trustees of the scheme and was carried out as at 30 April 2014. In September 2015, the Company and the Trustees agreed the 
actuarial valuation deficit of £13.8m. As part of that agreement, the Company agreed to make deficit recovery contributions 
at the rate of £1.5m per annum until 2028.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 25 years (2016: 24 years). The next triennial valuation is 
expected to take place with an effective date no later than 30 April 2017.
Nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments held by the Bespak scheme
The expected return on the scheme’s assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the financial year for returns 
over the life of the related obligation. The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly 
from their market value. Some of these bond investments are issued by the UK Government and the risk of default on these 
is very small. The trustees also hold bond investments issued by public companies. There is a more significant risk of default 
on these which is assessed by various rating agencies. The trustees also have a substantial holding of equity and hedge fund 
investments, with a target of 60% of the scheme’s assets being invested in these funds. The investment return related to these 
is variable, and they are generally considered much “riskier” investments. It is generally accepted that the yield on these 
investments will contain a premium (“the equity risk premium”) to compensate investors for the additional risk of holding this 
type of investment. There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of this risk premium.
The majority of the equities held by the scheme are in international blue chip entities. The aim is to hold a globally diversified 
portfolio of equities, with a target of 22% of equities being held in the UK, 27% in the rest of Europe, 20% in North American 
equities, 10% in each of Japanese and Pacific Basin equities and 11% in emerging markets.
As part of the investment strategy review, the trustees, in conjunction with the Group, have carried out an asset-liability 
review for the scheme. These studies are used to assist the trustees and the Group in determining the optimal long-term asset 
allocation with regard to the structure of liabilities within the scheme. The results of the study are used to assist the trustees in 
managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and the risk of a significant increase in the scheme’s deficit 
by providing information used to determine the pension scheme’s investment strategy. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

price when manufacturing commences or when the products are delivered to the customers. During the year, manufacturing 
commenced for all related advance payments and therefore amounts were reclassified to deferred income in trade and  
other payables.
The restructuring and other provisions balance at 30 April 2017 comprises mainly environmental provisions acquired from 
Aesica, employee severance associated with the restructuring and integration of Aesica and other provisions.
Employee benefits represents a provision for national insurance contributions on share options and other share-based 
payments.
For all provisions, the amounts provided represent management’s best estimate of the most likely outcome. The split of

The Group has a £160m multicurrency revolving facility and a £65m “accordion” facility by which further facilities may be 
made available by Barclays, Lloyds, RBS and Santander under the current terms to support significant investment or acquisition 
opportunities which may arise. The existing revolving credit facilities expire in September 2019. Whilst the multi-year revolving 
committed credit facility does not expire for more than two years, the debt within this is disclosed as less than one year on 
the balance sheet, as it is drawn for one-month periods, and then redrawn as appropriate to minimise the amount of debt 
drawn relative to the Group’s needs to minimise the interest payable, as assumed in its Viability Statement considerations. The 
undrawn facilities are unsecured. The bank loans and overdrafts are subject to cross-guarantees between Group undertakings. 
Interest on the multicurrency revolving credit facility is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.20% and 2.15%, depending 
upon the ratio of net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and on UK overdrafts at

26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES
Financial risk management
Consort Medical plc reports in Sterling and pays dividends out of Sterling profits. The Group manages and monitors the Group’s 
external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of Group corporate objectives. Treasury activities are 
governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board and monitored by the Group.
The Group maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor interest rate, foreign exchange, credit and  
liquidity risks.
Consort Medical plc uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, to finance and to manage market risks of its 
operations. Financial instruments include cash and liquid resources, borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Liquid assets surplus to the immediate operating requirements of Group undertakings are invested and managed centrally by 
the Group. 
External borrowings are managed centrally by the Group and comprise a combination of long and short-term finance.
Consort Medical plc does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and the Group’s 
Treasury policies specifically prohibit such activity. All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks 
arising from underlying business activities. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Selling margins are sufficient to cover normal operating costs and the Group’s operating subsidiaries are cash-generative. 
None of the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Operating cash flow is used to fund 
investment in new product development as well as to make the routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and 
repayment of maturing debt.
The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net 
debt is calculated as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and prepaid facility fees. Total capital is calculated as total 
equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
As at 30 April 2017, the Group is in a net debt position of £92.6m (30 April 2016: £97.0m), see note 23.
The Group has historically monitored two widely used ratios to measure the ability to service debt, being net debt/EBITDA and 
EBITDA interest cover. These measures were ahead of target throughout FY2017 and FY2016.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The table entitled “Fair value of financial assets and liabilities” presents the carrying amount and the fair values of the Group’s 
financial assets and liabilities under IFRS. Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. Where 
market values are not available, fair values are determined using the prevailing interest and exchange rates. 
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
• Currency exchange contracts – based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date;
• Contingent consideration – the discounted value of anticipated future receipts. 
The fair value of other assets and liabilities approximates to the carrying amount reported in the balance sheet.
Fair value and cash flow hedging activities
All derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. Gains and losses are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement unless they are designated as fair value hedging instruments and tested to 
be effective under IAS 39 “Financial instruments – Recognition and measurement”, in which case the element of gains and 
losses that fulfil the hedge effectiveness criteria are taken directly to equity.
Consort Medical plc’s hedging strategy is unchanged in respect of covering the transactional risk of foreign currency sales and 
purchases. In respect of the translational risk on the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, the Group has utilised a hedge of net 
investments in foreign operations. The Group uses a Euro loan, which had a carrying value of £29.6m at the year end (2016: 
£32.1m), as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus potentially exposing the Group to interest rate risk, against which, in 
the past, the Group has sought to protect itself through interest rate swaps. Although the Group/Company is currently in a net 
debt position, no interest rate swaps are held as the Group was not subject to any significant movements in these rates during 
the period and current expectations do not indicate significant changes in this in the near future. This will continue to be kept 
under review over time. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

The Group uses forward contracts to hedge a proportion of forecast foreign currency transactional exposure generally 
extending up to 12 months. At 30 April 2017, the Group held forward contracts to hedge the equivalent of £23.1m of forecast 
foreign currency transaction exposures (2016: £12.5m). The fair value of the forward exchange contracts was a liability of £0.2m 
at 30 April 2017 (2016: liability of £0.3m). The Group currently does not designate these forward contracts as cash flow hedges 
and so gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
The primary transactional exposures in the UK and European business are transactions denominated in the USD and the Euro. 
A 10% decline in Sterling against the USD and the Euro (which is considered reasonably possible) would increase operating 
profit and equity by £1.9m (2016: £0.5m) on an unhedged basis. A 10% increase in the value of Sterling (which is considered 
reasonably possible) would have a similar but opposite effect.
Translational exposure
The Group also has exposure in the retranslation of the German and Italian operations in Aesica into GBP. The foreign currency 
translation sensitivity for the Euro for the full year FY2017 was such that a change in the rate of €0.01: £1 would have impacted 
revenue by £0.8m (2016: £0.6m) and EBIT by £0.1m (2016: £0.1m).
Committed facilities
As explained in note 23, the Group has committed facilities available at floating rates which expire in September 2019 and 
overdraft facilities that expire within one year.
Market risk of financial assets
The Group invests centrally managed liquid assets in short-term investments with banks at floating interest rates. These 
investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk in respect of its major customers such that, if one or more of them is 
affected by financial difficulty, it could materially and adversely affect the Group’s financial results. However, the Group 
generally does not expect its customers to fail to meet their obligations.
The Group does not believe that it is exposed to major concentrations of credit risk on other classes of financial instruments. The 
Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does 
not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
The Group applies Board-approved limits to the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and employs strict 
minimum creditworthiness criteria as to the choice of counterparty. 
Liquidity risk
The Group operates internationally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group 
trades. Selling margins are sufficient to exceed normal operating costs and the Group’s main operating subsidiaries are  
cash-generative.
Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the research and development of new products as well as routine outflows 
of capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt. The Group may, from time to time, have additional 
demands for finance, such as acquisitions.  25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

All financial liabilities have a contractual maturity date that is less than 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Hedge of net investments in foreign operations
Included in loans at 30 April 2017 was a borrowing of £29.6m (2016: £32.1m) which has been designated as a hedge of the net 
investments in the two subsidiaries in Italy and Germany, Aesica Pharmaceuticals GmbH and Aesica Pharmaceuticals Srl. This 
borrowing is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to the Euro foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains or losses 
on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to OCI to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in 
the subsidiaries. There is no ineffectiveness in the year ended 30 April 2017.
The equity investments in Atlas Genetics Limited and Oxular Limited are unquoted investments and therefore held at cost, less 
any provision for impairment as its fair value cannot be measured reliably in the absence of an active market.
The following tables categorise the Group’s and Company’s financial assets and liabilities held at fair value by the valuation 
methodology applied in determining fair value. Where possible, quoted prices in active markets are used (Level 1). Where such 
prices are not available, the asset or liability is classified as Level 2, provided all significant inputs to the valuation model are 
based on observable market data. In other cases the instrument is classified as Level 3. The Company has no financial assets 
held at fair value through profit or loss. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

27. EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME
Share options
The Group operates share award schemes whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares in Consort Medical 
plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of certain specified performance targets. It also offers savings-related 
share option schemes. Following the formal approval of the Performance Share Plan 2015 (“PSP”) at the Annual General 
Meeting in September 2015, no further awards have been made under the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). In June 2016 
and April 2017 awards were made under the PSP. In June 2016 awards were made under the DBP.
Grants of share options are normally exercisable at the end of the three-year vesting/performance period. Grants under 
savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years’ saving. Grants under share option schemes 
are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. Options under the share option schemes are 
normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant. The majority of options under the savings-related share option 
schemes are now granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Share options awarded to the directors are subject to performance criteria as detailed in the Remuneration Report.

Risk-free interest rate 0.9%
Dividend yield 1.9%
Volatility 26.0%
Expected lives of options granted under:
Savings-related share option schemes 3 years
Weighted average share price for grants in the year:
Savings-related share option schemes – market and option price 1,047p 
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected 
period to exercise. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the 
assumed option life. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

27. EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME (CONTINUED)
During the year awards under the LTIP and DBP were granted to a number of employees. The fair value per share under award 
at grant has been calculated using a Monte Carlo share pricing model. The assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
FY2017
Share price at grant date 992.0p

Vesting period 3 years
Volatility 26.4%
Risk-free rate 0.54%

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF CONSORT MEDICAL PLC ONLY 
OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Consort Medical plc for the year ended 30 April 2017 set out on pages 79 to 133. 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
30 April 2017 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement, in decreasing order of audit 
significance, that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows (unchanged from 2016):
Risks of material misstatement vs 2016
Recurring risks Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Revenue Recognition
< >
< >
The risk Our response 
Valuation of Goodwill 
and Intangibles 
Assets 
(Goodwill: £126m 
(2016: £122.6m))
(Intangible Assets: 
£56.2m (2016: 
£67.3m))
Refer to page 53 
(Audit Committee 
Report), page 90 
(accounting policy) 
and pages 108 
to 109 (financial 
disclosure).
Valuation of Goodwill and 
Intangible Assets
Goodwill and customer 
relationship intangible 
assets are directly linked 
as they arise from past 
acquisitions. These are 
assessed for indicators of 
impairment and tested 
for impairment if such 
indicators are identified. 
The cash generating 
units to which goodwill is 
allocated are assessed 
for impairment using a 
discounted cash flow 
model to calculate 
a value in use, on an 
annual basis. Due to 
the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting 
and discounting future 
cash flows, the valuation 
of goodwill and customer 
relationships is one of the 
key judgmental areas on 
which our audit focused.
Our procedures included:
Our sector experience
We assessed and challenged whether there were any internal or 
external indicators of impairment that should have been considered 
by the directors, associated with the goodwill and finite life intangible 
assets, based on our knowledge of the Group and the market; 
Benchmarking assumptions 
We used our own valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the 
discount rate and we considered the reasonableness of other key 
assumptions including, growth rate, foreign exchange rates, and 
cash flow forecasts; 
Sensitivity analysis
We performed breakeven analysis on the assumptions noted above;
Historical comparisons
We challenged the forecast used in the discounted cash flow model 
by evaluating the Group’s budgeting procedures upon which the 
forecasts are based. We assessed the accuracy of the current year 
forecasts by considering the accuracy of prior period forecasts; and 
Assessing transparency
We assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures (see notes 14 
and 15) in respect of impairment testing and considered whether the 
disclosures reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill and 
intangible assets. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

The risk Our response 
Revenue recognition 
(£294.0m; (2016: 
£276.9m))
Refer to page 53 
(Audit Committee 
Report), page 88 
(accounting policy) 
and pages 96 to 97 
(financial disclosure).
Completeness, existence 
and accuracy of revenue 
recognition
The Group’s revenue is mainly 
derived from long-term 
manufacturing agreements. 
The agreements vary from 
customer to customer in terms 
of minimum order quantities, 
performance obligations 
or milestone deliverables 
and payment mechanisms. 
Given the variety of individual 
contract terms, and that 
revenue is a material figure 
in the financial statements, 
we consider a significant risk 
exists in relation to the timing 
and value of revenue to be 
recognised.
Our procedures included:
Control design, observation and performance:
Testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of the controls over the revenue process 
Expectation vs outcome:
For a sample of significant contracts in Bespak, we developed 
an expectation of the revenue to be recognised based on the 
contractual terms with regards to price and volumes delivered in 
the year and compared to actual revenue; and
Test of details:
We read a sample of revenue contracts for Bespak and Aesica 
to determine whether the amounts recognized in revenue were 
in line with the contractual terms with regards timing and value 
taking into consideration delivery quantities, milestones and other 
performance obligations. 
We obtained a sample of invoices raised and related delivery 
documentation around the year end to assess whether revenue 
had been recorded in the appropriate period with respect to 
those invoices. We examined a sample of credit notes raised 
after the period end to determine whether revenue had been 
recorded in the appropriate accounting period.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Overview 
Materiality: Group financial statements as a whole £1m (2016: £1m)
5% (2016: 5%) of normalised Group profit before tax
Coverage
90% (2016: 99%) of Group profit before tax
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £1m (2016: £1m) and determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before tax as disclosed on the face of the Income Statement, of which it represents 5% (2016: 5%). 
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £50k (2016: £50k), in 
addition to other identified misstatements that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 27 components (2016: 27 components), we subjected 15 (2016: 15) to audits for Group reporting purposes. 
These accounted for over 93% (2016: 94%) of the Group’s revenues, 90% (2016: 99%) profit before taxation, and 96% (2016: 96%) 
of the Group’s total assets. For the remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine 
our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement with these.
The Group audit team instructed the component auditor as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks 
detailed above and the information to be reported back. 
The component materialities ranged from £281k to £700k (2016: £2k to £730k), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile  
of the Group across the components. The work on 1 (2016: 1) of the 15 components was performed by component auditors 
and the rest by the Group team. 
The Group team held telephone conference meetings with the overseas Group reporting component auditor, and also 
attended the audit clearance meeting. At these meetings, the audit approach, findings and observations reported to the 
Group audit team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed 
by the component auditor. The Group team also reviewed the audit work papers for significant areas prepared by the 
component auditor. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5

4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with the financial 
statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and from reading the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
• we have not identified material misstatements in those reports; and 
• in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the directors’ statement on Viability on page 52, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the 
directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation over the three years to 2020; or 
• the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting. 
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the 
financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report on page 53 does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit 
committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 25378.04    19 July 2017 4:02 PM     Proof 5
