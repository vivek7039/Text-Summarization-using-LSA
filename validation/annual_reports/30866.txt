All brokers in the Network are carefully selected for their 
specialist knowledge, local market reputation and quality of 
service. We expect them to have the capability not only to 
service JLT’s multinational clients to the highest standards, 
but to compete for and win the largest accounts in their own 
territories in collaboration with JLT’s Reinsurance, Specialty and 
Employee Benefits teams.
Service standards are codified through our Global Service 
Standards Guide, a set of clear operating procedures designed 
to ensure that each client, regardless of their size, consistently 
receives the highest level of care and attention. Each member  
of our Network is also required to adhere to JLT's Code of 
Ethical Conduct. 
A further area of differentiation is JLT’s Global Service Team 
hubs, multi-lingual groups that provide clients with a single  
point of contact, managing their global programmes via the  
JLT International Network. These specialty teams are used as a 
centre of excellence, delivering advice to clients and colleagues 
globally on insurance market practices, regulation and the 
compliance of global insurance programmes in a fast-changing 
and challenging environment.
Overall responsibility for the Network sits with the  
JLT International Network Management Team, whose role  
is to ensure common service standards through the sharing of 
expertise and best practices across the Network, whilst offering 
a clear channel through which to escalate and resolve issues 
with speed and efficiency.
The JLT International Network offers our multinational clients risk management and employee benefit 
solutions in over 135 countries, providing a global reach.
Our Network is comprised of majority-owned and associate operations in all of the world's key 
economies, supplemented by non-owned partner operations. The Network also offers a global 
distribution channel for JLT's Reinsurance, Specialty and Employee Benefits activities.
JLT INTERNATIONAL NETWORK    Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 11
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
I am pleased to present the Group’s 
Annual Report for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017.
JLT has delivered a strong set of 
financial results in 2017. The Group 
made substantial financial progress, 
returning to strong overall organic 
revenue growth of 5%.
During the year we carried out a 
re-examination of the Group’s strategy, 
and we have made some important 
decisions which we believe will position 
the Group for continued success.
PERFORMANCE
Total revenues increased by 10%, 
or 6% at constant rates of exchange 
(CRE), to £1.39 billion.
The Group’s underlying trading profit 
increased by 10% to £213.7 million 
and by 7% at CRE. Underlying profit 
before tax increased by 11% to 
£191.5 million. The Group's trading 
margin was maintained at 15.4%.
Our reported profit before tax  
increased by 35% to £181.6 million, 
which includes the impact of net 
exceptional items of £9.9 million.
Reported diluted EPS increased to 
54.7p and underlying diluted EPS 
increased to 58.5p.
INCREASED DIVIDEND
The Directors have recommended 
a final dividend of 21.8 pence per share 
(2016: 20.6 pence) for the year to  
31 December 2017. The dividend will be 
paid on 8 May 2018 to shareholders who 
are on the register as at 3 April 2018.
This will bring the total dividend for  
the year to 34.0 pence per share,  
an overall increase of 5.6% and the  
ninth consecutive year that JLT has  
paid an increased dividend.
The business has delivered a Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) of 328% 
over the past nine years, as illustrated 
in the chart on page 87.
CORPORATE ACTIVITY 
HIGHLIGHTS
Our Risk & Insurance businesses 
delivered organic revenue growth of 
5% in the year, with strong client retention 
and new business in JLT Europe delivering 
good performances from most divisions in 
challenging market conditions. 
The build-out of our US Specialty 
platform continues, with revenues 
approaching USD 100 million in 2017.  
The net investment losses peaked in 
2016 and reduced in 2017 and we 
remain fully focused on achieving 
profits as planned in 2019. 
JLT Re achieved organic revenue growth 
of 4%, with a trading margin of 20% 
which reflected its continued investment 
in the business. 
The UK and Ireland Employment Benefits 
businesses saw a return to growth in 
2017. Trading profits increased by 40% 
from 2016 with organic revenue growth 
of 8%. 
In the year, the Group completed three 
acquisitions, for a total consideration of 
£61.2 million, as it continued to build 
further scale in its existing businesses 
and geographies.
The Group is making investments to 
strengthen its representation in continental 
Europe. These investments support  
the Group's preparations for different 
Brexit scenarios. 
In light of the investments being made 
and the preparatory work that has been 
undertaken, we do not anticipate that 
Brexit will materially impact our ability to 
serve clients and access markets in the 
European Union.

Geoffrey Howe 12 STRATEGIC REPORT
RE-EXAMINATION OF GROUP STRATEGY
During 2017 we carried out a re-examination of the Group’s 
strategy, in order to ensure that it remains appropriate to 
support and enable our future growth plans so we can continue 
to create long-term value for our stakeholders. The review 
resulted in a number of key conclusions in respect of the future 
shape of the Group’s strategy, recognising the importance of 
JLT’s distinctive identity and culture and deep specialist strength 
as key differentiators between JLT and its larger competitors; 
and the importance of consistent and coordinated collaboration 
across divisions, regions and industry practices.
The review also recognised JLT’s international development 
needs and opportunities, including in the US, where our 
representation now creates the opportunity for us to move from 
an international to a global business. As a result of the review, 
the Group reformulated its mission during the year: ‘To become 
the leading global specialist risk adviser and broker’.
To progress towards our mission, the Group is undertaking a 
number of strategic initiatives, including: 
• the simplification of our business and management 
structure. As we announced in January, from 1 April 2018, 
our regional insurance broking operations will be brought 
together into an integrated Specialty division. The Group’s 
businesses will then be structured into three divisions, 
Reinsurance, Specialty and Employee Benefits; 
• the implementation of a Global Transformation Programme 
to streamline the operational processes we use to serve 
clients in each of our divisions, to deliver global consistency 
and eliminate duplicated costs;
• building on the firm foundation we have already established 
in the US through continuing organic revenue growth, 
complemented by targeted acquisitions; and
• coordinating the marketing and operation of our Employee 
Benefits activities worldwide.  
Further details regarding the strategy review and these key 
initiatives can be found in the Chief Executive’s Review on 
pages 14 to 17 and in the Reviewing & Delivering Our Strategy 
section on pages 22 to 24.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board continues to recognise the need for a strong 
corporate governance framework and supporting processes 
across the Group and believes that good governance, with 
tone set from the top, is a key factor in delivering sustainable 
business performance and creating value for the Group's 
stakeholders. The Board feels that it has a good balance of 
experience, skills and knowledge to support and challenge 
the management team, and that it is supported by effective 
governance and control systems. More information on these 
systems can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 57 to 66. In addition, the Directors’ Report on pages 91 
to 98 reports on JLT’s compliance with the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) during 2017.
During the year, the Board and its Committees undertook 
reviews of their effectiveness. The conclusions from these 
reviews provided useful feedback to each body on its 
performance. Further details are provided in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 57 to 66. 
JLT’s share incentive schemes are designed to ensure that 
decisions are made by management to support long-term 
growth, that the right behaviours are rewarded and that 
management’s interests are aligned with those of shareholders. 
Further details of the operation of these schemes can be found 
in the Directors' Remuneration Report set out on pages 78 to 90.
The strength and support of Jardine Matheson has been, and 
will continue to be, an important factor in the success of JLT. 
Since 2014 a Relationship Agreement has been in place with 
Jardine Matheson, in accordance with the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which require shareholders 
with a 30% or more shareholding to comply with certain 
independence provisions set out in a written and legally 
binding agreement. More detail on the relationship with 
Jardine Matheson is set out on page 66.
BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT

and Jonathan Dawson retired on 3 October 2017. I should like 
to record the Board’s thanks to Bruce and Jonathan for their

We were pleased to welcome Andrew Didham and

2017. Richard has become Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee and Andrew has become Chair of the Audit & Risk

as the Company’s Senior Independent Director. 
As we announced on 28 February 2018, Lynne Peacock will

industry over many years.  Lynne, along with our existing 
Directors, will be proposed for election at this year's Annual 
General Meeting and Lynne's biographical details will be set out

on M&A and to continue to play a leading role in driving new 
business development. Pat Donnelly, formerly President and 
Deputy CEO, assumed the role of CEO of that business. 
In view of the changes to the Group business and management 
structure, the Group Executive Committee will be reconstituted 
from 1 April 2018. The members of the Committee will 
comprise: Dominic Burke, Mark Drummond Brady, Charles 
Rozes, Lucy Clarke, Ross Howard, Mike Methley, William 
Nabarro, Jim Pierce, Mike Reynolds and Bala Viswanathan.
OUR PEOPLE
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank everyone in JLT for 
their continued hard work and contribution to the Group’ s results 
in 2017. I would also like to welcome all our new colleagues who 
have joined JLT during the year. Whatever part of the Group I visit 
I always see evidence of the distinctive culture at JLT that values 
agility and entrepreneurial drive, rigour and depth of thought and 
a collaborative approach that puts customers first. There is further 
information about our colleagues and culture on page 7.
OUR ROLE IN SOCIETY
JLT takes its role in society seriously and has an active 
Corporate Responsibility programme. JLT’s approach is 
coordinated by a Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee, 
which has Board, Group Executive Committee and senior 
management membership.
JLT supports the charitable efforts of colleagues around 
the Group. We currently focus on three strategic partners 
aligned to our own areas of business, sharing the social 
benefits of knowledge, wellbeing and resilience. Our current 
partners on these strategic themes are Udaan Foundation 
(knowledge), Alzheimer's Society (wellbeing) and RedR 
(resilience). We manage the majority of our charitable giving 
business-by-business, with a central fund to provide greater 
support to our strategic partners.
We regularly engage clients in joint fundraising activities and 
see this as an important part of client relationship building.
We match pound-for-pound money raised by UK staff in 
fundraising activities and all UK staff are entitled to take one 
Charity Day per year, when they can spend company time helping 
a charity. The Group Charities Committee considers the many 
requests we receive from charities and takes a particular interest 
in those charities connected to communities local to our offices.
Our Diversity Committee has defined our diversity agenda on the 
basis of three pillars: Networking, Sponsorship and Involvement, 
while ensuring that all of our activities are inclusive, whether 
externally or internally focused. In 2017, JLT supported a number 
of initiatives, both internally and at public events in the London 
and other markets, to help drive a more diverse and inclusive 
business and to play our part in addressing diversity challenges 
in our industry. 
We are also keen to ensure that we minimise our environmental 
impact and we take a number of steps to reduce our carbon 
footprint, such as encouraging the use of teleconferencing facilities 
where possible, instead of travelling to face-to-face meetings.
Further details can be found in our Corporate Responsibility 
Report on pages 46 to 55.
SHARE BUY-BACK AUTHORITY
We will be seeking renewal of our standing share buy-back 
authority at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, up to a 
maximum of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital. 
As in previous years, we will not be seeking shareholder 
approval for a dispensation under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code 
in relation to this authority. This means that if the Directors 
were to initiate a buy-back, then in order to avoid triggering 
a mandatory offer obligation on Jardine Matheson Holdings 
(JMH) under Rule 37 of the Takeover Code, JMH would need 
to be able to participate in those buy-backs so that its overall 
percentage holding (which as at 22 February 2018 was 40.16%) 
did not increase following the buy-back.
Although the Company has not utilised the authority to buy 
back shares since 2008, the Board believes it would be in the 
interests of all shareholders for the Company to have the right 
to purchase its own shares in the market in the appropriate 
circumstances. We would only exercise this authority if we 
believe it is in the best interests of the shareholders and would 
result in an improvement in earnings per share.
OUTLOOK 
Overall the Group is in very good shape and well placed to take 
advantage of the current market environment. We enter 2018 
looking forward to continuing strong organic revenue growth 
and further financial progress.

KEY FINANCIAL 
HIGHLIGHTS
JLT made substantial financial 
progress in 2017, returning to strong 
organic revenue growth. 
JLT achieved total revenues of 
£1,386 million in 2017, an increase of 
10% over 2016. This included strong 
organic revenue growth of 5%, in line 
with historical rates. 
Our underlying profit before tax  
increased by 11% to £191.5 million,  
or by 8% at constant rates of  
exchange (CRE). The trading margin  
was maintained at 15.4%.
RISK & INSURANCE
Our global Risk & Insurance businesses 
grew revenues to £1,066 million, 
an increase of 11%, with organic 
revenue growth of 5%. Trading profit 
rose substantially, increasing from 
£166.6 million to £197.9 million and 
contributing to a 2% increase in trading 
margin to 19%. 
JLT Europe delivered total revenues of 
£399.3 million in 2017. After adjusting  
for the disposal of Thistle at the end of 
2016, this represented revenue growth  
of 7%, or 4% growth on an organic 
revenue basis. Trading profit in JLT 
Europe increased by 9% to £90.6 million 
and the trading margin increased from 
22% to 23% on an adjusted basis. 
Strong client retention and new 
business drove good performances 
from most divisions, including in 
Financial Lines, Northern Europe and 
Credit & Political Risks. This achievement 
was delivered despite challenging market 
conditions, particularly in the Energy 
and Marine sectors. 
We made investments in 2017 to 
strengthen our presence in continental 
Europe, including the acquisition of 
Belgibo, the Belgian specialty broker, 
in August. These investments for growth 
also support our Brexit planning, enabling 
JLT to manage the consequences of 
different Brexit scenarios. 
Outside of Europe, we also delivered 
strong growth in our international 
Specialty businesses, which achieved 
revenues of £449.4 million, a headline 
increase of 21% with organic revenue 
growth of 8%. The combined trading 
margin in the international Specialty 
businesses increased from 12% to 14%.
JLT's Australia and New Zealand 
businesses grew revenues by 7% 
to £125.7 million. We anticipate that 
earnings from a number of important 
client wins will help these businesses 
return to organic revenue growth in 2018.
Our business in Asia had a good 
performance with an 11% increase in 
revenues to £100.3 million, with 6% 
organic revenue growth. Revenue 
performance was driven by our core 
specialties, particularly Financial Lines 
and Construction.
Our Latin American operations grew 
revenues by 31% to £93.3 million, 
with 19% organic revenue growth. 
Trading profit increased by 24% to 
£26.1 million, a 17% increase at CRE. 
We have been making significant 
investments in building our Specialty 
capabilities across Latin America and 
these results demonstrate the success 
of that strategy.
The US Specialty business continued 
to make good progress in the year, 
delivering revenue approaching           
USD 100 million. Net investment losses 
reduced from £27 million to £16 million, 
delivering on our previous guidance  
that these losses reached the 'high-
water' mark at the end of 2016.  
The US business is now firmly  
established with 335 employees in  
17 locations and an increasing market 
presence, now representing 5% of the 
Fortune 500. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S 
REVIEW
“
2017 was an important year for the JLT Group. 
The decisions we took during the year and  
the strategic developments we have initiated 
will, I believe, mark the start of a new chapter  
in the growth of JLT.
“
Dominic Burke    Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 15
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
JLT Re, our global reinsurance broking business, increased 
revenues by 11% to £217.1 million, reflecting organic revenue 
growth of 4%. This performance was delivered despite a 
continued decline in pricing across most lines of reinsurance 
and in most geographies during the year. This was underlined 
by the 1 January 2017 renewals, which saw risk-adjusted global 
property-catastrophe pricing reduce by almost 6%.  
JLT Re’s trading profit increased by 5% to £42.4 million.  
The trading margin was 20% in the year, reflecting JLT Re’s 
continued investment in market leading talent across all of its 
geographies, increasing headcount by approximately 10% 
year on year. Organic revenue growth in Europe and North 
America was offset in part by Asia Pacific, where we saw 
significant headwinds from the rating environment combined 
with reductions in facultative buying activity.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
JLT's global Employee Benefits (EB) operations delivered 
overall revenue growth of 7%, with 4% organic revenue growth. 
Within the global total, the UK EB business achieved particularly 
strong organic revenue growth of 8%, which was offset by 
some weakness in regions of the international EB business. 
JLT’s UK and Ireland EB business grew revenues by 7% to 
£172.0 million, reflecting impressive organic revenue growth 
of 8%. Trading profit increased by 40% to £17.2 million.  
Trading margins in the UK and Ireland EB business increased 
from 8% to 10%. We now expect to achieve our 15% trading 
margin target for this business in 2019, rather than in 2018, 
with the benefit of the Global Transformation Programme 
described below. The Group anticipates that the business will 
make further progress in 2018 towards this target, with the 
majority of the progress being made in 2019.
JLT's international Employee Benefits businesses achieved 
mixed headline results, although there was improving 
momentum and some good performances within  
individual businesses.
In Asia, Private Client Services (PCS), our life assurance 
broker, had a difficult first half to the year. However, this was 
followed by a positive performance in the second half of the 
year. The business is now expanding into new geographies, 
including mainland China.
In Australia, structural changes in the workers compensation 
market resulted in a slower rate of revenue growth. However, 
we are anticipating a better performance in 2018, building on 
the trading profit growth in 2017.
In Brazil, corporate payrolls fell as the economy remained 
weak, leading to slower headline revenue growth and a 
year on year reduction in trading profit in the region. 
However, Latin America EB has been successful in winning 
significant volumes of new business and we look forward to 
growth rates returning to former levels in this business as 
economies in the region recover.
Details of the performance of each individual business are set 
out in the Review of Operations on pages 27 to 34. 
A YEAR OF PROGRESS AND 
STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT
2017 was an important year for the JLT Group. The decisions 
we took during the year and the strategic developments we 
have initiated will, I believe, mark the start of a new chapter in 
the growth of JLT.
The Group’s acquisition of TW Re in late 2013, followed by the 
establishment of JLT’s US Specialty business in 2014, has given 
JLT a firm foundation in the US. That increase in scope and 
opportunity provided the context for the Group's re-examination 
of its strategy during 2017. The process confirmed that:
• JLT’s deep specialist strength is a key differentiator between 
JLT and its larger competitors; and
• representation in the US now gives JLT the opportunity to 
move from an international to a global business across each 
of Reinsurance, Specialty and Employee Benefits.
JLT re-articulated its mission, ‘To become the leading global 
specialist risk adviser and broker', and the Group is now taking 
a number of important steps towards its strategic objectives.
BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE
We are making a number of structural changes to the 
businesses and management of JLT. Collaboration has 
always been a key part of the JLT culture. However, 
becoming truly global requires us to graduate from informal, 
ad hoc collaboration to consistent and systematically 
coordinated working. 
As announced in January 2018, Lucy Clarke has been 
appointed to the new role of Global CEO of the Group's 
Specialty business with effect from 1 April. Bringing JLT's 
regional insurance broking operations together into an 
integrated Specialty division, with leaders appointed in each 
of its principal industry specialty businesses (Energy, 
Construction, Financial Lines, Aerospace, Marine & Cargo 
and Credit & Political Risks), responsible for globally coordinated 
sales and delivery to clients, will enable JLT to operate as 
a combined group of global specialists. 16 STRATEGIC REPORT
An integrated global management structure is already operating 
effectively and delivering value in JLT’s Reinsurance division. 
The Group is confident that JLT will realise the same benefits 
in Global Specialty, and that its Specialty businesses will see 
accelerated growth, operating on a global basis.
Employee Benefits will also operate as a worldwide business. 
UK & Ireland and International Employee Benefits, including 
PCS, will be the third of JLT's three business divisions. 
From 1 April 2018, the Group’s businesses will therefore be 
structured into three divisions, Reinsurance, Specialty and 
Employee Benefits, and the same structure will be adopted 
when reporting the Group’s future results.
GLOBAL TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME – 
TRANSFORMING OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES
For some time JLT has been investigating how we can 
streamline the operational processes used to serve clients in 
each of our divisions, to deliver global consistency and eliminate 
duplicated costs. 
The Group will be implementing a two-year plus Group-wide 
Global Transformation Programme. From 2020, JLT expects 
to use a consistent set of processes and core operating 
platforms for the delivery of each of Reinsurance, Specialty 
and Employee Benefits. 
The benefits will be significant in terms of seamless global 
service and delivery; communications internally and externally 
to clients; and data collection and analysis. 
In financial terms, the Group expects the programme to deliver 
annualised savings of £40 million by 2020 for a one-off cost 
of £45 million. Further financial details can be found in the 
Finance Director’s Review on page 38.
Operating on a consistent basis across all of JLT’s global 
businesses will achieve significant, tangible benefits: 
a better client experience, improved cost efficiency and 
stronger controls.
JLT SPECIALTY USA – BUILDING A BUSINESS  
OF SCALE
The objective of building a US Specialty business that 
contributes to the Group on a scale that better reflects the 
importance of the US to the global economy is at the heart 
of the Group’s medium term strategy.
In addition to revenues and profits generated in and from the 
US, the Group believes that a strong US business will create 
further opportunities for growth in other parts of the world. 
We therefore intend to build on the firm foundation that JLT 
has already established in the US through continuing organic 
revenue growth, complemented by targeted acquisitions. 
This began with the purchase of a controlling interest in the 
construction specialist, Construction Risk Partners, in January 
2017 which has proven to be highly successful, delivering a 
continuing stream of domestic wins and increasing coordination 
throughout the Group to win and service international 
construction clients. 
In 2017, the US Specialty business represented 5% of the 
Group’s revenues. That proportion is expected to grow in the 
next few years. Following a move into profitability in 2019, 
we anticipate that trading margins in the US Specialty business 
will move broadly into line with those in JLT’s other major global 
Specialty businesses in the medium term. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS - ESTABLISHING A 
COORDINATED GLOBAL BUSINESS
The Group is confident about the momentum throughout 
the Employee Benefits busnesses going into 2018, and the 
prospects for the division’s revenue and profit growth.
In UK EB, the largest business, we anticipate further strong 
growth in both revenue and trading margin as we see a return 
on the investments made in recent years. 
The UK EB business has a strong position in the occupational 
pension scheme market. It is also making appropriate 
investments for the future so as to generate new business from 
today’s employees. These investments are in the ‘new world’ 
areas of retirement savings, occupational health insurance, 
employee wellness, workplace marketing and flexible benefits 
made available by employers to their workforces, as well as 
serving the growing needs of workers in the ‘gig economy'.
JLT now operates Employee Benefits across the Group and 
through its international network, and we have begun work to 
coordinate the presentation and marketing of our Employee 
Benefits activities worldwide. During 2017, we took advantage 
of JLT's international coverage to launch a coordinated global 
Employee Benefits offering, sold, managed and delivered by a 
single global team. The initial response from clients confirms 
that JLT can grow revenues in the international employee 
benefits market.     Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 17
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
LOOKING FORWARD 
After five consecutive years of falling reinsurance rates, global 
property catastrophe rates have experienced some upward 
pressure but with significant variances across regions driven 
in large part by the losses experienced following hurricanes 
Harvey, Irma and Maria. Across most lines and most classes of 
reinsurance and specialty, the trend of steady price reductions 
through a number of years seems to have moderated or ended. 
However, a consistent pattern is not evident and it would be 
premature to refer to a hardening market. 
In today’s market each risk needs the broker to demonstrate 
real understanding of the risk and real transactional expertise to 
secure appropriate cover on the optimum terms for the client. 
This is the specialist capability that JLT has built over the past 
decade and the Group is confident that JLT is well placed to 
grow and execute on its strategy.
JLT has entered 2018 with real momentum but we do not 
expect a consistently hard insurance market. While the Group 
is positive with regards to the factors within its control, volatile 
currency markets present a risk. Therefore, taken together, 
JLT enters 2018 looking forward to continuing strong organic 
revenue growth and further financial progress.
Dominic Burke
Group Chief Executive
28 February 2018 18 STRATEGIC REPORT
JLT is a global provider of reinsurance, insurance and employee benefits related advice, brokerage and 
services. Our business is influenced by a number of external factors, at both an industry-specific level and 
more generally. A summary of some key market factors which currently affect JLT, and are expected to 
continue to impact it in the coming years, is set out below.
MARKET FACTORS 
IMPACTING JLT
The IMF estimates that global output grew by 3.6% in 2017 
and that it will grow by 3.9% in 2018, with sustained growth 
momentum across North America, Europe and the emerging 
markets. Risks to the global growth forecast are seen as 
broadly balanced in the near term, but remain skewed to the 
downside over the medium term.
The future development of the UK economy remains less clear 
and subject to volatility in the near term as negotiation of the 
UK’s exit from the EU continues.
Higher oil prices in recent months have stimulated some new 
exploration activity but, overall, global exploration spend is not 
expected to increase in 2018. Similarly, forecasts for maritime 
industry activity are mixed.
IMPACT ON JLT
JLT’s growth prospects are sensitive to macro trends: higher 
levels of economic growth lead to more corporate activity, 
investment and increasing personal wealth. This increased 
activity stimulates demand for our services.
In light of the Group’s investments to strengthen its representation 
in the European Union and the preparatory work undertaken,  
JLT does not anticipate that Brexit will materially impact its ability 
to serve clients and access markets in the EU.
Conditions remain challenging in industries such as energy and 
marine, which represent important client concentrations for JLT.
For the longer term, JLT’s strategy is increasingly aligned with 
faster-growing sectors and geographies where demand is 
driven by market trends and demographic factors such as 
population growth, ageing, urbanisation and increasing middle-
class wealth.
GLOBAL MACRO ECONOMIC TRENDS

  Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 19
COMPETITION

THE RATING ENVIRONMENT
2
For several years, high levels of available capital in the insurance 
markets, with relatively low loss levels, have led to sustained 
downward pressure on premiums. The level of capital deployed 
in the insurance and reinsurance markets remains high.
Towards the end of 2017, upward pricing pressure was 
experienced in some reinsurance markets. This was primarily 
a result of the higher property catastrophe losses caused by 
hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria striking coastal regions of 
the US and the Caribbean. Wild fires in California also added to 
market losses.
At the start of 2018, the trend of significant price reductions 
seems to have moderated or ended, with renewal rates seeing 
increases in areas where there were heavy losses. However, 
other lines of business are still seeing price reductions, albeit at 
a slower pace, and a consistent pattern is not yet evident.
IMPACT ON JLT
JLT is adversely affected by depressed insurance and 
reinsurance pricing levels as a significant proportion of our 
income is earned by way of commissions. This creates 
challenges for the business in delivering organic growth.
Reduced downward pressure on insurance pricing should 
provide a better trading environment for JLT but we continue to 
focus on those specialty sectors and economies where there is 
particular value in our distinctive proposition.
If available capital and insurance capacity in the market 
moderates or declines, the value of the expertise provided by 
the broker will increase.
JLT faces a wide range of local, regional and international 
competitors in its Reinsurance, Specialty and Employee  
Benefits operations.
Macro economic headwinds and the depressed rating 
environment have combined, over recent years, to create a 
competitive environment in which some rivals have discounted 
heavily to retain and win new business, as well as offering very 
significant remuneration packages to attract new staff.
The competitive environment is unlikely to ease significantly in 
the near future, even if the rating environment starts to ease.
IMPACT ON JLT
JLT has been able to attract new clients due to its differentiated 
specialty-led offering and distinctive culture.
We remain confident that the distinctive culture JLT offers to 
professional colleagues, together with our client proposition,  
will allow us to continue to attract and retain talent and business. 20 STRATEGIC REPORT
JLT operates under the jurisdiction of a number of different 
regulators. Its principal regulator is the UK Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). The level of oversight exercised by the various 
financial services regulators varies from country to country 
and often by business activity, but the overall trend is towards 
increasing levels of regulatory oversight. There is also more 
consistency in the type of regulation being introduced across 
many countries, in areas such as data protection.
Regulation can also create a more level playing field and 
help stimulate greater client demand. Proportionate and fair 
regulation is something we welcome as being positive for our 
clients, our colleagues and the industry as a whole.
IMPACT ON JLT
The trends in global regulation place an additional resource 
and cost burden on JLT. They also increase the chances of 
regulatory action being faced by the Group in the relevant 
jurisdictions, sometimes with a retrospective element.
Furthermore, as JLT grows, we can expect a greater level of 
regulatory scrutiny in line with our increased scale, particularly 
for those of our businesses that carry consumer ‘conduct risk’. 
We continue to invest in our risk and compliance frameworks  
to ensure that we have the right skills to enable us to  
advise our businesses on the implications of the changing 
regulatory environment.
JLT is committed to working constructively with all of our 
regulators to ensure that we meet our regulatory commitments, 
protect our clients’ interests and achieve fair client outcomes.
REGULATION
4
TECHNOLOGY
5
Advances in technology are bringing rapid changes in how  
JLT’s clients’ businesses are run and in the risks they face. 
Similar pressures directly impact JLT’s own business.
Technological change also gives rise to new areas of insurance 
such as cyber risk cover.
A significant increase in the volume of risk and insurance data 
that can be collected and analysed is having a significant 
impact on the industry’s actuarial understanding of underlying 
risk trends and how they should be priced.
Technological advances potentially enable a new generation of 
competitors to disrupt existing players such as JLT.
IMPACT ON JLT
Technological changes create opportunities for JLT to carry 
out its operations more efficiently and cost-effectively. 
They also allow us to enhance the service we provide to clients, 
for example through the collection and use of data to drive 
better insights for our clients, or through the adoption of new 
channels for engaging and communicating with them.
While the level of risk to our own business from cyber attack 
continues to increase, and requires substantial investment  
in systems and procedures to counter the threats, cyber risk 
offers an opportunity to provide risk management advisory 
services to clients.
Since a large proportion of the services JLT provides are 
specialised services in relation to the complex, specific risks 
borne by a base of mainly large clients, we believe that JLT is 
at a comparatively low risk of technology-enabled disruption.

OUR MISSION
The Group’s mission is to become the leading global specialist risk adviser and broker, operating through three 
divisions, Reinsurance, Specialty and Employee Benefits. We will achieve that by establishing, developing and refining 
our specialised capabilities and ensuring that there is coordination across the Group to provide a seamless global 
service to clients that include the largest multinationals. This will govern the Group’s strategy.
FEES AND COMMISSIONS
PROFIT
REMITTED TO SHAREHOLDERS REINVESTED IN BUSINESS
OUR BUSINESS MODEL
Fees are typically charged either on a time-cost 
or a fixed-fee basis and are earned in each of the 
Reinsurance, Specialty and Employee Benefits 
divisions. These fees are paid by the client rather 
than the insurer or reinsurer.
Commissions are typically based on a percentage 
of the insurance or reinsurance premium being paid 
by the client. Frequently, the level of this commission 
payment is also subject to negotiation with the client. 
This commission is paid by the insurer or reinsurer 
rather than the client and is largely earned in the 
Group’s Reinsurance and Specialty businesses.
INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment income arises from the holding of cash and 
investments on behalf of clients. The holding of client monies 
largely relates to premium and claims payments which the 
business holds for a short period of time in its role as the 
intermediary.
COSTS
Two of the largest underlying costs to the business relate to staff 
and premises. In 2017, these represented 62% and 5% respectively 
of total revenues. There is a clear focus on cost discipline with the 
trading margin being a Key Performance Indicator. The Group's 
Global Transformation Programme is projected to deliver significant 
cost reductions. 
ACQUISITIONS
Acquisitions to complement organic revenue 
growth have been, and will continue to be, an 
important element of delivering on the Group’s 
strategy. In 2017, the Group made three  
new acquisitions for a total consideration  
of £61.2 million.
In the last 5 years, the Group has made a total 
of 36 acquisitions for a total consideration 
of £379.9 million. The three largest of these 
constituted 64% of this amount. 
PEOPLE
The Group continues to retain and recruit 
market-leading individuals across all of its  
global operations.
JLT now has over 10,000 employees working 
for the Group. Key to the success of our 
recruitment approach has been retaining and 
attracting individuals who not only add further 
capabilities, but also fit JLT’s distinctive culture.
The Group is committed to investing in the 
training and development of all its employees.
From April 2018, our business will be structured into three divisions, Reinsurance, Specialty and 
Employee Benefits.
DIVISIONS 22 STRATEGIC REPORT
REVIEWING & DELIVERING 
OUR STRATEGY 
RE-EXAMINATION OF  
GROUP STRATEGY
During 2017 we carried out a re-examination of the Group’s 
strategy, in order to ensure that it remains appropriate to 
support and enable our future growth plans. 
The potential created for the Group by our growth in the US 
includes both further expansion in the US market and the 
acceleration of our development in other parts of the world. 
The US ambition remains at the heart of the Group's medium 
term strategy. It was against this backdrop that we re-examined 
our strategy, to ensure that the Group is able to deliver on this 
growth potential. 
The review was also carried out in the context of continuing 
economic and industry challenges, including headwinds in 
the reinsurance rating environment and challenging market 
conditions in some industry sectors, such as oil and gas.  
Other factors included changes in the types of risks that 
clients face, with a move to more communication and 
processing-dominated ways of conducting business across 
many industries, and the emergence of more intangible risks.
Extensive discussions were held with senior colleagues across 
the Group, as well as with our clients and our trading partners, 
in order to gain a detailed understanding of the key challenges 
and opportunities the business faces.
KEY CONCLUSIONS
The review resulted in a number of conclusions in respect 
of the future shape of the Group’s strategy. These are 
summarised below.
PRESERVATION OF JLT’S DISTINCTIVE CULTURE
JLT’s distinctive identity and culture – an entrepreneurial 
approach, a focus on clients’ interests and the provision to 
colleagues of the opportunity to develop their practices - are 
key differentiators with clients, insurance professionals and 
markets. Their preservation and development are seen as 
paramount. At the same time, it is essential to maintain an 
equitable balance between the interests of the Group’s four 
principal stakeholders: our clients, colleagues, trading partners  
and shareholders. 
SPECIALIST FOCUS 
JLT will focus on becoming even more of a Specialty business 
in the next few years.  
‘Specialty’ is defined as those practice areas (industries or 
products) where JLT has:
• deep knowledge, expertise and experience;
• understanding of the risks specific to the area and risk 
management options;
• first rate transactional capability; and
• market standing, contacts and reputation.  
OUR MISSION
To become the leading global specialist risk adviser and broker.
OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy balances the interests of our four key stakeholders: our clients, our colleagues, our trading 
partners and our shareholders. The four pillars to our strategy are described in more detail on page 6: 
Culture, Specialist, Coordination and International.  
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
  Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 23
Specialty also includes those areas where JLT can operate and 
compete as a value-adding trusted adviser, offering services 
such as data analytics, risk evaluation and management 
services, in order to win appointments to carry out placements 
and to provide the best service to our clients.
A large component of JLT’s success is the quality of our people, 
and it is this emphasis on enabling professionals to deploy their 
strength that makes JLT an attractive employer. We will not seek 
to commoditise what is a value-adding professional offering or 
rely on automatic placement of premiums via client treaties or 
other mechanisms with the carriers who offer the intermediary 
the highest return at the lowest cost. We do recognise, 
however, that changes are taking place in how clients address 
risk, which are leading to changes in the types of service they 
want from JLT. It is essential for us to deliver what clients want, 
which will mean striking the right balance between complex 
transactions and simpler, more commoditised solutions in  
some circumstances.  
JLT will focus on narrower but deeper penetration of existing 
clients, with increased cross-selling of additional lines of cover 
to existing clients.  
JLT will focus its investment in new risk areas, as a worldwide 
evolution of risk from the physical to the intangible occurs. 
In particular there will be extensive investment in the management 
of Cyber Risk and areas such as Credit & Political Risks.
As a result of the review, the Group re-articulated its mission 
during the year: ‘To become the leading global specialist risk 
adviser and broker’. 
COORDINATION IS A KEY DIFFERENTIATOR
Another key conclusion from the review was to reaffirm the 
importance of collaboration across divisions, regions and industry 
practices as a differentiator between JLT and its competitors.  
Working together is central to the JLT culture; it has been a major 
factor behind our success and is, and will remain, the foundation 
of our structure and what we offer to clients.
To pursue the Group’s mission successfully, JLT needs to 
evolve from case-by-case collaboration to working in a  
more formalised and consistently coordinated way.  
This will enable JLT to provide a seamless and consistent  
global service to multinational clients wherever in the world  
we engage with them.
AN EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL NETWORK
JLT’s International Network, which is a combination of 
controlled and non-controlled, branded and non-branded 
operations, is effective. There are, however, opportunities to 
improve collaboration within and between regions, through 
investment in supporting emerging specialties and international 
development of regional strengths. 
The objective of building a US Specialty business that 
contributes to the Group on a scale that better reflects the 
importance of the US to the global economy is at the heart of 
the Group’s medium-term strategy. The Group intends to build 
on the firm foundation that it has already established in the US 
through continuing organic revenue growth, complemented by 
targeted acquisitions. 
JLT will focus on strengthening its continental European 
presence ahead of the UK’s exit from the European Union.
JLT will also continue to explore opportunities to strengthen its 
presence in China. 
JLT needs to have the right representation in the right locations 
to enable us to realise our global Specialty mission in our 
chosen industries.
STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
The Group is undertaking a number of strategic initiatives to 
progress towards its mission to become the leading global 
specialist risk adviser and broker, details of which are set out in 
the Chief Executive's Review on pages 14 and 15 and the table 
on page 24.   24 STRATEGIC REPORT

Total revenue per employee* Trading Margin**
Revenue per employee increased, reflecting a 10% growth in 
revenue whilst headcount remained at a similar level to 2016. 
Across the Group we continued to invest in our Specialty 
capabilities through the ongoing recruitment of leading industry 
professionals and targeted acquisitions which has offset 
headcount reduction from disposals.
The underlying trading margin for the Group was maintained at 
15.4%. Our focus on preserving operating leverage maintained 
cost growth in line with revenue, whilst continuing to invest for 
the future. 
Underlying PBT*** Underlying Diluted EPS***

JLT Europe provides insurance broking, risk management and 
claims services for clients across a wide range of business 
sectors. The division employs some 1,700 people primarily 
based in London, but with a growing European presence, 
all of which work in close collaboration with the broader JLT 
International Network, supplying them with industry expertise, 
advice and access to international markets. 
Review of Operations 
JLT Europe's revenues increased to £399.3 million in 2017. 
After adjusting for the disposal of Thistle at the end of 2016, 
this represented a 7% increase, of which 4% was organic. 
Trading profit grew by 9% to £90.6 million and trading margin 
increased to 23% on an adjusted basis.
Strong client retention and new business drove good 
performances from most divisions, including Financial Lines, 
Northern Europe, and Credit & Political Risks. This was 
achieved despite challenging market conditions, particularly 
in the Energy and Marine industry sectors. The business 
made investments in 2017 to strengthen its presence in 
continental Europe, including the acquisition of Belgibo, the 
Belgian specialty broker, in August. These investments support 
the Group's Brexit planning, enabling JLT to manage the 
consequences of different Brexit scenarios. Through JLT's 
continued investment on the continent, European revenues are 
expected to grow over time across several specialty sectors.

in 18 countries, delivering world class risk analysis and risk 
transfer solutions.
Review of Operations
JLT Re's revenues increased by 11% to £217.1 million, 
reflecting organic revenue growth of 4%. This performance was 
delivered despite the continued decline in pricing across most 
lines of reinsurance business and in most geographies during 
the year. This was underlined by the 1 January 2017 renewals, 
which saw risk-adjusted global property catastrophe pricing fall 
by almost 6%. 
JLT Re’s trading profit increased by 5% to £42.4 million.  
The trading margin was 20% in the year, reflecting JLT Re's 
continued investment in market leading talent across all of its 
geographies, increasing headcount by approximately 10% 
year-on-year. 
Organic revenue growth in Europe and North America was 
offset in part by Asia Pacific, which experienced significant 
headwinds from the rating environment combined with 
reductions in facultative buying activity.

£10.5 million, a 2% increase on 2016, or a decrease of 
2% at constant rates of exchange. Trading profit decreased 
to a £0.6 million loss from a profit of £0.3 million in 2016. 
Through the provision of captive management and consultancy 
services, JLT Insurance Management supports some of 
JLT’s largest global clients and, as such, plays a key role in 
programmes that deliver revenue to the wider Group.

revenue growth rate of 8%. Trading profit grew to £17.2 million,

INCOME STATEMENT
The Group’s total revenue for the year 
was £1.39 billion. Underlying profit before 
tax was £191.5 million, with reported 
profit before tax of £181.6 million (after 
exceptional items) and reported profit 
after tax and non-controlling interests of 
£118.4 million. Diluted earnings per share 
(EPS) was 54.7p, up from 37.8p in 2016.
Underlying profit before tax grew by 11% 
on 2016 and was underpinned by the 
overall strong trading performance of the 
business. The 2017 results have been 
favourably impacted by changes in foreign 
exchange rates although the benefit was 
significantly reduced from 2016. However, 
sterling has strengthened significantly 
since December 2017 and should sterling 
remain at its highest point in the year to 
date, the Group anticipates that this would 
reduce underlying profit before tax by 
approximately £10 million.
Revenue
Compared with 2016, JLT delivered a 
10% increase in total revenue, 6% at 
constant rates of exchange (CRE),  
with 5% organic growth.
Our Risk & Insurance businesses,  
which in 2017 represented approximately 
77% of the Group’s revenue, grew 
revenues to £1.07 billion, an increase of 
11%, or 5% on an organic basis.
Our Employee Benefits businesses  
grew revenues by 7%, or 4% on an 
organic basis. This was principally  
due to 8% organic growth in our  
UK & Ireland business.
Organic revenue of our international 
Employee Benefits businesses remained at 
similar levels to 2016 reflecting challenging 
macroeconomic and trading conditions.
Operating costs
Total underlying operating costs 
(excluding exceptional items) increased 
by £104 million, or 10%, to £1.17 billion. 
Of the increase, £48 million arose from 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The 
mix of the cost base remained broadly 
unchanged with staff and premises costs 
being the major individual expense items.
Head office costs rose to £34.3 million in 
the year, in line with previous guidance, 
and are expected to remain at a similar 
level in 2018, subject to changes in 
provisions. The increase in the year related 
to rising premises costs, higher 
UK employment taxes and normalised 
self-insurance costs.
Trading profit
The Group’s underlying trading profit 
increased by 10% to £213.7 million  
 and the trading margin was maintained 
at 15.4%.
Associates
The Group’s income from its Associates 
increased from £1.0 million to £2.1 million. 
Finance costs
Net finance costs increased by  
£2.2 million to £24.3 million as 
we continued to invest across the 
business, including the acquisition of 
Construction Risk Partners (CRP) in 
the US and Belgibo in Belgium.
Underlying profit before tax
The Group’s underlying profit before tax 
increased by 11% to £191.5 million.
Exceptional costs
In 2017, net exceptional items were  
£9.9 million (2016: £37.7 million), 
primarily driven by £9.1 million related to 
a settlement of litigation, £2.6 million of 
acquisition and integration costs mainly 
in respect of CRP and Belgibo, offset by 
£1.8 million of gains on the disposals of 
the Group's Mexican Associate business 
and Expacare, the small UK expatriate 
insurance business.

Tax
The tax charge for the year was £52.9 million, representing 
an effective tax rate of 29.5% (2016: 32.9%) excluding share 
of Associates. The underlying tax expense was £53.3 million, 
representing an effective tax rate of 28.2% (2016: 30.5%).  
The year-on-year decrease in the underlying tax rate was driven 
by the change in the geographical mix of profit and the different 
tax rates across those geographies.
Profit after tax and non-controlling interests
Profit after tax and non-controlling interests was £118.4 million 
(2016: £81.5 million). Diluted earnings per share was 54.7p  
on a reported basis (2016: 37.8p).
BALANCE SHEET
The net assets of the Group increased to £398 million from 
£351 million. The key movements were:
• an increase in goodwill of £35 million mainly due to the 
acquisition of 50.1% of CRP and the entire shareholding of 
Belgibo, partly offset by the impact of foreign exchange. 
The Group completed three acquisitions for a total 
consideration of £61.2 million; 
• a net increase in working capital of £33 million, which is 
£10 million lower than the same period in 2016, despite 
higher overall revenues and no significant shift in seasonality;
• a decrease of £29 million in the net pension liability primarily 
as a result of the Group's annual contributions and returns 
on scheme assets. The associated deferred tax asset was 
recognised accordingly; and
• the derivatives position decreased by £30 million, mainly 
due to mark to market adjustments. The associated 
deferred tax asset was recognised accordingly.
Net debt, defined as own funds less total borrowings net of 
transaction costs, was £506 million (2016: £496 million).  
The Group’s principal measure of leverage, the Net Debt to 
EBITDA ratio, was 1.8:1 (2016: 2.1:1) or 1.6:1 (2016: 1.6:1) 
on a bank covenant basis. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group had committed long-term 
unsecured revolving credit facilities of £500 million and drawn 
private placement loan notes equivalent to £420 million, 
resulting in total debt facilities equivalent to £920 million 
with maturities between 2020 and 2029. A long term private 
placement loan note for USD 42 million, issued in 2010, was 
repaid in September 2017. Gross borrowings were £710 million, 
which includes £691 million of borrowings under the Group’s 
committed facilities, leaving unutilised committed facilities 
headroom of £229 million.
The Group continues to be well funded with an appropriate 
mix of short and long-term debt, with a range of maturities that 
extend to 2029.

OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS
The Group primarily monitors operational cash flows, which 
report cash and net debt movements but exclude fiduciary funds; 
statutory cash flows include movements in fiduciary funds.
In 2017, the Group generated £279 million of EBITDA,  
reflecting an increase in underlying profit and a reduction in 
exceptional items. 
Operational free cash flows increased to £175 million,  
reflecting the EBITDA growth, offset by an increase in annual 
capex due to the fit-out of additional space in the Group’s 
London headquarters, as well as improvements to its IT 
infrastructure. Acquisition capex was primarily driven by the 
acquisitions of CRP and Belgibo. This resulted in an overall net 
cash outflow of £49 million in 2017.
DIVIDENDS
The Board has recommended a final dividend in respect of 
2017 of 21.8p per share. Together with the interim dividend 
of 12.2p per share, this brings the total dividend to 34.0p per 
share, an increase of 5.6%. This represents dividend cover 
of 1.7 times, based on underlying diluted earnings per share, 
compared to 1.6 times in 2016.
IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
Details regarding the Group‘s current assessment of the impact 
of new accounting standards, IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) 
and IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), 
can be found in the Significant Accounting Policies of the 
financial statements.
IFRS 9 is anticipated to have an immaterial impact on the 
Group's profit and loss account mainly due to our conservative 
bad debt provisioning policy and strong credit control. 38 STRATEGIC REPORT
As stated in the Chief Executive’s review, implementation of the 
two year Group-wide Global Transformation Programme will 
commence in 2018. It is projected to deliver a fully sustainable 
operating cost reduction of £40 million by the end of the  
2020 financial year, secured at a one-off cost estimated at  
£45 million, which will be recorded as exceptional items in the 
year they are incurred. The benefits will register progressively in 
2018, 2019 and 2020.
Including the Global Transformation Programme, the Group 
anticipates a shift in the phasing of its profits in 2018 to 
approximately 49% in the first half, and 51% in the second half 
of the financial year.
PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL RISKS
The Group has identified four principal financial risks: capital 
and liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, counterparty risk and the 
defined benefit pension scheme risk.
1) Capital and Liquidity Risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard 
its ability to continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital 
structure to ensure an optimal cost of capital. In order to achieve 
2) Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has transactional and translational foreign currency 
exposures. The transactional exposure arises primarily in the 
London Market businesses, which have a sterling cost base but 
which have a significant proportion of US dollar denominated 
revenues (approximately USD 350 million in 2017).
The Group continues to operate a US dollar hedging 
programme to reduce the volatility caused by exchange 
rate movements, by entering into forward foreign exchange 
contracts. As at 14 February 2018, 87% of these anticipated 
dollar revenues for 2018 earned in the UK (approximately 
USD 360 million) are hedged at an average rate of USD 1.39. 
For 2019, 65% of expected dollar revenues are hedged at an 
average rate of USD 1.33, for 2020 63% are hedged at an 
average rate of USD 1.34 and 10% are hedged for 2021 at 
an average rate of USD 1.46. Other hedging programmes are 
operated for other transactional currency exposures, primarily in 
respect of the Euro, Indian rupee and Canadian dollar.
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations. 
Movements in exchange rates between balance sheet dates  
will affect the sterling value of the Group’s consolidated  
balance sheet.
The currency profile of the Group’s borrowings is managed to 
mitigate balance sheet translation exposures where practical 
and cost effective.

Total capital 903.7 847.1
these objectives, the Group may adjust, for example, the 
amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital by a 
share buy-back, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group manages its balance sheet through monthly reviews, 
management controls and financial reporting. 
In order to manage liquidity risk, the Group maintains 
committed, long-term credit facilities to ensure that it is well 
positioned to meet seasonal capital requirements and to 
support the strategic growth of the business. There are no 
restrictions on the use of these facilities in the normal course 
of business. At 31 December 2017 the facility headroom was 
£229 million. 
The insurance and reinsurance broking operations within the 
Group operate in a number of jurisdictions where local regulation 
requires a minimum level of capital to be maintained. The total 
regulatory capital to be held by the Group is not considered 
significant in the context of the total available capital.
The total capital of the Group at 31 December 2017 and 2016 
was as follows:

JLT has historically recognised inception date as the primary 
trigger for recognising revenue, a practice that has largely 
been upheld under the new standard. As a consequence the 
restatement of 2017 underlying PBT on adoption of IFRS 15 will 
be limited to an overall rephasing of approximately £4.5 million 
into subsequent years. Most of this relates to JLT's UK Employee 
Benefits business due to the longer term nature of its contracts, 
and a further amount to JLT Re for similar reasons. The residual 
balance is split across the remainder of JLT's businesses.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Group’s 2017 consolidated financial statements include 
an income statement, statement of comprehensive income, 
balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and a statement 
of cash flows. These statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union.
Statutory accounts of individual Group companies are 
prepared, as required, in accordance with applicable local 
accounting standards.
The balance sheet of the Company, Jardine Lloyd Thompson 
Group plc, on page 171, has been prepared in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting practice in the UK.
GLOBAL TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME    Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 39
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
In addition to the transactional foreign exchange exposure, 
JLT is also exposed to translational foreign exchange 
movements which are not hedged. Given the relative size and 
profitability of the Group’s Australian business, this is the most 
material such exposure. 
3) Counterparty Risk
The Group’s gross exposure to counterparty risk at 
31 December 2017 is £1.64 billion, representing own cash, 
fiduciary funds, investments and deposits, derivative assets, 
and trade receivables. The Group maintains a counterparty 
policy based on credit analysis, market data and published 
credit ratings to manage the concentration of funds and 
its exposure to individual counterparties. Deposit limits are 
assigned to each counterparty appropriate to its credit rating 
and overall financial profile.
The Group manages its own cash and invested fiduciary 
funds in the form of deposits with a number of banks, 
AA money market funds, and other secure short-term 
money market instruments.
The Group’s counterparty approval criteria include a 
requirement that financial institutions maintain a minimum long  
term investment grade rating, except where this is not possible 
or practical due to local operating or regulatory requirements.
The Group’s credit criteria also include reference to credit 
default swap spreads and capital ratios. All exposures to 
individual counterparties are subject to a formal credit limit 
to control concentrations of credit exposure and limit the 
impact of default risk. Counterparty limits, ratings and 
credit default spread rates, together with utilisation levels, 
are reviewed regularly.
The respective credit quality by rating of each class of financial 
asset is included within the notes to these accounts.
4) Defined Benefit Pension Scheme Risk
The Group has exposure to movements in the balance sheet, 
income statement and statement of comprehensive income as 
a consequence of changes in the valuation of retirement benefit 
assets and liabilities and the impact of such changes on the 
Group’s defined benefit pension scheme positions.
The Group seeks to manage this exposure through regular 
monitoring and reporting of scheme asset performance and 
liability positions, suitable scheme investment and risk mitigation 
strategies and appropriate funding arrangements based on 
periodic actuarial valuations.
Assets held in the UK defined benefit pension scheme include 
annuity buy-in contracts which secure the future benefits 
relating to approximately 70% of pensioner liabilities and which 
reduce exposure to ongoing longevity and asset risk arising 
from that portion of the pension scheme liabilities.
The pension trustees are undertaking a revaluation of the UK 
defined benefit pension scheme position as at 31 March 2017.  
A revised deficit recovery schedule will be agreed in 2018 as a 
part of the scheduled triennial revaluation process. 40 STRATEGIC REPORT

RISK MANAGEMENT REPORT
As a global company, JLT faces a range of risks, any of which has the potential to impact on 
the achievement of our strategic business objectives and our reputation, as well as providing 
opportunity in the right circumstances.

FRAMEWORK
JLT’S INTERNAL CONTROL FRAMEWORK
JLT Three Lines of Defence
The Group operates a 'Three Lines of Defence' (3LOD)  
model as a core component of its governance arrangements,  
as shown above.
The current 3LOD model has been in place and operating for 
five years across the Group, and has been subject to iterative 
enhancements during that time. JLT completed an internal 
review of its 3LOD model in the UK businesses during 2016, 
building upon the solid governance framework already in place. 
JLT successfully implemented the recommendations of the 
review during 2017, which were focused on delivering: 
• enhanced accountability and ownership of risk within the 
businesses, ensuring that the right people with the right 
skills are available to the businesses and close to decision 
making processes;
• clear, skilled roles for the control functions in the second line 
of defence, providing specialist advice and strong oversight 
to the businesses internationally; and
• an enhanced focus on risk management disciplines across 
the business.
In early 2017, JLT also completed a review of its international 
3LOD model, which resulted in a number of enhancements 
being rolled out during the year, including:
• designating all international local risk and compliance 
teams as 1st Line of Defence ('1LOD'), clarifying their role 
and responsibilities, and ensuring a clear delineation from 
the 2nd Line of Defence ('2LOD'); and
• strengthening the 2LOD support and oversight of 
international operations. 
JLT regularly reviews its governance arrangements through 
Board and Audit & Risk Committee (ARC) effectiveness 
reviews which are carried out on an annual basis. More detail 
can be found in the Corporate Governance and Audit & Risk 
Committee Reports on pages 57 to 74. 42 STRATEGIC REPORT
Key JLT policies include:
Anti-bribery and corruption Anti-money laundering and fraud
Gifts and entertainment Conflicts of interest
Market abuse and insider dealing Complaints
HR related policies IT Security
Data protection Sanctions
Each business maintains an Operating Procedures Manual, 
which contains all key procedures for the business to conduct 
itself in a compliant and sustainable manner.
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
JLT’s risk management framework was refreshed and 
strengthened during 2016, referencing several recognised 
standards such as the Institute of Risk Management and ISO 
31000. The revised framework was rolled out during 2017.  
It is based on seven risk categories (IT, Finance, Operations, 
Strategic, People, Legal & Compliance and Service & Markets), 
each of which has a Group level sponsor whose daily role 
is aligned to the subject matter. The Group specialists are 
engaged in defining the Group level risk profile, which is used 
in deriving the Principal Risks shown on pages 43 to 45 and in 
arriving at the Viability Statement on pages 95 and 96.
In addition to the above, the businesses maintain their own 
risk registers and risk reporting, which are produced by each 
executive team and regularly reviewed by their local Entity ARC. 
The Entity ARCs consider the key risks and any mitigating 
action that can be taken to keep the identified risks within the 
risk appetite of the firm, as well as assessing new emerging 
risks and opportunities.
PRINCIPAL RISKS
The principal risks faced by the Group are summarised in the 
table on pages 43 to 45.
FINANCIAL RISKS
The principal financial risks are also discussed in more detail in 
the Finance Director’s Review on pages 38 and 39.

Underpinning JLT’s governance is a suite of policies, which are 
authored and managed by the relevant Group function, signed 
off by the relevant senior Group executive and accessible to 
employees via the Group’s intranet Policy Portal. There is also 
a revolving mandatory programme of e-learning modules for 
employees to take throughout the year, reinforcing the policy 
messages. Adherence to the Group’s policies is monitored 
by the functions who own them and by Group Internal Audit, 
who refer to them during the course of their audits, which are 
reported to the local Entity ARCs and to the Group ARC.  
In parallel, the Group’s Compliance team provides assurance 
that local regulation is adhered to and that clients' interests  
are at the heart of everything we do.
AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEES
JLT has implemented a consistent governance model across 
the Group, run through local Boards and business level ARCs 
('Entity ARCs'), which are operated as committees of each Board 
and are overseen by them. There are over 20 Entity ARCs, most 
chaired by a Non-Executive Director who, in most instances, is 
also independent of the JLT Group. The relevant management 
team (including its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer and others as required) attend Entity 
ARC meetings to present their view of the risk and compliance 
environments across their businesses. Group Risk & Compliance 
and Group Internal Audit also attend these meetings and provide 
independent reporting and challenge to ensure that there is 
adequate discussion of relevant issues, including key risks and 
mitigating controls.
During 2017, JLT introduced a series of subject matter briefing 
sessions for all Non-Executive Directors across the Group. 
These sessions focused on the General Data Protection 
Regulation (‘GDPR’) and financial controls. 
The following diagram shows the interaction of 3LOD within 
the governance model. The membership, terms of reference 
and key areas of focus of the Group Audit & Risk Committee 
are outlined in the Audit & Risk Committee Report on pages 
67 to 74.    Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 43
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
RISKS NATURE OF RISK MITIGATION
STRATEGIC RISKS
Economic Instability JLT’s business is driven more by economic activity and 
growth than by (re)insurance market rates, since greater 
levels of corporate activity generally drive greater demand 
for the Group’s services. There is a risk that economic 
instability reduces client demand.
• Global business operations diversified across a broad range of 
territories and industry sectors.
• Well funded balance sheet and access to liquidity.
• Annual strategy review at Board and Group Executive Committee.
Strategy & Change 
Management 
Strategy: there are risks to the Company’s strategic plan 
arising from changes in the external environment, such 
as markets (e.g. consolidation), customer behaviour 
(e.g. disintermediation), technology (e.g. disruptive 
technologies) and political developments such as Brexit, 
as well as risks arising from acquisitions, strategic change 
initiatives and the execution of the Company’s strategy.
•  Annual strategy review by the Board and the Group Executive 
Committee.
• Formal three year strategic planning process for every business 
revised annually, which includes consideration of material risks to the 
business plan.
• Acquisition due diligence and risk assessment processes.
• Brexit - Investments made to strengthen operations in Europe to 
reduce potential impact on serving clients and the access to markets 
in the EU.
Change management: JLT is an agile organisation that 
seeks to ensure it maximises opportunities for the benefit 
of clients and other stakeholders, and is well controlled 
and resilient. There is a risk that the appetite of the Group 
for change exceeds its capability and capacity to deliver 
and absorb change(s) effectively.
• Programme governance over strategic change initiatives.
Reputation JLT recognises the strategic importance and value  
of its reputation and takes a wide range of measures to 
protect it. Damage to reputation can potentially occur as 
a result of any principal risk crystallising. 
At a macro level there is a risk of reputational impact 
arising from the conduct of employees and parties we 
work with in the course of our business, falling outside of 
our values, policies and expectations.
• Formal recruitment processes and employee vetting.
• Client & third party due diligence and governance.
• Sanctions/anti money laundering screening.
• Market security due diligence.
• Group Procurement function with supplier screening process.
• Group crisis management team, plan, reputational management plan 
and public relations agency.
OPERATIONS RISKS
Business Interruption Loss of physical site: the Group operates from over 
100 offices in 41 territories across the world, with a 
number of key strategically important sites. There is a 
risk of a business interruption due to a large, 
unexpected incident.
• Dedicated Group Business Continuity Management function that provides 
oversight of plans and solutions, and co-ordinates responses to events.
• Detailed Group Business Continuity policy and procedures for each 
business unit.
• Regular independent review and testing of business continuity plans.
Loss of IT: The Group is reliant on the ability to process 
its transactions on behalf of its clients. Risks arise from 
non-performance or failure of IT, whether in-house or 
from an outsourcing provider/IT supplier, malicious act 
and/or cyber-crime, and internal operational issues.
• Group Procurement function with supplier screening process.
• Formal contracts and service level agreements in place with all 
outsourcing providers or IT suppliers. 
• Dedicated IT Security function.
• Monitoring of compliance with Group IT Security policy and service  
level agreements.
• Regular IT disaster recovery plan testing by each business unit.
PEOPLE RISKS
Loss of Key Staff/ 
Teams
The Group’s principal asset is its people; there is a risk 
that the organisation may not be able to attract and 
retain market leading talent.
• Distinctive entrepreneurial, collaborative and team oriented culture  
and environment.
• Effective staff reward and retention strategies. 
• Effective staff appraisal and development programmes.
• Succession planning processes.
IT RISKS
Information Security 
& Cyber
Intermediaries and pension administrators process and 
retain confidential data in the normal course of business. 
Risks relate to loss of customer records or breach of 
confidentiality due to inadequate security and other  
key controls.
•  Risk based monitoring and reviews performed by Group Information 
Security and Group Internal Audit.
•  Regular reporting to business Audit and Risk Committees. 
•  IT platform security - Data Loss Prevention tools and processes, firewall, 
identity and access management, network access controls, network and 
security event monitoring, penetration testing, and server maintenance.
•  Mobile device encryption; restrictions on USB devices and access to 
personal email.
•  Non-Technical and Technical Group Information Security policies and 
standards and all staff training. 44 STRATEGIC REPORT
RISKS NATURE OF RISK MITIGATION
LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS
Data Privacy Risks arising from non-compliance with or 
misinterpretation of local or international data privacy 
regulation/legislation.
• Group-wide information classification schema. Regular reviews of 
highly confidential data and corresponding controls and protections.
• Group Data Protection policy and training for all staff.
• Data loss prevention tools and processes.
• Mobile device encryption; restrictions on USB device, and access to 
personal email.
• Records Management policy including retention and archiving.
• Technical Group IT Security policies and standards.
• Formal General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
implementation programme.
E&O claims Intermediaries run a risk of incurring a loss if the operating 
procedures in place across the Group in relation to 
market security, placement and claims are not complied 
with or alleged negligence/breach of contract in the 
provision of services/advice becomes apparent.
•  Common operating procedures and compliance policy in each business.
•  Staff training in errors and omissions avoidance.
•  Central and regional risk and compliance monitoring.
•  Strong procedural and systems controls.
•  Quality assurance programmes.
•  Professional indemnity insurance programme.
•  Market security processes, monitoring and Insurer Impairment Plan.
•  A global policy of proportionate liability capping wherever practicable.
Litigation (Non E&O 
litigation)
Litigation risk can arise from a number of different 
sources such as:
•  M&A litigation (e.g. breach of Sale & Purchase 
Agreement);
• breach of employment law; and
•  tortious liability arising from the recruitment of individuals.
•  Dedicated Legal and M&A function with oversight responsibilities.
•  Staff training in HR policies and procedures.
•  Formal recruitment processes based upon HR and legal advice.
Competition/ 
Anti-trust
Engagement in anti-competitive/anti-trust practices could 
result in infringement of competition/anti-trust laws and 
regulations.
•  Group Competition Risk policy. 
•  Staff training and awareness in competition laws and regulations.
Bribery and 
Corruption
Risks relating to the engagement in corrupt practices 
could result in a breach of bribery & corruption legislation 
and regulation.
•  Group Anti-bribery & Corruption policies (including Gift and 
Entertainment and Third Party Payments & Approvals policies).
•  Client & third party due diligence and governance.
•  Staff training and awareness in anti-bribery and corruption laws  
and regulations.
•  Segregation of duties. 
•  Operating Procedures manuals.
•  System and payment controls.
•  Group Financial Crime team oversight.
Regulatory The Group’s footprint brings with it an increasingly 
complex regulatory landscape to be anticipated and 
managed. There is a risk that JLT may fail to take into 
consideration the requirements leading to legal and/or 
regulatory breach.
Risk can also arise from a regulator conducting a review  
of past business activities which causes it to revise 
its view of the product/proposition and could result in 
regulatory sanction, fines and remediation costs.
•  Dedicated first and second line of defence compliance functions.
•  Group Compliance policies and staff training programmes on 
regulatory topics.
•  Regulatory monitoring programmes.
•  Quality Assurance programmes.
Sanctions As a global company supporting international clients, 
brokers run the risk of engaging with sanctioned 
territories and/or individuals/entities which could give  
rise to a breach in sanctions/export control orders.
• Group Sanctions policy.
• Systems screening and sweeping.
• Staff training and awareness on sanctions risk and compliance 
obligations.
• Operating Procedures manuals.
• System controls.
• Group Financial Crime team oversight.    Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 45
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
RISKS NATURE OF RISK MITIGATION
FINANCIAL RISKS 
Liquidity/Financing Risk that the Group is not able to meet its obligations 
when they fall due, or can do so only at excessive cost. 
This risk may occur through: 
•  lack of undrawn credit facilities. 
• inability to obtain financing, including refinancing  
at maturity.
• breach of debt covenants.
• Multiple banking facilities.
• Cash management processes.
• Financial planning and forecasting.
• Group Cash Management policy & process.
Foreign Exchange The Group has foreign exchange exposures to:
•  risk arising from the need to convert currencies into 
GBP for reporting purposes; and
• risk arising from revenues and costs being denominated 
in different currencies.
• Prudent management of transactional currency exposures through a 
structured hedging programme.
• Regular review and sensitivity analysis of currency translation impacts 
to financial reports.
• Centralised hedging of material transactional exposures.
• Reporting and auditing of hedging and exposures.
Counterparty Counterparty risk can arise for JLT from two key sources:
- Banks: risk of loss of own cash, fiduciary funds, 
investments & deposits, derivative assets & trade 
receivables as a result of bank failure.
• Board approved Investment and Counterparty policy to limit the 
concentration of funds and exposure with any one counterparty.
• Defined Cash and Investments policy.
• Active management and monitoring of counterparty limits, financial 
strength and credit profile of key counterparties.
• Regular review by Board and Audit & Risk Committee of counterparty 
limits, ratings, credit default swap spread rates, utilisation levels and 
compliance with applicable regulation.
- (Re)Insurers: JLT owes a duty of care to place clients' 
business with security, which may reasonably be 
regarded as being sufficiently sound financially to meet 
potential claims as they may fall due. In the event of 
insurer impairment, this could result in client detriment 
and damage to the broker/client relationship(s). Also, in 
the event of JLT having been adjudicated not to have 
exercised reasonable endeavours to mitigate this risk, it 
could result in an E&O claim.
• Market security due diligence.
• Group Market Security team.
• Insurer Impairment Plan.
Defined Benefit 
Scheme liabilities
Risk of adverse financial impact as a consequence of 
increase in the Defined Benefit Pension Scheme deficit.
• Appropriate scheme investment strategy and diversification.
• Triennial actuarial valuations and regular trustee funding updates.
• Agreed deficit funding plan.
• Regular review of long term de-risking strategy.
• Regular scheme membership data verification.
• Effective independent trustee governance.
• Regular review of employer covenant.
• Regular monitoring and reporting of scheme asset performance and 
liability positions.
Interest Rate Risk of volatility of earnings and cash flows arising  
from exposure to movements in interest rates. This may 
also impact the Defined Benefit Pension Scheme assets 
and liabilities.
• Group Treasury management of cash balances.
• Interest rate hedging programme.
• Financial planning and forecasting.
Financial Reporting The risk of inaccurate accounting and reporting, internally 
and externally.
• Group Accounting policy.
• Attestation process for financial reporting.
• Financial reporting policy and procedures.
• Internal and external audit of financial controls and reports.
Fraud Risks relating to the theft or misuse of JLT and 
client monies.
• Group Treasury policy, procedures & controls.
• IT system access management and restrictions.
• Segregation of duties.
• Segregation of client and company funds.
• Whistleblowing policy and hotline.
• Financial Crime team. 46 STRATEGIC REPORT
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
We see it as essential to act in the interests of all our stakeholders – in particular our clients,  
our colleagues, our shareholders and our trading partners – in order to build a sustainable, long term 
business; one that balances risk with opportunity and that makes a positive contribution to the  
communities in which we live and work. 
We also recognise that one of the key duties which our Directors have under the Companies Act 2006  
(the Act) is to promote the success of JLT for the benefit of its shareholders, whilst having regard to the 
interests of the Company's broad range of other stakeholders and wider social responsibilities. In this 
section we review the activities of the Group over the past year in terms of how we have sought to  
fulfil our environmental, social and governance responsibilities. 
MANAGEMENT OF CORPORATE 
RESPONSIBILITY
Our approach to Corporate Responsibility (CR) has a strong 
focus on the interests of our clients. Our clients increasingly 
seek evidence that their service providers are well governed, 
and that we make a sustainable, positive contribution to solving 
the challenges that face our communities, our society and 
the environment. It is therefore integral to our success that 
JLT demonstrates high standards of CR – not only delivering 
the best commercial outcomes for our clients, but also taking 
every opportunity to do so in the most socially responsible and 
sustainable way.
At JLT our functional teams - including HR, Property Services, 
Procurement, Finance, Risk and Marketing – have a strong 
focus on delivering CR-related projects. Each of our businesses 
across the Group is also closely involved and colleagues around 
the world regularly volunteer for a wide range of activities.  
The Group's CR strategy and activities are coordinated by  
the CR Steering Group, which has Board, Group Executive 
Committee and senior management membership. 
Our CR Steering Group actively pursues the achievement  
of higher standards in both our socially responsible behaviours 
and our capacity to measure and benchmark those behaviours 
for our stakeholders. 
This Steering Group includes senior representation for each of 
JLT’s main operating companies, worldwide. These designated 
representatives are responsible for driving CR activity at a local 
level and liaise closely with the Steering Group. The Group's 
approach to charitable giving is coordinated by the Group 
Charities Committee.
We are constituents of the FTSE4Good index.  
FTSE4Good evaluates companies’ performance in the areas 
of Environmental, Social and Governance responsibility. 
Our continued presence in the index reflects our ongoing 
commitment to corporate responsibility.

  Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 47
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
We recognise that climate change and the scarcity of natural resources will pose an increasingly 
significant challenge to society over time. We believe that JLT has a social responsibility to minimise  
our environmental impact as far as possible. We therefore seek to take commercially sustainable 
measures to manage our environmental impact, including how we manage our property portfolio.  
For example, our preference is always to use energy-efficient lighting technologies where we can,  
and to take measures to use water efficiently.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In line with Mandatory Carbon Reporting (MCR) requirements 
within the Companies Act 2006, this report outlines  
JLT's Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions covering the  
2017 financial year.
The scope of JLT's reporting encompasses its operational 
boundary and includes emissions associated with all of 
JLT's offices worldwide. JLT has reported on the mandatory 
scopes 1 and 2, and for the optional scope 3 has opted to 
include global business travel (given that air travel in particular 
is acknowledged as a large contributor to greenhouse gas 
emissions) and non-purchased electricity where available.
JLT's total GHG emissions for 2017 were 20,244 tCO
2
e.  
The largest proportion of JLT's GHG emissions can be 
accounted for by air travel which comprises 62% of the total 
emissions, equating to 12,566 CO
2
e.
In order to demonstrate JLT's emissions in relation to a 
quantifiable factor relating to its business activities, JLT has 
calculated its intensity ratio on the basis of the number  
of JLT employees, as this is considered to relate to Company  
growth and GHG emissions. The intensity ratio for 2017  
is 1.82 tCO
2
e/employee.

*What is tCO
2
e?
It is standard practice to report GHG emissions in tonnes of CO
2
 equivalents (tCO
2
e). This is a universal unit of measurement used to indicate the global warming potential of the GHG in relation 
to the global warming potential of one unit of carbon dioxide. The seven main greenhouse gases that are converted into tCO
2
e are Carbon dioxide (CO
2
), Methane (CH
4
), Hydrofluorocarbons

METHODOLOGY
The methodology employed to calculate the GHG emissions is 
in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Reporting and 
Accounting Standard (revised edition). Data has been collated 
from JLT's global offices for electricity, fuels, refrigerants and 
transport directly purchased or controlled by JLT, in line with the 
mandatory scopes 1 and 2. 
With regard to the optional scope 3, JLT has included within 
its report emissions relating to air travel by its employees for 
business use, as this is recognised as a significant contributor 
to carbon emissions. JLT has also reported on non-purchased 
electricity usage (i.e. used by JLT but purchased by the 
landlord) for countries that have this data available and for 
the UK only, rail travel and waste data. The relevant UK or 
international emissions factors have been applied.
There were some limitations to the reporting due to gaps in 
data, and where necessary every reasonable effort has been 
made to fill these and estimate data as accurately as possible. 
For air travel, some countries were excluded as this data is not 
available for this reporting period. JLT will be working with its 
global offices to further improve data availability for the 2018 
reporting period.
YEAR-ON-YEAR REVIEW
The total emissions associated with JLT’s operations have 
increased. The intensity ratio of emissions per employee has 
increased by 0.08 tCO
2
e/employee. The number of employees 
has decreased slightly. There has been a wider data set 
included this year, for instance more countries able to report on 
non-purchased electricity and the inclusion of waste data.
The wider data set, alongside an increase in air travel emissions, 
has meant that the scope 3 emissions have increased whereas 
both scopes 1 and 2 have decreased.
JLT's focus on reducing its environmental impact extends 
beyond reporting on its emissions. For JLT's London head 
office there is now an environmental management system in 
place, which is committed to reducing the impact of its activities 
and promoting good environmental practice. 
RECYCLING
We actively promote recycling and encourage the removal of 
general waste bins and the provision of sorting bins and facilities 
in our offices. This initiative has been particularly successful in 
our London headquarters and in our Mumbai operations, which 
between them represent more than 35% of our JLT colleagues.

In London, the Corporation of London’s 
Clean City Awards scheme has awarded 
our London headquarters, The St Botolph 
Building, a Gold rating for its “zero to landfill” 
approach to waste management.
TRAVEL
In 2017, JLT introduced a new global Travel & Entertainment 
Policy. This policy establishes, as a minimum, standardisation 
of JLT’s approach to travel, consolidation of travel data and 
improvement in traveller tracking. The policy builds on our 
commitment to reduce all travel, particularly for internal staff 
meetings, national or international, and we continue to extend  
our teleconferencing facilities in JLT offices globally.
Where there is an identified need to travel, we are actively 
promoting the benefits of combining trips and taking advantage 
of multi-sector air tickets, thus reducing our carbon footprint.
We also continue to monitor our air travel usage as part of our 
statutory GHG reporting responsibilities.
We are fully aware of our corporate responsibility with regards 
to the regulations associated with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 
which our hotel selection procedure recognises.
PAPER CONSUMPTION
We recognise both a cost benefit and an environmental benefit 
in limiting our consumption of paper, and seek to manage our 
consumption of paper with the environment in mind. To that end 
we uphold the following principles: 
• to use print suppliers whose sustainability programme 
employs the replanting of crop. 
• to set laser printer defaults to two-sided printing. Adopted 
in JLT Group IT policy, this requirement is reducing paper 
consumption and waste; and
• to circulate documents (e.g. meeting agenda and papers) 
in a format that avoids the need for printing. The Group 
employs cloud-based software systems to distribute board 
and committee papers electronically, saving on paper as 
well as reducing overheads associated with distribution.   50 STRATEGIC REPORT

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Our colleagues across the world are active and enthusiastic contributors to community life. They take 
real pride in exercising their personal responsibility to make a positive contribution to the environment and 
to the communities in which they live and work. We believe community engagement makes a positive 
difference to our team spirit and ultimately to the quality of the work our teams can deliver for clients.  
JLT supports and encourages colleagues' initiatives – this can include time off work to take part  
in volunteering activities and matched-funding to support charitable fund-raising.

CHARITY
To maximise the impact we can have, we focus on 3 strategic 
partners aligned to our own areas of business; sharing the 
social benefits of knowledge (Specialty), wellbeing (Employee 
Benefits) and resilience (Reinsurance). 
Our current partners on these strategic themes are: Udaan 
Foundation (knowledge), Alzheimer's Society (wellbeing) and 
RedR (resilience). We manage the majority of our charitable 
giving business-by-business, with a central fund to provide 
greater support to our strategic partners.
Charitable Donations
Our focus on inclusion is global, and tailored to meet the needs 
of our individual businesses and geographies, as well as the 
needs of the businesses they serve. 
Having established our Diversity Committee in 2015, we defined 
JLT’s Diversity agenda on the basis of three pillars - Networking, 
Sponsorship and Involvement, each of which has inclusion at 
its core. In 2017 JLT supported many initiatives, both internally 
and in public events in the London Market and other insurance 
hubs, to help to drive a more diverse and inclusive business and 
to play our part in solving these challenges in our industry.
Across 2018, our efforts will be focused around building 
inclusion, in particular, ensuring that we continue to reinforce 
the need for inclusive working practices, and an awareness of 
innate biases, through all of the employee life cycle. 
Following a review of our career management processes, 
strategic impact has been defined with greater precision. 
As a result, the in-scope population in determining the 
make-up of JLT's senior management has reduced in number. 
A restatement of the figures previously reported for 2016 
on this basis results in 76% of the senior management 
population being male and 24% being female. The 2017 
position is as follows:
We regularly engage clients in joint fundraising activities  
and see this as an important part of client relationship building. 
Perhaps the most longstanding example is JLT’s annual golf 
day in aid of Sydney’s Westmead Hospital, which to date has  
raised more than AUD 1.8 million for the Children’s Cystic 
Fibrosis clinic.
We actively manage the risk that charitable payments may  
be misused as inducements, with training and monitoring in 
place as part of our bribery and corruption controls framework.
DIVERSITY & INCLUSION
At JLT we strive to provide an inclusive working environment 
that encourages everyone to fulfil their potential. We believe 
an inclusive culture encourages diversity, which in turn leads 
to better business decisions and better solutions for clients, 
drawing on a wide range of experience. We aim to recruit the 
most talented and ambitious people, irrespective of differences 
in education, religion, nationality, race, gender, age, physical 
ability, social background or sexual orientation.

Networking
In 2017, Women@JLT launched in Australia. The inaugural 
event was held in Sydney and focused on the challenges 
faced by women in their careers. In the UK, JLT continued its 
membership of the City Women’s Network. Additionally,  
JLT colleagues across the UK participated in the Independent 
Women In Insurance (iWIN) network and the Gender Inclusion 
Network for Insurance. Collaboration with others in the 
insurance industry included the second joint leadership event 
with Hiscox in London on career challenges. JLT also hosted its 
second private dinner for the London Insurance Supper Club, 
a network of senior women within our sector, on the subject of 
wellness at work. 
Sponsorship
Our sponsorship of Lloyd’s 'Dive In' festival (Diversity and 
Inclusion in Insurance) continued for a third year. A breakfast 
event for millennials was hosted in JLT’s offices in Sydney, 
Australia, while in Singapore JLT co-sponsored the Dive In.  
JLT was a silver sponsor of the 'Dive In' festival in EMEA and 
hosted a follow up event later in the year in London on the use  
of language at work.
In Hong Kong, JLT is sponsoring a project in conjunction 
with the Hong Kong Council on Social Services on the 
empowerment of women. 
Involvement 
JLT supports the Chartered Insurance Institute’s involvement in 
the HeForShe campaign which aims to achieve gender parity. 
This support was re-confirmed with senior leaders publicly 
making their HeForShe pledges. We recognise that making 
diversity part of our DNA demands an inclusive environment.  
Our training and development in this area continues to be 
enhanced with inclusive leadership being a critical part of all  
our leadership and management development programmes.   
It is also integrated into our Performance Management training.  
We are making the way we recruit more deliberately inclusive, 
and enhancing our ability to track and manage our performance 
on a range of relevant metrics.  
HEALTH & WELLBEING
As a major global provider of Employee Benefits services to 
our clients' employees, we have a natural insight into the health 
and welfare responsibilities of employers, especially through the 
occupational rehabilitation services we deliver on behalf of our 
clients in various territories. 
We offer a range of standard and discretionary health benefits 
to our employees in most territories, alongside support for 
healthy lifestyles. 
The ‘Wellbeing’ theme in our internal CR programme includes 
a range of activities with third parties, for example the Mindset 
charity in Hong Kong and Singapore, working with Jardine 
Matheson. Globally, across 2018, we will be bringing greater 
focus to mental health in the workplace including expanding the 
use of accessible resources for employees, and establishing 
stress management workshops for managers to recognise the 
early signs of mental health issues. 
LABOUR STANDARDS
As a specialist professional services firm, our exposure to the 
risk of low labour standards is not significant. We are opposed 
to forced labour or child labour. Our Employee Handbooks 
specify clear standards for acceptable working practices.  
We apply due diligence in our procurement policy and processes 
to ensure that we work with appropriate sub-contractors. 
In addition, our Employee Benefits business frequently helps 
clients to improve their own capabilities in the area of employee 
wellbeing through helping to minimise risks and deliver 
healthcare and rehabilitation support services, contributing to 
enhanced labour standards in the markets we serve. 
HUMAN RIGHTS & MODERN SLAVERY
As an employer in both the developing and developed worlds 
and with clients who have diverse businesses in some of the 
most remote and poor, as well as the most affluent, corners of 
the world, we recognise and support the need to work together 
to ensure that principles of respect, fairness and integrity remain 
at the heart of how we run our business. 
We respect and uphold the human rights and principles set out 
in detail in:
• The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and
• The International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work
We have a zero tolerance for modern slavery and human 
trafficking in our organisation and in our supply chain.  
Our supply chains include providers of professional services,  
IT services and equipment, office facilities services, recruitment 
and training, advertising and marketing, and business 
operations and infrastructure support.
As a service based insurance broking and employee benefits 
business we believe the risk of modern slavery and/or human 
trafficking in or business and supply chain is low.
We have a Code of Ethical Conduct. This sets the standards we 
expect from both our own people and those of our partners.
We are committed to improving our supply chain vetting and 
due diligence. In the UK we carry out an annual risk assessment 
with our supply partners to ensure that compliance to our 
standards remain in place.
In 2016 we increased our scrutiny of our UK supply chain in 
respect of the specific abuse of human rights that is human 
trafficking, in recognition of both the spirit and letter of the UK’s 
Modern Slavery Act. 52 STRATEGIC REPORT
In 2017, we made further progress in improving our supply 
chain vetting and due diligence for our operations outside of  
the UK. This is an ongoing process.
In addition, in 2018 we will be launching a training and 
awareness programme to appropriate members of staff to 
ensure a high level of understanding of the risk of modern 
slavery and human trafficking within the business.
In accordance with the Act, we publish on our website an 
annual statement detailing our commitments and the progress 
we are making towards assuring that our supply chain conforms 
to the principles we uphold. 
SOCIAL BUSINESS & PRO BONO WORK
We are increasingly looking for opportunities to apply our 
professional expertise to support the communities in which 
we operate. Our Local Community Insurance Services (LCIS) 
team in JLT Australia, for example, delivers low cost access 
to insurance services for small not-for-profit organisations and 
clubs who might otherwise face insurmountable obstacles to 
hosting events or accepting volunteers.
At the same time, we are sometimes able to offer our  
specialist expertise on a pro bono basis for good causes,  
which we are pleased to do whenever our expert advisers  
have the capacity.
An example of this is where the fund managers at The Future 
Generation Investment Company and the Future Generation 
Global Investment Fund waive all management and performance 
fees, enabling 1% of assets to be donated to young Australians 
affected by mental illness every year. As their risk partner,  
we're honoured to provide broking services on a pro bono 
basis, supporting their innovative venture and the millions of 
dollars they raise.

REDR UK
On 1 March 2017, JLT in London hosted an annual drinks event 
for patrons of RedR, the disaster relief experts and our 'resilience' 
charity partner. The event was led by the Princess Royal, HRH 
Princess Anne, who is President of the charity, and was attended 
by 120 patrons and friends of the charity, including many of our 
contacts in the Construction and Energy sectors.
UDAAN SCHOOL
JLT partners with the Udaan India Foundation which is close to 
its office in Mumbai, a not-for-profit organisation working with 
children from low-income communities in the field of education. 
The primary aim is to ensure that every school child is gaining a 
strong and holistic educational foundation to become a responsible, 
compassionate and confident citizen of tomorrow.
MINDSET CHALLENGE, HONG KONG 
The annual 'Walk Up Jardine House' is one of Jardine Matheson 
Group’s most notable philanthropic initiatives in Hong Kong and 
has been taking place since 1985. In March 2017, five of JLT Hong 
Kong's colleagues ran up 49 floors, covering 947 steps in just over 
five minutes contributing to the HK$40 million raised for charity.
ALZHEIMER'S SOCIETY
JLT Specialty is proud to be partnering with the Alzheimer’s Society 
in 2017 and 2018 with a campaign to raise £150,000 to assist them 
with their vital work in combating dementia. Through the hard work 
of all concerned they were able to present a cheque to the charity 
for the sum of £80,000 at the end of 2017.
THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL AT WESTMEAD
JLT Australia's annual golf day in aid of The Children's Hospital at 
Westmead, Sydney, is one of our longest standing charity partnerships. 
Over 14 years it has raised more than AUD 1.8 million. These funds 
have annually sponsored a young paediatric doctor, the JLT Medical 
Fellow, to undergo Specialist training in Cystic Fibrosis. T wo of these 
doctors are now world-leading researchers in Cystic Fibrosis.
BRAZIL
In 2017, JLT Brazil colleagues dedicated time to bring a smile to 
more than 800 children in deprived areas of São Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro, on Easter, Children’s day, and Christmas, also developing  
a warm clothing campaign. Our colleagues donated more than  
400 toys to help Santa deliver Christmas gifts to the children.  
MAKING A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION
Our colleagues across the world are active and enthusiastic contributors to community life. They take 
real pride in exercising their personal responsibility to make a positive contribution to the communities 
in which they live and work. 54 STRATEGIC REPORT
GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY
As a financial services group with operations across the world, JLT’s governance capability is highly 
developed. We hold each other to high standards of integrity – our culture is committed to transparency 
and fairness to the client, and the rigorous pursuit of their best interests. This section highlights topics 
of particular relevance to Corporate Responsibility benchmarks. For a fuller account, refer to the Risk 
Management section on pages 41 to 45 and the Corporate Governance Report on pages 57 to 66. 
RISK MANAGEMENT
As a global company, JLT faces a range of risks, each of 
which has the potential to negatively impact the delivery of our 
strategic business objectives, outcomes for clients and our 
reputation. These risks can also provide opportunities in the 
right circumstances. Taking risk in a disciplined and considered 
way is essential to our growth and continued success. It allows 
us to maximise the positive impact that our business can have 
on society and communities, and minimise the downside risk. 
JLT’s risk management arrangements enable us to:
• understand the risks we face;
•  manage risk in an intelligent, conscious, disciplined, agile 
and balanced way;
• enhance performance and maximise opportunities; and
• operate with rigour to:
 - protect our key stakeholders, our reputation and  
our results from events that could have been 
reasonably foreseen;
 - provide our clients and other key stakeholders with 
confidence that we are a sustainable and resilient 
business that is able to service their needs when they 
need us; and
 - comply with applicable regulations, laws and corporate 
governance obligations.
The Group operates a '3 lines of defence' governance model. 
The first line (the business) is responsible for the identification and 
management of all the risks inherent in its operations; the second 
line (Group Risk & Compliance) provides policy, advice, guidance 
and challenge to the business; and the third line (Group Internal 
Audit) independently assesses and reports on the effectiveness  
of governance, risk management and internal controls. 
The Group operates an enterprise-wide risk management 
framework, which is based around recognised standards and 
good practice including the Institute of Risk Management and 
ISO 31000, and which is tailored to align with JLT's role as a 
(re)insurance broker and employee benefits solutions provider. 
The framework is periodically reviewed to ensure that it remains 
appropriate, and in keeping with the nature and scale of the 
Company and the environment within which we trade. 
For more detail on the principal risks we track and the 
governance structure we apply to maintain rigorous risk 
management, see pages 41 to 45.
BRIBERY & CORRUPTION  
We are committed to actively contributing towards the international 
efforts to eradicate all forms of financial crime. Limiting our 
exposure to financial crime is an integral part of JLT's activities and 
helps us maintain our reputation. As a global business listed on 
the London Stock Exchange, JLT is subject to the UK Bribery Act 
(2010) which requires us to have adequate procedures to prevent 
bribery and corrupt action by those working for JLT or on its behalf. 
Anti-bribery and corruption is also a key feature of global regulatory 
regimes that JLT complies with. JLT’s policies and procedures 
are based around external good practice and use leading 
worldwide corruption data such as that provided by Transparency 
International. We actively guard against bribery and corruption by:
• Maintaining Anti Bribery & Corruption (‘ABC’) policies –   
we have an overarching ABC policy which is underpinned by 
a number of specific policies including Gifts & Entertainment, 
Third Party Payments & Approvals and Conflicts of Interest 
policies. These provide clarity to staff on our commitment, 
legal and regulatory obligations (both corporate and personal) 
and the requirements we have as a Group to minimise the risk 
of bribery and corruption, including reporting any actual or 
suspected instances of bribery and corruption. These policies 
are maintained and set out within our Employee Handbook  
and are accessible on our company intranet;
• Training – our set goal is to train every employee from 
director to broker to support functions globally so not only  
can they recognise and prevent the use of JLT in the 
furtherance of bribery and corruption, but they can anticipate 
where to look. Training includes global e-learning modules in 
eight languages, and is supplemented by face to face training 
and briefings for higher risk jurisdictions;
• Vigilance – all staff are reminded of their legal obligations in 
relation to reporting suspicious activity or transactions and JLT 
provides communication channels to enable employees to 
discuss and report any suspicion of bribery and corruption.  
JLT also has a whistleblowing policy as described on page 55;
• Investigation – JLT will investigate any instance of alleged 
bribery and corruption as well as assisting the police and 
other appropriate authorities in any resultant investigation  
and prosecution; and
• Financial Crime Team – this JLT team supports the active 
reduction of bribery and corruption risk by managing and 
providing oversight of the Group's ABC policies, and providing 
tools, training and specialist expertise including investigation.  
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
  Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 55
WHISTLEBLOWING
JLT has a global whistleblowing policy and 24 hour hotline 
provided by a specialist external firm. This provides an 
alternative channel for those colleagues who might feel unable 
to report wrongdoing, or suspicions of wrongdoing, through 
their normal line management channels. The hotline allows 
employees across the world to report issues or concerns 
online or by phone in a range of languages and with complete 
confidence and without fear of dismissal or retaliation. 
The whistleblowing policy is actively communicated during 
the year and managers are required to ensure that their teams 
understand the purpose of the policy, how concerns can be 
raised, and the protections afforded to employees. Any reports 
of incidents, events or concerns made under this policy are 
investigated and resolved confidentially. JLT’s policy and 
systems conform with the differing regulatory requirements of 
all the countries in which we operate, and gives colleagues the 
option of anonymity or complete confidentiality wherever this is 
permitted by law. The Group's whistleblowing arrangements are 
monitored and reviewed by the Group Audit & Risk Committee.
TAX TRANSPARENCY
The Group’s updated tax principles, which comply with section 
16(2), schedule 19 of the Finance Act 2016, are published 
on the Group’s website jlt.com. We believe these principles 
are based on good corporate practice in the area of tax 
management and tax transparency, balancing the interests of 
our stakeholders. We will continue to revise and strengthen 
these principles as necessary, in response to the needs and 
expectations of our stakeholders. 
The Strategic Report is signed for and on behalf of the Board.

INTRODUCTION FROM 
THE CHAIRMAN 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to introduce the Company’s Corporate 
Governance Report for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017. 
We continue to believe that how the 
Group does business is as important as 
what it does, and recognise the need for a 
strong corporate governance framework 
and supporting processes across the 
Group. Good governance, with high 
standards set from the top, is a key 
factor in delivering sustainable business 
performance and creating continued value 
for the Group’s shareholders.
In the following pages you will find details 
of how JLT approaches governance, 
including the operation of the Board 
and its Committees and an explanation 
of how we comply with the 2016 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code). 
You will also find a summary of the key 
outputs from the latest review of the 
Board's effectiveness - the results of 
which were very positive - and Reports 
from each of the Board's Committees.
We recognise the importance of 
effective corporate governance 
throughout the Group and of having 
robust governance structures and 
processes in all our businesses. 
Each of the Group’s businesses is 
governed by a board of directors and, on 
an individual business or regional basis, 
an audit and risk committee, further 
details of which can be found in the Risk 
Management Report on page 41.
BOARD COMPOSITION
During 2017, a number of changes were 
made to the membership of the Board 
and its Committees. Two Directors retired 
from the Board during the year: Bruce 
Carnegie-Brown retired in June, following 
his appointment as the Chairman 
of Lloyd’s of London, and Jonathan 
Dawson retired in October. I should 
like to express the Board’s thanks to 
Bruce and Jonathan for their respective 
contributions to the Board. 
Andrew Didham and Richard Meddings 
both joined the Board on 2 October 
2017. Richard has become Chair of 
the Remuneration Committee and 
Andrew has become Chair of the Audit 
& Risk Committee. Annette Court has 
succeeded Jonathan Dawson as the 
Company’s Senior Independent Director. 
We are also pleased to welcome  
Lynne Peacock, who will join the Board  
as a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 1 May 2018.
CODE COMPLIANCE
We remain committed to the principles 
of good corporate governance 
established by the Code. We confirm 
that the Company applied the main 
principles and complied with the 
relevant provisions of the Code during 
2017, with the exception of provisions 
B.1.2, B.2.1, C.3.1 and D.2.1 relating 
to the composition of the Board and 
its Committees. This was primarily due 
to the roles of two Jardine Matheson-
appointed Directors on the Board. 
The Board strongly believes that the 
continuation of these arrangements is 
in the Company's best interests. This is 
explained further in the Directors’ Report 
on pages 91 to 98, which provides an 
overview of the Company’s compliance 
with the Code and an explanation for the 
areas of non-compliance.
I should like to thank the Directors for 
their support throughout the year.

STRUCTURE AT A GLANCE
The structure below sets out the composition of the Board and its Committees as at 31 December 2017: 
GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 
The Board and its Committees operate within a wider 
governance framework. This ensures that decisions are  
taken at the right level in the business by the people best  
placed to take them. Our framework is designed to maintain 
high standards of governance.
The work of the Board is supported by the Audit & Risk, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees. The roles and 
activities of the Committees are described in more detail in the 
Reports of the respective Committees on pages 67 to 90.  
Terms of reference for each of the Committees, which are 
reviewed regularly, can be found on the Company's website,  
jlt.com. 
The Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the 
Group, development of the Group's strategic direction (for 
consideration and approval by the Board) and implementation 
of the agreed strategy to the Group Chief Executive, Dominic 
Burke. The Group Executive Committee operates to support 
the Group Chief Executive in the running of the Group and 
comprehensive Group Delegated Authorities govern the taking 
of all significant decisions and the provision of approval for a 
broad range of matters. Further details of the composition of the 
Group Executive Committee can be found on page 26.
In addition, the Group has a Disclosure Committee which 
oversees the Company’s compliance with the Group’s 
disclosure obligations. The Disclosure Committee is not a 
Committee of the Board, but reports to the Board or to the 
Group Audit & Risk Committee as appropriate. The Committee 
is chaired by Charles Rozes, Group Finance Director.
The Board is collectively responsible for approving and 
overseeing the implementation of the Group’s strategy to  
create and deliver long term value for our shareholders in  
a way that is supported by the right culture, values and 
behaviours across the Group.
The Board is also responsible for reviewing the performance 
of management; ensuring that appropriate systems of internal 
controls and risk management are in place; and that the provision 
of the right resources are in place throughout the Group.
The Board has established a schedule of reserved matters 
which include the aforementioned areas of responsibility, as 
well as a range of other areas, including the approval of financial 
results announcements, the Annual Report and Accounts and 
shareholder circulars; decisions relating to the Group’s capital 
structure; approval of dividend recommendations; and the 
approval of material acquisitions and disposals.

who is also available to each Board member for consultation

The Group maintains Directors' and Officers' Insurance cover

to ensure that its scope remains appropriate. 
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
Under the Companies Act 2006, all Directors have a duty to 
avoid conflicts of interest and disclose any interests and outside

Register. On appointment, new Directors are advised of the

BOARD DIVERSITY
The Board supports the Code's recommendation that diversity 
and gender should be considered when making Director 
appointments. The Board seeks to ensure that it has the right 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
to enable it to achieve its objectives and discharge its 
responsibilities and duties effectively. The Board's policy is to 
select the best candidate irrespective of background. 
The Company has taken, and continues to take, steps to 
promote diversity and inclusion, including gender diversity,  
both at senior management level and in the boardroom.  
During the year the business has continued to progress its 
diversity programme. Further information is available in the 
Nominations Committee Report on page 75 and the Corporate 
Responsibility Report on pages 50 and 51.
* Taking into account all relevant factors set out in the Code, the independence of the Non-Executive Directors has been assessed as indicated. Lynne Peacock will join the Board as an 
additional Independent Non-Executive Director on 1 May 2018.

SUCCESSION PLANNING 
Succession planning and talent development has been an 
important focus for the Board and its Committees in the year. 
Substantial progress has been made in promoting talent across 
the Group and the Board is confident that there is a strong 
senior management succession pipeline.
During the year management worked with external consultants 
to carry out a review of the leadership capability and potential 
of a cohort of nearly 40 of JLT’s senior managers. The review 
focused on the capability of the cohort as leaders within JLT, 
using the Group’s five pillar leadership model, measuring their 
leadership potential using a number of external tools and 
against a large group of executives in other businesses. The 
exercise was seen as important in assessing the strength of 
JLT’s leadership team and how well positioned it was to drive 
JLT forward. The results of the review indicated that JLT’s 
cohort had strong leadership in core areas and an appropriate 
succession pipeline. Training and development plans, with 
appropriate coaching and mentoring, are being tailored to help 
individuals meet their individual development needs.
The Group operates a range of programmes focused on 
the development of future leaders, including its International 
Senior Managers Programme (ISMP) and its Emerging Leaders 
Programme. More details on the ISMP can be found on page 7.
During the year the Nominations Committee discussed 
succession planning for the Group Chief Executive and the 
Group Chairman. 
The work of the Nominations Committee in respect of 
succession planning is described in greater detail in the 
Nominations Committee Report on pages 75 and 77. 
BOARD MEETINGS 
A forward agenda for the Board is maintained to ensure that  
all necessary and appropriate matters are covered during the 
year and to allow sufficient time for discussion and debate.  
The Board receives papers and presentations from the 
Executive Directors and senior managers are regularly invited to 
attend to provide further detailed insight on specific matters.  64 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

DIRECTORS’ INDUCTION AND DIRECTORS’ 
TRAINING 
An induction programme is provided to new Directors which 
is tailored to their roles on the Board and its Committees. 
The programme is designed to provide new Non-Executive 
Directors with an understanding of the Group, its business and 
the markets in which it operates. It also provides a briefing on 
Directors’ responsibilities and the governance framework within 
which the Board operates. The programme provides Directors 
with the opportunity to meet and establish relationships with key 
people in the business as well as the Group’s key advisers. 
A tailored induction programme was agreed for the new 
Directors, Andrew Didham and Richard Meddings, who joined 
the Board during the year. The programme was facilitated by 
the Chairman and the Group Company Secretary. It involved 
in-depth introductory meetings with a range of key people, 
including the Executive Directors, the members of the GEC 
and other function heads, including the Group Head of Internal 
Audit; the Group Head of Risk and Compliance; the Group 
Treasurer; the Group Human Resources Director; and the 
Group Company Secretary. Meetings were also arranged with 
the Group’s auditor, corporate brokers and public relations/
media advisers.
The programme of meetings was supported by the provision 
of a range of background information about JLT and its 
business, the Board and general guidance on the duties and 
responsibilities of a listed company director.
Members of the Board and its Committees are provided with 
regular training in order to keep them abreast of industry and 
legal and regulatory developments, facilitated by professional 
advisers where appropriate. During the year Directors were 
provided with briefings on new accounting developments, 
including the introduction of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9; data 
protection issues, including the implementation of the General 
Data Protection Regulation; the actions being taken by the 
Group to manage cyber risks; and governance developments, 
including the governance green papers issued by the UK 
government and the consultation launched by the FRC on a 
replacement for the Code. 
Directors are encouraged to visit different parts of the business 
on a regular basis in order to enhance their understanding of 
those businesses and the key issues they face. 
INFORMATION 
The Board and its Committees receive briefing papers and 
information prior to meetings to ensure Directors are fully briefed 
on the matters for discussion. 
Directors also have access to the Group Company Secretary 
and senior management should they wish to receive additional 
information on any of the items for discussion. 
BOARD PERFORMANCE REVIEW 
The Board’s performance is reviewed annually. Following an 
externally led review of the Board and its Committees in 2016, 
an internally facilitated review was conducted in 2017.  
The results of the review were generally very positive, and the 
Board was seen as functioning well and covering the right 
ground. Discussions were considered to be of a high quality 
and there was felt to be open and constructive debate pitched 
at the right level, with effective challenge where appropriate. 
The Board was seen as being particularly effective at managing 
performance and risk, as well as investment appraisal, and had 
a clear approach to strategy.
A number of recommendations were made as to how to 
increase the effectiveness of the Board further, including 
reviewing the breadth of skills and experience on the Board 
in the context of its future needs; reviewing the pipeline of 
top talent in the business; and adopting improvements to 
Board processes. The Chairman also met with each individual 
Director to discuss performance as well as any training and 
development needs. 
The Senior Independent Director, Annette Court, led a review of 
the performance of the Chairman, the results of which were very 
positive, and concluded that he continues to provide effective 
leadership to the Board.
Following these processes, the Board remains satisfied that,  
in line with the Code, all the Directors have sufficient time to 
carry out their responsibilities as Directors effectively. 
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group's systems  
of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness.  
The implementation and maintenance of the risk management 
and internal control systems are the responsibility of the 
Executive Directors and senior management. 
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of any significant risks the Group is willing to take in order to 
achieve its strategic objectives, as well as for maintaining sound 
risk management and internal control systems to ensure that  
an appropriate culture is embedded throughout the Group.  
Owing to the limitation inherent in any system of internal control, 
this system provides robust, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group’s risk management and internal control systems 
comprise Group policies, procedures and practices covering 
a range of areas, including the appropriate authorisation and 
approval of transactions, the application of financial reporting 
standards and the review of financial performance and 
significant judgements.  66 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board monitors the effectiveness of the Group’s systems  
of internal control carefully throughout the year and carries out 
an annual review covering their adequacy and effectiveness. 
The Board has delegated part of this responsibility to the  
Audit & Risk Committee. The role and work of the Audit & Risk 
Committee in this regard and the role of the Group’s Internal 
Audit function are described in the Audit & Risk Committee 
Report on pages 67 to 74.
CULTURE AND ETHICS
The Board recognises the importance of demonstrating its full 
support for ethical conduct and leadership. During the year, 
the Board considered the subject of culture and ethics in the 
context of JLT's style, tone and organisation. The Board has  
a strong focus on ensuring that there is a continuing open  
and straightforward culture of integrity and honesty across  
the Group, and that the behaviour of employees ensures  
that the Group is compliant with applicable legal and  
regulatory requirements.
The Board takes the views of its staff seriously and regularly 
provides an opportunity to provide feedback. In 2017,  
the Board considered the results of an employee engagement 
survey, which emphasised that JLT’s culture of collaboration, 
inventiveness, agility and client centricity was seen as  
remaining strong. 
During the year the Company refreshed and reissued its 
Employee Handbook, which emphasises the importance of 
JLT’s culture of compliance. In addition, employees are required 
to undertake regular training courses, including online training, 
covering a range of ethical, legal and regulatory issues, such 
as the prevention of bribery and corruption, sanctions, data 
security and market abuse.
JLT has published its Code of Ethical Conduct on its website, 
jlt.com, along with its modern slavery policy. 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS 
ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS 
Our Board welcomes the opportunity to engage openly with 
shareholders as it recognises the importance of a continuing 
effective dialogue, whether with major institutional investors, 
private shareholders or employee shareholders. The Board is 
regularly updated on shareholder views. 
The Board aims to ensure that investors understand the 
Group’s strategy and objectives. The Chief Executive Officer 
and Group Finance Director are closely involved with investor 
relations, together with the Group Head of Investor Relations. 
 
In addition, the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are 
available to discuss matters with institutional shareholders 
and the Board is also available at the Annual General Meeting 
to respond to questions. The Investor Relations team 
arranges communication with institutional shareholders with a 
combination of analyst briefings and presentations, including 
at the annual and half year results. In addition, the Company’s 
website, jlt.com, has an investor section which contains further 
information about the Company and details of regulatory news 
releases which may be of interest to shareholders. 
Following a tender held during the year, Barclays were 
appointed as joint corporate brokers to the Company alongside 
JP Morgan. The addresses of the Group’s brokers can be found 
on page 178. The Company regularly consults its brokers in 
relation to disclosure matters.
RELATIONSHIP WITH JARDINE MATHESON GROUP 
The Group continued to have a number of arm’s-length trading 
links with the Jardine Matheson group of companies during 
the financial year, which are set out in note 32 on page 160. 
At 22 February 2018 (being the latest practicable date prior to 
the date of this Report), Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited 
(Jardine Matheson Holdings) had an interest in 40.16% of  
the Company’s issued share capital. This interest is held 
through JMH Investments Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Jardine Matheson Holdings. 
The Company entered into a Relationship Agreement on  
23 October 2014, as required by Listing Rule 9.2.2AR(2)
(a), and in March 2016 an amended Relationship Agreement 
was signed with Jardine Matheson Holdings. The Agreement 
is intended to ensure that Jardine Matheson Holdings, as 
the Group’s controlling shareholder, complies with certain 
independence provisions. It contains undertakings that 
transactions and arrangements with Jardine Matheson 
Holdings and/or any of its associates will be conducted at 
arm’s-length and on normal commercial terms; that neither 
Jardine Matheson Holdings nor its associates will take any 
action which could prevent the Company from complying with 
its Listing Rules obligations; and that neither Jardine Matheson 
Holdings nor its associates will propose any shareholder 
resolution intended to circumvent the proper application of the 
Listing Rules.
The Board confirms that, since the date of entry into the 
Agreement, the Group has complied with its provisions and that, 
so far as the Company is aware, Jardine Matheson Holdings 
and its associates have also complied with the independence 
and procurement obligations set out in the Agreement. 
The updated Agreement formalised the processes the 
Company has in place to control the provision of information  
to Jardine Matheson and clarified when and how information 
may be requested by Jardine Matheson from JLT.   Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017    67

AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE 
REPORT
INTRODUCTION FROM 
THE COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMAN
I am pleased to present the Audit & Risk 
Committee Report for the year ended  
31 December 2017. 
I became Chairman of the Committee 
on 3 October 2017, upon the retirement 
of Jonathan Dawson, who had been 
Chairman of the Committee since March 
2013. On behalf of the Committee I would 
like to thank Jonathan for his strong 
leadership of the Committee over the past 
four years and wish him well for the future. 
The Committee has continued to play a 
crucial role in providing comfort to the 
Board on the integrity of the Group's 
processes and procedures relating to 
financial reporting, internal control and 
risk management. 
This report highlights the extensive work 
carried out by the Committee during 2017, 
including its continued focus on the risks 
and controls in key areas of the Group’ s 
businesses. The Committee’ s work has 
reflected the further expansion of the 
Group’ s geographical footprint, including 
in the US and Asia; external challenges 
affecting the Group’ s key risk exposures; 
and internal changes in business 
organisation, structure and leadership.
The Committee has carried out a 
number of in-depth risk reviews during 
the year. This included thematic reviews 
in respect of cyber risk, business 
continuity and Brexit.
The Committee remains focused 
on ensuring that relevant laws and 
regulations are complied with, and that 
the business operates within the right 
control framework. During the year the 
Committee monitored key compliance 
activities, including the development and 
implementation of systems and controls 
to address the requirements of the new 
General Data Protection Regulation, the 
Senior Managers and Certification Regime 
and the Criminal Finances Act 2017.
The Committee continued to oversee 
preparations for the implementation of 
new accounting standards, in particular 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments' and 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers’, as further described in the 
Significant Accounting Policies in the 
financial statements.
The Committee continues to focus on 
these key areas in 2018.
As part of its role, the Committee 
supported the Board in its assessment of 
whether the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide sufficient 
information to allow an assessment of 
the Group's position and performance, 
business model and strategy. 
The Committee also considered in detail 
management’s assessment of the going 
concern and viability statements and the 
underlying models and assumptions used, 
prior to their consideration by the Board.
Finally, in addition to Jonathan Dawson’s 
retirement and my joining the Committee, 
there have been other changes to the 
composition of the Committee during  
the year. Bruce Carnegie-Brown retired 
from the Committee and the Board in 
June 2017, following his appointment  
as Chairman of Lloyd's of London.  
Richard Meddings joined the Committee 
on 2 October 2017, bringing a broad 
range of skills and experience, including 
many years as a finance director and as  
a Chartered Accountant.

The UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the Code)  
requires the Board to establish an audit committee of at least 
three independent, Non-Executive Directors. The Committee 
currently comprises five Non-Executive Directors, of which  
four are independent. 
The Board is satisfied that Andrew Didham and Richard 
Meddings each possess recent and relevant financial 
experience for the purposes of the Code and the requisite 
competence in accounting. In addition, the Board considers 
that the Committee as a whole has competence relevant to  
the sector in which JLT operates. The experience and expertise 
of Committee members is set out on page 62 and in their 
biographies on pages 58 and 59. 
In addition to the Committee members, a number of other 
people routinely attend meetings by invitation. The list of the 
additional invitees is set out in the following table:

COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCE 
The Committee held six scheduled meetings during the 2017 
financial year. Each meeting agenda was designed to reflect 
the Company’s financial reporting cycle and to incorporate 
other matters of importance to the Committee. The Committee 
has a forward planner which is designed to ensure that the 
Committee discharges its responsibilities in full during the year.
The Chairman of the Committee reports to the Board after each 
meeting and Committee meetings are scheduled close to Board 
meetings in order to facilitate a timely reporting process.

Additional ad hoc meetings may also be held as and  
when necessary. 
During the year the Committee also held separate sessions with 
Group Internal Audit and the external auditor in order to provide 
additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback without 
management being present. The Chairman of the Committee 
also met with the Group Finance Director, Group Head of 
Internal Audit, Group Head of Risk and Compliance and Group 
Company Secretary on an ad hoc basis, and prior to each 
Committee meeting.
COMMITTEE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
The role of the Committee is to provide oversight and advice 
to the Board on matters of financial reporting, financial 
controls and risk management, together with the assessment 
and reporting of key risks, whilst maintaining an appropriate 
relationship with the Company’s external auditor. 
The business of the Committee is closely linked to the Group’s 
internal calendar of events and external financial reporting cycle.  
The Committee works independently of management and 
liaises with other Group Committees. Cross-membership 
between each of the Group Committees ensures that members 
have a better understanding of the work of each Committee 
and that communication is more efficient.    Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017    69

COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES 
The table below highlights some of the main activities carried out by the Committee during 2017.  70    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In order to satisfy its responsibilities the Committee, in the ordinary 
course of business, reviewed a wide range of matters, including: 
• the drafting of the interim report, preliminary announcement 
and relevant sections of the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements before their submission to the Board;
• reports from the Group Finance Director, including updates 
on currency exposures, the treatment of exceptional items, 
key accounting judgements, market counterparty security, 
the Group insurance programme and financial reporting 
standards and controls;
• reports from the Group Head of Internal Audit on areas 
where control weaknesses had been identified, together 
with the mitigation and remediation plans of management, 
the activities within the function and resourcing matters;
• reports from the Group Head of Internal Audit in respect of 
the overall control environment;
• reports from the Group Head of Risk, including updates  
on dealings with the regulators in the UK and in  
other jurisdictions;
• reports from the Company’s external auditor, including in 
respect of financial reporting and accounting matters;
• reports on the management of professional indemnity risk 
exposure and the extent of any litigation or other provisions 
held; and
• the effectiveness of the Committee.
In addition to its regular agenda of matters, the Committee 
considered key and emerging risks in a number of business 
areas, which were supported by ‘Risk Review’ presentations 
delivered by senior management and, in some cases, the 
Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee of the relevant 
business area. 
Key business areas reviewed

JLT Europe Canada
UK Employee Benefits Middle East and Africa
India
• a range of matters in relation to the regulatory environment, 
including MiFID II, the General Data Protection Regulation, 
the Senior Managers and Certification Regime and the 
Criminal Finances Act 2017. The Committee reviewed the 
work performed by the Group in the year to assess and 
respond to the implications for the business arising from the 
new regulations and to prepare the Group for compliance;
• the risk scenario analysis underpinning the Group’s viability 
and going concern statements to be included in the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements; 
• themes relating to the development of the Group’s internal 
control environment framework; and
• regular reviews of compliance monitoring.
The Committee is focused on ensuring that the Group complies 
with its regulatory obligations and monitors current and emerging 
developments, including reviews and investigations carried out 
by regulators in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.  
The Committee discussed reports during the year in respect 
of a number of regulatory developments, reviews and 
investigations, including:
• an FCA market-wide study of competition in the wholesale 
insurance broker sector;
• an FCA review of IT resilience and capabilities across the 
financial services sector;
• JLT's participation, following a market study into the asset 
management sector by the FCA, in a Competition and 
Markets Authority review of investment consultancy and 
fiduciary management services in the UK;
• an FCA conduct and anti-competition review concerning 
aviation broking, the competition aspect of which has now 
been passed to the European Commission for investigation; 
and
• the ongoing review by the Financial Conduct Authority of 
enhanced transfer value pension products previously sold 
by a number of market participants. 
The Group continues to assist the relevant regulators with their 
reviews and is monitoring developments closely.
Business Audit & Risk Committees ('Entity ARCs') 
JLT operates Entity ARCs as part of its global governance 
across the Group. Each Entity ARC is provided with a template 
planner to ensure that all matters in the terms of reference 
are addressed during the year. The Entity ARCs focus on the 
oversight of risk registers, emerging risks and financial reporting, 
together with their regulatory and compliance responsibilities 
and the review of reports from Internal Audit. Entity ARCs are 
typically chaired by a Non-Executive Director and have a formal 
reporting process to the Group Audit & Risk Committee. 
The Committee Chairman meets periodically with the Chairs of 
Entity ARCs to discuss common themes and emerging risks 
and to share areas of best practice across the Group.
The Committee also considered the following thematic topics 
during the year:
• a review of the increasing challenges associated with IT 
security and, in particular, cyber risk;
• a review of global sanctions regimes and their application 
across the Group;
• the implementation of a consistent limitation of liability 
programme across the Group, commensurate with the type 
and nature of services that each business offers;
• a review of financial accounting developments; 
• ongoing review of the key risks and themes of Brexit;
• the further development and implementation of the Group’s 
business continuity plans and framework;   Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017    71

SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL STATEMENT ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE
The Committee considered the following significant issues in the year, taking account of the views of the Company’s external auditor.
Issue How the issue was addressed by the Committee 
Pension 
Liability 
Valuation
The Committee discussed the maintenance of complete and accurate pension scheme data on which the pension liability 
assumptions are based and noted that no exceptions had been found from testing. The Committee considered the 
appropriateness of the methodology used by management including the key assumptions used to value the pension liabilities.
The key assumptions include the appropriateness of the discount rate used for the UK scheme by reference to the 
iBoxx AA 15+ corporate bond index; the adjustment made by management to match the duration of the liabilities and 
compared this to assumptions adopted by other schemes with a similar duration; the rates used by management for each 
of these elements to the Bank of England inflation curve; and the appropriateness of the base tables selected for use by 
management by reference to the mortality experience analysis, completed by the UK Pension Scheme Trustees as part of 
the 2014 funding valuation.
The Committee concluded that the key assumptions made were reasonable and that the overall pension deficit is 
appropriately calculated.
Intangibles 
Impairment 
Assessment 
The Committee reviewed management’s process for testing goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment. 
This included the results of management’s impairment assessment, including an assessment of the appropriateness of 
the methodology used to perform this. The Committee considered the appropriateness of the key assumptions within 
management’s valuation, in particular the terminal growth rates in the forecasts, by comparing them to economic and industry 
forecasts; and the weighted average cost of capital by assessing the cost of capital for the Company and comparable 
organisations. The Committee considered the substantive testing results performed by the Company's external auditor of all 
inputs into the valuation, for example agreeing to approved budgets and checking historical performance against the budget.  
The Committee concluded that the impairment assessment results are appropriate.
Litigation 
Provisions
The Committee members received and reviewed errors and omissions and other litigation reports addressing key disputes, 
and discussed with management the key judgements made, including relevant legal advice if received.
The Committee members also discussed litigation provisions with the Company's external auditor, and received reports 
from Group Internal Audit and Group Risk and Compliance on quality controls designed to minimise the incidence of errors 
and omissions. As a result, it was determined that the overall provision is appropriate, but it was recognised that due to the 
inherent uncertainties of litigation the final results could differ.
New 
Accounting 
Standards
The Committee reviewed management’s reports on the progress being made towards the adoption of IFRS 9 (Financial 
Instruments) and IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). Management briefed the Committee on the key 
elements of the standards, how management had interpreted them and their key judgements in the design of the resultant 
Group accounting policies.
In respect of IFRS 15 in particular, the Committee was kept informed of the progress being made by the business in 
collecting and analysing data, and enhancements to systems and procedures needed to adopt the new policy.
The Committee was kept informed of the major financial implications of adoption and the additional disclosure requirements.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AUDIT & RISK COMMITTEE
An internal review of the Committee’s effectiveness was 
carried out in respect of 2017. All of the members and 
regular attendees of the Committee were asked to complete 
a questionnaire and the feedback was discussed by the 
Committee. The results of the review were very positive 
overall, with the Committee seen as functioning effectively 
and being well-chaired. Discussions were seen to be of a high 
quality, focusing on the right areas, and with a good level of 
constructive debate and challenge in an open environment. 
The Committee was also considered to have a good 
understanding of the Group's inherent risks and risk 
management activities. The Committee will increase its focus 
on operational risks and controls as the Group implements 
a number of planned transformation programmes. Some 
opportunities were also identified to make Committee papers 
more concise and focused and to develop the professional 
training provided to the Committee.
GROUP INTERNAL AUDIT 
The Committee is accountable to the Board in relation to 
the effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit (GIA) function. 
The function’s terms of reference were reviewed by the 
Committee during the year and were considered to remain 
appropriate. There was no change to the holder of the Group 
Head of Internal Audit position during the period. 
An external review of the GIA function took place in 2016,  
in accordance with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors’ 
Standards. This confirmed the function’s effectiveness at that 
time, and its positive contribution to improving the control 
environment. The Committee considers the effectiveness of 
the GIA function on an ongoing basis during the year and is 
satisfied that it remains effective and is adequately resourced.  72    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
 During 2017, the Committee reviewed, evaluated and monitored: 
• the independence of the GIA function;
• the annual GIA plan and other audit activities undertaken by 
the function;
• reports from the Group Head of Internal Audit on the results 
of audit work performed, and the effectiveness of the 
Group’s systems of internal control;
• reports and recommendations from the Group Head of 
Internal Audit on themes affecting the development of the 
Group’s internal control framework;
• co-ordination between the internal and external auditors, 
other control functions within the Group, and with  
external regulators;
• management’s responsiveness to the findings and 
recommendations of GIA, and the monitoring of follow up 
actions relating to these;
• the adequacy of the resources of the GIA function, including 
plans for managing that resource to meet the demands of 
the business; and
• the overall effectiveness of the Group Head of Internal 
Audit and the GIA function in promoting and influencing 
improvements in the Group’s internal control environment.
The Committee, and separately the Committee Chairman on 
a one-to-one basis, regularly meets with the Group Head of 
Internal Audit to discuss the work of the GIA function and the 
findings of audits performed. 
EXTERNAL AUDITOR 
The Committee is accountable to the Board in relation to the 
appointment of the external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP ("PwC") and for overseeing the relationship with PwC. 
During the year, the Committee:
• agreed PwC’s remuneration for audit services, including 
satisfying itself that the level of audit fee was appropriate to 
enable an adequate audit to be carried out. The Committee 
also reviewed and monitored fees in respect of non-audit 
services; 
• approved the external audit plan and ensured that it was 
consistent with the scope of the audit engagement;
• approved the terms of engagement, including the 
engagement letter issued at the start of each audit,  
and the scope of the audit;
• assessed PwC’s independence, including in relation to non-
audit services provided;
• reviewed the findings of PwC, including discussion of 
any major issues arising, and any accounting and audit 
judgements; and
• held meetings with PwC without management present. 
PwC contribute an independent perspective on certain aspects 
of the Company’s financial control systems arising from its work 
and report its findings to the Committee.
EFFECTIVENESS OF EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Committee considers the effectiveness, independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor throughout the year. 
An internal effectiveness review of PwC was undertaken 
during the year. The review focused on areas including: PwC’s 
expertise and resources; the robustness and effectiveness 
of the external audit process; and the quality of reporting. 
Feedback was obtained from finance directors across the 
business. The Committee considered the feedback from the 
review, which was generally very positive, and concluded 
that PwC continued to operate to the expected standards. 
The Committee and PwC agreed areas where there were 
opportunities for development in order to further enhance the 
audit process.
NON-AUDIT FEES AND EXTERNAL AUDITOR 
INDEPENDENCE 
To safeguard auditor objectivity and independence, the Group 
has a policy for the approval of non-audit services provided 
by PwC. All proposed services must be pre-approved in 
accordance with the non-audit services policy which sets out 
defined and escalating approval levels in reference to materiality.  
This policy was reviewed and updated by the Committee in 
February 2018. All non-audit services with fees exceeding 
£50,000 must be pre-approved by the Committee Chairman or 
the Committee, which also reviews the non-audit fees charged 
by PwC during the year. 
Prior to approving non-audit services, consideration is given  
to whether it is in the interests of the Company that the services 
are purchased from PwC, rather than another supplier.  
Where PwC was chosen to provide non-audit services during 
the year, this was as a result of its detailed knowledge of the 
structure of our business combined with an understanding of 
JLT’s industry, which together made PwC the best supplier 
to carry out the relevant work cost effectively. In such 
instances, both JLT and PwC were satisfied that appropriate 
safeguards were in place to ensure the preservation of PwC’s 
independence as external auditor.    Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017    73
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Fees paid to PwC for audit and non-audit services are set out 
in note 7 to the financial statements and are summarised in the 
table below. 
2017
£’000
2016

Non-audit 960 755
Total 4,347 3,404

The audit fees increased in the year, primarily due to the 
additional work required in connection with the implementation 
of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and certain component auditor  
scope changes. 
The table below summarises some of the more significant non-
audit services carried out by PwC in 2017 and the safeguards 
to preserve PwC’s independence: 
Nature of Service Safeguards to preserve independence
Tax advisory and 
compliance services 
in international 
markets
Tax specialists are separate to the audit 
team. PwC acts as adviser only and is not 
involved in making or influencing management 
decisions. No contingency fee involved. PwC 
does not directly handle or take custody of 
any client funds.
Forensic services Data is not accounting information and 
does not relate to risk management. 
Specialists involved are separate to the audit 
team. Advocacy threats are mitigated. No 
contingency fee involved.
Other advisory 
services
Specialists involved are separate to the audit 
team. Advocacy threats are mitigated. No 
contingency fee involved.
The Committee remains satisfied with PwC’s independence, 
and its responsiveness to management, in respect of work 
undertaken in 2017. PwC have also assessed and confirmed 
their independence to the Committee. 
EXTERNAL AUDITOR RE-APPOINTMENT
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the 
Board with regard to the reappointment of the external auditor 
each year. In making this recommendation, the Committee 
takes into account auditor independence and effectiveness, 
audit partner rotation and any other factors that may impact the 
Committee’s judgement regarding the external auditor. Based 
on the Committee’s recommendation, the Board is proposing 
that PwC is reappointed to office at this year’s AGM.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR ROTATION 
PwC was appointed as the external auditor of Jardine Lloyd 
Thompson Group plc in 1997 following the merger of JIB Group 
plc and Lloyd Thompson Group plc, prior to which PwC was 
the external auditor of JIB Group plc from 1991.
The Committee is aware of the EU-wide regulations concerning 
audit tenure and the longevity of audit firm relationships with 
the companies they audit. Under current EU transitional 
arrangements, it is anticipated that the last financial year for 
which PwC will audit the Group’s accounts will be that ending 
31 December 2019. The current audit partner, Nick Wilks, took 
up his role in 2015.
Continuity and consistency of audit quality are important, but 
the Committee is mindful of the fact that PwC has been the 
Company's auditor for 21 years without re-tender and it remains 
the Company’s intention to initiate an audit re-tendering process 
in 2018. The Company believes that this timing is appropriate 
as it aligns with the rotation cycle for the current engagement 
partner. There are no contractual obligations that would restrict 
the selection of a different auditor.
The Committee considers that the Company has, throughout 
the year ended 31 December 2017, complied with  
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
RISK MANAGEMENT 
A description of the processes followed by the Group to identify 
and manage risk is included in the Risk Management Report on 
pages 41 to 45. 
CYBER RISK 
The risk of any firm being compromised by some form of cyber 
event is ever present. JLT takes cyber risk very seriously and 
seeks to address any threats from internal or external sources, 
whether intentional and malevolent or by simple human error. 
JLT also recognises the interrelationship between addressing 
cyber risk and dealing with other subjects such as the 
forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation, in particular 
that creating a strong environment to manage one will assist 
with addressing the other. 
Cyber risk and related subjects have been the topic of regular 
discussion by the Committee for several years. Rather than 
running a one-off programme, JLT adopts the stance that this 
area requires a constant focus across people, processes and 
technology in order to stay current and to mitigate this threat.  74    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CULTURE
The Committee recognises that a strong and transparent 
corporate culture is a valuable asset to protect and generate 
value. Companies need to have a strong purpose, culture and 
ethical values in order to succeed, be sustainable and build 
trust among their stakeholders.
JLT's corporate culture is underpinned by a clear alignment of 
business purpose, values, strategy and incentives: people at 
all levels of the organisation understand JLT's values and act in 
accordance with these.
Corporate culture is led by the Board and is not about rules but 
about actions. A key objective for both the Board and senior 
management is to communicate the behaviours they want to 
see in the business and to find constructive ways to encourage 
and build those behaviours.
The Committee also has an important role to play in supporting 
the right culture across the Group, by overseeing the provision 
of high quality, insightful reporting both internally and externally 
to the Group’s stakeholders, which demonstrates that the 
Group has in place the right structures and processes to 
support the right behaviours by employees. The Committee 
seeks to recognise and address any instances where there is 
misalignment between behaviour, purposes and values.
The Committee’s work in this regard is supported by the key 
control functions, including Group Risk & Compliance, Group 
Internal Audit and Group Corporate Secretariat, as well as by 
the Group’s external auditor.
The Committee has increased its focus on this area in the  
past year and has discussed a number of matters relevant to  
the fostering of an appropriate corporate culture within JLT, 
including the improving maturity of the control environment in  
the Group’s businesses and in the context of the year end review 
of internal controls.
GLOBAL COMPLIANCE 
Our businesses around the Group are at differing levels of 
maturity, but they have all implemented a suitable governance 
and control environment, which in many cases either mirror,  
or are based upon, JLT Group standards and structures. 
Businesses adopt appropriate quality assurance processes 
and all significant businesses operate an independently chaired 
Audit & Risk Committee. Businesses are also subject to regular 
internal audits. 
Where local laws or regulations impose standards or practices 
which differ from those of the wider JLT Group (for example  
in relation to licensing requirements or the applicable sanctions 
regime), adjustments are made to policies and practices  
as appropriate. 
The compliance framework of each of our businesses will 
continue to evolve in response both to their growth and local 
legal and regulatory changes.
DIRECTORS’ FAIR, BALANCED AND 
UNDERSTANDABLE STATEMENT 
At the request of the Board, the Committee carried out a 
detailed review of the robust processes which were followed  
in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements,  
and reported the results of that review to the Board.
The review supported the Directors in satisfying themselves 
that they could make the statement on page 95 of the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements that the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE 
REPORT
INTRODUCTION FROM 
THE COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMAN
I am pleased to present the Nominations 
Committee report for the year ended  
31 December 2017. 
It has been an active year for the 
Committee, with a strong focus on 
succession planning for both the Board 
and senior management.
During 2017 there were a number of 
Board and Committee changes. Two 
Directors left the Board during the year: 
Bruce Carnegie-Brown retired from 
the Board and as Senior Independent 
Director on 14 June 2017, following his 
appointment as the Chairman of Lloyd’s of 
London, and Jonathan Dawson retired on 
3 October 2017. I should like to express 
the Board’s thanks to Bruce and Jonathan 
for their respective contributions to the 
Board and its Committees.
The Committee oversaw the selection 
and appointment of new Non-Executive 
Directors and appointed executive search 
firm, The Zygos Partnership, a signatory 
to the Voluntary Code of Conduct of 
Executive Search Firms, to compile a 
long list of candidates for the respective 
roles. In October, Andrew Didham and 
Richard Meddings were appointed 
Directors. Richard has become Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee and 
Andrew has become Chair of the Audit 
& Risk Committee.
The Committee was also pleased 
to recommend the appointment of 
Annette Court as the Company’s Senior 
Independent Director. 
In February 2018, the Committee 
recommended the appointment of 
Lynne Peacock. Lynne will join the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director 
on 1 May 2018.
At a senior management level, Lucy 
Clarke was appointed as Global CEO 
of JLT Specialty with effect from 1 April 
2018. Further details can be found in my 
Chairman's Statement on page 12. 
Jonathan Palmer-Brown stepped  
down from the Group Executive 
Committee at the end of the year and 
continues to act as an Adviser to the 
Group Chief Executive. 
Leo Demer retired as CEO of our 
Australia and New Zealand business at 
the end of December 2017 and has been 
succeeded by Nick Harris. Nick joined  
the Group Executive Committee with 
effect from 1 January 2018. Leo assumes 
the new role of Head of Global Public 
Sector Specialties.
With effect from 26 February 2018,  
Mike Rice became Executive Chairman of 
JLT's US Specialty business to focus on 
M&A and to continue to play a leading role 
in driving new business development.  
Pat Donnelly, formerly President and 
Deputy CEO, assumed the role of CEO  
of that business on the same date. 
Another key area of focus for the Group 
has continued to be diversity. We have 
defined JLT’s diversity agenda on the  
basis of three pillars: Networking, 
Sponsorship and Involvement. In 2017, 
JLT supported a number of initiatives, 
both internally and in public events in 
the London Market and other insurance 
hubs, to help to drive a more diverse and 
inclusive business and to play our part in 
solving these challenges in our industry. 
More details are available in the Corporate 
Responsibility Report on pages 50 and 51.
The Committee continues to focus  
on succession planning and executive 
development and during the year 
it oversaw a detailed review by 
management, with the assistance of 
external consultants, of the leadership 
capability and potential of a cohort  
of nearly 40 of JLT’s senior managers.  
More details of this review and its 
conclusions are set out in the  
following Report.

COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the structure and 
composition of the Board and its Committees and ensuring that 
they have the right balance of skills, knowledge and experience.
The Committee ensures that there is a formal, rigorous and 
transparent process for new Board appointments. It is the 
Committee’s responsibility to lead this process by preparing 
a description of the role and capabilities required for each 
particular appointment; appointing external search consultants 
as appropriate and overseeing the search process; and making 
recommendations on new appointments to the Board.  
All appointments to the Board are made on merit and against 
objective criteria. 
The Committee has responsibility for considering a range of 
other issues including diversity, inclusion and gender equality. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the 
Company's website jlt.com.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES 
The Committee met formally on two occasions during 2017, 
as well as meeting on an ad hoc basis on several occasions to 
discuss key events during the year. 
During the year the Committee focused on succession 
planning and the development of Directors and high performing 
members of senior management, as well as on the promotion of 
diversity and inclusion across the organisation.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR APPOINTMENTS
The Board appointed two new Non-Executive Directors in 2017, 
Andrew Didham and Richard Meddings. An external search 
consultancy, The Zygos Partnership, was engaged to lead the 
search process for both candidates. The Zygos Partnership has 
no other connections with the Company. A detailed longlist was 
prepared and discussed with the Committee and a shortlist of 
candidates was then interviewed. The Committee met twice 
to discuss the results of the process and recommended the 
appointment of the two final candidates to the Board.  
The Committee subsequently engaged The Zygos Partnership 
to lead the search for a further Independent Non-Executive 
Director. The Committee discussed the results of the process 
during 2018 and recommended the appointment of Lynne 
Peacock to the Board with effect from 1 May 2018.
During 2017, the Committee also reviewed and recommended 
the extension of Nicholas Walsh’s appointment as a Non-
Executive Director following three years of service on the Board.
SUCCESSION PLANNING 
One of the key roles of the Committee is to discuss succession 
planning for the Board and other senior management positions. 
It is important that a pipeline of talent is recognised and 
nurtured within the business and that the skills and experience 
of senior management are developed. Ultimate responsibility  
for making senior management appointments rests with the 
Group Chief Executive. 
The Committee works closely with management to ensure 
that succession planning looks ahead over multiple years and 
addresses any identified skill shortages.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
During the year the Committee oversaw a detailed review by 
management, with the assistance of external consultants,  
Korn Ferry, of the leadership capability and potential of a  
cohort of nearly 40 of JLT’s senior managers. The review 
focused on the capability of the cohort as leaders within JLT, 
using the Group’s five pillar leadership model, as well as on  
their leadership potential measured using a number of 
external tools and against a large group of executives in other 
businesses. The exercise was seen as important in assessing 
the strength of JLT’s leadership team and how well positioned  
it is to drive JLT forward to deliver on the Group’s strategy. 
The results of the review indicated that JLT’s cohort had  
strong leadership in core areas and great potential.  
Training and development plans, with appropriate coaching 
and mentoring, are being tailored to help individuals meet their 
development needs.
The Committee also continued to discuss future succession 
plans for the role of Group Chief Executive. Korn Ferry carried 
out further work to evaluate several potential internal candidates 
for the role, in order to identify development opportunities for 
those individuals.
The Committee also spent time considering succession 
planning in respect of the Chairman and is comfortable that an 
appropriate plan is in place.
The Committee is confident that there are succession plans in 
place for Directors and senior management across the Group 
which are appropriate to enable the implementation of our 
corporate strategy and our future growth plans.
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION 
The Committee aims to maintain an appropriate balance of 
skills, experience, expertise and background on the Board.  
In preparing to recommend new appointments, the Committee 
takes into account the benefits of diversity whilst considering 
candidates on merit against objective criteria. 
The Board supports the recommendations made in the reviews 
published by Davies, Hampton-Alexander and Parker and 
supports the Code’s recommendation that diversity and gender 
should be considered when making Board appointments. 
JLT recognises the benefits of having a diverse Board and is 
committed to achieving a Board which includes and makes the 
best use of differences in culture, gender, skills, background, 
regional, financial and industry experience and other qualities.
More details of JLT's approach to diversity can be found in the 
Corporate Responsibility Report on pages 50 and 51.
BOARD INDUCTION AND TRAINING 
The Committee is focused on ensuring that an appropriate 
induction programme is provided to all new Directors which  
is tailored to their roles on the Board and its Committees.  
A programme has been developed which is designed to  
provide new Directors with an understanding of the Group,  
its governance framework, its business and the markets in  
which it operates. 
Members of the Board and its Committees are provided with 
regular training in order to keep them abreast of industry and 
legal and regulatory developments, facilitated by professional 
advisers where appropriate. 
Further details regarding the induction and training programmes 
provided during the year can be found on page 65.

DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION 
REPORT
INTRODUCTION FROM 
THE COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMAN
I am pleased to introduce the Directors' 
Remuneration Report for 2017. In doing 
so, I would like to thank the Board and 
senior management for their support 
since my appointment to the Committee 
on 2 October 2017 and to thank my 
predecessor Bruce Carnegie-Brown  
for his leadership during the early part 
of the year, and in particular for his 
consultation with shareholders on the  
full review of JLT’s Remuneration Policy.  
The Remuneration Policy was 
subsequently approved at the 2017 
AGM, by 95.59% of shareholders. 
At JLT we believe that our Remuneration 
Policy is appropriate for rewarding 
Executive Directors in line with business 
performance while remaining in line  
with the interests of shareholders.  
The Committee is keeping under 
review the Financial Reporting Council’s 
current consultation on the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and its 
potential implications for the Group’s 
Remuneration Policy.
KEY PRINCIPLES
Our Policy continues to be based on the 
following key principles:
• simple, consistent and transparent;
• supports the cultural and behavioural 
priorities of the Group; and
• achieves a balance between pay and 
performance, such that:
 - fixed pay remains at an 
appropriate level when 
considered against a competitive 
global market place, ensuring we 
are able to attract and retain high 
calibre staff; and
 - variable pay and incentives 
provide a strong and 
demonstrable link between the 
performance of the Company 
and the performance of its 
Executive Directors and senior 
management team members.
The Committee believes this philosophy 
provides a direct incentive for our 
employees to create long-term 
sustainable value for our shareholders 
together with upholding the strong cultural 
identity and expected standards of 
behaviour. Share awards continue to be 
an essential tool in aligning the interests of 
employees with those of shareholders.
In setting remuneration levels, the 
Committee is mindful that our business 
operates in a competitive global market.
The Committee takes into account 
appropriate remuneration data relevant 
to UK public companies of a similar size 
and complexity however also recognises 
that there are no directly comparable 
UK companies and that its principal 
competitors are often businesses which 
are part of much larger groups, primarily 
based in the US.
In 2017, the Committee spent the early 
part of the year focused on executive 
compensation in relation to 2016 
performance and considering appropriate 
revisions to the Remuneration Policy in 
order to be in a position to recommend 
full approval of the new Policy by 
shareholders at the 2017 AGM.  
Following approval of the Remuneration 
Policy, the Committee implemented 
the revised Policy as it related to senior 
management compensation.  
During the year, the Committee took a 
wider view on compensation matters 
for the top 100 highest paid individuals 
in the Group. The Committee was 
satisfied that total compensation for 
these individuals aligned with shareholder 
interests in terms of value creation. 
The Committee also considered the 
figures relating to the required reporting 
requirements under the Gender Pay Gap 
regulations in the UK. The Committee, 
when reviewing the outcomes, endorsed 
management’s stance on addressing the 
talent agenda which, in common with 
many other UK businesses, is highlighted 
by the Gender Pay Gap figures.

MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND DECISIONS  
IN 2017
INCENTIVE OUT-TURNS IN RESPECT OF 2017
As reported last year, the Committee agreed at the time of  
setting the 2016 annual bonus targets for the Executive Directors, 
that the underlying Profit Before Tax (PBT) target would include 
the budgeted investment in the US Specialty business.
80% of the Executive Directors’ 2017 bonus was based on 
Group underlying PBT targets. The underlying PBT delivered 
in the year of £191.5 million was significantly in excess of the 
target of £183.0 million such that a maximum award was earned. 
The remaining 20% was based on the achievement of specific 
personal objectives. The bonus awards, which were made in 
respect of 2017 (Group Chief Executive 200% of salary,  
Deputy Group CEO and Group Finance Director both at 149% 
of salary) are reflective of the strong results that the business 
has delivered this year. The Committee considers that the strong 
financial performance of the Group warrants these awards. 
PLANS FOR 2018 
Salary: As previously reported, the Deputy Group CEO and 
Finance Director were both awarded salary increases in 2017, 
with an agreement that there would be no further review until 
2019. The Group Chief Executive will receive a salary increase  
of 3.5% in 2018 resulting in an annual base salary of £793,000. 
The all employee UK salary increase averaged 4% across 2017, 
with a similar increase anticipated for 2018.
Bonus: The annual bonus will remain 80% based on Group 
results (measured on underlying PBT) and 20% based on the 
achievement of personal objectives. The target bonus award 
for the Deputy Group CEO and Group Finance Director will 
remain 125% of salary and the maximum bonus 150% of 
salary. For the Group Chief Executive, the target and maximum 
bonus awards continue to be the same (150% and 200% of 
salary respectively). 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Award: Earnings per share 
(EPS) has been used as the measure of performance for the 
LTIP for a number of years and continues to be an important 
and appropriate measure of the long-term success of JLT and 
is aligned to shareholder returns. The Committee proposes no 
change to the EPS targets for the 2018 LTIP award, which remain 
appropriately challenging in the current trading environment.  
Accordingly, EPS growth is set at a range of 4% per annum 
(12% over 3 years) to 12% per annum (36% over 3 years). 
The threshold level of vesting will remain at 20% of the 
maximum award. 75% of the maximum award will be payable 
on EPS growth of 8% per annum (24% over 3 years).
Full vesting of the award will, as in prior years, remain subject 
to the achievement of growth in EPS of 12% per annum (36% 
over 3 years).
The 2017 underlying basic EPS will be used as the base year 
for the purposes of this award and includes the costs of the  
US Specialty investment. However, from 2014 to 2016 inclusive,  
as previously stated, the costs of US investment were excluded 
in order to normalise the earnings profile of the Group during the 
start-up phases of the investment cycle for the purposes of long 
term remuneration. The investments in the US have resulted in 
an accumulation of losses which may result in the recognition 
of a deferred tax asset. As this is likely to have a positive, but 
distorting effect on the underlying EPS result when recognised, 
the Committee has decided to exclude the benefit of the 
deferred tax asset for the purposes of any LTIP calculation.
OTHER KEY DECISIONS 
A review of Non-Executive Director fees in line with market has 
resulted in an increase to the basic fee to £65,000 with effect 
from 1 April 2018. The fees were last increased in April 2014. 
Supplementary fees remain unchanged.

In the UK, this is provided via contributions to  
the Defined Contribution (DC) section of the  
JLT UK Pension Scheme or as a cash salary 
supplement. Contributions, in line with the Scheme 
Rules, are made by reference to pensionable 
earnings (currently a maximum of £140,000 but 
reviewed annually).
Members of the Defined Benefit (DB) section of 
the scheme will continue to receive benefits in 
accordance with the terms of this plan, although 
it is closed to further accrual or to new members. 
Since the closure of the DB scheme in 2006, 
affected employees, including some Executive 
Directors, receive a fixed salary supplement, which 
was determined at the time the scheme was closed 
based on each individual's circumstances.
Current UK Executive 
Directors receive a 
maximum DC/cash 
supplement of 15% of 
pensionable earnings.

KEY COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION 
The following sections describe how the Committee 
implemented key elements of the Policy in the year ended  
31 December 2017 and how it is intended to operate in the 
year ending 31 December 2018. 
Salary
In setting salaries, the Committee takes into account the  
scale and complexity of the Group, the scope and 
responsibilities of the role, the skills and experience of the 
individual, performance in role, the level of salary increase  
within the business, and the Committee’s assessment of  
the competitive environment including consideration of 
appropriate market data. The Committee also takes into 
account appropriate remuneration data relevant to UK public 
companies of a similar size and complexity but also recognises 
that there are no directly comparable UK companies and 
that the Company’s principal international competitors are 
businesses which are part of much larger groups, primarily in 
the US. The base salaries of the Executive Directors effective  
1 April 2018 are set out in the table below, together with the 
prior year comparative.
The Committee proposes to increase the Group Chief 
Executive’s salary by 3.5% from 1 April 2018 with the next 
review in April 2019. The all employee UK salary increase 
averaged 4% across 2017, with a similar increase anticipated 
for 2018.
As noted last year, the Committee recognises the concerns 
of investors around executive salary inflation which is why it 
committed that the salaries of the Deputy Chief Executive  
and Group Finance Director will remain unchanged until at least 
1 April 2019. 
Directors 2018 2017 Change 
Dominic Burke £793,000 £766,000 3.5%
Mark Drummond Brady £450,000 £450,000 -
Charles Rozes £455,000 £455,000 -
ANNUAL BONUS 
In 2017, the Executive Directors had a target bonus opportunity 
of 125% salary (150% of salary for the Group Chief Executive) 
and a maximum of 150% (200% for the Group Chief Executive).  
In 2017, the bonus was based on a combination of both 
financial and personal performance measures, requiring the 
achievement of stretching performance targets, as follows:
• 80% on JLT Group underlying PBT performance. 
As described in more detail on page 79, 2017 saw a 
Group underlying PBT of £191.5 million. This significantly 
exceeded the Target of £183.0 million such that the 
maximum award was due; and
• 20% on the achievement of personal objectives. Each of the 
Executive Directors set their objectives with the Group Chief 
Executive (or in the case of the Group Chief Executive, with 
the Remuneration Committee). These are documented and 
reviewed mid-year to ensure that they continue to be relevant 
to the business, with an overall assessment being made at 
the end of the performance year. Personal objectives align to 
the Group’s strategic priorities.
Dominic Burke’s personal objectives during 2017 have focused 
on the Group strategy and its delivery including: 
• delivering the Group Strategic Review and implementation 
plan including a new target operating model and 
transformation programme to deliver sustained Group 
performance; and
• the corresponding talent management and development 
review of the senior leadership population.
Charles Rozes’ objectives have focused on efficiency and 
continued effective governance including:
• delivering the Group capital funding structure in support of 
the Group strategic review;
• delivering substantive efficiency and productivity gains 
across the Finance function globally; and
• implementation of revised and enhanced risk & governance 
structures internationally. 
Following his change of role at the start of 2017, Mark 
Drummond Brady’s objectives focused on JLT’s Latin 
American and Canadian businesses as well as his Deputy CEO 
responsibilities. His objectives included:
• delivering on the strategic alignment of the Canadian and 
Latin American businesses as part of the Group strategic 
review; and
• leading on the post-Brexit plan for JLT Group in Europe.
Based on the performance against the targets set, the 
Committee determined that the Executive Directors would 
receive the bonus for the year as shown in the Single Total 
Figure of Remuneration Table (133% of Target bonus for the 
Group Chief Executive, and 119% of Target for each of  
Charles Rozes and Mark Drummond Brady). This has been 
based on the underlying PBT results, and the achievement of 
personal objectives. 
For 2018, the annual bonus will operate on the same basis as 
2017. The Committee and Board of JLT believe the specific 
performance targets are commercially sensitive and therefore 
it is inappropriate to publish further detail here. It is the current 
intention that they will be disclosed next year to the extent that 
the Committee is comfortable that they are no longer sensitive. 84    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The calculation of EPS is underlying basic EPS, excluding 
exceptional items and impairment charges and measured on 
actual achieved exchange rates and will be verified by the 
Company’s auditor.
As noted earlier, the 2017 underlying basic EPS will be used as 
the base year for the purposes of this award and includes the 
costs of the US Specialty investment. However, from 2014 to 
2016 inclusive, as previously stated, the costs of US investment 
were excluded in order to normalise the earnings profile of the 
Group during the start-up phases of the investment cycle for the 
purposes of long term remuneration. The investments in the US 
have resulted in an accumulation of losses which may result in 
the recognition of a deferred tax asset. As this is likely to have a 
positive, but distorting effect on the underlying EPS result when 
recognised, the Committee has decided to exclude the benefit of 
the deferred tax asset for the purposes of any LTIP calculation.
Awards will be made at the same level as in 2017, as set out in 
the Policy.

SHAREHOLDER GUIDELINES AND SHARE INTERESTS 
Executive Directors are required to build up long-term share 
interests equivalent to 200% of base salary (300% of base salary 
for the Group Chief Executive). In summary, the guidelines are 
for Executive Directors to retain 50% of shares acquired on the 
vesting of share awards after the payment of income tax and 
national insurance, until such time as the guideline has been 
met. Deferred shares count towards the guideline (on a net of 
tax basis). The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not 
subject to the share ownership guidelines. 
LTIP – 2015 AWARD, VESTING IN RESPECT OF 2017 
The 2015 LTIP was based on basic EPS growth (excluding 
exceptional items and impairment charges and measured  
on actual exchange rates) in the three financial years to  
31 December 2017 in accordance with the targets laid out 
below, determined by the Committee at the time of grant. 
Following the announcement of the expansion into the US,  
the Committee considered the impact of the significant 
expected investment costs on LTIP awards (i.e. 2013 to 2016 
awards inclusive). The Committee determined that it was 
appropriate to adopt the following approach:
• in respect of a financial year in which US investment costs 
occur, that such cost will be added back to the EPS for that 
year for the purposes of measuring LTIP performance; and
• the Committee retains discretion over whether to apply such 
an approach in respect of any financial year and on the 
proportion of the cost which is added back. Any adjustment 
will be verified by the Company’s auditor prior to the vesting 
date and clearly disclosed in the relevant Remuneration 
Report. The Committee believes that although the costs 
are not “exceptional costs” from a technical accounting 
perspective (and therefore will not be excluded from 
“Underlying EPS”) they are exceptional for the purposes 
of LTIP measurement. The approach is consistent with the 
rules of the LTIP and with the Policy.
Per the award criteria, after removing the impact of the US 
investment costs the LTIP will vest at 28.44% of the maximum 
on 1 April 2018.

The Committee reviewed the performance targets for the LTIP

the current environment. Therefore, this target range will apply 
to the 2018 LTIP award.

DBSP: Awards under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan are made in the form of conditional shares and are not subject to any further performance conditions.
LTIP: Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan made in the form of nil-cost options (2013, 2014 and 2015 awards) or conditional share awards (2016 and 
2017 awards) subject to EPS growth performance conditions. For the 2013, 2014 and 2015 LTIP awards, the performance condition requires EPS growth 
over a three year period of 6% pa (18% over 3 years) for 20% vesting, to 12% pa (36% over 3 years) for full vesting. For the 2016 and 2017 LTIP awards, the 
performance condition requires EPS growth over a three year period of 4% pa (12% over 3 years) for 20% vesting, to 12% pa (36% over 3 years) for full vesting.

29 December 2017. 
With the exception of the Directors' interests disclosed in the table above, no Director had any additional interest in the share capital of the Company during 
the year. Between 1 January 2018 and 22 February 2018 (being the latest practicable date prior to the posting of this report) the trustees of the Jardine Lloyd 
Thompson Group plc All Employee Share Plan have acquired 21 shares on behalf of Dominic Burke. 86    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees
The fees were reviewed during 2017 and no changes were made. However, they have now been reviewed in line with market and 
therefore, for 2018, the basic fee for Non-Executive Directors will increase to £65,000 a year from 1 April 2018. All other fees will 
remain the same.
2018 2017 Change 
Group Non-Executive Chairman £300,000 £300,000 0%
Basic fee for Non-Executive Director £65,000 £60,000 8%
Supplementary fees for: 
Chairman of Group Audit & Risk Committee Chairman £22,500 £22,500 0%
Chairman of Group Remuneration Committee £20,000 £20,000 0%
Group Senior Independent Director £10,000 £10,000 0%
Nicholas Walsh is a member of the Board and ARC of the US Specialty business and of the ARC of the US Reinsurance business. He also attends 
meetings of the Executive Committee of the US Reinsurance business. He is paid an annual fee of £88,600 in respect of these commitments.
PENSION 
Pension benefits are provided to Executive Directors via the 
Defined Contribution (DC) section of the JLT UK Pension 
Scheme or as a cash salary supplement. Member contributions 
are matched by a Company contribution equivalent to 2.5 
times the amount paid by the member subject to a maximum of 
5% to 15% of pensionable earnings for the Scheme (currently 
£140,000 but reviewed annually).
Contributions in respect of 2017 are included in the Single Total 
Figure of Remuneration Table on page 82.
To reflect the closure of the DB scheme in 2006, affected 
employees, including some Executive Directors, also receive a 
fixed cash supplement, which was calculated as a percentage 
of salary determined at the time the scheme was closed based 
on each individual’s circumstances. These cash supplements 
are included in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration Table  
on page 82. 
SERVICE CONTRACT 
It is the Company’s standard policy that Executive Directors 
should have service contracts with an indefinite term which 
can be terminated by the Company or the Director by giving 
notice not exceeding 12 months. This applies to all current 
Executive Directors and would normally be applied to future 
appointments. The Committee retains discretion to offer service 
agreements with notice periods which exceed 12 months (up to 
a maximum of 24 months). If such a contract were offered, the 
notice period would normally be reduced during the first year of 
employment to the standard 12 month notice period.
Under all the current Executive Director service contracts,  
the Company may terminate employment by making a payment 
in lieu of notice which would not exceed 12 months’ salary, 
benefits and pension contributions. This policy would be applied 
to future appointments.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three year term, 
which is renewable, with three months’ notice on either side. 
The contract for the Chairman is subject to a six month notice 
provision on either side. For both Non-Executive Directors and 
the Chairman, no contractual termination payments would be 
due and both are subject to election pursuant to the Articles of 
Association at the Annual General Meeting.

Dominic Burke is non-executive chairman of Newbury 
Racecourse plc. He retained the fee of £20,000 paid by 
Newbury Racecourse in respect of 2017. No other Executive 
Directors hold outside paid posts.
Dilution
The Company continues to operate its share schemes in line 
with the Investment Association guidelines on dilution.
The Company follows a conservative approach to hedging for 
share awards made under LTIP , DBSP and other share-based 
schemes, whereby shares to satisfy such awards are normally 
purchased in the market and held in an employee trust.
The Company seeks to be fully hedged as far as possible 
against awards made. At 31 December 2017 the total awards 
outstanding in respect of the LTIP , DBSP and other share-based 
schemes totalled 9,833,701 shares representing 4.47% of 
the Company’s issued share capital. This comprised 0.23% in 
respect of awards which were fully vested and 4.24% in respect 
of awards which had not yet vested.

Roles and Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee
Remuneration and Policy 
Framework
To determine and agree with the Board the framework and policy for the remuneration of the Group Chief Executive, 
Chairman, the Executive Directors and other members of the Group Executive Committee (GEC);  
In determining such policy, to take into account information about remuneration in other relevant companies and 
trends in remuneration across the Group.
Annual bonus plans To approve the design of, and determine targets and vesting schedule for, any annual bonus plans for the Executive 
Directors and other members of the GEC.
Share incentive plans To review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and (where applicable) shareholders.  
To determine whether awards will be made and, if so, the overall amount of such awards and the performance 
targets to be used. 
Individual remuneration 
packages
Within the terms of the agreed Policy, to determine the total individual remuneration package of each Executive 
Director and other members of the GEC and the terms of any compensation payable for loss of office or employment. 
Significant remuneration 
proposals for below  
GEC level
To be informed of, and be consulted by, the Group Chief Executive on any significant proposals relating to 
remuneration for executives below the GEC level, including significant new hirings. 
Disclosure requirements To ensure that all disclosure requirements in relation to remuneration are fulfilled. 
Remuneration consultants To appoint and manage the engagement of any remuneration consultants who advise the Committee. 
 
THE ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE 
The principal purpose of the Committee is to determine the Company’s policy on the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive 
Directors and other members of the Group Executive Committee, as well as to approve specific remuneration packages for each  
of them. The Remuneration Policy was voted on and approved at the 2017 Annual General Meeting. The voting figures can be 
found on page 87. 
The full terms of reference of the Committee have been approved by the Board and are available on the Group’s website, jlt.com. 
Key Responsibilities
Effectiveness of the Remuneration Committee
A review of the Committee's effectiveness was carried out in 
respect of 2017. All members and regular attendees of the 
Committee were asked to complete a questionnaire and the 
feedback was discussed by the Committee. The results of the 
review were positive, acknowledging the smooth transition to a 
new Chairman, who was seen to promote effective and efficient 
meetings. Discussions were seen as high quality, focusing on 
the appropriate areas, with a good level of constructive debate 
and robust challenge. There was seen to be good interaction 
between members and management. Opportunities for further 
improvements were identified, including in relation to the 
provision of more concise papers and the provision of additional 
market insights to the Committee. 
Committee Advisers 
The Remuneration Committee advisers are appointed by the 
Committee and their roles are kept under review.
During the year Deloitte LLP have been retained by the 
Committee in their capacity as Remuneration Committee 
advisers. Deloitte LLP were originally appointed in 2011 
following a selection process undertaken by the Committee. 
Deloitte LLP is a member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and as such voluntarily operates under the Code of 
Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in 
the UK. The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte LLP 
engagement partner and team that provide remuneration 
advice to the Committee do not have connections with Jardine 
Lloyd Thompson Group plc that may impair their objectivity 
and independence. The fees charged by Deloitte LLP for the 
provision of independent advice to the Committee during 2017 
were £7,000. Deloitte LLP also provide services to the Group 
in respect of corporate tax advice, internal audit assistance, 
regulatory reporting and Company share schemes.  90    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

DIRECTORS' REPORT
The Directors present their report and audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for the  
year ended 31 December 2017.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 2016 
As a company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, we are committed to complying with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (the 'Code'), which is available on the FRC website at frc.org.uk. Throughout the accounting period,  
we have complied with the provisions of Sections A to E of the Code as detailed below, with the exception of those listed and  
as explained in the following table:
Provision Requirement Non-compliance 
B.1.2 At least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, 
should comprise non-executive directors 
determined by the Board to be independent.
Between 1 January and 14 June 2017, excluding the Chairman, the  
Board comprised six Non-Executive Directors (four Independent and two  
Non-Independent) and three Executive Directors. On 14 June 2017,  
Bruce Carnegie-Brown retired from the Board. 
The Company became compliant with the Code on 2 October 2017 following 
the appointment of two Independent Non-Executive Directors, Andrew Didham 
and Richard Meddings. Following Jonathan Dawson’s resignation on 3 October 
2017, excluding the Chairman, there were six Non-Executive Directors  
(four Independent and two Non-Independent) and three Executive Directors. 
Lynne Peacock has been appointed as an additional Independent Non-
Executive Director with effect from 1 May 2018, from which date the Company 
expects to be compliant with Code provision B.1.2.  
B.2.1 A majority of members of the nomination 
committee should be independent  
non-executive directors.
Between 1 January 2017 and 14 June 2017, the Committee’s composition met 
the requirements of the Code. Following Bruce Carnegie-Brown’s resignation 
on 14 June 2017, the Committee was comprised of the Chairman, three 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, and two Non-Independent Non-
Executive Directors. 
The Company became compliant with the Code on 2 October 2017 following 
the appointment of two Independent Non-Executive Directors, Andrew Didham 
and Richard Meddings.
C.3.1 The Board should establish an audit  
committee of at least three independent  
non-executive directors.
Throughout the year, the Committee was comprised of at least three 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, in addition to Lord Sassoon,  
a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director. 
D.2.1 The Board should establish a remuneration 
committee of at least three, independent non-
executive directors. 
Throughout the year, the Committee was comprised of at least three 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, in addition to Lord Sassoon and  
Adam Keswick, both of whom are Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Nominations Committee has led a formal and rigorous 
process to replace outgoing members of the Board. Every 
effort has been made to search for individuals with the talent 
and experience to complement the existing Board. As a result 
of that process, Andrew Didham and Richard Meddings were 
appointed as Independent Non-Executive Director on  
2 October 2017. Lynne Peacock has also been appointed  
as an Independent Non-Executive Director with effect from  
1 May 2018, and therefore the Board balance will comply with 
Code provision B.1.2 from that date. 
Since 1997, other than for three months in 2016, JLT has had 
two representatives of Jardine Matheson on the Board. Jardine 
Matheson has a 40.16% interest in the Company. As a result, 
the Jardine Matheson-appointed Directors are considered to 
be Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors. The relationship 
with Jardine Matheson is maintained on an arm’s length basis 
as detailed on page 66 and in note 32 on page 160. 
The Jardine Matheson-appointed Directors, Lord Sassoon 
and Adam Keswick, will be standing for re-election at the 
Company’s AGM. In addition to their Board roles, the Jardine 
Matheson-appointed Directors hold Committee memberships. 
Lord Sassoon is a member of the Audit & Risk, Nominations 
and Remuneration Committees and Adam Keswick is a 
member of the Nominations and Remuneration Committees.  92    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
JLT has always sought to satisfy shareholders with an 
appropriate explanation of any areas where it does not  
comply with the Code and to provide a full explanation for 
retaining the Jardine Matheson Directors on the Board and  
relevant Committees. The Board strongly believes that the 
continuation of these arrangements is in the best interests of 
the Company’s shareholders for the following reasons: 
• we believe our Board functions very well and has an 
appropriate combination of Independent and Non-
Independent Non-Executive Directors, in line with the 
Code’s principle that no individual or small group of 
individuals should be able to dominate the Board’s  
decision-making; 
• there are at least three (currently four) Independent 
Non-Executive Directors on each Committee and 
each Committee comprises a majority of Independent 
Directors. Committee effectiveness reviews confirm that 
each Committee is considered to operate, and discharge 
its duties and responsibilities, effectively as currently 
constituted;   
• the business and profits of JLT have grown significantly 
in recent years and we believe the overall contribution of 
Jardine Matheson and its nominated Directors has been 
material to this;
• Jardine Matheson has clearly demonstrated that it is a 
committed, long-term shareholder. We believe that its 
interests are fundamentally aligned to the interest of other 
shareholders. In the Board’s experience, over many years, 
conflicts of interest between Jardine Matheson and the 
other shareholders of JLT rarely occur, but if they do (for 
example where Jardine Matheson has sought to increase 
its shareholding in JLT) the Jardine Matheson-appointed 
Directors recuse themselves from any relevant discussions; 
• we believe that the continuing support of Jardine Matheson 
has been, and will continue to be, of great importance to 
the success of JLT, especially in Asia, a key growth market 
for the Company, where Jardine Matheson’s reputation and 
connections are of great value to us; and
• as individuals, Lord Sassoon and Adam Keswick bring  
skills and experience that complement the balance of 
the Board and its Committees, supporting an effective 
decision-making process and providing appropriate levels of 
challenge to the Executive management. 
The following table describes in more detail how we have 
complied with the respective provisions of the Code.

The Group aims to provide an environment where individuals

Regular briefings and consultation, using the JLT intranet 
where possible, keeps colleagues informed about the Group’s 
performance and matters that affect them as employees. 
Additionally we offer a wide range of benefits for colleagues 
including health and lifestyle benefits.
During 2017 JLT refreshed the Employee Handbook bringing 
together a number of in-force policies and ensuring that current 
employees and new joiners have valid information on their 
contractual terms and related JLT policies to hand. 
JLT operates a strict regulatory framework under which  
all colleagues are required to undertake, and complete, a 
number of training modules on an annual or biannual basis. 
The purpose of the regulatory training is to: refresh employees’ 
understanding and awareness of a number of core risks and the 
actions needed to manage them for the benefit of clients and 
JLT; help protect employees from breaching JLT Policy; and, 
for UK employees, aid them to comply with legal and regulatory 
requirements, including those of the Financial Conduct Authority 
and the UK Information Commissioner.

leadership at all levels of the organisation. 
Our recruitment and selection policy supports this as we focus 
on a candidate’s skills, experiences and potential within the 
business. Everyone is judged fairly on their merits. We promote 
fair and consistent treatment and ensure that colleagues are 
promoted and developed on the basis of their ability. 
We are committed to ensuring that disabled people are afforded 
equality of opportunity in respect of entering and continuing 
employment with us. If existing colleagues become disabled, 
every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the 
Group continues. If such colleagues are unable to continue to 
work, every effort is made to safeguard their financial interest. 
The Group aims to provide recruitment, training, development 
and promotion opportunities that are identical, as far as 
possible, for disabled and non-disabled colleagues.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as 
adopted by the European Union, and the parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law).
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
the Company, and of the profit or loss of the Group and the 
Company for that period.    Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017    95
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed for the group financial 
statements, and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the Company 
financial statements, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any 
time, the financial position of the Company and the Group,  
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and, 
hence, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy. Each of the Directors whose 
names and functions are listed on pages 58 and 59 confirms 
that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Company financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 "Reduced Disclosure 
Framework", and applicable law), give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of  
the Company; 
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; and
• the Strategic Report, contained in pages 2 to 55 of the 
Annual Report, includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces. 
Each Director as at the date of this Report, further confirms 
that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
JLT VIABILITY STATEMENT 
As prescribed by provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘UK Code’), the Board has conducted 
a detailed assessment of those risk events that could threaten 
JLT’s ability to continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over a three-year period. This time scale is believed to 
be appropriate for the following reasons:
• a three-year period aligns with JLT’s business and strategic 
planning process and the short business cycles associated 
with general insurance;
• given the environment JLT operates in, the use of any time 
period greater than three years means increasing the level of 
uncertainty over key assumptions used within the assessment;
• the stress and scenario tests are considered over a three 
year period (as applicable), a period which provides 
management with the opportunity to implement mitigations 
to return the business to ‘normal’ trading conditions; and
• difficulty or inability to accurately predict the nature and 
impact of environmental factors that could have a bearing  
on the Group with a crystallisation period in excess of  
three years.
The Company’s principal risks are at the heart of this rigorous 
assessment which included the following core components:
• Financial sensitivity testing – A series of key financial metrics 
are stressed, including levels of planned revenue, the 
development of key strategic operations, changes in foreign 
exchange and interest rates, and cash flow;
• Key risk testing – Assessing the impact of a combination of 
principal risks crystallising during the viability period. Risks 
captured within the scenario testing include Litigation  
(Non E&O), Information Security/Cyber, Privacy, Loss of 
Revenue, Bribery and Corruption and Competition; 96    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
• Reverse stress testing – Estimating the quantum of a loss, 
which may ultimately threaten the Company’s viability, if not 
effectively managed. This is then reviewed in the context  
of two of the key principal risks facing JLT, E&O risk and 
Cyber risk; and
• Principal risks & environmental factors – Reviewing 
the Company’s principal risks in the context of the key 
environmental factors and considerations over the next 
three years. These included key trends, issues, uncertainties 
(such as the regulatory environment and disruptive 
technology), known potentially impactful events and 
emerging risks (for example geopolitical risk).
The financial model incorporates the Group's 2018 budget, 
and a series of projections for 2019 to 2020. This model is the 
basis on which the results of stressing the firm’s cash flow and 
balance sheet are derived.
As a result of this assessment, the Directors can confirm it is 
their reasonable expectation that, over the next three years, 
the Company will continue to operate and meet its ongoing 
liabilities as they fall due.
This statement is underpinned by various mitigating factors 
including the Company’s control environment, capital 
requirements and resources, together with the quality and 
accessibility of its funding facilities.
GOING CONCERN 
The Strategic Report on pages 2 to 55 includes information 
on the Group structure, the performance of our businesses, 
the markets in which we operate and the principal risks and 
uncertainties faced by the business. The Financial Statements 
on pages 100 to 169 include information on our Group financial 
results, cash flow and balance sheet position.
The Directors have also considered the Group's cash flow 
projections, presented in the review of the budget for the full 
year to 31 December 2018, as well as work undertaken for the 
Viability Statement. The Directors are satisfied that these cash 
flow projections, taking into account reasonably possible risk 
sensitivities associated with these forecasts and the Group's 
current funding and facilities, alongside the Group's funding 
strategy, show that the Group will continue to operate and  
meet its liabilities for a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2017.
The Directors therefore consider it appropriate to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting (in accordance 
with “Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting" issued by the FRC  
in September 2014) in preparing the financial statements.
There has been no significant change in the financial or trading 
position of the Group since 31 December 2017.
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION 
Directors’ Indemnity and Insurance 
The Company provides the appropriate level of Directors’ 
and Officers’ Liability Insurance in respect of any legal actions 
brought against its Directors, in addition to the indemnity 
included in the Company’s Articles of Association. Neither the 
insurance nor the indemnity provides cover where the relevant 
Director or Officer acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 
SHARE CAPITAL 
The issued share capital of the Company and details of 
movements in the share capital are shown in note 24 to the 
financial statements. As at 31 December 2017, the issued share 
capital consisted of 220,181,007 ordinary shares of 5 pence 
each, of which 1,143,131 shares were held as treasury shares 
for which voting rights are not exercised.
The Company has one class of share capital, being ordinary 
shares of 5 pence each, and all the shares rank pari passu.  
The holders of ordinary shares on the record date are entitled to 
receive dividends. No person holds securities carrying special 
rights with regard to control of the Company. The shares are 
admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange and may be 
traded through the CREST system. 
The Board has the power to implement the purchase by the 
Company of its own shares in accordance with the power 
granted at the AGM each year, and will be seeking renewal of 
that power at the forthcoming AGM within the limits set out in 
the notice of that meeting. The Company did not purchase any 
of its own shares during the year. 
All the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating 
to a change of control. Outstanding options and awards would 
normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, 
subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions as 
may be appropriate at that time.
SHARES HELD IN TRUST 
As at 31 December 2017, the Jardine Lloyd Thompson 
Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust) held 7,557,229 shares in the 
Company representing 3.45% of the issued capital (excluding 
treasury shares). As of 22 February 2018 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to the date of this Report), the Trust held 
7,492,791 shares representing 3.42% of the issued capital 
(excluding treasury shares). 
In relation to LR 9.8.4R(12) and (13), the Trustees of the  
JLT Employee Benefit Trust agree to waive dividends on the 
shares held by the Trust to meet the awards under the long 
term incentive plans and the Senior Executive Share Scheme.    Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017    97
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS 
Shareholders can declare final dividends by passing an ordinary 
resolution, but the amount of the dividend cannot exceed the 
amount recommended by the Board.
The Board can pay interim dividends whenever the financial 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies 
such payment. The Board can withhold payment of all or any 
part of any dividend or other monies payable in respect of the 
Company’s shares from any person with a 0.25% interest (as set 
out in the Articles) if that person has been served with a notice 
after failure to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act (2006). The Directors may also retain any 
dividends payable on shares on which the Company has a lien, 
and may apply the same in or towards satisfaction of the debts, 
liabilities or engagements in respect of which the lien exists.
VOTING RIGHTS 
On a show of hands at a general meeting, every member 
present in person has one vote and on a poll, every member 
who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for each 
share held. In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of 
the senior holder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by 
proxy, will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other 
joint holders and, for this purpose, seniority will be determined 
by the order in which the names stand in the Register of 
Members in respect of the share. Voting rights in relation to 
treasury shares are suspended and the voting rights are not 
normally exercised in respect of the shares held in the Employee 
Benefit Trust, which are used to satisfy awards made under the 
Company’s share plans.
RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING 
No member, unless the Directors otherwise determine, is 
entitled to vote either in person or by proxy at any general 
meeting in respect of any shares held by the member if any call 
or other sum then payable by the member in respect of that 
share remains unpaid. In addition, no member is entitled to 
vote if the member has been served with a notice after failure to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests in 
those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act.
DEADLINES FOR VOTING
Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy or in relation to 
corporate members, by corporate representative. The Articles 
provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms of not less 
than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of 
the meeting or adjourned meeting, and the notice of AGM will 
specify the deadline for exercising voting rights.
A member that is a corporation may appoint an individual to 
act on its behalf at a general meeting or class meetings as 
a corporate representative. The person so authorised shall 
be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of such 
corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were an 
individual member of the Company.
VARIATION OF RIGHTS 
If, at any time, the capital of the Company is divided into 
different classes of shares then, subject to statute, the Articles 
specify that rights attached to any class of shares may be 
varied with the written consent of the holders of at least 75% 
in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the 
sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of the holders of those shares. At every such separate 
general meeting, the quorum is two persons holding or 
representing by proxy at least one third in nominal value of the 
issued shares of the class (calculated excluding any shares held 
as treasury shares).
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
Shareholders approved the authority for the Company to buy 
back up to 10% of its own ordinary shares by market purchase 
until the conclusion of the AGM to be held this year. We will not 
be seeking shareholder approval for a ‘Rule 9’ dispensation  
in relation to this authority pursuant to the Takeover Code.  
This means that in the event that the directors were to initiate 
a buy-back, in order to avoid triggering a mandatory offer 
obligation upon Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited (JMH) 
under Rule 37 of the Takeover Code, JMH would need to 
participate in any such buy-back so that its overall percentage 
holding (which at 22 February 2018 was 40.16%) did not 
increase following the buy-back.
Although the Company has not utilised the authority to buy 
back shares since 2008, the Board believes that it would 
be in the interests of all shareholders for the Company to 
continue to have the right to purchase its own shares in the 
market in appropriate circumstances. We would only exercise 
this authority if we believe that it is in the best interest of 
shareholders and would result in an improvement in earnings 
per share. 
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
The powers of the Directors are determined by UK legislation 
and the Articles of Association. The Directors are authorised 
to issue and allot shares, and to undertake purchases of 
Company shares, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM. 
Any amendment of the Articles requires shareholder approval in 
accordance with legislation in force from time to time. Copies 
will be available at the Company’s AGM and can also be 
accessed on the Group’s website: jlt.com.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
The 2018 AGM will be held at 12.00 noon on 1 May 2018 at the 
St Botolph Building, 138 Houndsditch, London EC3A 7AW. 
Full details will be included in the Notice of Meeting.  98    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR       
Following review, the Board proposes that

The scope of our audit
As 	 part 	 of 	 designing 	 our 	 audit, 	 we 	 determined 	 materiality 	 and	
assessed 	 the 	 risks 	 of 	 material 	 misstatement 	 in 	 the 	 financial 	
statements. 	 In 	 particular , 	 we 	 looked 	 at 	 wher e 	 the 	 dir ectors 	 made	
subjective 	 judgements, 	 for 	 example 	 in 	 r espect 	 of 	 significant 	
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 
framework applicable to the group and the industries in which 
it 	 operates, 	and 	consider ed 	 the	 risk	of	 acts	 by	the	 gr oup	which	
wer e	contrary	to	applicable	laws	 and 	 r egulations,	including	
fraud.	W e 	designed	 audit 	 pr ocedur es	at 	gr oup	 and 	 significant	
component	level 	to 	r espond 	to 	the	 risk, 	 r ecognising	that	the	 risk	
of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher 
than 	the 	risk	of	not	detecting 	 one	r esulting	fr om	 err or ,	 as 	 fraud	
may	involve	deliberate	concealment	 by,	for	 example,	forgery 	or	
intentional	misr epr esentations,	or 	thr ough 	 collusion.	W e	focused	
on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material 
misstatement 	in	the	 gr oup 	and	company	 financial	statements,	
including,	but	not	limited	 to, 	 the	Companies	Act	 2006, 	 
the	Listing	Rules,	Pensions	 legislation,	UK	 tax 	 legislation	and	
equivalent	local	laws	and 	r egulations 	applicable	to	 significant 	
component 	 teams.	Our	tests	 included, 	but 	wer e	not	limited	
to,	r eview 	of	the	 financial	statement	disclosur es 	to	 underlying	
supporting	documentation, 	r eview 	of	corr espondence 	with	
and	r eports 	 to	the	r egulators,	r eview	of	corr espondence 	with	
legal	advisors,	enquiries 	of 	 management, 	r eview	of	significant	
component auditors' work and review of internal audit reports 
in	so	 far 	 as	they	r elated 	to	the 	financial	statements.	Ther e 	 ar e	
inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and 
the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations 
is	fr om 	 the	events	and	 transactions 	r eflected 	in	the 	financial	
statements,	the	less 	likely	 we 	 would 	 become	awar e	of	it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to 
irr egularities, 	 including 	 fraud. 	As 	in	all 	 of 	 our 	audits 	we	also	
addr essed 	the	risk	 of 	 management	override 	of 	 inter nal	contr ols,	
including testing journals and evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of 
material misstatement due to fraud.

identified 	by	 our 	audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Complex and judgemental areas of revenue recognition
The significant accounting policies section of the financial statements 
discloses	JL T’ s 	r evenue	accounting 	 policy	 (r efer	to	 page 	 115).
Revenue is the largest balance in the group financial statements.  
The group has a number of revenue streams for which the timing and 
extent of revenue recognition is considered to be more complex or 
judgemental,	for	example,	 r evenue 	str eams 	with	 ongoing	performance	
conditions, 	long	term	 r evenue	 str eams	 which	generate 	significant	
accrued income balances and third party revenue sharing arrangements.
• We have performed walkthroughs of key controls relevant to material 
revenue streams and performed testing over these controls in order to 
obtain	comfort	over 	the 	 cut 	of f, 	 occurr ence 	and	accuracy	of	 r evenue	
around the group.
• We substantively tested the timing of recognising revenue in material 
revenue streams by reviewing and assessing contractual terms and 
performance obligations to customers.
• We substantively tested accrued and deferred revenue by evaluating 
the appropriateness of the key assumptions and considering the 
accuracy of prior year estimates against the current year realisation 
which did not identify unusual or irregular items.
• W e 	r eviewed 	 unusual	or	complex	contracts,	 for	example,	thir d 	party	
pay	away	arrangements,	 and 	 assessed 	 them 	 to 	ensur e 	ther e 	is	
appropriate revenue recognition in line with the terms of the contract.
Based on the results of our testing we did not identify any areas where we 
deemed revenue recognition was inappropriate.
Completeness and valuation of litigation provisions
As	at	31	December	2017, 	the	Gr oup 	had 	a	 litigation	pr ovision	of	 £6.3m	
(2016:	£7.4m).
The significant accounting policies section of the financial statements 
discloses	JL T’ s 	accounting	 policy	 in 	 r elation	to	 litigation	pr ovisions	(r efer	
to page 115) and Note 23 outlines the detailed provision disclosures.
There is an inherent level of uncertainty that surrounds litigation 
provisions in relation to potential and actual claims where clients or third 
parties believe there has been fault in the services provided.
Consequently a high degree of management judgement is involved in 
determining the level of provision required.
• We updated our understanding of management’s process to identify 
and evaluate provisions for potential and outstanding litigation for  
the group.
• We met with management to discuss new significant legal  
provisions as well as changes to significant existing potential and  
actual legal provisions.
• We reviewed the E&O register maintained by the Group Legal 
department as well as minutes of committee meetings.
• In	instances	 wher e	 exter nal 	 legal 	 counsel 	 was	engaged,	 we 	obtained 	
external confirmations.
• We substantively tested legal expenses across the Group to identify any 
other potential areas of unrecorded potential and actual claims.
• W e 	understood 	the 	 underlying	assumptions,	rationale	and	sensitivities	
having regard to the potential for bias.
• We considered the appropriateness of the judgements and sensitivities 
management have adopted to determine any significant legal 
pr ovisions,	as	well	as	 the 	r esulting 	disclosur es.
• We have reviewed the accuracy of management’s estimates in the prior 
years against actual settlements or current estimates.
Based on the work performed we found that the assumptions used were 
supported	by	 the 	evidence	we	obtained.	The	 natur e 	of	the	pr ovisions,	
being	determined	 on 	 an 	assessment	of 	legal	outcomes,	means	any	 final	
settlement 	is	subject 	to	significant	uncertainty.	The	r esults 	could	dif fer , 	
possibly	 materially, 	 fr om	the	amounts	pr ovided.   Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 103

Valuation and impairment of intangible assets
As	at	31 	December 	2017,	the	 gr oup	 had	 goodwill	of 	£577.8m	(2016:	
£543.0m)	and	intangible 	 assets	of 	£109.0m	(2016:	£102.0m).
The significant accounting policies section of the financial statements 
discloses JLT’s accounting policy in relation to goodwill and intangibles 
(r efer	to	page	113),	and	Notes	11	 and	 12 	 outline	the	 detailed	goodwill	
and intangible disclosures.
Based	on	the	r esults	of	their	impairment 	analysis,	management 	
determined there was headroom of the recoverable amount above the 
net	asset	value	in	each	of	 the	gr oup’ s	Cash	Generating	Units 	(‘CGUs’), 	
and therefore there was no impairment.
We focused on this area because the determination of whether or not 
certain elements of goodwill and intangible assets were impaired involves 
complex and subjective judgements by the Directors about the future 
results of the relevant parts of the business. Management calculates the 
r ecoverable 	 amount 	 by 	 using 	 a 	 value 	 in 	 use 	 (‘VIU’) 	 discounted 	 cash 	 flow	
model underpinned by key assumptions which are the terminal growth 
rates 	 and 	 weighted 	 average 	 cost 	 of 	 capital 	 (‘W ACC’) 	 by 	 CGU.
• W e 	 evaluated 	the	r esults 	of 	management’ s 	 impairment	assessment,	
including an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology 
used 	 to	 perform 	 this,	 and 	 performed 	 substantive	 testing	 of	 all 	 inputs	 into	
their valuation such as agreeing to the approved budgets and checking 
historical performance against the budget.
• We considered the appropriateness of the following key assumptions 
within management’s valuation: Terminal growth rates in the  
for ecasts 	by	comparing 	them	to	economic	and	industry	 for ecasts; 	
and WACC by assessing the cost of capital for the company and 
comparable organisations.
• We performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions  
set out above to ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions 
that either individually or collectively would be required for goodwill to 
be impaired.
Based on our testing we determined that the impairment assessment 
performed is reasonable based on the current business plans and 
historical performance for both goodwill and significant intangible assets.
Valuation of pension deficit
As	at	31 	December 	2017,	the	 net	pension	liability	 is 	 £169.3m	(2016:	
£198.4m).
The significant accounting policies section of the financial statements 
discloses JLT’s accounting policy in relation to the various pension 
arrangements 	 (r efer 	to	 page 	 115), 	 and	 Note	31	outlines	 the	detailed	
pension disclosures.
We focus on this area as the pension scheme obligation is highly 
sensitive to changes in the assumptions used within the model 
to calculate the valuation and subsequent charge or credit to the 
Statement	 of 	Other 	Compr ehensive 	Income	 (‘OCI’).
Those assumptions to which the liability is most sensitive are as follows:
• Discount	rate:	Under	IAS 	19,	 the	discount	rate	should	be	 set	with	
reference to the yield on high quality corporate bonds of term 
appropriate to the duration of the liabilities.
• Future rates of price inflation: the level of future pension payments is 
linked to price inflation indices. Various investment market statistics 
are used to form a view on the long term average rates of price retail 
and consumer price inflation.
• Post 	 r etir ement 	 mortality: 	 Scheme 	 specific 	 base 	 tables 	 ar e 	 used 	 with 	 an	
allowance for future improvements in life expectancy based on recent 
projections. These projections will depend on future expectations of 
improvements in life expectancy and are therefore uncertain.
• We tested the controls over the completeness and accuracy of pension 
scheme data on which the pension liability assumptions are based.
• We assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used by 
management including the key assumptions used to value the UK 
pension liabilities
 - Discount	rate: 	we	consider ed	 the 	appr opriateness 	 of	the	2.45%	
discount rate assumption used by reference to the iBoxx AA 15+ 
corporate bond index. We reviewed the adjustment made by 
management to match the duration of the liabilities and compared 
this to assumptions adopted by other schemes with a similar 
duration.
 - Inflation rate: we agreed the rates used by management for each of 
these elements to the Bank of England inflation curve.
 - Mortality: we considered the appropriateness of the base tables 
selected for use by management by reference to the mortality 
experience	analysis 	completed	by	 the 	UK	 Pension	Scheme 	T rustees 	
as part of the 2014 funding valuation.
From the evidence obtained we found the assumptions and methodology 
used to be appropriate. 
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough	work 	to	be 	able	 to	 give	 an 	 opinion	on	the 	financial	
statements	as	a	whole,	 taking 	 into	account	the 	structur e	of	
the	gr oup	and	the 	company, 	 the	 accounting 	pr ocesses	and 	
contr ols,	and	 the	industry	 in 	 which	they	 operate.
The group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main 
segments,	based	on	 the	 services	and	pr oducts 	 of fer ed:	 
Risk	& 	Insurance,	Employee	Benefits 	and	Head	 Of fice	&	 
Other operations. The Risk & Insurance business comprises 
JLT’s global specialist and reinsurance broking activities.  
The	Employee 	Benefits	 business 	 consists	of	 pension	
administration,	outsour cing 	and	employee 	benefits 	consultancy,	
healthcare and wealth management activities.
The	Head	 Of fice	&	Other	segment	consists	mainly	of	holding	
companies,	central	administration 	functions,	the	 Gr oup's	 
captive insurance companies and the Group’s investments  
in associates. 
Ther e	wer e	thr ee 	financially	 significant	components	made	up 	
of	JL T	 Specialty	Limited	(Risk	& 	Insurance),	JL T	Reinsurance	
Br okers 	Limited	 (Risk 	 &	Insurance),	and 	Jar dine 	Lloyd	
Thompson 	 Australia 	 Pty 	 Limited 	 and	its	contr olled	entities	(Risk	
& Insurance). In addition we selected 11 further reporting entities 
based on their size and risk characteristics for full scope audits 
of	their	financial	 information,	and 	two	further	r eporting 	 entities	for 	
specified	pr ocedur es. 	 104 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
T aken	together , 	the	territories	 and 	 functions	 wher e 	 we	
performed	our	audit	work	 accounted 	 for 	 73%	of 	gr oup	r evenue 	
and	77% 	of	underlying	pr ofit 	befor e 	tax.
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed at 
the	r eporting 	units	by	us, 	the	 gr oup	engagement	 team, 	 and	
component	auditors 	fr om 	 other 	 PwC 	 network	firms	 operating	
under our instruction. Where the work was performed by 
component	auditors,	 we	determined 	the	 level	of 	involvement 	we 	
needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be 
able	to 	conclude	whether	 suf ficient 	appr opriate 	 audit	evidence	
had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group 
financial	statements	 as	a	whole.
We issued instructions to each component engagement team. 
As part of the supervision process the group engagement team 
visited	JL T	 operations	in	Hong 	 Kong,	Colombia,	Brazil,	 the 	US,	
and the shared service operations in Mumbai. We have held 
regular planning and coordination calls with our component 
audit teams. During our half year review and year end audit we 
held weekly calls with each component audit team to ensure 
significant	audit 	and	 accounting	issues	wer e	discussed	and	
insights are shared in a timely manner. We have attended half 
year and year end results calls with local management and our 
component audit teams to understand the local businesses. 
W e 	 have	r eviewed 	 all 	inter -of fice	r eporting 	 submissions	fr om	
component audit teams. We have continued to undertake 
r emote 	 r eviews 	of	significant 	component	 work 	 papers, 	 this	year 	
reviewing Australia and the US.
Materiality
The	scope	of 	our 	 audit 	was 	 influenced	 by 	 our	application	of	materiality.	W e	set	certain	quantitative	 thr esholds 	for 	materiality.	 
These, 	 together 	with	 qualitative 	 considerations,	helped	us	to 	determine	the	 scope	of	our	audit	and 	the	natur e,	 timing	and 	extent	 of	
our 	 audit 	pr ocedur es	on	 the	individual 	financial	statement	line	items 	and	disclosur es	and 	in	evaluating	the	 ef fect 	of	misstatements,	
both	individually 	and	in	aggr egate 	 on 	 the	 financial	statements	as	 a	whole.
Based 	on	 our 	pr ofessional	 judgement,	 we	determined 	materiality	for 	the	financial	 statements 	 as	a	whole	as	follows:
For 	 each 	component	in	the 	scope	of 	our	 gr oup 	 audit,	 we	allocated 	a	materiality	that	is 	less	than	our	overall	gr oup	materiality.	 
The range of materiality allocated across components was between £0.5m and £7.0m. Certain components were audited to a local 
statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
W e 	 agr eed 	with	the 	 Audit	 Committee 	 that 	 we	 would 	 r eport	 to	them	misstatements 	identified	during 	our 	 audit	above	£470,000	
(Gr oup	audit)	(2016:	£438,000)	 and 	 £53,500 	 (Company 	 audit)	(2016:	£60,000) 	 as	well	as	 misstatements	below 	those 	 amounts	that, 	
in 	our 	 view , 	warranted	r eporting	 for 	 qualitative	 r easons.
Going concern
In	accor dance	with	ISAs	 (UK)	we 	r eport 	as	 follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £9.5m	(2016:	£8.6m).	 £1.1m	 (2016: 	 £1.2m).
How we determined it 5% 	 of	underlying	 pr ofit	befor e	tax, 	which	 comprises 	 pr ofit	
before tax adjusted for non-recurring exceptional items. 
0.5%	 of	net	assets.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
When reviewing financial performance management 
focus	on	underlying	pr ofit 	 (that	is, 	pr ofit 	befor e 	 tax	
excluding non-recurring exceptional items). It is this 
measure that is used both to discuss performance of 
the group with investors and in calculating employee 
bonuses and therefore we have concluded it is the most 
appropriate measure of performance against which to 
set our materiality benchmark.
As the company is the ultimate parent for the group 
and	does	not	actively 	trade,	pr ofit	is	 not 	seen	as	 a	key	
indicator . 	Consequently, 	net 	 assets 	 has	been	deemed 	
as an appropriate benchmark given the nature of the 
company being that of a holding company.
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements and the directors’ identification of any material uncertainties 
to the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern 
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.  
However ,	because	not	all	futur e 	events 	or	conditions	can	be	pr edicted,	
this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s and company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going 
Concer n 	in	 	 accor dance	with	 Listing	Rule	 9.8.6R(3) 	 is	materially 	
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.

REPOR TING 	ON	OTHER	INFORMA TION
The other information comprises all of the information in the 
Annual	Report	other 	than	 the	financial 	statements 	 and	our	
auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the 
other	information.	Our	 opinion 	 on	the	 financial	statements	 does	
not 	cover	the 	other	information	 and,	accor dingly, 	we 	do	not	
expr ess 	an 	audit	opinion	or , 	 except	to 	the	 extent 	 otherwise	
explicitly	stated	in	this	r eport,	 any	form	of 	assurance	 ther eon.
In	connection 	with	our	audit	 of	the 	financial	 statements, 	our	
r esponsibility	is	to	r ead 	 the	 other 	 information	and, 	in	doing	
so,	consider	whether	the 	other	information	 is	materially	
inconsistent	with	 the 	financial	statements	or 	our	 knowledge	
obtained	in	the	 audit,	or 	otherwise	appears	to 	be	materially	
misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or 
material 	misstatement,	we 	ar e	 r equir ed	to	 perform	pr ocedur es	
to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the 
financial	statements	 or	a	 material	misstatement 	of	 the	 other	
information.	If,	based	on	 the	work	 we	have	 performed,	we	
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information,	we	ar e 	r equir ed	to 	r eport 	that	fact. 	W e	 have	nothing	
to report based on these responsibilities.
W ith 	r espect	to 	the	Strategic	Report 	and	Dir ectors’	Report,	 
we also considered whether the disclosures required by the  
UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work 
undertaken 	in	the 	course	of	 the	 audit,	the	 Companies	Act	2006,	
(CA06),	ISAs	(UK)	and	the 	Listing	Rules	 of	 the	Financial	 Conduct	
Authority 	(FCA)	r equir e 	us	also	to 	r eport 	certain	 opinions	 and	
matters	as	described	below	 (r equir ed 	by	 ISAs	(UK) 	unless	
otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In	our	opinion, 	 based	on	 the	work	undertaken 	in	the	 course	
of	the 	audit,	the 	information	 given 	 in 	 the	Strategic 	Report	and 	
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is 
consistent 	 with	the	financial 	 statements	 and	has	been	pr epar ed 	
in 	accor dance	with	applicable	 legal	r equir ements.	 (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and 
company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, 	we 	did	not 	identify	any	 material	 misstatements	in 	the	
Strategic 	Report	and	Dir ectors’	 Report. 	(CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group 
and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The 	 dir ectors’ 	 confirmation	 on 	 pages 	 94 	 and 	 95 	 of 	 the 
Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of 	 the 	 principal 	 risks 	 facing 	 the 	 gr oup, 	 including 	 those 	 that	
would 	 thr eaten 	 its 	 business 	 model, 	 futur e 	 performance,	
solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on pages 95 and 96 of the Annual 
Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
gr oup,	over	what	period 	they 	 have	done	so	and 	why	they	
consider	that	 period	to	be	appr opriate,	and	their 		statement	
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities	as	they	fall	due 	over	the	period	 of 	 their	assessment,	
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary	qualifications 	or	assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of 
the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the group and statement 
in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review 
was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted 
of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process 
supporting	their 	statements;	checking	that	the	statements	ar e 	
in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate 
Gover nance 	Code 	 (the	“Code”);	and	considering	 whether 	the	
statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding 
of the group and company and their environment obtained in the 
course 	 of 	 the	audit. 	 (Listing 	Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to  
report when:
• The 	 statement 	 given 	 by 	 the 	 dir ectors, 	 on 	 pages 	 94 	 and 	 95, 	 that	
they 	 consider 	 the 	 Annual 	 Report 	 taken 	 as 	 a 	 whole 	 to 	 be 	 fair ,	
balanced 	 and 	 understandable, 	 and 	 pr ovides 	 the 	 information	
necessary for the members to assess the group’ s and 
company’ s 	 position 	 and 	 performance, 	 business 	 model	 
and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of  
the group and company obtained in the course of performing 
our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 69 and 70 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a 
departur e 	fr om 	a	r elevant	pr ovision 	 of 	the 	Code 	 specified,	
under 	the	 Listing 	Rules,	 for	r eview	by 	the	auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In	our	opinion,	the	part 	of 	 the	Dir ectors’	Remuneration	Report	 to	
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies 	 Act	2006.	(CA06) 106 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
RESPONSIBILITIES	FOR	THE	FINANCIAL	
STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities 	 set 	 out 	 on 	 pages 	 94 	 and 	 95, 	 the 	 dir ectors	
ar e 	 r esponsible 	 for 	 the 	 pr eparation 	 of 	 the 	 financial	 statements	
in accordance with the applicable framework and for being 
satisfied	 that 	 they 	 give 	 a 	 true 	 and 	 fair 	 view . 	 The 	 dir ectors 	 ar e	
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary 	 to 	 enable 	 the 	 pr eparation 	 of 	 financial	 statements	 
that 	 ar e 	 fr ee 	 fr om 	 material 	 misstatement, 	 whether 	 due 	 to 	 fraud	 
or error.
In	pr eparing 	 the	financial	statements,	 the	 dir ectors 	ar e 	
responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s 
ability 	 to	continue	as 	 a	going	 concer n,	 disclosing 	 as	applicable,	
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate	the 	gr oup 	or	the	 company	or	 to	 cease 	 operations,	 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the  
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether	the	financial 	 statements 	 as	a	 whole 	 ar e	fr ee	 fr om 	
material 	misstatement,	whether	 due 	 to	fraud	or 	err or , 	and 	to	
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance	is 	a 	high	level	 of	assurance, 	but 	is	not	 a	guarantee	
that 	 an	audit 	conducted 	 in 	 accor dance 	 with	 ISAs	(UK) 	
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material 	if,	individually	or	 in 	 the	aggr egate, 	they 	could	
r easonably 	be	expected 	 to	influence 	the 	economic 	 decisions	 of 	
users	taken	on	the 	basis	of 	these 	financial	 statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial	statements	 is 	 located	 on 	 the	 FRC’ s	website	 at:	www .

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
for the year ended 31 December 2017
BASIS 	OF	PREP ARA TION
Compliance with IFRS 
The 	 consolidated 	 financial	 statements 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 have 	 been 	 pr epar ed	
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted 	 by 	 the 	 Eur opean 	 Union 	 (IFRSs 	 as 	 adopted 	 by 	 the 	 EU) 	 and	
interpr etations 	 issued 	 by 	 the 	 IFRS 	 Interpr etations 	 Committee 	 (IFRS 	 IC) 	 and	
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to Companies reporting under IFRSs. 
The 	 financial	 statements 	 comply 	 with 	 IFRS 	 as 	 issued 	 by 	 the 	 Inter national	
Accounting 	 Standar ds 	 Boar d 	 (IASB).
Historical cost convention
The 	 consolidated 	 financial	 statements 	 have 	 been 	 pr epar ed 	 on 	 a	 
going 	 concer n 	 basis, 	 under 	 the 	 historical 	 cost 	 convention, 	 except 	 for	 
the following:
• available-for -sale 	 financial	 assets, 	 certain 	 financial	 assets 	 and 	 liabilities	
(including 	 derivative 	 financial	 instruments) 		 which 	 ar e 	 measur ed 	 at 	 fair	
value; 	 and
• defined	 benefit	 pension 	 plans 	 wher e 	 plan 	 assets 	 ar e 	 measur ed	 
at fair value.
ST ANDARDS, 	AMENDMENTS	AND	
INTERPRET A TIONS	EFFECTIVE	IN 	2017
No 	 new 	 standar ds, 	 amendments 	 or 	 interpr etations, 	 ef fective 	 for 	 the 	 first 	
time 	 for 	 the 	 financial	 year 	 beginning 	 on 	 or 	 after 	 1 	 January 	 2017 	 have 	 had	 
a material impact on the Group.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries 	 ar e 	 all 	 entities 	 (including 	 structur ed 	 entities) 	 over 	 which 	 the	
Group has control.
The 	 Gr oup 	 contr ols 	 an 	 entity 	 when 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 is 	 exposed 	 to, 	 or 	 has 	 rights	
to, 	 variable 	 r etur ns 	 fr om 	 its 	 involvement 	 with 	 the 	 entity 	 and 	 has 	 the 	 ability	
to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that 
control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for 
business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition 
of 	 a 	 subsidiary 	 is 	 the 	 fair 	 values 	 of 	 the 	 assets 	 transferr ed, 	 the 	 liabilities	
incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration 
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a 
contingent 	 consideration 	 arrangement. 	 Identifiable	 assets 	 acquir ed 	 and	
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an 
acquisition-by-acquisition 	 basis, 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 r ecognises 	 any 	 non-contr olling	
interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If 	 a 	 business 	 combination 	 is 	 achieved 	 in 	 stages, 	 the 	 fair 	 value 	 of 	 the	
Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair 
value 	 at 	 the 	 acquisition 	 date 	 thr ough 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised 
at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value 
of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability 
is 	 r ecognised 	 in 	 accor dance 	 with 	 IAS 	 39 	 either 	 in 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss 	 or 	 as 	 a	
charge to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is 
classified	 as 	 equity 	 is 	 not 	 r emeasur ed, 	 and 	 its 	 subsequent 	 settlement 	 is	
accounted for within equity.
The 	 excess 	 of 	 the 	 consideration 	 transferr ed, 	 the 	 amount 	 of 	 any 	 non-
controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any 
pr evious 	 equity 	 inter est 	 in 	 the 	 acquir ee 	 over 	 the 	 fair 	 value 	 of 	 the 	 identifiable 	
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration 
transferr ed, 	 non-contr olling 	 inter est 	 r ecognised 	 and 	 pr eviously 	 held 	 inter est	
measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary 
acquir ed 	 in 	 the 	 case 	 of 	 a 	 bargain 	 pur chase, 	 the 	 dif fer ence 	 is 	 r ecognised	
directly in the income statement.
Inter -company 	 transactions, 	 balances, 	 income 	 and 	 expenses 	 on	
transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Accounting 
policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Transactions with non-controlling interests
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of 
contr ol 	 ar e 	 accounted 	 for 	 as 	 equity 	 transactions 	 – 	 that 	 is, 	 as 	 transactions	
with the owners in their capacity as owners.
The difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the 
relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary 
is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling 
interests are also recorded in equity.
Disposal of subsidiaries
When 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 ceases 	 to 	 have 	 contr ol, 	 any 	 r etained 	 inter est 	 in 	 the 	 entity	
is 	 r e-measur ed 	 to 	 its 	 fair 	 value 	 at 	 the 	 date 	 when 	 contr ol 	 is 	 lost, 	 with 	 the	
change 	 in 	 carrying 	 amount 	 r ecognised 	 in 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of 
subsequently 	 accounting 	 for 	 the 	 r etained 	 inter est 	 as 	 an 	 associate, 	 joint	
ventur e 	 or 	 financial	 asset. 	 In 	 addition, 	 any 	 amounts 	 pr eviously 	 r ecognised	
in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for 
as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other 
compr ehensive 	 income 	 ar e 	 r eclassified	 to 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss.
Associates
Associates 	 ar e 	 entities 	 over 	 which 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 has 	 significant	 influence	 but	
not 	 contr ol, 	 generally 	 accompanying 	 a 	 shar eholding 	 of 	 between 	 20% 	 and	
50% 	 of 	 the 	 voting 	 rights. 	 Investments 	 in 	 associates 	 ar e 	 accounted 	 for	
using the equity method of accounting.
Under 	 the 	 equity 	 method, 	 the 	 investment 	 is 	 initially 	 r ecognised 	 at 	 cost, 	 and	
the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s 
shar e 	 of 	 the 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss 	 of 	 the 	 investee 	 after 	 the 	 date 	 of 	 acquisition.
The 	 Gr oup’ s 	 investment 	 in 	 associates 	 includes 	 goodwill 	 identified 	 
on acquisition.
If 	 the 	 ownership 	 inter est 	 in 	 an 	 associate 	 is 	 r educed 	 but 	 significant 	
influence	 is 	 r etained, 	 only 	 a 	 pr oportionate 	 shar e 	 of 	 the 	 amounts 	 pr eviously	
r ecognised 	 in 	 other 	 compr ehensive 	 income 	 is 	 r eclassified	 to 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss	
where appropriate.
The 	 Gr oup’ s 	 shar e 	 of 	 post-acquisition 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss 	 is 	 r ecognised 	 in 	 the	
income 	 statement, 	 and 	 its 	 shar e 	 of 	 post-acquisition 	 movements 	 in 	 other	
comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with 
a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. 
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its 
inter est 	 in 	 the 	 associate, 	 including 	 any 	 other 	 unsecur ed 	 r eceivables, 	 the	
Gr oup 	 does 	 not 	 r ecognise 	 further 	 losses, 	 unless 	 it 	 has 	 incurr ed 	 legal 	 or	
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates 
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 
of 	 the 	 associates 	 have 	 been 	 modified	 wher e 	 necessary 	 to 	 ensur e	
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.   Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 113

SEGMENT	REPOR TING
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating 	 decision-maker , 	 who 	 is 	 r esponsible 	 for 	 allocating 	 r esour ces 	 and

FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Functional and presentation currency 
Items 	 included 	 in 	 the 	 financial	 statements 	 of 	 each 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 entities	
are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which 	 the 	 entity 	 operates 	 (‘the 	 functional 	 curr ency’).
The 	 consolidated 	 financial	 statements 	 ar e 	 pr esented 	 in 	 Sterling, 	 which 	 is	
the Group’s functional and presentational currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency 
using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of 
such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
r ecognised 	 in 	 the 	 income 	 statement, 	 except 	 when 	 deferr ed 	 in 	 equity	
as 	 qualifying 	 cash 	 flow	 hedges 	 and 	 qualifying 	 net 	 investment 	 hedges.	
T ranslation 	 dif fer ences 	 on 	 non-monetary 	 items, 	 such 	 as 	 equities 	 held 	 at	
fair 	 value 	 thr ough 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss, 	 ar e 	 r eported 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 the 	 fair 	 value 	 gain	
or 	 loss. 	 T ranslation 	 dif fer ences 	 on 	 non-monetary 	 items, 	 such 	 as 	 equities	
classified	 as 	 available-for -sale 	 financial	 assets, 	 ar e 	 included 	 in 	 other	
comprehensive income.
Group companies
The 	 r esults 	 and 	 financial	 position 	 of 	 all 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 entities 	 (none 	 of 	 which	
has 	 the 	 curr ency 	 of 	 a 	 hyperinflationary	 economy) 	 that 	 have 	 a 	 functional	
currency different from the presentational currency are translated into the 
presentational currency as follows:
i)  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated 
at 	 the 	 closing 	 rate 	 at 	 the 	 date 	 of 	 that 	 balance 	 sheet;
ii)  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at 
average 	 exchange 	 rates 	 (unless 	 this 	 average 	 is 	 not 	 a 	 r easonable	
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the 
transaction 	 dates, 	 in 	 which 	 case 	 income 	 and 	 expenses 	 ar e 	 translated	
at 	 the 	 rate 	 on 	 the 	 dates 	 of 	 the 	 transactions); 	 and
iii)  all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
On consolidation exchange differences arising from the translation of 
net 	 investment 	 in 	 for eign 	 entities, 	 and 	 of 	 borr owings 	 and 	 other 	 curr ency	
instruments 	 designated 	 as 	 hedges 	 of 	 such 	 investments, 	 ar e 	 taken 	 to 	 other	
compr ehensive 	 income. 	 When 	 a 	 for eign 	 operation 	 is 	 sold, 	 such 	 exchange	
dif fer ences 	 ar e 	 r eclassified	 to 	 the 	 income 	 statement 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 the 	 gain 	 or	
loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
GOODWILL ARISING ON CONSOLIDATION
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair 
value 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 shar e 	 of 	 the 	 identifiable	 net 	 assets 	 of 	 the 	 acquir ed	
subsidiary/associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions 
of subsidiaries is shown separately on the Balance Sheet. Goodwill on 
acquisitions of associates is included in investments in associates.
Goodwill 	 is 	 not 	 amortised 	 but 	 it 	 is 	 tested 	 for 	 impairment 	 annually, 	 or 	 mor e	
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be 
impair ed, 	 and 	 is 	 carried 	 at 	 cost 	 less 	 accumulated 	 impairment 	 losses.	
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount 
of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash 
generating 	 units, 	 or 	 gr oups 	 of 	 cash 	 generating 	 units, 	 for 	 the 	 purpose 	 of	
impairment testing. Cash generating units represent the lowest level of 
geographical and business segment combinations that the Group uses for 
internal reporting purposes.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Computer software
Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of 
the costs incurred to acquire them and bring them to use. These costs 
are amortised over their estimated useful lives. Costs associated with 
maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an 
expense as incurred. 
Development costs that are directly associated with the production of 
identifiable	 and 	 unique 	 softwar e 	 pr oducts 	 contr olled 	 by 	 the 	 Gr oup, 	 and	
that 	 will 	 generate 	 economic 	 benefits	 exceeding 	 costs 	 beyond 	 one 	 year ,	
are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs include the software 
development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant 
overheads. Capitalised development costs are amortised over their 
estimated useful lives from the point when the asset is ready to use.
The 	 rates 	 of 	 amortisation 	 ar e 	 between 	 14% 	 and 	 100% 	 per 	 annum.
Capitalised employment contract payments
The Group makes payments to certain key employees in recognition of 
them 	 signing 	 a 	 long-term 	 employment 	 contract, 	 usually 	 thr ee 	 to 	 five	 years.	
These payments are capitalised as intangible assets since legal rights 
pr otect 	 the 	 expected 	 benefits	 that 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 will 	 derive 	 fr om 	 the 	 contracts.
The asset recognised is then amortised over the duration of the underlying 
contract within salaries and associated expenses.
Other
For 	 acquisitions 	 completed 	 after 	 1st 	 January 	 2004, 	 the 	 business 	 acquir ed	
is 	 r eviewed 	 to 	 identify 	 assets 	 that 	 meet 	 the 	 definition	 of 	 an 	 intangible	
asset 	 per 	 IAS 	 38. 	 Examples 	 of 	 such 	 assets 	 include 	 customer 	 contracts,	
expectations of business renewal and contract related customer 
relationships. These assets are valued on the basis of the present value 
of 	 futur e 	 cash 	 flows	 and 	 ar e 	 amortised 	 to 	 the 	 income 	 statement 	 over 	 the	
life of the contract or their estimated economic life. The current maximum 
estimated 	 economic 	 life 	 is 	 fifteen	 years.
IMP AIRMENT	OF	ASSETS
Goodwill 	 and 	 other 	 intangible 	 assets 	 that 	 have 	 an 	 indefinite	 useful 	 life 	 ar e	
not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets 
that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to 
sell 	 and 	 value-in-use. 	 For 	 the 	 purposes 	 of 	 assessing 	 impairment, 	 assets	
ar e 	 gr ouped 	 at 	 the 	 lowest 	 levels 	 for 	 which 	 ther e 	 ar e 	 separately 	 identifiable 	
cash 	 flows	 (cash-generating 	 units).
PROPER TY , 	PLANT	AND	EQUIPMENT
Assets 	 ar e 	 stated 	 at 	 their 	 net 	 book 	 amount 	 (historical 	 cost 	 less	
accumulated depreciation). Cost includes the original purchase price of 
the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use.

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of such assets over their 
estimated useful lives.
The principal rates of depreciation are as follows:
• 	 Fr eehold 	 land 	 and 	 buildings 	 - 	 between 	 0% 	 and 	 2% 	 per 	 annum.
• 	 Leasehold 	 impr ovements 	 - 	 between 	 10% 	 and 	 20% 	 per 	 annum 	 or	
over the life of the lease.
• 	 Fur nitur e 	 and 	 of fice	 equipment 	 - 	 between 	 10% 	 and 	 20% 	 per 	 annum.
• 	 Computer 	 har dwar e 	 - 	 between 	 20% 	 and 	 100% 	 per 	 annum.
• 	 Motor 	 vehicles 	 - 	 between 	 25% 	 and 	 33 	 1/3% 	 per 	 annum.
The depreciation rates are reviewed on an annual basis.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
The 	 Gr oup 	 classifies	 its 	 financial	 assets 	 as 	 loans 	 and 	 r eceivables 	 and	
available-for -sale 	 assets. 	 The 	 classification	 depends 	 upon 	 the 	 purpose 	 for	
which 	 the 	 financial	 assets 	 wer e 	 acquir ed. 	 Management 	 determines 	 the	
classification	 of 	 its 	 financial	 assets 	 at 	 initial 	 r ecognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans 	 and 	 r eceivables 	 ar e 	 non-derivative 	 financial	 assets 	 with 	 fixed	 or	
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
included 	 in 	 curr ent 	 assets, 	 except 	 for 	 maturities 	 gr eater 	 than 	 12 	 months	
after the balance sheet date.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables 
and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. Loans and 
receivables are carried at amortised cost.
Available-for-sale financial assets
A vailable-for -sale 	 financial	 assets 	 ar e 	 categorised 	 into 	 one 	 of 	 two	
categories:
1)	 Investments 	 and 	 deposits 	 consist 	 mainly 	 of 	 fixed	 term 	 deposits,	
bonds 	 and 	 certificates	 of 	 deposit. 	 These 	 investments 	 ar e 	 held 	 at 	 fair	
value 	 and 	 ar e 	 classified	 as 	 curr ent 	 or 	 non-curr ent 	 assets 	 depending	
on the maturity date.
2) Other investments include securities and other investments held for 
strategic purposes. These investments are held at fair value unless 
a fair value cannot be accurately determined in which case they are 
carried at cost less any provision for impairment. 
Interest on deposits and interest-bearing investments is credited in the 
income statement as it is earned.
Regular 	 pur chases 	 and 	 sales 	 of 	 financial	 assets 	 ar e 	 r ecognised 	 on 	 the	
trade date - the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the 
asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction 
costs. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive 
cash 	 flows	 have 	 expir ed 	 or 	 have 	 been 	 transferr ed 	 and 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 has	
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-
sale assets are subsequently carried at fair value.
The fair values of quoted investments are determined based upon current 
bid price.
When 	 securities 	 classified	 as 	 available-for -sale 	 ar e 	 sold 	 or 	 impair ed, 	 the	
accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in 
the income statement.
Interest on available-for-sale securities calculated using the effective 
inter est 	 method 	 is 	 r ecognised 	 in 	 the 	 income 	 statement 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 finance 	
income. Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised 
in 	 the 	 income 	 statement 	 as 	 part 	 of 	 finance	 income 	 when 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 right	
to receive payments is established.
Held-for-sale financial assets
Non-curr ent 	 assets 	 ar e 	 classified	 as 	 held-for -sale 	 if 	 their 	 carrying 	 amount	
will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition. 
Immediately 	 befor e 	 classification	 as 	 held 	 for 	 sale, 	 the 	 assets 	 ar e	
remeasured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. 
Ther eafter , 	 the 	 assets 	 (or 	 disposal 	 gr oup) 	 ar e 	 r ecognised 	 at 	 the 	 lower 	 of	
their 	 carrying 	 amount 	 and 	 fair 	 value 	 less 	 costs 	 to 	 sell. 	 Assets 	 classified	 as	
held-for -sale 	 ar e 	 not 	 depr eciated. 	 Impairment 	 losses 	 on 	 initial 	 classification 	
as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are 
included in the income statement.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in 
the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis 
or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally 
enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be 
enfor ceable 	 in 	 the 	 normal 	 course 	 of 	 business 	 and 	 in 	 the 	 event 	 of 	 default,	
insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.
INSURANCE BROKING RECEIVABLES AND 
P A Y ABLES
Insurance brokers act as agents in placing the insurable risks of their 
clients 	 with 	 insur ers 	 and, 	 as 	 such, 	 ar e 	 not 	 liable 	 as 	 principals 	 for 	 amounts	
arising 	 fr om 	 such 	 transactions. 	 In 	 r ecognition 	 of 	 this 	 r elationship, 	 debtors	
from insurance broking transactions are not included as an asset of the 
Group. Other than the receivable for fees and commissions earned on a 
transaction, 	 no 	 r ecognition 	 of 	 the 	 insurance 	 transaction 	 occurs 	 until 	 the	
Gr oup 	 r eceives 	 cash 	 in 	 r espect 	 of 	 pr emiums 	 or 	 claims, 	 at 	 which 	 time 	 a	
corresponding liability is established in favour of the insurer or the client.
In 	 certain 	 cir cumstances, 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 advances 	 pr emiums, 	 r efunds 	 or	
claims to insurance underwriters or clients prior to collection.
These 	 advances 	 ar e 	 r eflected	 in 	 the 	 consolidated 	 balance 	 sheet 	 as 	 part 	 of	
trade receivables.
TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at 
amortised 	 cost, 	 less 	 pr ovision 	 for 	 impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due 	 accor ding 	 to 	 the 	 original 	 terms 	 of 	 the 	 r eceivables. 	 Significant	 financial 	
dif ficulties	 of 	 the 	 debtor , 	 dispute, 	 default 	 or 	 delinquency 	 in 	 payments 	 ar e	
considered indicators that the receivable is impaired. 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an 
allowance 	 account, 	 and 	 the 	 amount 	 of 	 the 	 loss 	 is 	 r ecognised 	 in 	 the	
income statement.
When 	 a 	 trade 	 r eceivable 	 is 	 uncollectible, 	 it 	 is 	 written 	 of f 	 against 	 the	
allowance account for trade receivables.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash 	 and 	 cash 	 equivalents 	 include 	 cash 	 in 	 hand, 	 deposits 	 held 	 at 	 call	
with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Whilst held in the Group’s non-statutory trust accounts under appropriate 
client 	 money 	 r egulation, 	 fiduciary	 funds 	 held 	 ar e 	 contr olled 	 by 	 the 	 Gr oup	
and 	 economic 	 benefits	 ar e 	 derived 	 fr om 	 them. 	 As 	 such 	 these 	 funds 	 ar e	
recognised as an asset on the Group’s balance sheet.
TRADE	P A Y ABLES
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
measur ed 	 at 	 amortised 	 cost 	 except 	 for 	 contingent 	 considerations,	 
which is always measured at fair value based on the underlying criteria  
of each transaction.   Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 115
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
BORROWINGS
Borr owings 	 ar e 	 classified	 as 	 curr ent 	 liabilities 	 unless 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 has 	 an	
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the balance sheet date. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair 
value, 	 net 	 of 	 transaction 	 costs 	 incurr ed. 	 They 	 ar e 	 subsequently 	 stated 	 at	
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
DEFERRED INCOME TAX
The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year at current rates 
of tax and takes into account deferred tax. 
Deferr ed 	 income 	 tax 	 is 	 pr ovided 	 in 	 full, 	 using 	 the 	 liability 	 method, 	 on	
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities 	 and 	 their 	 carrying 	 amounts 	 in 	 the 	 consolidated 	 financial 	
statements. 	 However , 	 if 	 the 	 deferr ed 	 income 	 tax 	 arises 	 fr om 	 initial	
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor 	 taxable 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss, 	 it 	 is 	 not 	 r ecognised. 	 Deferr ed 	 income 	 tax	
is 	 determined 	 using 	 tax 	 rates 	 (and 	 laws) 	 that 	 have 	 been 	 enacted 	 or	
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax is charged or credited to equity in respect of any 
items, 	 which 	 is 	 itself 	 either 	 charged 	 or 	 cr edited 	 dir ectly 	 to 	 equity.
Any subsequent recognition of the deferred gain or loss in the 
consolidated income statement is accompanied by the corresponding 
deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that 	 futur e 	 taxable 	 pr ofit	 will 	 be 	 available 	 against 	 which 	 the 	 temporary	
differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments 	 in 	 subsidiaries 	 and 	 associates, 	 except 	 wher e 	 the 	 Gr oup	
controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it  
is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the  
foreseeable future.
EMPLOYEE	BENEFITS
Pension obligations
The 	 Gr oup 	 operates 	 a 	 number 	 of 	 defined	 benefit	 pension 	 schemes,	 
and 	 a 	 number 	 of 	 employees 	 ar e 	 members 	 of 	 defined	 contribution	 
pension schemes.
Full 	 actuarial 	 valuations 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 defined	 benefit	 schemes 	 ar e 	 carried	
out at least every three years.
A 	 qualified	 actuary 	 updates 	 these 	 valuations 	 to 	 31 	 December 	 each 	 year .	
For 	 the 	 purposes 	 of 	 these 	 annual 	 updates, 	 scheme 	 assets 	 ar e 	 included	
at market value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis 
using 	 the 	 pr ojected 	 unit 	 cr edit 	 method; 	 these 	 liabilities 	 ar e 	 discounted 	 at	
the current rate of return of a high quality corporate bond of equivalent 
curr ency 	 and 	 term. 	 The 	 defined	 benefit	 surplus 	 or 	 deficit	 is 	 calculated 	 as	
the 	 pr esent 	 value 	 of 	 defined	 benefit	 obligations 	 less 	 the 	 fair 	 value 	 of 	 the	
plan assets and is included on the Group’s balance sheet. Surpluses are 
included only to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced 
contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes. The net 
inter est 	 on 	 the 	 defined	 benefit	 surplus/deficit	 is 	 included 	 within 	 finance 	
costs. 	 Actuarial 	 gains 	 and 	 losses, 	 including 	 dif fer ences 	 between 	 the	
expected 	 and 	 actual 	 r etur n 	 on 	 scheme 	 assets, 	 ar e 	 r ecognised 	 thr ough 	 the	
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
A 	 defined	 contribution 	 plan 	 is 	 a 	 pension 	 plan 	 under 	 which 	 the 	 Gr oup	
pays 	 fixed	 contributions 	 into 	 a 	 separate 	 entity. 	 The 	 Gr oup 	 has 	 no 	 legal	
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does 
not 	 hold 	 suf ficient	 assets 	 to 	 pay 	 all 	 employees 	 the 	 benefits	 r elating 	 to	
employee service in the current and prior periods. 
The 	 costs 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 defined	 contribution 	 pension 	 schemes 	 ar e	
charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
Share-based compensation
The 	 Gr oup 	 operates 	 a 	 number 	 of 	 equity-settled, 	 shar e-based	
compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined 
by 	 r efer ence 	 to 	 the 	 fair 	 value 	 of 	 the 	 options 	 granted, 	 excluding 	 the	
impact 	 of 	 any 	 non-market 	 vesting 	 conditions 	 (for 	 example, 	 pr ofitability 	
and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become 
exer cisable. 	 At 	 each 	 balance 	 sheet 	 date, 	 the 	 entity 	 r evises 	 its 	 estimates 	 of	
the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.  
It 	 r ecognises 	 the 	 impact 	 of 	 the 	 r evision 	 of 	 original 	 estimates, 	 if 	 any,	 
in 	 the 	 income 	 statement, 	 and 	 a 	 corr esponding 	 adjustment 	 to 	 equity.	
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs 
ar e 	 cr edited 	 to 	 shar e 	 capital 	 (at 	 nominal 	 value) 	 and 	 shar e 	 pr emium 	 (excess	
over nominal value) when the options are exercised.
PROVISIONS	FOR 	LIABILITIES	AND	CHARGES
A 	 pr ovision 	 is 	 r ecognised 	 wher e 	 ther e 	 is 	 a 	 pr esent 	 obligation, 	 whether	
legal 	 or 	 constructive, 	 as 	 a 	 r esult 	 of 	 a 	 past 	 event 	 for 	 which 	 it 	 is 	 pr obable	
that 	 a 	 transfer 	 of 	 economic 	 benefits	 will 	 be 	 r equir ed 	 to 	 settle 	 the 	 obligation	
and a reasonable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Where appropriate the Group discounts provisions to their present value. 
The unwinding of the provision discounting is included as an interest 
expense 	 within 	 finance	 costs 	 in 	 the 	 income 	 statement.
REVENUE
Fees and commissions
Fees and commissions are derived from three principal sources:
Insurance broking
Income relating to insurance broking is accounted for at the later of  
policy inception date or when the policy placement has been completed 
and 	 confirmed. 	
Where there is an expectation of future servicing requirements an element 
of income relating to the policy is deferred to cover the associated 
contractual obligation.
Employee benefits
Income 	 r elating 	 to 	 employee 	 benefits	 services 	 includes 	 fees 	 and	
commissions. 	 Fees 	 ar e 	 charged 	 on 	 a 	 time-cost 	 or 	 fixed-fee	 basis 	 and	
are recognised in line with the performance of the underlying service. 
Commission 	 is 	 r ecognised 	 upon 	 confirmation	 of 	 the 	 underlying 	 policy	 
or product.
Other services
Fees and other income receivable are recognised in the period to which 
they relate and when they can be measured with reasonable certainty.
Investment income
Investment income arises from the holding of cash and investments 
r elating 	 to 	 fiduciary	 funds 	 and 	 is 	 r ecognised 	 on 	 an 	 accruals 	 basis.
EXCEPTIONAL	ITEMS
Exceptional 	 items 	 ar e 	 separately 	 identified	 to 	 pr ovide 	 gr eater	
understanding 	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 underlying 	 performance. 	 Items 	 classified

position of the Group these items are summarised within the operating 
pr ofit,	 note 	 3 	 on 	 page 	 122, 	 under 	 the 	 heading 	 “Exceptional 	 items”.
LEASES
Assets 	 held 	 under 	 leasing 	 agr eements, 	 which 	 transfer 	 substantially 	 all 	 the	
risks 	 and 	 r ewar ds 	 of 	 ownership 	 to 	 the 	 Gr oup, 	 ar e 	 included 	 in 	 pr operty,	
plant and equipment. The capital elements of the related lease obligations 
are included in liabilities. The interest elements of the lease obligations are 
charged to the income statement over the period of the lease term.
The	pr operty,	plant 	and	 equipment 	 acquir ed 	under 	finance	leases	is	
depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the  
lease term.
Leases 	 in 	 which 	 a 	 significant	 portion 	 of 	 the 	 risks 	 and 	 r ewar ds 	 of 	 ownership	
ar e 	 r etained 	 by 	 the 	 lessor 	 ar e 	 classified	 as 	 operating 	 leases. 	 Payments	
made 	 under 	 operating 	 leases 	 (net 	 of 	 any 	 incentives 	 r eceived 	 fr om 	 the	
lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the period of the lease.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The 	 Gr oup 	 only 	 enters 	 into 	 derivative 	 financial	 instruments 	 in 	 or der 	 to	
hedge 	 underlying 	 financial	 and 	 commer cial 	 exposur es.
Derivative 	 financial	 instruments 	 ar e 	 initially 	 r ecognised 	 at 	 fair 	 value 	 on	
the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-
measured at their fair value. 
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss is dependent on the 
nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value  
of 	 a 	 r ecognised 	 asset 	 or 	 liability 	 (fair 	 value 	 hedge), 	 a 	 hedge 	 of 	 a	 
for ecasted 	 transaction 	 or 	 of 	 the 	 for eign 	 curr ency 	 risk 	 on 	 a 	 firm 	
commitment 	 (cash 	 flow	 hedge), 	 or 	 a 	 hedge 	 of 	 a 	 net 	 investment 	 in 	 a	 
for eign 	 entity 	 (net 	 investment 	 hedges).
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as 
fair 	 value 	 hedges 	 and 	 that 	 ar e 	 highly 	 ef fective, 	 ar e 	 r ecor ded 	 in 	 the 	 income	
statement, 	 along 	 with 	 any 	 changes 	 in 	 the 	 fair 	 value 	 of 	 the 	 hedged 	 asset 	 or	
liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify 
as 	 cash 	 flow	 hedges 	 and 	 that 	 ar e 	 highly 	 ef fective, 	 ar e 	 r ecognised 	 in	
equity. 	 Wher e 	 the 	 for ecasted 	 transaction 	 or 	 firm	 commitment 	 r esults 	 in	
the 	 r ecognition 	 of 	 a 	 non-financial	 asset 	 or 	 of 	 a 	 non-financial	 liability, 	 the	
gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity 
and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. 
Otherwise, 	 amounts 	 deferr ed 	 in 	 equity 	 ar e 	 transferr ed 	 to 	 the 	 consolidated	
income 	 statement 	 and 	 classified	 as 	 income 	 or 	 expense 	 in 	 the 	 same	
periods 	 during 	 which 	 the 	 hedged 	 firm	 commitment 	 or 	 for ecasted	
transaction affects the income statement.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
When 	 a 	 hedging 	 instrument 	 expir es 	 or 	 is 	 sold, 	 any 	 cumulative 	 gain 	 or	
loss existing in equity at that time remains in the hedging reserves and 
is 	 r eclassified	 to 	 the 	 income 	 statement 	 when 	 a 	 hedge 	 no 	 longer 	 meets	
the criteria for hedge accounting or when the committed or forecasted 
transaction ultimately occurs. When a committed or forecasted transaction 
is 	 no 	 longer 	 expected 	 to 	 occur , 	 the 	 cumulative 	 gain 	 or 	 loss 	 that 	 was	
reported in equity is immediately recognised in the income statement.
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION
Dividends proposed or declared after the balance sheet date are not 
recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date. Final dividends are 
recognised as a charge to equity once approved and interim dividends are 
charged once paid.
FINANCIAL	AND	CAPIT AL 	RISK 	MANAGEMENT
The 	 Gr oup’ s 	 exposur e 	 to 	 financial	 risks 	 and 	 its 	 financial	 and 	 capital	
management policies are detailed in the Finance Director’s Review and the 
Risk Management Report on pages 38 to 45.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND 
JUDGMENTS
Estimates 	 and 	 judgments 	 used 	 in 	 pr eparing 	 the 	 financial	 statements 	 ar e	
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other 
factors, 	 including 	 expectations 	 of 	 futur e 	 events 	 that 	 ar e 	 believed 	 to 	 be	
r easonable. 	 The 	 r esulting 	 accounting 	 estimates 	 will, 	 by 	 definition,	 seldom	
equal the related actual results.
The 	 estimates 	 and 	 assumptions 	 that 	 have 	 a 	 significant	 ef fect 	 on 	 the	
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
a) Fair value estimation
The 	 fair 	 value 	 of 	 financial	 instruments 	 traded 	 in 	 active 	 markets 	 (such 	 as	
available-for-sale) is based upon quoted market prices at the balance 
sheet 	 date. 	 The 	 quoted 	 market 	 price 	 used 	 for 	 financial	 assets 	 held 	 by 	 the	
Group is the current bid price.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and 
payables are assumed to approximate their fair values. The fair values of 
financial	 liabilities 	 ar e 	 estimated 	 by 	 discounting 	 the 	 futur e 	 contractual 	 cash	
flows	 at 	 the 	 curr ent 	 market 	 inter est 	 rate 	 that 	 is 	 available 	 to 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 for	
similar 	 financial	 instruments.
The fair value of acquired intangible assets is estimated based upon the 
pr esent 	 value 	 of 	 modelled 	 r elated 	 expected 	 futur e 	 cash 	 flows.
Judgement 	 may 	 be 	 applied 	 in 	 the 	 determination 	 of 	 the 	 gr owth 	 rates,	
discount 	 rates 	 and 	 the 	 expected 	 cash 	 flows.
b) Impairment of assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill and other assets that have 
indefinite	 useful 	 lives 	 suf fer ed 	 any 	 impairment. 	 Other 	 assets 	 ar e 	 r eviewed	
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is 
determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of 
management’s assumptions and estimates. This determination requires 
significant	 judgment. 	 In 	 making 	 this 	 judgment, 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 evaluates,	
among 	 other 	 factors, 	 the 	 duration 	 and 	 extent 	 to 	 which 	 the 	 fair 	 value 	 of 	 an	
investment 	 is 	 less 	 than 	 its 	 cost; 	 and 	 the 	 financial	 health 	 of 	 and 	 near -term	
business 	 outlook 	 for 	 the 	 investment, 	 including 	 factors 	 such 	 as 	 industry	
and 	 sector 	 performance, 	 changes 	 in 	 r egional 	 economies 	 and 	 operational	
and 	 financing	 cash 	 flow .
c) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. 
Significant	judgement	is	 r equir ed	 in 	 determining 	the	worldwide 	pr ovision	
for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for 
which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary 
course 	of	 business.	Wher e 	 the 	final	tax	 outcome	of	 these	 matters	 is	
dif fer ent	fr om	the	amounts	that 	wer e 	initially 	r ecor ded, 	such	 dif fer ences	
will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in 
which such determination is made.
d) Pension obligations
The present value of pension obligations depends on a number of factors 
that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.
The assumption used in determining the net cost or income for pension 
obligations is a discount rate based upon high quality corporate bonds.   Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017 117
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Any changes in the assumptions may impact the carrying amount of 
pension 	 obligations, 	 the 	 charge 	 in 	 the 	 income 	 statement, 	 or 	 statement 	 of	
comprehensive income.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each 
year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present 
value 	 of 	 estimated 	 futur e 	 cash 	 outflows	 expected 	 to 	 be 	 r equir ed 	 to 	 settle	
the pension obligations.
In 	 determining 	 the 	 appr opriate 	 discount 	 rate, 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 considers 	 the	
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in 
the 	 curr ency 	 in 	 which 	 the 	 benefits	 will 	 be 	 paid, 	 and 	 that 	 have 	 terms 	 to	
maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Other 
key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current 
market 	 conditions. 	 As 	 well 	 as 	 the 	 discount 	 rate, 	 the 	 inflation	 rates 	 and 	 life	
expectancy are also key assumptions. 
T o 	 set 	 the 	 price 	 inflation	 assumptions 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 considers 	 market	
expectations 	 of 	 inflation	 at 	 the 	 appr opriate 	 durations. 	 Adjustments 	 ar e	
made 	 to 	 these 	 rates 	 wher e 	 necessary 	 to 	 r eflect	 an 	 inflation	 risk 	 pr emium.
In determining the life expectancy assumptions the Group considers the 
mortality assumptions used by the Trustees of the pension schemes in their 
latest actuarial valuations and also mortality guidance laid out by legislation. 
This enables the Group to determine a best estimate of life expectancy that 
is appropriate for accounting purposes.
e) Litigation and other provisions
During the ordinary course of business the Group can be subject to claims 
for errors and omissions made in connection with its broking activities.
A balance sheet provision is established in respect of such claims when it 
is probable that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability 
can be reasonably estimated.
The 	 Gr oup 	 analyses 	 its 	 litigation 	 exposur es 	 based 	 on 	 available 	 information,	
including 	 exter nal 	 legal 	 consultation 	 wher e 	 appr opriate, 	 to 	 assess 	 its	
potential liability.
The outcome of the currently pending and future proceedings cannot be 
pr edicted 	 with 	 certainty. 	 Thus, 	 an 	 adverse 	 decision 	 in 	 a 	 curr ent 	 or 	 futur e	
lawsuit 	 could 	 r esult 	 in 	 additional 	 costs 	 that 	 ar e 	 not 	 cover ed, 	 either 	 wholly	
or 	 partially, 	 under 	 insurance 	 policies 	 and 	 ar e 	 in 	 excess 	 of 	 the 	 pr esently	
established 	 pr ovisions. 	 It 	 is 	 possible 	 ther efor e 	 that 	 the 	 financial	 position,	
r esults 	 of 	 operations 	 or 	 cash 	 flows	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 could 	 be 	 materially 	 af fected	
by the unfavourable outcome of litigation.
FUTURE	 DEVELOPMENTS
The following standards have been published but are not mandatory for 
31 December 2017 reporting period and the Group has not adopted them 
early.
IFRS 9, (‘Financial instruments’)
IFRS 	 9 	 addr esses 	 the 	 classification,	 measur ement 	 and 	 r ecognition 	 of	
financial	 assets 	 and 	 financial	 liabilities. 	 The 	 standar d 	 is 	 ef fective 	 for 	 annual	
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. It replaces the guidance 
in 	 IAS 	 39 	 that 	 r elates 	 to 	 the 	 classification	 and 	 measur ement 	 of 	 financial 	
instruments. 	 IFRS 	 9 	 r etains 	 but 	 simplifies	 the 	 mixed 	 measur ement 	 model	
and 	 establishes 	 thr ee 	 primary 	 measur ement 	 categories 	 for 	 financial	 assets:	
amortised 	 cost, 	 fair 	 value 	 thr ough 	 other 	 compr ehensive 	 income 	 (OCI) 	 and	
fair 	 value 	 thr ough 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss.
The 	 basis 	 of 	 classification	 depends 	 on 	 the 	 entity’ s 	 business 	 model 	 and 	 the	
contractual 	 cash 	 flow	 characteristics 	 of 	 the 	 financial	 asset. 	 Investments 	 in	
equity 	 instruments 	 ar e 	 r equir ed 	 to 	 be 	 measur ed 	 at 	 fair 	 value 	 thr ough 	 pr ofit	 or	
loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value 
in OCI not recycling. The Group does not expect any material change in the 
measur ement 	 of 	 its 	 financial	 assets 	 and 	 liabilities.
There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred 
loss 	 impairment 	 model 	 used 	 in 	 IAS 	 39. 	 Under 	 IFRS 	 9, 	 it 	 is 	 not 	 necessary	
for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. 
The new impairment model will mainly affect the Group’s trade receivables 
and 	 contract 	 assets. 	 The 	 Gr oup 	 expects 	 to 	 apply 	 the 	 simplified	 appr oach	
to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for its trade receivables and 
contract assets. The impact on 2017 opening retained earnings and on the 
2017 results is not expected to be material.
For 	 financial	 liabilities 	 ther e 	 wer e 	 no 	 changes 	 to 	 classification	 and	
measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk  
in 	 OCI, 	 for 	 liabilities 	 designated 	 at 	 fair 	 value 	 thr ough 	 pr ofit	 or 	 loss 	 unless	
such presentation would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in  
pr ofit	 or 	 loss.
On 	 initial 	 application 	 of 	 IFRS 	 9, 	 an 	 entity 	 may 	 elect, 	 as 	 its 	 accounting 	 policy	
to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 instead 
of the hedge accounting requirements of the new standard. IFRS 9 relaxes 
the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge 
effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the 
hedged 	 item 	 and 	 hedging 	 instrument 	 and 	 for 	 the 	 ‘hedged 	 ratio’ 	 to 	 be 	 the	
same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. 
Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that 
currently prepared under IAS 39. The changes to the hedge accounting 
requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
IFRS 15, (‘Revenue from contracts with customers’)
IFRS 	 15 	 addr esses 	 r evenue 	 r ecognition 	 for 	 customer 	 contracts, 	 with	
particular focus on aligning revenue recognition with the separate and 
distinct performance obligations to the customer. The standard replaces 
IAS 	 18 	 (‘Revenue’) 	 and 	 IAS 	 11 	 (‘Construction 	 Contracts’) 	 and 	 r elated	
interpr etations. 	 IFRS 	 15 	 includes 	 pr escriptive 	 guidance 	 to 	 deal 	 with 	 specific 	
scenarios and requires more extensive disclosures.
IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
The 	 Gr oup 	 will 	 r eport 	 its 	 financial	 r esults 	 on 	 this 	 basis 	 for 	 the 	 half 	 year 	 period	
ending 	 30 	 June 	 2018, 	 and 	 full 	 year 	 period 	 ending 	 31 	 December 	 2018, 	 as	
well as restated comparative results for these periods.
The new standard requires that revenue is only recognised when the 
performance 	 obligation 	 has 	 been 	 satisfied	 and 	 the 	 customer 	 obtains 	 contr ol	
of 	 the 	 asset. 	 Under 	 existing 	 accounting 	 policies, 	 the 	 primary 	 trigger 	 for	
revenue recognition in the Group’s Risk and Insurance business is the later 
of 	 policy 	 inception 	 date, 	 or 	 the 	 date 	 on 	 which 	 the 	 placement 	 is 	 completed	
and 	 confirmed	 to 	 the 	 customer . 	 This 	 r emains 	 the 	 same 	 under 	 the 	 new	
standard. In certain service agreements this will defer the recognition 
of 	 r evenue 	 compar ed 	 to 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 curr ent 	 policy, 	 but 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 will	
r ecognise 	 a 	 fulfilment	 cost 	 asset 	 for 	 work 	 performed 	 wher e 	 such 	 cost 	 is	
expected to be recovered.
The 	 Gr oup 	 defers 	 some 	 elements 	 of 	 r evenue 	 curr ently, 	 primarily 	 to	
r eflect	 anticipated 	 claims 	 handling 	 activity. 	 This 	 will 	 continue 	 under 	 the	
new 	 standar d, 	 but 	 will 	 be 	 r e-measur ed. 	 In 	 addition, 	 the 	 Gr oup 	 will 	 now	
r ecognise 	 a 	 deferral 	 against 	 cancellation, 	 which 	 under 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 curr ent	
policy is recognised at the point of cancellation. The Group will also defer 
revenue in respect of other performance obligations that are separate and 
distinct, 	 which 	 is 	 not 	 expected 	 to 	 be 	 significant.
The new standard introduces the recognition of those costs that are 
dir ectly 	 attributable 	 to 	 obtaining 	 the 	 contract, 	 wher e 	 these 	 ar e 	 expected 	 to	
be recovered. This is a new requirement for the Group and will create the 
r ecognition 	 of 	 a 	 new 	 set 	 of 	 assets, 	 which 	 will 	 then 	 be 	 amortised 	 to 	 match	
the recognition of revenue. Under the Group’s current policy these costs 
have been expensed as incurred.
The 	 Balance 	 Sheet 	 will 	 intr oduce 	 new 	 classifications	 being 	 contract 	 assets	
and liabilities.
W ork 	 continues 	 on 	 the 	 r efinement	 of 	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	 policy, 	 but 	 it 	 is 	 expected	
that the change will result in a reduction of the Group’s 2017 opening 
r etained 	 ear nings 	 in 	 the 	 range 	 of 	 £33 	 to 	 £37 	 million, 	 a 	 r eduction 	 in 	 the 	 2017	
pr ofit	 befor e 	 tax 	 of 	 appr oximately 	 £4.5 	 million 	 and 	 a 	 r eduction 	 in 	 pr ofit	 after	
tax 	 of 	 appr oximately 	 £3.5 	 million. 	 Cash 	 flows	 will 	 be 	 unalter ed.
IFRS 16 – Leases
IFRS 	 16 	 r equir es 	 lessees 	 to 	 r ecognise 	 a 	 lease 	 liability 	 r eflecting	 futur e 	 lease	
payments 	 and 	 a 	 ‘right-of-use 	 asset’ 	 for 	 virtually 	 all 	 lease 	 contracts. 	 This	
dif fers 	 fr om 		 IAS 	 17 	 ‘Leases’ 	 wher e 	 a 	 distinction 	 between 	 a 	 finance	 lease	
(on 	 balance 	 sheet) 	 and 	 an 	 operating 	 lease 	 (of f 	 balance 	 sheet) 	 was 	 r equir ed.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2019 and earlier application is permitted. The Group is in the process of 
assessing IFRS 16’s full impact.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
2. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Management has determined its operating segments based on the analysis used to make strategic decisions.
BUSINESS SEGMENT ANALYSIS
The Group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main segments: Risk & Insurance, Employee Benefits and Head Office & Other operations. 
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting structure of the Group.
The Risk & Insurance segment comprises JLT’s global specialist and reinsurance broking activities.
The Employee Benefits segment consists of pension administration, outsourcing and employee benefits consultancy, healthcare and wealth 
management activities. Certain Risk & Insurance and Employee Benefits operating segments have been disclosed within the reporting segments 
given their individual size. The Head Office & Other segment consists mainly of holding companies, central administration functions, the Group’s 
captive insurance companies and the Group’s investments in associates.
Following the disposal of Thistle in 2016, the majority of what was classified as JLT Insurance Services, plus Northern Europe which was previously 
in JLT Europe, Middle East and Africa, both included in Other Risk & Insurance in the 2016 financial year, now together with JLT Specialty, form the 
business group JLT Europe. Prior period numbers have been restated to reflect this change.
JLT Re principal locations include North America, the United Kingdom and Asia.
SEGMENT RESULTS
Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based upon a measure of underlying trading profit. Segment results include the 
net income or expense derived from the trading activities of the segment together with the investment income earned on fiduciary funds. Interest 
income on the Group’s own funds and finance costs are excluded since the trading activities of the Group’s primary segments are not of a financial 
nature. Income tax expense and the charge in respect of non-controlling interests are excluded from the segmental allocation.
SEGMENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Assets and liabilities are not allocated to individual segments and are therefore all reported within Head Office & Other.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES
The Group owns the following stakes in its principal associates: 20% of GrECo, which operates mainly in Austria and Eastern Europe; 25% of MAG 
JLT, which operates mainly in Italy and 25% of March-JLT, which operates mainly in Spain. The investment and the Group’s share of the net results of 
these associates are included in the Head Office & Other segment, together with the investment and results of the Group’s other associates, Sterling 
Re Intermediaro de Reaseguro SA de CV, JLT Insurance Management Malta, JLT Energy (France) SAS and JLT Independent Insurance Brokers 
Private Ltd.
Subject to local regulations, the Group agreed to the disposal of its Mexican associate, Sterling Re Intermediaro de Reaseguro SA de CV,  
in December 2017. Details of the transactions are provided on page 134.

 7,474 4,730
The Group’s investment income arises from its holdings of cash and investments relating to fiduciary funds. Equivalent average cash and investment 
balances during the year amounted to £801 million (2016: £797 million) denominated principally in US dollars (57%), Sterling (13%) and Australian 
dollars (12%). The average return for 2017 was 0.93% (2016: 0.60%). Based upon average invested balances each 1% movement in the average 
achieved rate of return would impact anticipated interest income by approximately £8 million.

INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group has both interest bearing assets, explained in note 4, and interest bearing liabilities that give rise to net exposures to changes in interest 
rates, primarily in US dollars and Sterling. Where appropriate, the Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge or match these interest rate exposures. 
The Group’s policy is to continue to manage net interest rate exposures arising from the Group’s cash (including fiduciary funds) and borrowings.  
Each 1% movement in the average achieved interest rate impacts interest expense by approximately £5.9 million based on average net borrowings  
in 2017. 124    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The remuneration of the Directors is disclosed on pages 78 to 90.
Key management personnel are defined as persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities  
of the Group directly or indirectly, including any director of the Group. This represents the Group Board of Directors and the Group Executive 
Committee only.
The Group’s equity-settled share-based payments comprise the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan (2004/2013), Senior Executive Share Scheme and the 
Executive Share Option Scheme.
JLT LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (2013)
The Group operates the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for Executive Directors and persons discharging managerial responsibility (PDMRs). 
The scheme was renewed in 2013. Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced options and are satisfied using market-purchased 
shares. The awards vest in full or in part depending on satisfaction of the performance conditions which are set out on page 84 of the Director’s 
Remuneration Report. The awards have a 3 year performance period and have a 10 year life from the date of grant. Options attract discretionary 
dividend equivalents (DDEs) that are rolled up and paid, in cash, on vesting. DDEs are paid to option holders only on the options that have vested. 
Forfeited or lapsed options are not eligible to DDEs and the DDEs that have accrued on the balance sheet are released to equity at the  
date of forfeiture.   Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017    125

6. EMPLOYEE INFORMATION CONTINUED
SENIOR EXECUTIVE SHARE SCHEME
The Group operates a Senior Executive Share Scheme for senior management and employees. Awards under the scheme are granted in the form  
of nil-priced options and are satisfied using market-purchased shares. The majority of awards have no specific performance criteria attached, other 
than the requirement that employees remain in employment with the Group. Certain awards have been granted with specific performance targets 
defined for the individual executives. In general these require targets for revenue and profit growth to be met over the vesting period. The awards  
have a 10 year life from the date of grant. Options granted prior to 1 January 2014 attract unconditional DDEs throughout the vesting period, this 
means that DDEs are paid to the option holders as and when dividends are paid to ordinary shareholders, there is no clawback on the dividends  
in the event of a forfeiture of the options. The options granted post 1 January 2014 attract DDEs that are rolled up and paid in cash, on vesting.  
The Group amended the plan rules on the 8 June 2016. From that date, all vested options are no longer eligible to DDEs.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME
Options were granted at a fixed price (usually market price) and are exercisable after the vesting period (usually 3 years). Options are satisfied by  
the issue of new shares or market-purchased shares. Some options carry performance conditions where they are only exercisable when earnings  
per share is in excess of RPI for the three consecutive financial accounting periods preceding the date of exercise. The awards have a 10 year life 
from the date of grant. This scheme is now closed for new grants and options were last granted under this scheme on 29 September 2006.

The option holders who have awards under the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan (2004/2013) and the Senior Executive Share Scheme also receive 
payments equating to the dividends payable on their shares (subject to meeting the performance criteria). Assuming that the dividend yield is zero  
and that the options are issued with no cost to the employees, then the fair value will equal the share price at date of grant.
The volatility has been calculated based on the historical share price of the Company, using a 3 year term.
All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Group’s employment during the vesting 
period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates. In calculating the cost of options granted,  
a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates. For Executive Share Option this is 20%. For the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 
(2004/2013) and the Senior Executive Share Scheme it is nil as both are issued with no cost to the employee. 126    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

4,347 3,404
In addition to the above, fees payable to the Company’s auditor and its associates for audit services supplied to the Company’s associated pension 
schemes amounted to nil (2016: £18,700).
The Audit & Risk Committee has a policy on the use of the external auditors for non-audit services to ensure that the auditor’s independence is 
maintained and that appropriate approvals are sought for non-audit services depending upon their nature and value. Each year a limit is set on the 
total fees that can be paid to the external auditor in relation to non-audit services. As in prior years, the limit set by the Audit & Risk Committee of £1 
million remained applicable in the year. 
The audit fees increased as a result of the imminent implementation of IFRS 9 & 15, as referred to in the Significant Accounting Policies and certain 
component auditor scope changes.

9. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the sum of the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year and the vested share options eligible to discretionary dividends equivalents, excluding unallocated shares held by 
the Trustees of the Employees'  Share Ownership Plan Trust which are treated as treasury shares. The profit attributable to shareholders is the profit 
attributable to the owners of the parent adjusted for the dividends equivalents and undistributed earnings attributable to the unvested share options 
carrying unconditional dividends equivalents rights. 
Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to take account for the potential dilutive effect  
of outstanding share options.
Basic and diluted EPS are also calculated based on underlying earnings attributable to shareholders, which exclude any exceptional items.

IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) identified according to country of operation and business segment. A summary  
of the goodwill allocation is presented below.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial 
budgets approved by management covering a five year period and are discounted using the weighted average cost of capital. Cash flows beyond  
the five year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below:

1) Average growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond five years. 
2) Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations were:
The budgeted trading profit growth: Management determines budgeted trading profit based on past experience and its expectation for market 
development. 
The budgeted investment income growth is based on past experience and long-term interest rates projections. 
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segment and country of operation.  
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with long-term economic forecasts in the countries of operation. 
The value-in-use is compared to an adjusted goodwill. The adjusted goodwill is the goodwill grossed up to reflect a 100% ownership by the Group.
The key sensitivity analysis are:
A decrease of 1% in the growth rate resulted in a reduction of 30% in the excess between the value in use and the adjusted carrying  
value of goodwill.
An increase of 2% in the discount rate resulted in a reduction of 50% in the excess between the value in use and the adjusted carrying  
value of goodwill.
A combined decrease of 1% in the growth rate and an increase of 2% in the discount rate resulted in a reduction of 58% in the excess between  
the value in use and the adjusted carrying value of goodwill.   Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017    131

Subject to local regulations, the Group disposed of its Mexican associate, Sterling Re Intermediaro de Reaseguro SA de CV, in December 2017. 
Details of the transactions are provided on page 134.
There are no contingent liabilities relating to the Group’s interest in any of its associates. 134    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
15. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND HELD-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS
Available-for-sale financial assets are categorised into one of two categories:
1. Investments and deposits, consist mainly of fixed term deposits, bonds and certificates of deposit. These investments are held at fair value  
and are classified between current and non-current assets according to the maturity date.
2. Other investments include securities and other investments held for strategic purposes and some debt instruments. The investments  
are held at fair value unless a fair value cannot be accurately determined in which case they are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
On 20 December 2017, the Group disposed of its 35.5% stake in its Mexican associate, Sterling Re Intermediaro de Reaseguro, SA de CV.  
The disposal is subject to certain conditions to be satisfied in the early part of 2018. The carrying value of the associate was reduced to £189,000 
which resulted in an impairment charge of £537,000. The balance was then reclassified to held-for-sale financial assets. Together with costs on 
disposal, the net loss was £640,000.
On 20 December 2017, the Group disposed of its investment in Lorant, Martinez, Salas y Compañia, Agentes de Seguros y de Fianzas, S.A. de C.V.. 
Together with costs on disposal of £22,000, the net gain was £2,168,000.

The Group’s treasury policies are approved by the 
Board and are implemented by a centralised treasury 
department. The treasury department operates within 
a framework of policies and procedures that establish 
specific guidelines to manage currency risk, liquidity 
risk and interest rate risk and the use of counterparties 
and financial instruments to manage these risks. The 
treasury department is subject to periodic review by 
internal audit.
The Group uses various derivative instruments including 
forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps 
and, from time to time, foreign currency collars and 
options to manage the risks arising from variations 
in currency and interest rates. Derivative instruments 
purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies 
of the Group’s main markets.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts have 
been entered into to manage currency risk, they are 
designated as hedges of currency risk on specific future 
cash flows, and qualify as highly probable transactions 
for which hedge accounting is applied. The Group 
anticipates that hedge accounting requirements 
will continue to be met on its foreign currency and 
interest rate hedging activities and that no material 
ineffectiveness will arise which will result in gains or 
losses being recognised through the income statement.
The fair value of financial derivatives based upon market 
values as at 31 December 2017 and designated as 
effective cash flow hedges was a net asset of £61.2 
million and has been deferred in equity (2016: net asset 
of £22.6 million). Gains and losses arising on derivative 
instruments outstanding as at 31 December 2017 will 
be released to the income statement at various dates 
up to: 
 i) 38 months in respect of cash flow hedges on 
currency denominated UK earnings.
ii) 12 years in respect of specific hedges on USD 
denominated long-term debt drawn under the 
Group’s USD private placement programme. 
iii) 8 years in respect of interest rate hedges on Sterling 
denominated long term debt drawn under the 
Group’s private placement programme.
No material amounts were transferred to the income 
statement during the year in respect of the fair value  
of financial derivatives.
Transactions maturing within 12 months of the 
balance sheet date are classified in current maturities. 
Transactions maturing in a period in excess of 12 
months of the balance sheet date are classified in non-
current maturities.
a) Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group’s major currency transaction exposure 
arises in USD and the Group continues to adopt a 
prudent approach in actively managing this exposure. 
As at 31 December 2017 the Group had outstanding 
foreign exchange contracts, principally in USD, 
amounting to a principal value of £1,158,701,000 (2016: 
£1,199,325,000).
As a guide, each USD 1 cent movement in the achieved 
rate (taking into account the hedges in place) currently 
translates into a change of approximately £1.8 million in 
revenue, with a corresponding impact on trading profit 
equal to approximately 70% of the revenue change.
b) Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate hedges, principally interest 
rate swaps, to mitigate the impact of changes in interest 
rates. The notional principal amount of outstanding 
cross currency interest rate swaps as at 31 December 
2017 was USD458,000,000 and £75,000,000 (2016: 
USD500,000,000 and £75,000,000). A net gain of  
£7.6 million (2016: net gain £29.3 million) on these 
instruments was offset by a fair value loss of £7.6 million 
(2016: loss £29.3 million) on the private placement 
loans, both of which were recognised in the income 
statement in the year.
c) Redemption liabilities
The redemption liabilities represent the valuation of the 
put options provided in the shareholders agreements 
of JLT Specialty Insurance Services Inc., JLT Sigorta ve 
Reasurans Brokerligi Ltd Sirketi, JLT SCK Corretora e 
Administradora de Seguros Ltda and Construction Risk 
Partners LLC. Fair value of these liabilities resulted in a 
gain of £1.1 million which was recognised in the income 
statement in the year.
The redemption liability increased in the year following 
the recognition of put option liabilities. These are 
detailed as follows:
a)  options provided in the operating agreement of CRP 
Holding Company LLC for £47,941,000.
b)  options in respect of new shareholders in JLT 
Specialty Insurance Services Inc. for £284,000.
The recognition of those liabilities resulted in a reduction 
in equity, related to transactions with non-controlling 
interest of £48,225,000.
d) Price risk
 The Group does not have a material exposure  
to commodity price risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the  
reporting date is the fair value of the derivatives  
on the balance sheet. 136    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As at 31 December 2017, the Group had exposures to individual trade counterparties within trade receivables. In accordance with Group policy, 
Group operating companies continually monitor exposures against credit limits and concentrations of risk. No individual trade counterparty credit 
exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of trading activity. Management does not expect any significant losses from non-payment by 
trade counterparties that have not been provided for.

Apart from where disclosed, there are no differences between the fair value and the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
Instruments included in level 1 are financial instruments traded in active markets for which the fair value is based upon quoted market prices at the 
balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry 
group, pricing service, or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s-length basis.
Instruments included in level 2 are financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) and 
for which the fair value is determined by using internal and external models. These models maximise the use of observable market data where it 
is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to measure the fair value of an instrument are 
observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Level 2 includes derivatives used for hedging, which are valued using a discounted cash flow 
methodology incorporating observable market forward foreign exchange and interest rates.
During the year there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2. There were no changes in valuation techniques during the year.
Instruments included in level 3 are financial instruments for which one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data. 
In respect of deferred and contingent consideration and redemption liabilities – option contracts, unobservable inputs include management’s 
assessment of the expected future performance of relevant acquired businesses and are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology.
A 1% movement in the discount rate applied in the calculation of the redemption liability in respect of Construction Risk Partners LLC, 
the largest item within the redemption liability, would result in a change of the overall redemption liability of 6%. 140    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Liquidity risk arises from an inability to maintain an optimal cost of capital or meet the short term financial demands of the business.  
The Group has implemented the following steps to mitigate the risk:
 - Management reviews of business unit balance sheets and cash flows
 - Maintenance of committed credit facilities
 - Compliance with regulatory minimum capital requirements and regular stress testing
 - Maintenance of a conservative funding profile. 144    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

22. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES CONTINUED
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefits through the future taxable profits is considered 
probable. A deferred tax asset relating to tax losses of £14,030,000 (2016: £14,340,000) has not been recognised in the balance sheet in respect 
of certain of the Group's operations, principally US, China, Singapore and Japan, where it is considered likely that the losses will expire before use 
or are unlikely to be realised in the short term. A deferred tax asset relating to other deferred tax balances of £6,853,000 (2016: £7,473,000) has 
not been recognised in the balance sheet in respect of certain of the Group's overseas operations, principally the US, where it is considered that 
the asset is unlikely to be realised in the short term. Following the recent US tax reform the federal tax rate has reduced from 35% to 21%, the non 
recognised deferred tax assets in relation to the US have been calculated using the reduced rate of 21%.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised on temporary differences of £136 million (2016: £124 million) representing the unremitted earnings 
of subsidiaries and joint ventures. Such amounts are permanently reinvested. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised on temporary 
differences of nil (2016: nil) representing unremitted earnings of associates.

Property related provisions
The Group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable 
costs of meeting the obligations under the contract. Provision is made for the future rental cost of vacant property and expected dilapidation 
expenses. In calculating the provision required, account is taken of the duration of the lease and any recovery of cost achievable from subletting. 
Property provisions occur principally in the US and UK and relate to a variety of lease commitments. The longest lease term expires in 2026.
Litigation provisions
At any point in time the Group can be involved in a variety of litigation, regulatory and other government authorities investigations and disputes  
around the world. A provision is established in respect of such issues when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the amount of the 
liability can be reasonably estimated. The Group analyses its litigation exposures based on available information, including external legal consultation 
where appropriate, to assess its potential liability. Where appropriate the Group also provides for the cost of defending or initiating such matters. 
However, the final outcome could differ materially from the amount provided. 146    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
23. PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES CONTINUED
Where a litigation provision has been made it is stated gross of any third party recovery. All such recoveries are included as “Other receivables” within 
trade and other receivables. At 31 December 2017, in connection with certain litigation matters, the Group’s litigation provisions include an amount 
of £0.1million (2016: £0.1million) to reflect this gross basis and the corresponding insurance recovery has been included within trade and other 
receivables. This presentation has had no effect on the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: nil).
Other
Other provisions include provisions for clawback of commission which arises on certain types of Employee Benefits contracts.

On 27 January 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of CRP Holding Company LLC, the holding company of Construction Risk Partners LLC 
(CRP), one of the leading construction Risk and Surety specialty brokers in the USA, providing risk consulting and broking services. The acquired 
business contributed revenue of £18,325,000 and net profit, including acquisition and integration costs incurred to date, of £1,940,000 to the Group 
for the period since acquisition. If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2017, we estimate the contribution to Group revenue would have 
been £20,436,000 and net profit, including acquisition and integration costs incurred to date, would have been £2,413,000.

The Jardine Lloyd Thompson UK Pension Scheme has two sections: one providing defined benefits and the other providing benefits on a defined 
contribution basis. The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee administered fund separate from the Company.
With effect from 1 December 2006 the defined benefit section of the Scheme was amended to cease future benefits accruals. Under the Scheme  
as amended, a participant’s normal retirement benefit will be determined based on their service and compensation prior to 1 December 2006.
The latest finalised triennial actuarial funding valuation of the Jardine Lloyd Thompson UK Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 31 March 2014, 
and showed a deficit of £134.2 million. The company agreed with the Trustees that annual contributions of £10.5 million would be paid each July for 
14 years, from 2015 and to 2018 to fund the scheme deficit. This valuation was updated to 31 December 2017 by a qualified actuary employed by 
the Group. An updated triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2017 is currently being carried out but results are not yet available. The weighted 
average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 18 years (2016: 18 years).
The principal overseas schemes are:
a)   The JLT (USA) Incentive Savings Plan which is a defined contribution scheme. Employees may contribute up to 50% of their salary subject to an 
IRS maximum each year of USD 18,000 in 2017 and the Group contributes at a rate of 100% of each 1% contributed by the employee up to a 
maximum employee contribution of 4%, up to a maximum of USD 10,600. Employees aged over 50 may make “catch-up” contributions subject 
to an IRS maximum each year of USD 6,000 in 2017.
b)    The JLT (USA) Employee Retirement Plan which is a defined benefit scheme. The latest actuarial valuation was undertaken at 1 January 2017  
by independent actuaries. With effect from 31 July 2005 the plan was amended to eliminate future benefit accruals. Under the plan as amended, 
a participant’s normal retirement benefit will be determined based on their service and compensation prior to 31 July 2005. The average 
compensation and length of service will be determined as at 31 July 2005. 
 The Group had made a settlement gain of £127,000 in 2016 relating to non-routine lump sum payments and it is disclosed under the curtailment  
 gain.
c)    The JLT (USA) Stable Value Plan. The latest actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2017 by independent actuaries. With effect from 
31 March 2016 the Plan was amended to eliminate future benefit accruals. Under the Plan as amended, a participant's normal retirement benefit 
will be determined based on their service and compensation prior to 31 March 2016. The average compensation and length of service was 
determined as at 31 March 2016. The plan closed in 2016.
d)    The Pension Plan for Employees of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Canada Inc. has two sections: one providing defined benefits based primarily 
on the 2007 pensionable salary and the other providing benefits on a defined contribution basis. The JLT pension contribution for the defined 
contribution plan ranges from 3% to 13% based on age and service. The company makes additional contribution to defined contribution plans, 
not exceeding 2% of pensionable earnings, if the member makes a matching voluntary contributions. The Defined Benefit  Pension Plan was 
amended on 1 January 2009 in order to close the plan to new entrants and eliminate future benefit accruals from this date forward.
 The JLT Canada Defined Pension Plan's last formal valuation was undertaken as at 31 December 2016 by a qualified third party actuary.
e)  The Jardine Lloyd Thompson Ireland Limited Pension Fund, which is a defined benefit pension scheme, has its assets held in a separately 
administered fund. The contributions to it are agreed between the Trustees and the Company, based on the advice of an appropriately qualified 
independent actuary. The most recent triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes was carried out by the appropriately qualified independent 
actuary as at 1 January 2014. With effect from 30 November 2008, the scheme was closed to new entrants and future service accrual ceased. 
The company also operates a defined contribution scheme, namely The Jardine Lloyd Thompson 2004 Retirement Benefits Scheme, which 
is held and administered under a separate trust. The most recent triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes was carried out by an 
appropriately qualified independent actuary as at 1 January 2017. 
f) The Belgibo DB and DC Plans has two sections: one pension plan providing defined benefits based primarily on the pensionable salary and   
 two pension plans providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, subject to certain guaranteed minimum asset returns. The employer   
 pension contribution for the defined contribution plan ranges from 2% to 6% based on category and service. The defined benefit scheme was  
 amended on 1 January 2007 in order to close the plan to new entrants. The defined benefit scheme’s last formal valuation was undertaken as at  
 31 December 2017 by a qualified third party actuary. 156     FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

a)  In respect of the UK scheme, where there are inflation linked benefits, the inflation increases are limited to a maximum of 5% per annum (some 
are limited to 3% per annum).
b) In line with IAS 19 (Revised) the expected return on scheme assets assumption is the same as the discount rate assumed for the liabilities.
c)  Mortality assumptions for the UK scheme are based on 105% of the S2PxA tables, with improvements based on CMI 2016 tables with a 1.25% 
per annum long-term rate of improvement.
 Mortality assumptions for the US Scheme and US Stable Value Plan are based on the RP2014 Mortality Table with MP2017 projections. 
  Mortality assumptions for the Canadian Scheme are based on the CPM-2014 Private Table with generational projection using scale CPM-B.
  Mortality assumptions for the Irish Scheme, assume that deaths after retirement will be in accordance with standard mortality tables 90% 
PxA92C=2004 with allowance for expected future mortality improvements. There is assumed to be no pre-retirement mortality.
 Mortality assumptions for the Belgian Schemes are based on the Belgian mortality table MR-3/FR-3.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
Impact on defined benefit obligation
Change in
assumptions
Change to
obligation
Discount rate decrease of 0.1% increase of 2.0%
Inflation rate increase of 0.1% increase of 1.0%
Life expectancy increase of 1 year increase of 4.0%
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely  
to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant 
actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end  
of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet. Note this sensitivity is for 
defined benefit obligations only and does not consider the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the assets, in particular the assets  
held in respect of the insured pensioners.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous year.   Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2017      157

Legal and other loss contingencies
Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims, legal proceedings, investigations by regulatory and other 
government authorities and disputes around the world including alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and 
reinsurance risks and consulting services.
IFRS requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and  
the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant management judgement is required to comply with this guidance. The Group analyses its 
litigation exposure based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to assess its potential liability.
On the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion  
of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial 
position of the Group. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any annual period could be materially affected by  
an unfavourable resolution of these matters.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees and letters of credit given on behalf of Group companies 
amounting to £14,385,000 (2016: £12,024,000).
In the UK, the Group is working with the UK Financial Conduct Authority following a market-wide thematic review of financial advice provided to 
customers who were offered enhanced transfer value products (‘ETVs’). Pending the outcome of the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s review a 
provision has been created for the estimated administration costs of completing the work for this review. It is too early to determine whether any 
further liability exists.

denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at rates of 
exchange	ruling	at	the	balance	 sheet 	 date.	For eign	exchange	 gains	 and

Trade and other receivables

impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash	 and	cash	 equivalents	 include	cash	 in 	 hand, 	 deposits 	 held 	 at 	 call	 with	
banks,	other	 short-term	highly	 liquid	investments	with	original	maturities 	 of

compr ehensive	 income	or 	dir ectly	in	shar eholders’ 	 funds, 	 r espectively.
The	curr ent	income	 tax 	 charge	is	calculated 	on	 the 	 basis 	 of 	 the	tax	laws 	
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries 
wher e 	 the 	 company	operates	 and	generates	 taxable	income. 	Management	
periodically	evaluates	 positions	taken	in	tax	r etur ns	 with 	 r espect 	 to	situations

to	the	tax	authorities.
Interest income
Inter est 	income	 is	r ecognised	using	the	ef fective 	inter est 	 method.	When	a	
loan	 and	r eceivable	is	impair ed,	the	company	 r educes 	the	carrying 	amount	 
to	its	 r ecoverable 	 amount,	being	the	estimated 	futur e	cash	 flow	 discounted	at	
the	original	ef fective 	inter est 	 rate	of	the	instrument,	 and	continues	 unwinding

is 	 established.
Dividend distribution
Dividends proposed or declared after the balance sheet date are not 
r ecognised 	 as	a	 liability	at	the	balance	 sheet 	 date.	Dividend 	distributions	to	
the company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the company’s 
financial	statements	in	the	period 	in	which	the	 dividends	ar e	 appr oved	 by	 
the	company’ s	shar eholders. 174					 FINANCIAL	ST A TEMENTS
