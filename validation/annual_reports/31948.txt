Our results refer to ‘adjusted’ results alongside our statutory results, which we believe will be more useful to readers since we manage our business using adjusted measures. 
The directors believe that exceptional items and adjustments impair visibility of the underlying performance of the Group’s businesses and, accordingly, these are excluded 
from our non-GAAP measures of revenue, profit before tax, EBITDA, operating profit and adjusted earnings per share, which we use in internal reports.

Overview
www.rank.com | 5
enracha  Dear shareholder
Rank’s aim is to be the UK’s leading multi-channel 
operator. The Group looks to meet this goal through 
delivering against its five strategic pillars:
1. create a compelling multi-channel offer;
2. build digital capability;
3. develop our venues;
4. invest in our brands and marketing; and
5. use technology to drive efficiency and improve 
customer experience.
Further detail of the Group’s progress against these 
pillars can be found in the strategy and KPIs and 
operating review sections of this report.
Financial performance
Following what has been a challenging year for  
our retail businesses, the Group delivered revenue
1
  
marginally up on the prior year. However, a strong 
digital performance and improved cost discipline 
across the Group contributed to a 1% increase in 
operating profit
2
.
The Group’s UK digital business had a strong year, 
again delivering impressive revenue
1
 growth, up 15%. 
The Group’s UK retail businesses had a tough year, 
with declines in visits adversely impacting revenue, 
and ended the year 3%
3
 down on the prior year.
As highlighted in our recent interim results, the 
Group faced increased costs during the year following 
the introduction of the National Living Wage and 
increased property rent costs. The combination of these 
cost increases and challenging UK retail conditions 
resulted in the Group undertaking a detailed review  
of its UK organisational structure and cost base.  
This identified a number of actions that were taken  
to mitigate cost inflation and improve efficiency,  
with the Group finishing the year with total costs 
marginally lower than the prior year. 2017/18 will  
see some benefit from the actions taken during the 
second half of 2016/17 and further details can be 
found in the financial review.

Strategic report
6 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 “Rank remains in a strong 
financial position, possesses  
market-leading brands and  
has a clear strategy for  
long-term growth.”
Responsible gambling
As an operator, Rank is committed to minimising the 
potential for harm from gambling. This year we made 
significant steps to increase the scale and impact of 
our response regarding the prevention and detection 
of problem gambling through:
◊ a newly formed board responsible gambling 
committee (see page 68 for more details);
◊ the development of propensity models to detect 
patterns of play symptomatic of problem gambling;
◊ investment in resourcing a team solely focused on 
responsible gambling; and
◊ the development of our new Customer Solutions 
Hub in Sheffield to better support our customers.
More detail of our responsible gambling strategy can 
be found in the operating responsibly section of 
this report.
Management team changes
In September 2016, Alan Morgan joined Rank as 
managing director of Mecca’s retail business. Alan  
has held several senior positions within the hospitality 
and leisure sector. Alan’s last role was chief operating 
and commercial officer for Spirit Pub Company until 
it was sold to Greene King plc.
On Alan’s appointment, Martin Pugh became 
managing director of Grosvenor Casinos’ retail 
business after 21 months as managing director 
of Mecca.
On 30 June 2017, the Group’s human resources 
director, Sue Waldock, retired after 28 years with the 
Group. Following Sue’s retirement, David Balls was 
appointed to succeed her. David was previously 
Grosvenor’s human resources director, and will 
continue to hold this position alongside his 
Group role.
Board changes
I am pleased to welcome Alex Thursby to the board  
as a non-executive director. Alex’s appointment was 
effective from 1 August 2017, when he also joined 
Rank’s audit, remuneration and nominations 
committees. Alex will also chair Rank’s audit 
committee following the conclusion of the  
annual general meeting on 19 October 2017.
I look forward to working with Alex and to  
benefiting from his experience of developing new, 
and transforming existing, businesses with the use of 
technology platforms. Alex’s extensive experience in 
compliance and risk governance in a highly-regulated 
sector will also further strengthen the board.
Owen O’Donnell, currently chair of the audit 
committee, notified the board of his intention not to 
seek re-election at the 2017 annual general meeting 
and will therefore step down later this year having 
completed nine years on the board. I would like to 
thank Owen for his valuable contribution as a director 
during his tenure and his excellent chairmanship of 
the audit committee over the last three years.
Dividend
The board targets a progressive and sustainable 
dividend. The dividend policy reflects the strong cash 
flow characteristics and long-term earnings potential 
of the Group, whilst allowing it to retain sufficient 
capital to fund ongoing operating requirements, 
investment and balance sheet management.
The board is pleased to recommend a final dividend  
of 5.3 pence per share to be paid on 31 October 2017 
to shareholders on the register at 22 September 2017. 
This will take the full-year dividend to 7.3 pence per 
share, a 12% increase on last year. The Group’s dividend 
cover has thus reduced to 2.2 times from 2.4 times in 
the prior year.
Culture
During the year, the Group rolled out its group-wide 
values, STARS, following their launch in July 2016. 
The values of Service, Teamwork, Ambition, 
Responsibility and Solutions reflect the behaviours 
vital for Rank employees to deliver successfully  
against Rank’s strategic goals.
We understand the important role the right culture 
plays in the gaming industry and in addressing our 
responsibilities to our customers and wider society. 
Work continues to bring STARS to life for all of 
Rank’s employees.
I would like to take the opportunity, on behalf of the 
board, to thank Rank’s employees for their continued 
passion and dedication in exciting and entertaining 
our customers.
Current trading and outlook
Trading in the short seven-week period to 
13 August 2017 has been encouraging and in line  
with management’s expectations.
Rank remains in a strong financial position, possesses 
market-leading brands and has a clear strategy for 
long-term growth.

customer events
In the UK, Rank is one of the few gaming  
companies in a position to provide customers  
with a genuine multi-channel gaming offer. We  
have a number of key assets, including a portfolio  
of 151 venues, our membership-based model with 
approximately three million registered members,  
our loyalty and reward programmes and the high 
levels of engagement that our team members enjoy 
with customers. As part of Rank’s strategy to build  
a compelling multi-channel offer, numerous multi-
channel customer events were held in the year;  
below are some examples.
Grosvenor Casinos’ new digital sports offer
Cheltenham Festival and Ascot preview events were held in the year; 
both evenings were hosted by various horse racing personalities with 
over 70 guests in attendance. Guests were provided with a race-by-race 
betting guide for the horse racing events in addition to the experts ‘best 
picks’. Guests included retail and digital casino customers as well as 
invited VIPs.
Big Bingo Bash
During the year, Rank leveraged its position of being able to offer its 
customers not just cross-channel gaming experiences but also cross-
brand experiences. In May 2017, digital bingo VIP customers were 
invited to experience both the Group’s UK retail brands. The evening 
featured dinner in Grosvenor’s Southend casino followed by an evening 
at Mecca Southend’s Big Bingo Bash event, a new bingo concept 
launched in the year.

Neon roll-out
During the year, the Neon casino management system 
roll-out was completed across Grosvenor’s retail 
casino estate.
The new system is a key building block in providing our 
casino customers with a single account and wallet across 
both our digital and retail channels – a key strategic priority 
for Grosvenor Casinos in creating a compelling multi-
channel offer.
Neon brings many improvements over the previous system, 
with the ability to track customers’ play in casino a key area.
Business intelligence functionality has also been included  
in the system, which enables Rank to:
◊ perform demand modelling and yield management for 
table gaming and machines;
◊ analyse machine game performance; and
◊ generally, see a more detailed view of the business.
Over the course of 2017/18, further Neon functionality  
will be rolled out across the casino estate to include player 
tracking for slots and electronic roulette, table management 
and a replacement loyalty system.

and undoubtedly had an impact on morale and 
performance. The business should now be in a  
much stronger and positive position with the  
project fully implemented.
Mecca suffered from declines in visits, but managed  
to outperform its main competitors and continued  
to maintain good cost control. More importantly,  
we have trialled a number of bingo variants – for 
example, Big Bingo Bash, Bonkers Bingo – which are 
showing promise, and, with the recently launched 
Luda, there is plenty to drive growth.
Our digital business had a strong year with profits  
up significantly. With 15% revenue

 growth we are 
outstripping UK market growth for digital gaming, 
with Grosvenor continuing its stellar trajectory and 
Mecca showing good progress in the lower growth 
digital bingo sector. We changed our digital operating 
structure, making way for a multi-brand approach, 
and made a number of new hires into key positions, 
such that we feel that we now have a very strong 
team. We also continued to develop our Sheffield 
Customer Solutions Hub, which has gone from strength 
to strength and gives us real competitive capability.
In the 
spotlight
Q&A
How would you characterise  
this year’s performance?
Overall, we are satisfied with where we ended up for 
the year, with some obvious caveats and considerations. 
We suffered a dip in retail visits and performance last 
summer and struggled to recover, leading to a weaker 
first half of the year than we would have expected. 
But an improvement in performance in the second 
half of the year together with some cost reductions  
led to a much stronger second half, contributing 
£46.9m of operating profit
1
 compared to £36.6m  
in the first half.
Grosvenor applied a much more stringent application 
of customer diligence with respect to evidencing source 
of funds, which, together with lower gaming margins 
on our VIP activity, led to lower than anticipated 
revenues. Grosvenor also implemented what it termed 
‘Project One’, changing and harmonising pay and 
benefits across the casino estate. This was a considerable 
Chief Executive’s Q&A
1 Before exceptional items.
2 Before customer incentives.
Strategic report
18 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 In Spain, where the economy continues to recover, 
our Enracha business had a very positive year with 
revenues and profits
1
 up 23% and 72% respectively. 
Although just nine bingo clubs, with a digital service 
fully launching in 2017/18 and with possibilities on 
the retail side, we are excited about Enracha’s 
continuing growth potential.
We also continued to look at how we could best run 
the centre of our organisation, closing our central 
London office and moving to a larger and more 
modern Maidenhead headquarters. The resulting 
workspace has led to a much more unified 
organisation and a positive environment.
Where do the Company’s priorities lie 
in the next 12 months?
Beyond achieving performance targets and all our 
brands showing solid growth, we are focused on  
five specific areas which will help drive growth and 
long-term value. In the course of 2017/18, we will 
launch a single account and wallet product across  
our Grosvenor channels. It will see the delivery of  
a complex solution combining different systems  
and technologies from a range of partners and 
suppliers. The result will be a joined-up retail and 
digital business with customers being able to move 
seamlessly between the two, which should drive 
activity and volumes in both. We will also be 
launching a number of new digital brands this year, 
which should also help digital growth. Although 
Mecca and Grosvenor are strong, established brands, 
they appeal to a certain customer segment and having 
additional brands will give us an improved ability to 
‘cross-sell’ customers into new brands and reactivate 
dormant customers.
Grosvenor’s nine London casinos generate 
approximately half of its profit. Whilst successful 
clubs in their own rights, they have historically been 
run fairly independently and have not utilised their 
combined benefit to full effect. Implementing a clear 
Grosvenor London strategy is therefore a priority for 
the year. We have just opened our first new Luda site, 
bringing bingo-led entertainment to the high street, 
in August 2017. Opening further Ludas and making 
the concept a success will also be an area of focus for 
the year. Finally, with rising operating costs, including 
increases in the National Living Wage and higher 
inflation, we are focused on keeping central and 
above-club costs disciplined whilst improving our 
support capability.
What is your view on the regulatory 
outlook for the gambling industry?
The whole gambling sector is waiting for the 
Department of Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) to 
publish the recommendations of their review of stakes 
and prizes on gaming machines, social responsibility 
measures and gambling advertising: what has been 
termed the ‘Triennial Review’. The DCMS has delayed 
publication a couple of times, latterly because of the 
general election, and the Review is now expected in 
October or November of this year. There is media 
speculation that stakes on B2 machines or ‘fixed odds 
betting terminals’ in betting shops will be reduced, 
but curbs being placed on TV advertising are also a 
possibility. Neither of these issues would have a big 
impact on our business: we do not have B2 machines 
in any of our premises and we are not a significant 
TV advertiser.
As part of the consultation process, we, together  
with the rest of the casino industry, argued for a 
harmonisation of 1968 Act and 2005 Act casino 
licences, which would mean that 1968 licences  
(the vast majority of our licences) would be entitled  
to a higher number of slot machines based on a 
higher gaming machine-to-table ratio. Only 3% of  
the UK’s slot machines are currently located in casinos 
and we estimate that harmonisation of licences would 
only move this to 4%. We believe a harmonisation of 
licences would open the way for increased investment 
and further non-gaming amenity to be contained 
within casinos, more akin to the US or continental 
casino model.
From August 2017, remote gaming duty at 15% will 
be due on any bonuses or freebets given to digital 
customers. Based on last year’s numbers this would 
have translated to £3.3m additional gaming tax.  
There is always scope for the government to increase 
gambling taxes but, given this recent move, we would 
be surprised if there were any further changes imminent 
on the digital side.
Land-based bingo is taxed at 10% (reduced from 20% 
in 2014), casino table games are subject to a 15-50% 
tax scale based on volumes, and most slot machines 
are subject to 20% machine gaming duty. Changes to 
tax are impossible to predict but we do not anticipate 
that these rates will change in the short term.
“Beyond achieving performance 
targets and all our brands 
showing solid growth, we are 
focused on five specific areas 
which will help drive growth  
and long-term value.”

www.rank.com | 19 Beyond regulation, we believe that the gambling 
industry has suffered a deterioration in trust in the 
eyes of customers, politicians and the media in the 
last few years. This has been reflected in the increased 
negative media coverage of the gambling sector. 
Whilst much of this criticism is justified and we 
support continued scrutiny of our industry, we believe 
that much is being done in and around the industry 
to promote responsible gambling and to minimise 
gambling-related harm that often gets overlooked.  
As this develops we believe the industry will regain 
some of that lost trust and be viewed in a more 
positive light.
Land-based retail businesses 
throughout the UK are struggling. 
What is your perspective on your  
own retail growth?
In general retail terms, there has been an undoubted 
shift from much of the high street to the digital world 
with some high-profile casualties along the way. 
However, where that shift has been most marked  
is where customer interaction is predominantly 
transactional: where the convenience and choice 
offered by a digital transaction trump anything  
on offer on the high street. But when there is an 
experiential element to a good or service, the digital 
world often provides a less compelling proxy. In our 
bingo venues and casinos, we offer both transactions 
and experiences and have the added advantage that 
when it comes to gaming, many customers still want 
to play with or draw their winnings in cash. So, we 
have no doubt that both casinos and bingo venues 
will prosper long into the future but, to maximise 
their ongoing potential, they will need to focus more 
on the experiential side of things and continue to 
adapt and change their offer. We feel we are well 
positioned on both fronts.
Will Brexit have an impact on  
your business?
With the exception of our Enracha business (4% and 
7% of Group revenues and profits respectively), the 
majority of our revenues and costs are in pounds 
sterling and we have no direct benefit from a single 
European market. A significant number of our 
employees are non-British EU nationals, so their 
continued right to residency in the UK is important  
to us – something to which the UK government has 
now committed. Our digital operations are based out 
of, but not licensed in, Gibraltar (we hold both UK and 
Alderney digital licences), meaning that any change to 
Gibraltar’s access to the EU market would not impact 
us. Were the border between Gibraltar and Spain to 
close we would need to enact contingency measures, 
similar to other gaming companies, as many of  
our employees currently live in Spain rather than 
Gibraltar. However, we see no imminent threat of  
this happening and have appropriate plans in place.
How has the introduction of company-
wide values evolved in the last year?
We launched our STARS values in July 2016, 
representing Service, Teamwork, Ambition, 
Responsibility and Solutions. This is the first time  
that Rank has had a single set of values across its 
businesses and reflects the fact that our businesses  
are increasingly bound together by the same set of 
opportunities and challenges.
Since their launch we have tried to embed our values 
into our business processes and daily working lives. 
An example of this has been threading our values 
through the lifecycle of an employee: assessing 
potential candidates based on evidence of displaying 
our values; adapting our employee appraisal process, 
such that our people are assessed on their adherence 
to our values as well as their individual objectives;  
and incorporating a values assessment as part of exit 
interviews. But beyond this example, there are many 
different areas, both in our venues and at the centre, 
where our values now play an important part in 
our company.
We believe our values are key both to business success 
and to shaping an organisation that has the right 
culture and ethos for dealing with many of the 
complexities of gambling, including the sometimes 
negative impact it can have on customers. As such,  
we will continue to evolve how our values are used 
and embodied in our business and to try to track  
and measure our progress.

In the year ended 30 September 2016, the British retail 
casino market generated £1,190m (£993m in the prior 
year) in gaming revenue, representing around 9%  
of consumer expenditure on gaming and betting.
Attendance levels marginally increased to 20.5m in 
the year ended 30 September 2016, from 20.4m in the 
prior year.
Average spend per visit rose by 19% to £58.05

As at 30 June 2017, the number of casino licences 
operating in Great Britain was estimated to be 146.  
All but six of these casinos were licensed under the 
1968 Act, and when the 1968 Act was superseded  
by the 2005 Gambling Act (‘the 2005 Act’) the  
rights of these casinos were ‘grandfathered’.
1968 Act casinos may only operate in 53 ‘permitted

www.rank.com | 25 Responsible gambling
Operating responsibl y
Oversight by the board is ensured by the board’s 
responsible gambling committee, chaired by the  
Rt. Hon. The Earl of Kilmorey. During the year, the 
committee examined and contributed to a number  
of critical matters, including the government’s review 
of gaming machines and social responsibility and  
the annual assurance statement submitted by Rank  
to the Gambling Commission. The committee met 
with and gained key insights from Dr Simon Tanner 
of the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board and, 
separately, Professor Ian McHale of Salford University 
who, along with Professor David Forrest, completed 
extensive research into machine play and indicators 
of problem gambling behaviour using anonymised 
data from Grosvenor Casinos.
Two new roles were created by Rank during the year,  
a head of responsible gambling and a responsible 
gambling data scientist. In particular, the data 
scientist role has significantly enhanced Rank’s 
analysis of historic player behaviour amongst digital 
customers, improving our ability to recognise risk and 
to know when a responsible gambling intervention 
may be helpful. The challenge, not only for Rank  
but for the whole industry, is to trial and determine 
the effectiveness of a range of possible intervention 
methods and to understand how to effectively time 
any intervention so to have the greatest benefit in 
encouraging our customers to reflect upon their play. 
The coming year will see us continue to focus on this 
important topic.
The establishment of our new customer contact  
centre in Sheffield, the Customer Solutions Hub 
(CSH), allows us to better embed our policies and 
procedures for responsible gambling and to improve 
the monitoring of customers, particularly those 
joining us online. The CSH, working across the Rank 
brands and channels to support and service customer 
needs, is ideally placed to improve our joined-up  
view of a customer and their experience wherever 
they choose to play. The CSH will grow in experience 
to play a pivotal role in the delivery of our player 
protection initiatives. During the year, extensive 
training has been provided to CSH employees to 
develop their awareness and understanding of 
problem and at-risk gambling and to know what  
to look for and how to respond when a customer,  
or the behaviour of a customer, suggests they may  
no longer be enjoying their play.
Our customers – responsible gambling 
2016/17 in review
Our commitment to acting responsibly is rightly clear 
to see in our commitment to minimise the potential 
for harm from gambling. Whilst the prevalence of 
gambling problems in Great Britain appears broadly 
stable, it is certain that the industry continues to 
innovate at pace, introducing new products and 
services and embracing the greater use of mobile 
gambling devices for those customers increasingly 
seeking multi-channel access to gambling 
entertainment. The challenge presented by 
combatting problem gambling is itself increasingly 
complex and evolving, but many of the same 
technologies and developments can assist in this 
regard. Any development of products and services  
can and must be undertaken with as firm a focus  
on meeting our social commitments, as well as our 
commercial objectives. There can be no doubt that 
our commitment to responsible gambling must 
remain and must grow and that we should be  
a positive example for others in the industry.
Building upon past investment, Rank took significant 
steps in 2016/17 to increase the scale and impact of  
its response to the prevention and detection of 
problem gambling.
Our purpose is to bring excitement and 
entertainment to the customers and 
communities we serve. We understand 
our responsibility to all in our 
communities. We aim to act with  
the highest integrity and honesty  
in everything we do.

Strategic report
26 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Responsible gambling in  
the year ahead
In the latter part of 2016/17, Rank drafted a two-year 
plan of activity to further advance its policies, systems, 
training and tools for responsible gambling. 2017/18 
will see the implementation of several initiatives 
designed to:
◊ inform and improve the way we deliver responsible 
gambling messaging to all our customers, and how 
we direct customers concerned about problem 
gambling to professional help and support;
◊ enhance our ability to detect early and challenge 
behaviour that may indicate a problem or risk of  
a problem;
◊ give greater control to our customers to manage  
the time and money they spend and to improve 
their ability to review and consider their past play;
◊ build upon existing training for our employees, 
ensuring they have the latest knowledge and 
awareness and understand how to act appropriately 
when concern for a customer arises;
◊ improve internal awareness of responsible gambling 
initiatives across the Group to further embed player 
protection at a cultural level and to enhance 
cross-channel working; and
◊ evaluate and assess the impact and effectiveness of 
our responsible gambling policies and procedures, 
informing future development and investment.
Cross-industry working
Rank remains committed to working collaboratively 
across the industry, most frequently through the 
respective bingo, casino and online gambling trade 
associations of which it is a member, to support and 
build on shared best practice and to encourage the 
highest standards in responsible gambling and 
player protection.
One such initiative to which Rank remains firmly 
committed is the ongoing development and 
improvement of multi-operator self-exclusion 
schemes. The ability for anyone recognising they  
have a problem to prevent their own access to 
gambling in the most effective way, so they may focus  
on their recovery and not be at risk of temptation, is 
incredibly important. In recent years we have seen the 
implementation of the Bingo Industry Self-Exclusion 
Scheme (BISES) and the Self-Enrolment National 
Self-Exclusion (SENSE) scheme by the casino sector. 
Both enable a customer to prevent their own access 
for a minimum of six months to local and national 
venues through a single enrolment. We believe such 
schemes can be very beneficial to anyone experiencing 
harm from gambling. Rank will continue to support 
the development of the respective retail self-exclusion 
schemes, including their review and evaluation.

Responsible 
gambling 
committee 69
www.rank.com | 27 Operating responsibl y continued
During 2017/18 Rank expects to see a similar scheme 
launched for our online gambling and we will very 
much welcome its arrival. We know from the small 
percentage of our customers who self-exclude online, 
and from experts in the field of problem gambling 
treatment, that such a facility is greatly needed.
However, Rank remains concerned that the work  
on self-exclusion will still not be complete when  
the various self-exclusion schemes are all available  
and established. Though self-exclusion is designed 
and intended for players experiencing a gambling 
problem, we are increasingly concerned that it  
is a facility also used by customers who might be 
dissatisfied by the service provided by a gambling 
operator – even when a gambling problem is not 
present. We think this may especially be the case  
in relation to gambling online where it is quick and 
easy to self-exclude with one operator and register 
with another. Recent research by the Gambling 
Commission indicates that more than 40% of people 
entering a self-exclusion may have been doing so  
for reasons other than controlling spend (with a 
particular operator or overall) and therefore that 
assuming self-exclusion to be confirmation that a 
customer is experiencing problem gambling may,  
in some cases, not be correct.
Rank feels strongly that self-exclusion should be  
a reliable proxy for harm and that customers using 
self-exclusion for reasons of problem gambling can 
inform greatly the further improvement of efforts to 
protect others. As a whole, but in particular perhaps 
by the online industry, more needs to be done to offer 
alternatives to dissatisfied customers and to encourage 
the use of self-exclusion only by those experiencing  
or at risk of a gambling problem. We will continue  
to contribute our own efforts to this end and to raise 
best practice across the industry where we can.

Culture
Back in 2015, Rank introduced a new strategic 
direction for the Group which relies on greater 
interdependence between and co-operation across 
Rank teams. To engender a culture of working 
together to build capability and solutions rather  
than supporting brand, location and department  
silos, the Group developed, across all brands,  
a group-wide set of values with the following 
supporting purpose statement:
To bring excitement  
and entertainment  
to the customers and 
communities we serve.
To excite and to entertain
Employees across the business were consulted  
to ascertain what values were considered key to 
achieving the Group’s strategic objectives. The 
Group’s new values, STARS, were subsequently 
launched on 6 July 2016.
Service
Service – We start with the customer. We do everything in our 
power to deliver special service every time.
Teamwork – We pull together across brands, channels and 
locations to perform at our very best.
Ambition – We challenge the way we do things and explore  
new ways to excite and entertain our customers and outshine 
the competition.
Responsibility – We understand our responsibility to all in our 
communities. We act with the highest integrity and honesty in 
everything we do.
Solutions – We act positively to get to the heart of problems quickly 
and find ways to solve them.

Learning and development
During the year, a total of 3,500 employees accessed 
in-house e-learning courses; this is in addition to 
in-house and external training courses attended  
by employees which are not tracked centrally.
Engagement
During the year two employee opinion surveys were 
sent to all Group employees. The survey scores are  
a proxy for employee engagement levels within our 
business. Over the year employee engagement fell by 
nine percentage points to 71%.
In addition, employees are asked questions on different 
aspects of their working life at Rank. Scores and 
comments are then reviewed and actions agreed 
where appropriate to address any identified issues.
Areas highlighted by the surveys included the need for 
better channels for communicating within the business 
and more opportunities for training and development.
Health and safety
The key objectives of the 2016/17 health and safety 
strategy were:
(i) to improve health and safety awareness across  
the Group through management training; and
(ii) to reduce the number of employee and customer 
accidents in the UK by 10% from their level at the 
start of the year.
Positive progress has been made in the year against 
both objectives, with a completion rate of 100% for 
Grosvenor managers completing the e-learning course 
and a completion rate of 97% for Mecca managers.
Rank also exceeded its target of reducing accidents 
within the UK, having achieved an overall reduction 
of 22% across both Mecca and Grosvenor in the year.
Diversity
Rank is committed to providing equal opportunities 
for all its employees. Rank’s diversity policy ensures 
that every employee is treated equally and fairly and 
that all employees are aware of their responsibilities.
Please refer to page 66 which outlines the board’s 
diversity policy.
The charts below provide a breakdown of the gender 
of directors and employees at 30 June 2017.
Disability
Rank is committed to ensuring that people with 
disabilities are supported and encouraged to apply  
for employment with the Group and to achieve 
progress whilst employed. Disabled persons will be 
treated so that they have equal opportunities, so far  
as justifiable, to be selected, trained and promoted.
Human rights
The board considers that it is not necessary for  
the Group to operate a specific human rights policy  
at present. Our policies already operate within a 
framework to comply with relevant laws and to 
respect the human rights of our employees and  
other stakeholders in the business.

Rank Cares
The year saw Rank continue the Rank Cares programme 
with its charitable partner, Carers Trust. Rank employees 
managed to raise a fantastic £0.5m in the year and a 
total of £1.5m since the start of the partnership in 
February 2014.
The fundraising covers a wide range of activities from 
sponsored team challenges to employee payroll giving 
through the ‘Pennies From Heaven’ scheme.
The Rank Cares programme specifically supports 
carers through a grant-giving programme which has 
resulted in 6,624 carers receiving support since the 
start of the partnership.
Employees have also given up their own time to 
volunteer at local carers’ services across the UK.  
More than 2,000 volunteer hours were completed  
by Rank employees in the year.

The factors highlighted at the Group’s half-year results 
continued to affect the performance in the second 
half of the year:
◊ gaming margin: for the full year gaming margin  
was 0.4 percentage points lower than the prior year 
across the entire estate and 6.9 percentage points 
down for our major players; and
◊ customer due diligence: more stringent customer due 
diligence to address money laundering, proceeds of 
crime and problem gambling.
Following a review of costs, savings of £1.2m were 
made in the year, with approximately £1.0m relating 
to employment costs.
The refurbishments of Grosvenor’s Nottingham and 
Leeds Westgate casinos were completed in the year at 
a total capital cost of £5.1m. Both casinos have since 
traded well.
During the year two casinos were closed: Glasgow 
Princes Street and Leeds Merrion Way. Grosvenor 
plans to relocate these spare licences once the required 
planning and licensing approvals have been obtained.

improving from the first half.
During the year, an exceptional cost of £5.2m

two casinos (Southend and Plymouth). Southend’s 
performance has improved, though it is not yet 
generating the expected returns whereas Plymouth’s 
performance has deteriorated in the year. Both casinos

Mecca’s performance on visits and revenues remains 
ahead of its key competitors, and it has a number  
of initiatives in place to drive visits in the current 
financial year. These include the roll-out of three  
new experiential bingo events to our club estate – 
Batty Bingo, Bonkers Bingo and Big Bingo Bash. These 
event formats target a specific demographic (students, 
18-30 year-olds and 25-45 year-olds respectively) and 
have been successfully trialled in pilot clubs.
Following a review of marketing effectiveness in the 
year, Mecca was able to reduce its marketing costs whilst 
still increasing its market share against key competitors.
A focus on increasing spend per visit and satisfaction 
levels led to the following new product and games 
being rolled out in the year:
◊ 5,250 Mecca Max units, of which 2,550 were 
incremental;
◊ new national game launched in February 2017;
◊ new American bingo game launched in April 2017;
◊ new-style experiential jackpot interval game;
◊ new food and beverage menu; and
◊ trial of a higher quality food and beverage menu  
at Mecca Beeston.

Improving  
performance
For the year ended 30 June 2017, statutory revenue 
was broadly flat at £707.2m. Strong revenue gains 
made in the year across the Group’s UK digital 
operations, up 12%, and its Spanish operations,  
up 23%, were adversely impacted by the Group’s 
challenged UK retail performance, down 3%. Profit 
before interest and taxation was down 8% following 
net exceptional income of £9.3m in the prior year, 
however adjusted profit before taxation was up by 2%.
Following the challenging trading conditions at the 
end of 2015/16 and beginning of 2016/17, the Group 
undertook a comprehensive review of its cost base, 
with a particular focus on labour as its largest cost. 
This identified areas where front-line labour hours 
could be reduced, remuneration structures aligned, 
management roles reduced at club level and a simpler 
organisational structure adopted. In addition, a review 
of marketing identified some areas of ineffective spend, 
particularly the Mecca digital TV campaign in the  
first half of the year, that were either not repeated  
or cancelled. The impact of these actions can be seen 
in note 2(d) where, despite pay increases and the 
increase in the National Living Wage, employment 
costs rose by only 2% in the year. Benefits from these 
actions will continue into 2017/18 as a number of 
savings were delivered during the second half.
In summary, total operating costs for the year were 
marginally lower as higher employment and direct 
costs were offset by lower gaming duties and 
marketing costs.
The net financing charge for the year fell by 23% to 
£4.8m as debt levels continued to reduce.

Details of exceptional items can be found in note 4.  
In the year, the key items were an exceptional cost of 
£5.2m relating to the underperformance of Grosvenor’s 
Southend and Plymouth casinos; exceptional income 
of £10.7m following the disposal of Mecca’s Bradford 
site and the associated onerous lease provision release; 
and an exceptional cost of £8.8m relating to the 
restructure of the Group’s UK operations.

Taxation
The Group’s effective corporation tax rate in 2016/17 
was 21.1% (2015/16: 22.5%) based on a tax charge of 
£16.8m on adjusted profit before taxation. This is in 
line with the Group’s anticipated effective tax rate of 
20%-22% for the year. Further details on the taxation 
charge are provided in note 6.
On a statutory unadjusted basis the Group had an 
effective tax rate of 21.0% (2015/16: 12.1%), based  
on a tax charge of £16.8m and total profit for the  
year of £79.7m.
Cash tax rate
In the year ended 30 June 2017 the Group had an 
effective cash tax rate of 18.5% on adjusted profit 
(18.3% in the year ended 30 June 2016). The cash  
tax rate is lower than the effective tax rate mainly  
as a result of the use of losses within the Group  
and the timing of tax instalment payments.
Financial review continued
Cash flow and net debt
Cash generated from continuing operations was up  
at £116.3m.
As at 30 June 2017, net debt was £12.4m, £28.8m 
lower than at the previous year end. Net debt 
comprised £70.0m in bank term loans, £10.5m in 
fixed rate Yankee Bonds, £8.4m in finance leases and 
£2.5m in overdrafts, offset by cash at bank and in 
hand of £79.0m.
In January 2017, the term loan facilities were reduced 
to £70.0m, from £80.0m, in line with the agreed 
amortisation profile. The £90.0m of revolving credit 
facilities was undrawn at the year end.
During the year ending 30 June 2018, the Group’s 
Yankee Bonds will mature (January 2018) and the 
£70.0m term loan will be amortised further to £50.0m 
(February 2018). Both are expected to be funded from 
surplus cash.
The bank facilities require the maintenance of a 
minimum ratio of earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to net 
interest payable and a maximum ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA, tested biannually. The Group has complied 
with its banking covenants.
The Group’s balance sheet continued to strengthen  
in the year with leverage falling to 0.1 times from 
0.3 times at the start of the year.
Further detail regarding the Group’s financial risk 
factors can be found in note 19.
1 Adjusted EPS is calculated using adjusted profit, which excludes discontinued operations, exceptional items, other financial gains or losses, 
unwinding of the discount in disposal provisions and the related tax effects. Adjusted earnings is one of the business performance measures 
used internally by management to manage the operations of the business. Management believes that the adjusted earnings measure assists in 
providing a view of the underlying performance of the business.

corporate office; £2.4m on the development of a new 
customer management system and lastly £1.4m on 
new finance and human resource systems.
During 2017/18, the Group is planning to invest 
between £50m and £55m. The success of any new 
concepts trialled in the year may lead the Group to 
invest beyond the stated range.
Total capital committed at 30 June 2017 was £3.3m.
IFRS 16 – Leases
IFRS 16 Leases represents a significant change, notably 
for lessees, in how leases are accounted for and reported. 
The standard will result in most of the Group’s lease 
arrangements being accounted for on balance sheet 
and will have a material impact on the Group’s 
balance sheet and reported results.
The standard will be effective for the Group for  
the period beginning 1 July 2019, subject to EU 
endorsement, and will replace IAS 17 Leases. The full 
impact of IFRS 16 on the Group is currently being 
assessed, including the practical application of the 
principles of the standard to the Group’s leases, and  
it is therefore not yet possible to provide a reasonable 
estimate of its effect. We expect to provide guidance 
on the impact of the new standard in our reporting 
for the year ended 30 June 2018. Further details are 
provided in note 1 to the Financial Statements.
IFRS 9 and IFRS 15
IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 will be effective for our next 
financial reporting period. The Group does not 
anticipate a material impact on the results or net 
assets from these standards, which are in issue but  
not yet effective.
www.rank.com | 39 Risk management
How we manage risk
Rank operates a comprehensive risk management 
methodology which is closely integrated into its 
management structure to provide clear oversight and 
governance of the risks which are considered to be 
material to its business, and to maintain continuous 
surveillance of its operating environment for 
emerging risks.
The approach endeavours to ensure that a clear risk 
appetite is set that balances risk and opportunities  
to contribute to the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
The board has responsibility for the risk framework 
and for establishing the Group’s risk appetite, as  
well as ensuring that risk controls are built into 
management’s approach to operations. The audit 
committee holds responsibility for assessing the 
effectiveness of the risk management systems which 
are in place and for undertaking an independent 
review of the risk mitigation plans which have  
been designed for material risks.
Rank’s risk committee (further information can be 
found on page 60) meets a minimum of eight times 
per year with a remit to conduct a thorough review  
of the risk register and to ensure that management  
is working effectively to identify and manage risks  
as they arise and on a continuous basis. Working 
sessions of the committee are held with departmental 
and divisional management to ensure that risks are 
being identified in a timely manner, procedural 
controls over identified risks are effective, and action 
plans are put into place for emergent risks. This 
approach ensures that risk is identified in both a 
‘top-down’ and a ‘bottom-up’ manner from the 
various management levels of the organisation to  
give assurance that risk registers are comprehensive.
Group internal audit works in support of the risk 
committee to help manage risk identification and 
conduct independent reviews of both the business’s 
risk and its progress in performing the mitigating 
action plans agreed for any relevant risks, the status  
of which is reported to the risk committee at 
each meeting.

.,  Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the 
financial information, the directors have considered 
the issues impacting the Group during the period as 
detailed in the operating review on pages 32 to 36 and 
have reviewed the Group’s projected compliance with 
its banking covenants. Based on the Group’s cash flow 
forecasts and operating budgets, the directors believe 
that the Group will generate sufficient cash to meet its 
liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from 
the approval of this report and will comply with its 
banking covenants.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the directors make  
the following statement:
The directors have considered the current position  
of the Group, its prospects and longer-term viability 
over a period of three years to June 2020. Although 
longer periods are used when making significant 
strategic decisions, three years has been used as it  
is considered the longest period of time over which 
suitable certainty for key assumptions in the gambling  
sector can be made.
In making this statement, the directors have 
performed a robust assessment of the principal  
risks facing the Group which includes consideration 
of both financial and non-financial risks that may 
threaten the business model, future performance, 
liquidity and solvency of the Group. The principal 
risks facing The Rank Group Plc and our approach  
to risk management are set out within our strategic 
report on page 40 and includes consideration of the 
impact of each risk, the direction of travel and actions 
taken to mitigate these risks. The risks considered 
included adverse regulation, adverse changes to rates 
of tax, adverse gaming win, loss of licences, wage  
rise inflation and technological risks (including  
cyber security).
The Group strategic plan is updated annually for a 
period of three years and takes into account current 
trading trends, the impacts from capital projects, 
existing debt facilities, and expected changes to the 
regulatory and competitive environment as well  
as expectations for consumer disposable income.  
In carrying out the assessment the directors have 
reviewed and challenged key assumptions within  
the Group’s strategic plan. A number of plausible  
but severe downside risks, including consideration  
of possible mitigating actions, have been modelled 
with particular focus on the potential impact to cash 
flows, net debt headroom and covenant compliance 
throughout the period of review.
A number of assumptions were included within the 
assessment, including no material adverse change to:
(i) gaming legislation
(ii) the taxation of gambling  
(beyond smaller changes to specific rates)
(iii) societal attitudes to gambling
(iv) loss of operating licences required to  
operate gambling
A ‘reverse stress test’ was also carried out in order to 
analyse combinations of the above risks which could 
bring about insolvency unless capital was raised; in 
such cases it is anticipated that mitigation measures 
(including a reduction in dividends and capital 
expenditure) could be implemented in order to 
forestall such an outcome.
As a result of this assessment the directors have 
concluded that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall  
due over a three-year period.

Addressing our risks
Regulatory, finance, business environment and tax risks
Risk Impact Mitigation
Regulation
The current political and social environment 
continues to perceive the gambling industry in  
a concerned light and there is a risk that such 
negative publicity may lead to adverse changes  
in regulation and legislation.
 Stable
Regulatory changes could 
increase the cost of doing 
business.
Rank works hard to ensure that it actively 
provides and promotes an environment in 
which customers can play safely, supported 
by its long-running ‘Keep it Fun’ brand 
which gives customers clear advice and 
guidance. The company also works with 
stakeholders, customers and regulators to 
help public understanding of the gaming 
offers it provides. Rank also participates in 
trade bodies’ representations to political 
and regulatory bodies to ensure that such 
stakeholders clearly understand the 
positive contribution that its business 
provides to the economy. 
Taxation
Adverse changes in fiscal regulation continue  
to be a significant risk, particularly to the digital 
environment where changes to Remote Gaming 
Duty will impose this duty on free bets from 
1 August 2017. 
 Stable
Any increases in the levels  
of taxation or duties to  
which we are subject, or the 
implementation of any new 
taxes or levies to which we 
will be subject, could have a 
material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
Rank continues to actively participate in  
all relevant consultations by government. 
Macroeconomic conditions
Current macroeconomic conditions coupled with 
political uncertainty over the Brexit negotiations, 
are causing a reduction in confidence in the UK 
economy, with an impact on discretionary 
leisure spending.
 Increasing
Macroeconomic conditions 
directly impact customers’ 
propensity to spend, which 
could have an adverse effect 
on revenues. European 
political uncertainties are 
fuelling exchange rate 
weakness which impacts 
directly on some business 
costs, reducing profitability. 
A rigorous trading analysis and business 
planning approach ensures that the 
business is ready to respond to changing 
conditions in a rapid and flexible manner.

Risk Impact Mitigation
Volatility of gaming win
The nature of the games played means that win 
margin can fluctuate in the short term although 
it will generally perform at a stable average over  
a longer period.
The important VIP sector of the business in  
both retail and digital contains a small volume of 
customers who can themselves create volatility  
in the overall margin given the value of their 
gaming play.
Issues with misfeasance or the accurate 
management of the games can also affect  
win margins.
 Stable
Fluctuations in gaming win 
margin directly affect 
profitability. 
Gaming limits are utilised across all  
areas of gaming operations to continually 
manage risk exposure. New systems of 
table management are being implemented 
in the casino estate to deliver up-to-the-
minute information to aid management  
to help promptly detect any operational 
issues which may affect the customer 
experience or the win margin.
The VIP population is closely managed to 
ensure that strong long-term relationships 
are developed through dedicated customer 
handling and specialised incentive schemes. 
The VIP segment is also monitored by 
senior management and resources are in 
place to attract and retain suitable high 
value players within appropriate limits  
to mitigate business risk. 
Loss of licences or imposition of serious licence conditions
Rank’s gaming licences are fundamental to its 
operation. In the British venues business there  
is a requirement to hold an operator’s licence 
from the UK Gambling Commission (the body 
responsible for regulating commercial gambling 
in Great Britain) in respect of each of the licensed 
activities undertaken. Additionally, it is necessary 
to hold premises licences from the relevant local 
authority in which each venue is situated, one for 
gambling activities and one for the sale of alcohol.
Our UK customer-facing transactional websites 
also require an operator’s licence from the UK 
Gambling Commission as well as a licence from 
the Alderney Gambling Control Commission, the 
body responsible for the regulation of eGambling 
in the States of Alderney where our remote 
gambling operations are based. Our operations  
in Spain and Belgium are also subject to licensing 
requirements in the jurisdictions and local areas 
in which they operate. 
 Stable
The loss of licences could 
have an adverse effect on our 
business and profitability and 
prevent us from providing 
gambling services. 
All staff undergo relevant training for their 
roles to ensure that a good understanding 
of the objectives of compliance and the 
obligations of their role is maintained. 
Rank also has a dedicated compliance 
function that is independent of the 
operational teams and exists to provide 
guidance and support to the operational 
teams delivering compliant operations, as 
well as oversight of all relevant matters 
relating to ensuring full compliance.  
In addition, there is a separate and 
independent internal audit function to 
provide assessments of the compliance  
of all operating areas on a regular basis.
Single account and wallet project
The project to deliver an integrated wallet and 
account experience for customers across the 
digital and retail casinos is a key strategic  
enabler for the Company.
 Stable
A failure to deliver key 
strategic projects impacts on 
customer loyalty and growth.
Rank has a structured and disciplined project 
delivery methodology to ensure that critical 
projects are robustly managed to achieve 
their deliverables. Key projects are also 
subject to detailed management oversight 
from a project board as well as having 
sponsorship from a senior-level stakeholder. 
A comprehensive project risk approach  
is also undertaken within the project, 
managed by experienced project managers.

Risk Impact Mitigation
Business continuity and disaster recovery 
The ongoing operation of the business is 
dependent on the availability of IT systems,  
staff and physical club venues. Ensuring that 
serious disruptive events such as fire, flood, 
pandemic or security incident can be managed  
to restore operations swiftly and smoothly is  
of critical importance. 
 Stable
Without effective business 
continuity and disaster 
recovery plans the business 
could experience delays in 
restoring revenue-generating 
activities or important 
operational processes such  
as financial reporting,  
causing both financial  
and reputational damage. 
Business continuity plans are in place  
for key operations and are reviewed on  
a regular basis to ensure that they remain  
in a state of preparedness.
Plans for the recovery of critical IT services 
are likewise in place and reviewed on an 
ongoing basis.
Information risk
Data management, information technology and cyber risk
In the course of its commercial business,  
and to comply with relevant regulatory and  
legal requirements, Rank collects and stores  
a considerable amount of data regarding its 
customers, staff and suppliers. The robust 
protection of this data is critical to ensuring  
that Rank acts responsibly in protecting these 
stakeholders from risk as well as complying with 
relevant data protection regulation, including  
the forthcoming EU General Data Protection 
Regulations due to come into force in May 2018.
In order to deliver commercial improvements 
and new customer experiences there is an 
ongoing programme of IT changes, additions  
and improvements. This continues the Group’s 
significant dependence on strong IT systems  
and processes, as well as its reliance on a large 
number of suppliers of IT services and software. 
The resilient and secure operation of these IT 
systems is a key requirement, particularly for  
the operation of the digital business, and  
any vulnerability to malfunctions, service 
interruptions or cyber-attacks would pose a  
risk to the Group’s ability to serve its customers.
 Stable
A breach of data security 
could result in significant 
reputational damage as  
well as impacting our 
customers’ trust of the 
Company, affecting their 
ongoing relationships and 
consequently the Company’s 
financial performance. 
Additionally, potential 
consequences of a breach 
could include compensation 
payments to those affected, 
or significant fines.
Any failure of technology 
systems could leave the 
Company unable to render 
service to customers, 
impacting on revenue  
and profitability. 
Rank has invested considerable resources 
in its information technology and 
cyber-security capabilities and continues  
to do so, with a team of specialist security 
resources guiding a comprehensive data 
and security strategy. A continuous process 
of risk assessment, identification and 
remediation is in place alongside robust 
change management protocols to minimise 
the risk of interruptions caused by  
IT changes.

Taxation
In the year 2016/17 the Group’s businesses paid 
£239.0m (2015/16: £259.9m) to tax authorities and 
local governments in irrecoverable VAT, gambling 
taxes, corporate tax, employment taxes and local 
business rates. Rank has provided employment to 
approximately 10,000 (2015/16: 10,700) people across 
the Group. The broader impact of Rank’s operations, 
including taxes paid by supplier companies, is harder 
to quantify but no less significant.
Taxation represents a significant proportion of the 
Group’s total outgoings as can be seen from the 
chart below.
Tax strategy
Rank’s objective is to ensure that all taxes are correctly 
accounted for and that tax returns are submitted 
accurately and on time and that any tax liabilities  
are paid. Processes and controls are in place to  
ensure that this objective is achieved.
Rank aims to manage and plan the Group’s tax  
affairs with a view to reducing cash tax payable in 
each jurisdiction and minimising the Group’s overall 
effective tax rate, whilst at the same time managing 
and mitigating tax risk. The Group does not intend to 
enter into aggressive tax avoidance transactions and 
any tax planning will revolve around the commercial 
needs of the business. Rank’s tax risks are managed  
as part of the Group’s overall comprehensive risk 
management methodology, that balances risks  
and opportunities to achieve strategic objectives. 
Significant tax matters are discussed at board level  
and supported by the use of appropriate tax advisors.
During the year, Rank has fully complied with 
statutory tax obligations, maintaining good 
relationships with tax authorities in all jurisdictions  
in which it operates. The Group meets regularly with 
HMRC (and other tax authorities as appropriate) to 
explain business issues and to discuss future, current 
and past tax issues.
In the event that the Group disagrees with a tax 
authority about the correct treatment of a tax issue, 
the Group aims to reach resolution as quickly as 
possible whilst also defending its position robustly 
with a view to protecting shareholder value and 
taking into account the cost of defending audits or 
assessments in relation to the amounts of tax at stake. 
Rank will consider litigation provided that the grounds 
of appeal stand a good chance of success that there is 
sufficient tax at stake to warrant the cost of litigation.
In the UK, corporate tax filing positions are agreed  
for years up to and including 2015 with the exception 
of one outstanding issue relating to 2010. The tax in 
relation to this issue has been paid and the matter is 
currently under appeal at First Tier Tribunal.
The Group’s tax strategy is reviewed and approved by 
the board on an annual basis.
Rank is a responsible taxpayer, paying 
tax and contributing to the economies 
in the territories in which it operates.

• •  Effective tax rate
The Group’s effective corporation tax rate in 2016/17 
was 21.1% (2015/16: 22.5%) based on a tax charge of 
£16.8m on adjusted profit before taxation. This is in 
line with the Group’s anticipated effective tax rate of 
20%-22% for the year. Further details of the taxation 
charge are provided in note 6.
Cash tax rate
In the year ended 30 June 2017 the Group had an 
effective cash tax rate of 18.5% on adjusted profit 
(18.3% in the year ended 30 June 2016). The cash  
tax rate is lower than the effective tax rate mainly as  
a result of the use of losses within the Group and the 
timing of tax instalment payments. In 2015/16 the 
Group also had an exceptional cash tax payment  
of £21.4m.
Future tax rates
The effective corporation tax rate for 2017/18 is 
expected to be 20%–22%, being 1%-3% above the  
UK statutory tax rate as a result of some overseas 
profits being taxed at higher rates and depreciation  
of assets that do not qualify for capital allowances.
The Group is expected to have a cash tax rate of 
approximately 19%-21% in the year ended 
30 June 2018.
Gambling taxes
United Kingdom
Online gaming became subject to tax on a place  
of consumption basis from 1 December 2014.  
The majority of the Group’s digital revenue is 
generated from UK customers, which is subject  
to remote gaming duty at 15%. During the year 
HMRC conducted a consultation into proposed 
changes which were intended to tax freeplays 
provided to customers as either a retention tool or 
sign-up incentive. The proposal was to introduce a  
tax charge on all freeplays by treating amounts given 
to customers as ‘stake’ with effect from 1 August 2017. 
Rank responded to HMRC’s consultation and the new 
rules take into account comments made by Rank and 
other operators so that only the first use of freeplays is 
subject to tax. The Group anticipates that the changes 
could have a net cost of around £3.3m although the 
business will seek to minimise the impact of this 
change by looking at alternative ways of acquiring 
and incentivising customers. The new rules were  
not included in the Finance Act 2017, but it is 
anticipated that the implementation date will  
remain 1 August 2017 when the rules are enacted  
in the Finance Bill (No.2) 2017.
During 2015/16 and 2016/17, Rank submitted 
repayment claims totalling £6.8m to protect its 
position in relation to gaming duty on free bet 
vouchers or casino chips provided by the casino to  
the player free of charge. This follows a judgment at 
the Upper Tier Tribunal for another casino operator, 
which stated that these items should not be included 
in the calculation of Gross Gaming Yield for gaming 
duty purposes. HMRC has appealed the finding of  
the Upper Tier Tribunal and the case is expected to  
be heard at the Court of Appeal in January 2018. 
Repayment of Rank’s claims will depend on the 
outcome at the Court of Appeal. These claims have 
not been recognised in the profit and loss account and 
will be discussed further with HMRC when the Court 
of Appeal judgment is available.
In 2015/16, the Group trialled an improvement to 
Rank’s electronic roulette offering across the casino 
estate where live or automated wheels operated in one 
casino may be beamed to electronic roulette terminals 
located in another casino (referred to as Get Set 
Roulette). This was driven by commercial factors 
which include improved customer service by being 
able to offer dealer-operated tables 24 hours a day, 
consistency of play for customers, more optimal use  
of licenced gaming space across the casino estate and 
labour-saving costs through one dealer being able  
to cover more than one casino. Get Set Roulette has 
proved popular with customers and has been rolled 
out more widely during 2016/17. From a gaming duty 
perspective, the bet is accepted by and any winnings 
are paid out of the casino where the roulette wheel is 
located (the ‘banker’ casino). Rank has received advice 
which indicates that income should be recognised in 
the ‘banker’ casino and that duty is payable at the 
relevant rate for that casino. Currently the gaming 
duty liability varies from 15% to 50% across the 
casino estate depending on the level of activity in  
the respective premises. HMRC does not agree with 
Rank’s tax analysis and Rank is in the early stages  
of discussions with HMRC. As at 30 June 2017,  
the amount under dispute was approximately £1m  
(or 1% of the Group’s total gaming duty liability)  
and has been fully provided for.
Rank considers that the current tax regime for gaming 
in Great Britain remains unduly complex, resulting  
in an inconsistent tax treatment for some products 
offered to customers. Gaming duty in casinos ranges 
from 15% to 50%, whereas similar games played 
online are subject to remote gaming duty at 15%. 
Rank promotes multi-channel gaming to its customers 
and is in favour of a simpler unified tax regime that 
encourages sustained growth and investment.

Strategic report
46 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Spain
In 2011, the Spanish government invited online 
operators to apply for remote gaming licences and 
introduced tax changes which levied gaming duty on 
a place of consumption basis. Remote gaming duty 
was introduced at a rate of 25% of gross gambling 
revenue (GGR). This differs from the taxation of 
land-based businesses, which although taxed at 
similar rates (of between 5% and 25%), are taxed  
on stakes received rather than revenue generated. 
Enracha’s digital products will relaunch on a new 
platform in the first half of 2017/18.
Belgium
The Belgian government introduced a taxation and 
licensing framework for online gaming companies  
in 2011. Companies may only apply for an online 
gaming licence in Belgium if they already hold a 
land-based gaming licence. Rank currently holds two 
digital licences that it allows a third-party operator to 
use in exchange for a revenue share. Online gaming  
in Belgium is subject to remote gaming duty at a rate 
of 11% and from 1 August 2016 has also been subject  
to VAT at 21%. This differs from land-based gaming, 
which remains exempt from VAT. This has resulted in 
lower income from the revenue-share arrangements.
VAT
As gambling is exempt from VAT in the UK,  
Rank pays significant amounts of irrecoverable VAT 
(£29.5m in the UK in 2016/17 and £24.7m in the UK 
in 2015/16). Rank has been working with HMRC since 
2013 to try to agree a method for recovering VAT in 
its retail casino business which relates to both taxable 
and exempt sales (residual VAT) which reflects the way 
in which input VAT is used in the business. The amount 
of VAT in dispute is £3.1m up to 30 June 2017. Of 
this, £2.6m was paid in the year with an accrual  
held for the balance. Rank has appealed assessments 
received and will continue to try to reach agreement 
with HMRC on a fair and reasonable recovery method.
The Supreme Court decision in the amusement 
machines case for October 2002 to September 2005 
has not altered Rank’s appraisal of its chances of success 
in its remaining amusement machine claims. Rank 
believes that it has a reasonable chance of success in 
one or both of the claims below, although as is the 
case with any litigation, there is a risk that the courts 
will take a different view.
In addition to the amusement machine claims there  
is a claim outstanding in relation to VAT on bingo for 
periods which HMRC regard as out of time. Rank is 
considering entering into litigation at the First Tier 
Tribunal in relation to this matter.
Compound interest
At present, HMRC accepts that taxpayers are entitled 
to receive interest on repayments caused by HMRC’s 
error. Such interest is calculated on a simple basis. 
However, there is ongoing litigation that such interest 
should be calculated on a compound basis. The UK 
High Court (having been referred back from the CJEU) 
found in favour of the litigant and HMRC appealed 
the judgment. The Court of Appeal released its 
judgment in May 2015, in which it agreed with the 
High Court. The Supreme Court heard the case in  
July 2017 and a judgment is awaited.
Rank has protected its position by submitting a claim 
for compound interest. It is possible that Rank may be 
required to undertake separate litigation even if the 
litigant is ultimately successful as HMRC considers 
that the existing judgments are not clear enough  
or general enough to be applied to other claimants. 
Rank will pursue its own claims when the Supreme 
Court judgment is available.
VAT claims
The following amusement machine VAT claims are outstanding:
VAT (£m) Status
October 2002 to 
September 2005
26.4 Found in favour of HMRC at the Supreme Court in July 2015. Remitted back to the First 
Tier Tribunal to consider similarities between amusement machines and fixed odds betting 
terminals. Tribunal hearing expected May 2018. 
April 2006 to 
January 2013
80.4 Rank is stood behind the litigation of another taxpayer. This case is expected to be heard 
by the First Tier Tribunal in winter 2017. Depending on the outcome of that litigation 
further litigation may be required by Rank. The issue is whether amusement machines 
were similar to fixed odds betting terminals.

CHAIRMAN’S GOVERNANCE 
INTRODUCTION
Ian Burke
Chairman
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present this year’s directors’ and corporate 
governance report. We are reporting this year against the  
April 2016 version of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the ‘Code’). We have been in compliance with the Code 
throughout the year under review.
Our responsibilities as a board include setting the Company’s 
strategic aims, providing the leadership to put them into effect 
and supervising the management of the business. The aim of 
this report is to explain how we have done that.
Culture and consumer protection
Corporate culture has continued to be an area of focus for  
the board this year, as has oversight of improvements to Rank’s 
social responsibility and anti-money-laundering controls across 
its businesses. We continue to aim for the highest standards,  
in keeping with our commitment to upholding the licensing 
objectives laid down in the Gambling Act 2005. During the 
year, the chairman, chief executive and social responsibility 
policy manager of the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) 
joined a Rank board meeting for a discussion in order that:
◊ the Rank board might deepen its understanding of what  
the UKGC was trying to achieve and for the UKGC to 
understand the issues that Rank was trying to address;
◊ the board should understand how Rank might contribute  
to the UKGC’s strategy; and
◊ the UKGC might understand how the board was using  
the UKGC’s new regulatory tool, the annual assurance 
statement process, to assist and deepen its understanding  
of responsible gambling.
Application of our social responsibility and anti-money-
laundering controls remains a challenge across some of our 
businesses and so we will continue to focus on the delivery of 
the cultural change across Rank that is required to ensure the 
effective delivery of consumer protection.
Lord Kilmorey continues to chair our board-level responsible 
gambling committee and his report can be found on page 68.
Diversity
During the year, the board and/or its committees have received 
briefings on several diversity-related issues, including:
◊ the Hampton-Alexander Review on improving gender balance 
in FTSE-company leadership;
◊ the Parker Report into ethnic diversity on UK boards; and
◊ the McGregor-Smith Review into race in the workplace.
We welcome the findings of the Hampton-Alexander Review 
and the Parker Report and we intend to put in place actions to 
implement the recommendations. We have a target of 33% of 
women on our board and we have set a target of 33% of women 
on the executive committee and of direct reports to the executive 
committee by 2020. We also aim to have at least one director  
of colour on our board by 2024. As at 30 June 2017, our data 
stood at:
Rank in June 2017 Female BAME

Plc board 12.5% 0%
Executive committee (inc. executive Plc directors) 22.2% 0%
Direct reports to executive committee/ 
heads of function 22.9% 3.6%

Governance
52 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Board succession
In anticipation of Owen O’Donnell, the chair of our  
audit committee, completing nine years of service on 
11 September 2017 and therefore no longer being independent, 
the board and its nominations committee have been focusing 
on succession planning. The report of the nominations 
committee can be found on page 65.
On 28 June 2017, we announced the appointment of 
Alex Thursby as a non-executive director with effect from 
1 August 2017. Mr Thursby serves on the board’s audit, 
remuneration and nominations committees and will chair  
the board’s audit committee with effect from the conclusion  
of the forthcoming annual general meeting when Mr O’Donnell 
will retire. Mr Thursby has had a long career in banking and has 
extensive experience in compliance and risk governance as well 
as experience of developing new, and transforming existing, 
businesses with the use of technology platforms.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my gratitude  
to all my board colleagues for their contributions this year.  
In particular, I would like to thank Owen O’Donnell for his 
valuable contribution as a director during his nine-year tenure 
on the board and his excellent chairmanship of the audit 
committee over the last three years.
Leadership and effectiveness
During the period under review, the leadership of our two  
retail businesses underwent change and, following on from  
last year’s evaluation, the board has been more engaged with 
the development of the leadership and strategies of those 
businesses. In June 2017, the contribution and effectiveness of 
our directors, both individually and collectively, underwent an 
internal evaluation. Areas for development included identifying 
opportunities to help management drive more value from the 
more challenged retail elements of the Group’s businesses,  
and improved depth of sector knowledge.
Governance – key features
In the table below I summarise the key features of governance 
at Rank and indicate where more information can be found in 
the report.
Conclusion
As a board, we recognise that it is imperative to have in place  
a strong governance framework which supports the Group’s 
strategic objectives and promotes the development of corporate 
culture and diversity across the business. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank our colleagues for their commitment 
to the business during the year.

Senior independent 
director
Our senior independent director is Chris Bell. 56
Composition,  
competence  
and experience
The composition of the board and all its committees complies with the Code. In particular, the Code’s 
requirements for recent and relevant financial experience and sector experience and the DTR’s requirement 
for competence in accounting or auditing and sector competence are complied with.
67
Responsibilities  
and election
There are clear terms of reference for the board and its committees and there is a clear separation of duties 
between the chairman and chief executive roles. We require all directors to stand for re-election annually.
54
Attendance The directors have all attended an acceptable number of board and committee meetings. 55
Evaluation An internal performance evaluation of the board and its committees was undertaken during the year.  
The last external evaluation was undertaken in 2015 and another will be undertaken in 2018.
57
Internal audit We have an internal audit function, details of which can be found in the audit committee report. 59
External audit Rank’s external audit was most recently tendered during 2009, resulting in a change of external auditors 
and the appointment of EY at the Company’s annual general meeting on 22 April 2010. In June 2017, the 
audit committee agreed that it would not be appropriate to decide on the timing of the audit tender until 
the committee chairman’s successor was in place.
64
Non-audit work policy We have a policy for the award of non-audit work performed by our external auditor and we have disclosed 
the non-audit work undertaken.
113
Remuneration During the year, the board and its remuneration committee have received briefings on external factors 
influencing executive pay and are mindful of the need to curb excessive remuneration, to align incentives 
with the long-term interests of the Company and shareholders and to increase transparency.

Board meetings allow for regular and frank discussion of 
strategy, trading, financial performance, regulatory affairs, 
responsible gambling and risk management.
During the period under review, the board’s committees also

The graphic below provides an overview of the board’s allocation 
of agenda time during the year, based on key areas of review at 
the meetings convened.
Insurance and indemnity
The Company has arranged insurance cover and indemnifies 
directors in respect of legal action against them to the extent 
permitted by law. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity 
applies in situations where a director has acted fraudulently 
or dishonestly.
Conflicts of interest
The directors have a statutory duty to avoid conflicts of interest. 
In accordance with the Company’s articles of association, it has 
adopted a policy and procedure for managing and, if appropriate,

chairman’s performance without him being present.
Effectiveness
The composition of the board
Size and structure
The nominations committee keeps the board’s size and 
structure under review. The nominations committee is of the 
view that the board is well balanced, providing a collective 
competence to suit the Group’s developing needs and an 
appropriate blend of executive and non-executive skill.  
We believe that all our directors are suitably qualified  
to help steer and challenge Group strategy.
More than half of our board excluding the chairman 
are independent.

56 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Commitment
The principal terms and conditions of appointment for each 
director are set out on pages 75 and 76, and their interests in 
Rank shares are detailed on page 82. All non-executive directors 
are required to disclose their other significant commitments, 
both before appointment and following subsequent changes,  
so that the board can satisfy itself that each of the directors  
has sufficient time to allocate to the Company to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively.
During the year the chairman became chairman of the FTSE 
SmallCap multi-channel retailer, Findel plc. Henry Birch is a 
trustee of GambleAware (formerly Responsible Gambling Trust) 
and Clive Jennings does not currently hold any directorships 
outside the Group. Executive Directors are not permitted to  
take up non-executive directorships outside the Group.
Development
Induction
During the period under review, no new non-executive 
directors were appointed to the board. Alex Thursby was 
appointed to the board as a non-executive director effective 
from 1 August 2017. As part of the comprehensive induction 
programme delivered to all non-executive directors, Mr Thursby  
met with senior management from across the business and 
visited the casino and bingo businesses accompanied by the 
respective managing directors of Mecca and Grosvenor.
Skills and knowledge
All directors are given regular written briefings with regard to 
matters affecting the Group’s businesses, such as the political 
and regulatory environment and corporate governance reform. 
Additionally, at the board’s request, the Group’s auditor keeps 
the board abreast of key impact items such as political and 
regulatory initiatives with regard to narrative reporting, 
executive remuneration, going concern and the role of  
the audit committee.
Directors are invited to identify to the company secretary  
or human resources director any desired skills and knowledge 
enhancements that they require so that appropriate training 
can be arranged.
Additionally, once a year, the directors have an opportunity  
to review and agree their respective training and development 
needs during their one-on-one meetings with the chairman.
Information and support
Assisted by the company secretary, the chairman is responsible 
for ensuring that directors receive accurate and timely 
information on all relevant matters.
The directors receive a monthly report of current and forecast 
trading results and treasury positions, as well as updates on 
shareholder views.
A rolling programme of items sets the agenda for board 
discussion. This is regularly reviewed and updated to cover 
topical issues and developments.
Comprehensive briefing papers on substantive agenda items  
are circulated at least five working days before meetings where 
possible. These contain detailed background information, thus 
freeing time for informed debate.
We operate an open-door policy between the board and the 
management team. Members of the management team also 
make regular board presentations to ensure a flow of operational 
information reaches the directors in a timely way.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company 
secretary and, if required, may take independent advice and/or 
professional development at the Company’s expense.
Evaluation
This year the evaluation of the board and its committees 
consisted of:
◊ individual private meetings between the chairman and board 
members at which feedback was given;
◊ a private meeting of the non-executive directors to review the 
performance of the chairman;
◊ a private meeting between the senior independent director and 
the chairman at which feedback on the performance of the 
chairman was given;
◊ an evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the  
audit committee using Ernst & Young LLP’s practical guide  
and toolkit and identification of actions for the forthcoming 
year; and
◊ an evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of  
the board’s other committees using questionnaires and 
identification of actions for the forthcoming year.
In addition, the chairman together with two non-executive 
directors evaluated the performance of the chief executive  
by means of a questionnaire and meeting. The outcome was 
discussed and then fed back to the other non-executive directors.
Actions identified from the above activities included:
◊ audit committee – implementation of a formal process for  
the committee to review the effectiveness of internal audit’s 
activities and identification of a method for assessing the 
financial literacy of committee members, of gaps in skills, 
knowledge and experience of committee members and,  
where necessary, of training and knowledge needs;
◊ nominations committee – closer monitoring of executive team 
succession, talent and resource, implementation of a plan to 
achieve board-level diversity targets, and review of the Group 
human resources director’s plan to achieve diversity targets for 
executive committee and direct reports to executive committee;
◊ remuneration committee – a further review of the committee’s 
terms of reference, and implementation of a process for aligning 
pay and conditions where acquisitions have been made;
◊ responsible gambling committee – redefinition of the 
committee’s purpose and goals and review of its terms of 
reference; and
◊ finance committee – review of its terms of reference.
The board met to discuss the effectiveness of itself and its 
committees during the year and concluded that, overall, it had 
functioned effectively during the period under review and that 
its committees continued to discharge their duties in line with 
their respective terms of reference.

Election and re-election
All new directors must stand for election at the first annual 
general meeting after their appointment and, thereafter, at 
intervals of no more than three years. Non-executive directors 
are engaged for an initial period of three years and must stand 
for election and re-election in the same way. The Company’s 
articles of association require one-third of serving directors to 
retire annually.
Alex Thursby was appointed to the board after the last annual 
general meeting and is therefore required to submit himself  
for election at the forthcoming annual general meeting on 
19 October 2017.
The Company complies with the Code’s requirement for annual 
re-election of directors of FTSE 350 companies. All directors will 
be submitting themselves for re-election at the forthcoming 
annual general meeting with the exception of Mr O’Donnell 
who has taken the decision to stand down from the board  
with effect from the conclusion of the forthcoming annual 
general meeting.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
The board as a whole takes responsibility for ensuring that 
satisfactory dialogue with shareholders takes place. As at 
30 June 2017, 56.16% of our shares were held by our majority 
shareholder, Hong Leong, and a further 38.08% were held by  
20 institutional shareholders.
Given that Rank is a 56.16% subsidiary of Guoco, the chief 
executive and other members of Rank’s executive management 
team meet with representatives of Guoco four times a year to 
discuss business performance and other issues that could  
impact their financial statements.
We speak with our institutional shareholders and city analysts 
through a programme of investor relations and regular meetings 
with principal shareholders conducted by our chief executive, 
finance director and director of investor relations.
All directors receive reports to keep them in touch with 
shareholder opinion. During the period under review, a total of 
52 meetings with 35 shareholders were attended by one or more 
of the chief executive and finance director.
Formal briefings on shareholder opinion are circulated to  
the board after presentation of the Company’s interim and 
annual results.
The principal method of communicating with all our 
shareholders is via our corporate website, www.rank.com. 
Information can be provided in paper format, but only  
when shareholders specifically request this.
Constructive use of the annual general meeting
All shareholders are welcome to attend our annual general 
meeting. Private investors are encouraged to ask questions.  
The chairman and chairmen of the audit and remuneration 
committees are all present.
Shareholders are invited to vote on the formal resolutions 
contained in the notice of meeting, which is published at least 
20 working days beforehand. The business presentation, voting 
results and a summary of the questions and answers are made 
available at www.rank.com, or in printed format on request.
Shareholders may also use electronic means to vote – or appoint 
a proxy to vote on their behalf – at the annual and other 
general meetings of the Company.
Next annual general meeting
The 2017 annual general meeting will be held on 
19 October 2017 and the full text of the notice of meeting, 
together with explanatory notes, is set out in a separate 
document at: www.rank.com/en/investors/shareholder-centre/
shareholder-meetings.html.
If you have elected for paper information, this will be enclosed 
with your hard copy of this annual report. Shareholders wishing 
to change that election may do so at any time by contacting the 
Company’s registrar, details of which can be found on page 146

58 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 AUDIT COMMITTEE
Owen O’Donnell
Chairman
Other committee members
Chris Bell, Steven Esom, Alex Thursby
Role of the audit committee
All members of the audit committee (the ‘Committee’) are 
independent, assisting the board in reviewing and maintaining 
internal controls, the management of risk and compliance with 
the law and regulation, namely by:
◊ taking responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal audit function;
◊ assessing the integrity of all public financial statements before 
their submission to the board, ensuring that a fair, balanced 
and understandable assessment of the Group’s ongoing 
position and prospects is presented;
◊ authorising any changes in accounting policies and reviewing 
the objectivity and effectiveness of the external auditor every 
year; and
◊ overseeing the Company’s internal code of conduct and 
monitoring the Company’s whistleblowing procedures through 
which employees may, in confidence, raise concerns about any 
possible improprieties in areas of financial reporting, financial 
control or ethical matters.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available from the 
Company’s website at: www.rank.com/en/investors/corporate-
governance/terms-of-reference.html, or by writing to the 
company secretary.
Audit committee membership and meetings
All members of the Committee are non-executive directors and 
have maintained independence throughout the period under 
review. Pursuant to Code provision C.3.1, the composition of 
the Committee provides a high level of financial experience and 
competence within the gaming sector. Chris Bell has extensive 
experience within the betting and gaming industry and Owen 
O’Donnell has held roles within the online gaming industry  
as well as being a chartered accountant.
Mr O’Donnell will be stepping down at the conclusion of the 
forthcoming annual general meeting, having served nine years 
on the board and thus no longer being considered independent. 
Following the appointment of Alex Thursby to the board as  
a non-executive director with effect from 1 August 2017, it  
is proposed that Mr Thursby serve as the chairman of the 
Committee, with effect from the conclusion of the annual 
general meeting. Mr Thursby has considerable experience 
within compliance and risk governance, having held senior 
executive and non-executive director roles within the 
banking sector.

and comprehensive  
manner to the  
audit committee
Perform  
‘deep-dive’ reviews into 
specific departments’  
and functions’ 
risk registers
A rolling agenda and topical items determine the Committee’s 
discussions. The Committee met formally four times in the 
period under review. Members of the Committee also met 
separately to discuss matters without the presence of 
management. The external auditor was also provided the 
opportunity to discuss any issues with the Committee  
without the presence of executive management.
At the invitation of the Committee chairman, the chief executive, 
finance director, company secretary, head of reporting and 
director of internal audit normally attend Committee meetings, 
as does the external auditor. Other board directors are encouraged 
to attend at least one Committee meeting a year at which the 
external auditor is present.
2016/17 activity
The graphic below provides an overview of the Committee’s 
allocation of agenda time during the year, based on key areas of 
review at the quarterly meetings.
Risk management
The Committee has four scheduled meetings per year, and  
by invitation welcomes specialist employees from various 
departments and functions of the Group to support detailed 
discussions of specific operational risks. The Committee 
supports the successful execution of the Group’s strategy,  
which requires a thorough and critical approach to identifying, 
accepting and mitigating existing and emergent risk; to that 
end both the board and the Committee take an active role  
in ensuring that a culture of risk awareness and risk-adjusted 
decision-making is embedded throughout the Group.
The Committee and the board monitor the effectiveness of  
the risk management process and regularly review the principal 
risks together with the controls and risk-mitigation actions put 
in place to manage them.
Whilst responsibility remains with the board, a key part of 
oversight of the risk management process is executed through 
the Group’s risk committee, which reports monthly to the board 
and provides oversight in relation to the Group’s risk exposure. 
The risk committee met 10 times during the year and comprises 
the chief executive, finance director, company secretary, chief 
information officer and director of internal audit.
Role of the risk committee:
The principal risks and uncertainties section on page 42 of  
the strategic report details the key areas of focus of the risk 
committee during the year.
The Committee reviews management’s biannual reports  
on anti-money-laundering, internal and external fraud, 
whistleblowing, internal code of conduct and inadvertent 
breaches of legislation, as well as reviewing the Group’s 
corporate risk register.

0 ®  Pursuant to Code provision C.2.2, in taking account of the 
Company’s current position and principal risks the board has 
adopted a period of three years for assessing the viability of the 
Company. The board agreed the proposed process to support 
the viability statement and has delegated to the Committee 
responsibility for overseeing this. The viability statement  
can be found on page 41.
Internal control framework
Our system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and 
provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. It controls, rather than eliminates, any 
human error, deliberate misconduct or uncertain events.
To maintain control and direction over strategic, financial, 
operational and compliance issues, the board has put in  
place formally defined lines of responsibility and delegation  
of authority. Established procedures are geared to identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant risks and to monitoring 
the Group’s businesses and performance.
This framework is reviewed annually and is designed to 
safeguard shareholders’ investments and the Group’s assets, 
while ensuring that proper accounting records are maintained. 
Senior management is responsible for making sure that controls 
and procedures are enforced and that the board is informed of 
any risks and control issues that arise.
Financial control: there is a comprehensive system for 
reporting financial results to the board, a budgeting process 
incorporating an approved budget and biannual re-forecasts. 
The chief executive and finance director hold monthly review 
meetings with managing directors and their respective directors 
of finance.
Financial reporting control: detailed policies and procedures 
are in place to ensure the accuracy and reliability of 
financial reporting.
Strategic control: the board reviews the Group’s strategic plans 
annually and regularly reviews strategic progress.
Operational control: procedures are laid down in detailed 
manuals and reinforced by employee training. Each business 
unit carries out a monthly self-audit to test key controls and 
report weaknesses to operational management.
Compliance control: across the Group we have teams  
whose responsibility it is to ensure day-to-day adherence to  
all legislation to which our operations are subject, including 
gambling, anti-money-laundering and health and safety.  
Senior executives and the internal audit team are responsible  
for monitoring overall compliance. They report to the 
Committee and the board.
The executive directors and senior management meet regularly 
with representatives from the businesses to address financial, 
human resource, risk management and other control issues.
At its meetings during the year and up to the date of approval 
of this annual report and financial statements, the Committee 
examined the effectiveness of the Group’s approach to internal 
control by reviewing changes to controls made during the year 
and reviewing the adequacy and progress of action plans to 
address failings or weaknesses identified in the Group’s system 
of internal control. This process has been reviewed by the  
board and meets the standards of Financial Reporting  
Council’s internal control guidance to directors.
Internal audit
The Committee has responsibility for the internal audit 
function and the director of internal audit reports directly  
to the chairman of the Committee. Our internal audit team 
provides an objective and regular stream of analysis and 
opinion on risk management and control. To avoid bias,  
it is entirely independent of the business operations under  
audit and maintains strict management of any conflicts of 
interest arising.
The scope of the audit coverage is approved by the Committee 
and covers all systems, procedures and activities of all operations, 
departments and functions within the Group, including 
projects, policy developments, and financial and non-
financial processes.
The Committee also agrees the annual audit plan, which  
covers operational, corporate and IT audits; reviews the level 
and nature of internal audit resource; and reviews the audit 
reports produced by the internal audit team.
Standard agenda risk reporting
Corporate risk register and methodology The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the methodology for the risk register, 
ensuring that it remains in line with the requirements of the business.
Assurance regarding anti-money laundering (AML), 
counter-terrorist financing (CTF) and anti-proceeds 
of crime (PoC) policies and procedures 
The Committee regularly reviews Mecca’s and Grosvenor’s management of controls  
in both retail and digital with regard to AML, CTF, PoC and legislative requirements.
Information security improvement plan Regular assessments are undertaken to review the progress achieved against management’s 
information security improvement plan and updated cyber security risks.
www.rank.com | 61 The internal audit team seeks to determine whether the system 
of risk management, control and governance processes, as 
designed and operated by management, is adequate and 
functioning in such a manner as to ensure that:
◊ risks are appropriately identified and managed in line with the 
Company’s risk appetite;
◊ operations are run with sufficient and adequate controls and in 
an efficient and effective manner;
◊ significant financial, managerial and operating information is 
accurate, reliable and timely;
◊ employee actions are in compliance with policies, standards, 
procedures, and applicable laws and regulations; and
◊ relevant laws, rules and regulations are complied with in the 
operation of the business.
To embed control further, the scores used by internal audit to 
monitor each business unit’s controls performance also affect 
operational management bonuses.
The director of internal audit makes regular presentations to  
the Committee and reporting includes comparative and trend 
analysis. During the period under review the Committee had 
three closed sessions with the director of internal audit without 
executive management being present.
Code of conduct
Rank has an employee code of conduct that sets out our values 
and principles and guides everyone’s behaviour. Adherence  
to the code is important as it upholds our reputation and 
relationships, inside and outside the Group.
The Committee is responsible for monitoring management 
reports on employee conduct, including our 
whistleblowing procedures.
Whistleblowing
Rank considers it important to maintain a culture of openness, 
honesty and opposition to fraud, corruption and unethical 
business conduct. It is Rank’s policy to implement and maintain 
procedures that promote ethical business conduct and reduce 
the risk of fraud and other irregularities, enabling early detection, 
investigation and reporting. To support this, Rank has a fraud 
and unethical business conduct whistleblowing policy which 
sets out the ways in which employees can voice their concerns 
about suspected fraud, corruption or unethical business conduct.
Culture
The Committee has reviewed the effective monitoring of 
Company culture and how this may be incorporated within  
the risk framework and assessed through the internal audit 
function. There has been a strong focus on the launch of the 
Group’s STARS values, details of which can be found on page 29 
of this report. Anonymous employee questionnaires have been 
used to gain further insight into employee satisfaction and 
there has been engagement in monitoring corporate culture 
using Glassdoor and LinkedIn.
Financial reporting and significant financial issues
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements. The Committee reviews 
accounting papers prepared by management which provide 
details of the main financial reporting judgements and estimates. 
The Committee also reviews reports by the external auditor on 
the full-year and half-year results which highlight any issues 
with respect to the work undertaken.
Significant accounting issues considered by the Committee 
during the year included:
◊ treatment of exceptional items;
◊ impairment review of intangible assets and property, plant  
and equipment;
◊ review of provisions, including those in relation to property 
leases, restructuring and indirect tax;
◊ review of the costs recognised as part of the Group 
restructuring undertaken;
◊ recoverability of the convertible loan note; and
◊ contingent assets and liabilities.
Exceptional items – The Committee reviewed the accounting 
treatment of exceptional items and members were in agreement 
that the items listed in note 4 are exceptional in size or nature 
in relation to the Group and therefore it is appropriate to 
disclose these separately.
Impairments – For goodwill and indefinite-life assets  
not subject to amortisation, the Group performs an annual 
impairment review. In addition, the Group also reviews assets 
that are subject to amortisation or depreciation for events or 
changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount 
of an asset or cash-generating unit may not be recoverable.  
If a definite-life asset has been previously impaired the Group 
considers whether there has been a change in circumstance or 
event that may indicate the impairment is no longer required. 
The Group considers each venue to be a cash-generating unit 
and therefore the review covers in excess of 150 individual 
cash-generating units.
The Committee reviewed management’s impairment review 
process including, where applicable, the potential indicators  
of impairment and/or reversal, cash flow projections and 
discount rates used to derive a value in use, and the sensitivity 
to assumptions made. During the year, the Committee reviewed 
total exceptional impairment charges of £6.7m in respect of 
four venues where performance has been below expectations, 
including a £4.1m impairment of Grosvenor’s Southend casino. 
The Committee also considered the exceptional reversal of 
previous impairment charges of £2.5m at three venues following 
a period of sustained performance recovery due to a competitor 
closure, and two reversals in Spain due to improvements in the 
local economic environment.
The Committee was of the view that the net impairment charge 
recognised of £4.2m was appropriate. Further details of the 
impairment charges and reversals are disclosed in note 4.

62 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Property leases – At both the half and the full year, the 
Committee considered the Group’s approach to property  
lease provisions, the discount rates applied and management’s 
recommendations, in order to satisfy itself how management 
came to its best estimate of property lease obligations. The 
Committee noted that the Group has a number of property 
leasehold contracts and was of the view that appropriate 
provision had been made against those property leases where 
the unavoidable costs exceed the expected economic benefit 
expected to be derived from the property. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed the exceptional net credit from property 
leases of £14.7m, including a £10.7m credit in relation to the 
successful surrender of the Bradford onerous lease following  
the venue’s closure, and it was of the view that the net credit 
released was appropriate. Further details of the property lease 
provision held are disclosed in note 21 and the exceptional 
adjustments made in the current year are disclosed in note 4.
In addition, the Committee was also updated in respect of certain 
property leasehold contracts where the rights and obligations but 
not the legal titles have been transferred to third parties such 
that the Group remains potentially liable in the event of default 
by the third party. Should default occur then the Group would 
have recourse to one or more guarantor entities. These leasehold 
contracts include eight remaining property leases, with lease 
durations of between 21 months and 96 years and a current 
annual obligation (net of sub-let income) of approximately 
£0.8m, that were transferred concurrent to the £211m sale and 
leaseback in 2006. The Committee noted the risk associated 
with the transfer of such property leasehold contracts but  
that the Group has not to date been notified of any default,  
or intention to default, in respect of the transferred leases. 
Further details of this contingent liability are disclosed  
in note 30.
Restructuring – The Committee received an update at both half 
and full year in respect of the Group restructuring undertaken 
during the year. The Committee considered the appropriateness 
of items included in the exceptional cost of £8.8m, together 
with the recognition criteria and measurement bases for the 
element provided for at the balance sheet date.
The Committee was satisfied that items included in the Group 
restructuring cost and the related provision were appropriate. 
Further details of the exceptional cost and related provision  
are disclosed in notes 4 and 21 respectively.
Indirect tax – The Committee receives and considers an  
update paper covering the Group’s indirect tax issues, including 
the Group’s VAT claims, at both the half and the full year. The 
Committee noted the decision of the Supreme Court in favour 
of HMRC regarding claims for overpaid VAT on certain types  
of amusement machines between 2002 and 2005, but that a  
full provision has been made for amounts not yet repaid.
The Committee was of the view that management’s best estimate 
of the liability for the issues that remained outstanding was 
appropriate. Details of the indirect tax liability recognised are 
disclosed in note 21.
Convertible loan note – The Committee considered 
management’s paper in respect of the recoverability of the 
convertible loan note due from the Group’s digital platform 
provider and recognised the significant level of judgement  
and estimation made by management in ascertaining its 
recoverability. It was noted that the estimation of fair value 
remains uncertain but that, based on the information presented 
by management, the committee is satisfied that the loan remains 
recoverable through conversion. The Committee will continue 
to monitor the appropriateness of the judgements and estimates 
made in respect of the recoverability of the convertible loan 
note during 2017/18.
Contingent assets and liabilities – In determining the 
accounting treatment of potential assets and liabilities 
management has applied judgement in assessing the probability 
of occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of the Company.
The Committee receives triannual updates from management, 
incorporating legal advice as appropriate, on the accounting 
treatment for potential assets and liabilities in relation to 
disclosure or recognition. The Committee is of the view  
that management has appropriately treated such items in  
the financial statements. Details of the liabilities are included  
in note 30.
In addition to the above, the Committee has been updated  
on progress in respect of the ongoing project to assess the 
impact of, and prepare for the transition to, IFRS 16 Leases.  
The Committee understands the impact of IFRS 16 on the 
Group will be material and as such will continue to request 
progress updates from management during 2017/18.
The Committee also receives and considers an update paper 
covering the Group’s ongoing direct tax issues at both the half 
and full year. These issues cover both discontinued operations 
with historic tax audits and continuing operations where tax 
returns submitted have been, or are likely to be, challenged by 
the relevant tax authority. The Committee was of the view that 
management’s best estimate of the liability for the remaining 
issues was appropriate. See note 17 for details of the direct tax 
liability recognised.
Financial Reporting Council review of interim accounts
In April 2017, the Company was notified that the Conduct 
Committee of the Financial Reporting Council had carried out  
a review of the Group’s interim report for the six months ended 
31 December 2016. The review raised no questions or queries 
on the interim report.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Details of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, and  
the controls in place to mitigate them, can be found on pages 
42 to 44 of the strategic report. Additionally, details of the 
financial risks that the Group faces can be found in note 19  
to the financial statements.
www.rank.com | 63 Committee evaluation
The Committee’s performance during the period under review 
was assessed via confidential questionnaires with Committee 
members and other individuals who support its work. The 
results were then reviewed by the Committee chairman and 
discussed with the board. The board agreed that the Committee 
continued to perform effectively. Further details of the 
evaluation process can be found on page 57.
Assessment of effectiveness of external audit process
Agreement on how best to assess the effectiveness of the 
external audit process was discussed between the Committee 
chairman, the finance director and the company secretary and a 
proposal agreed. That proposal was put to the other Committee 
members for agreement. Part of the effectiveness of the external 
audit process was assessed by the use of a questionnaire which 
posed questions in relation to different aspects of the external 
audit process. Those individuals employed by Rank most actively 
involved with the day-to-day aspects of the audit provided 
responses to certain questions asked of them. The views of Rank 
employees involved with the audit were considered, discussed 
and summarised and provided to audit committee members  
for discussion amongst themselves.
In addition to a private meeting between the Committee  
chair and the external audit partner, the Committee met with 
the auditor on three occasions following Committee meetings 
in closed sessions without executive directors to assess the 
objectivity and accuracy of financial reporting and to hear  
any other observations that the auditor had to make.
Audit tendering
The Committee has noted the requirements regarding  
audit tender and rotation of the audit engagement partner.  
The Company’s external audit was most recently tendered 
during 2009, resulting in a change of external auditors and  
the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP at the Company’s 
annual general meeting on 22 April 2010. There was a change of 
external audit partner following completion of the 31 December  
2015 interim review. The Committee has continued to give 
consideration to the timing of the next formal tender and has 
considered that it is not appropriate to define the timing of the 
tender until the successor to the current Committee chairman 
formally takes his seat. The Committee does not anticipate that 
a tender will be undertaken during the 2017/18 financial year 
and there are no contractual obligations that restrict the choice 
of external auditors.
Auditor
Having reviewed their performance throughout the period, our 
conclusion that Ernst & Young LLP’s effectiveness is satisfactory 
enables us to recommend their reappointment for 2017/18.
The auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, is willing to continue in office 
and a resolution that they be reappointed at a remuneration to 
be agreed by the Committee will be proposed at the forthcoming 
annual general meeting.
External auditor
Our auditor is employed to express an opinion on the financial 
statements. It reviews the systems of internal financial control 
and the data contained in the financial statements to the extent 
necessary to express its opinion.
It discusses with management the reporting of operational 
results and the financial position of the Group, and presents 
findings to the Committee.
Information
The directors in office at the date of this report are not aware  
of any relevant information that has not been made available  
to the auditor and each director has taken steps to be aware  
of all such information and to ensure it is available to the 
Company’s auditor.
Non-audit work
The Committee oversees the nature and amount of any 
non-audit work undertaken by the auditor to ensure it remains 
independent. Consequently, the Committee is required to 
approve in advance all non-audit services priced above £25,000.
When seeking external accountancy advice in relation to 
non-audit matters, the Group’s policy is to invite competitive 
tenders where appropriate. It is also the Group’s policy to 
balance the need to maintain audit independence with the 
desirability of taking advice from the leading firm in the area  
of advice being sought and the desirability of being efficient. 
Details of the fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP throughout the 
period under review can be found in note 3.
Rank has used the services of other accounting firms for 
non-audit work during the period under review.
Rank is satisfied that the objectivity and independence of the 
audit partner and the audit engagement team have not been 
compromised by the fees paid for the non-audit work 
undertaken by Ernst & Young LLP.
Assurance
The internal audit function and the external auditor presented 
their findings to the Committee in August and November 2016 
and in January and June 2017. We confirm that action plans to 
remedy identified weaknesses in internal control have been in 
place throughout the period.

Introduction
The nominations committee (the ‘Committee’) comprises  
the chairman and all independent non-executive directors.
The Committee is responsible for identifying relevant talent 
and nominating all board appointments with due regard for  
the benefits of diversity on the board, including gender 
and ethnicity.
2016/17 activity
During the year under review the Committee met formally on 
two occasions.
The main issues which the Committee discussed during the 
year under review were:
◊ preparations for the retirement of the audit  
committee chairman;
◊ review of board appointments process;
◊ board diversity;
◊ governance: strengthening the employee, customer and wider 
stakeholder voice;
◊ chairman succession planning;
◊ review of committee terms of reference;
◊ review of board skills; and
◊ board and committee composition.
Appointment of non-executive director
Alex Thursby was appointed to the board with effect from 
1 August 2017 for an initial term of three years subject to 
election at the forthcoming annual general meeting and 
thereafter subject to re-election at subsequent annual 
general meetings.
The key criteria applied in screening candidates for this 
appointment were that the successful individual would:
◊ bring a high level of commercial experience and expertise  
to the board to assist in its deliberations to create value  
for shareholders;
◊ be able to chair the audit committee, having the relevant  
levels of financial and accounting experience to do so; and
◊ have a good cultural fit with the current board and  
majority shareholder.
It was recognised that the individual’s diversity in outlook  
and attitude would be important and that ideally the successful 
candidate would also bring gender and/or ethnic diversity to 
the board.
A sub-committee of the board comprising the chairman,  
senior independent director and Susan Hooper was formed  
to conduct the search process. The board together with the 
majority shareholder and several advisers were requested to  
put forward the names of potential candidates who satisfied the 
above criteria. Given the quantity and quality of candidates put 
forward, it was determined that it was not necessary to appoint 
an external search firm or use open advertising to assist in 
identifying further candidates. Four candidates were short-listed 
for interview and all three sub-committee members met two of 
the short-listed candidates. The sub-committee met to review 
the four short-listed candidates and discuss who to put forward 
to the remaining members of the nominations committee  
for interview. The sub-committee agreed to put forward 
Mr Thursby as it felt that he best met the selection criteria.  
www.rank.com | 65 All other board members then each met Mr Thursby and their 
feedback was given to the Committee. Mr Thursby was already 
known to the majority shareholder due to Mr Thursby’s previous 
professional banking experience in Asia.
Following a meeting of the Committee, Mr Thursby was 
recommended to the board for appointment. At its meeting  
on 28 June 2017 the board unanimously resolved to appoint 
Mr Thursby to the board and to serve on its audit, remuneration 
and nominations committees and succeed to the chair of its 
audit committee upon the resignation of Mr O’Donnell at the 
conclusion of the 2017 annual general meeting.
The board is satisfied that Mr Thursby is independent by 
reference to the criteria set out in provision B.1.1 in the Code. 
Details of Mr Thursby’s experience, current and former roles  
can be found on page 51.
Board appointments process
The Committee reviewed its process for board appointments 
that had last been reviewed in March 2015. That review resulted 
in the secretary being requested to amend the process so that it 
specifically referred to ethnic diversity and so that any search 
firm engaged would speak to the brand managing directors  
in order to gain an understanding of the corporate culture.
Board diversity
During the period under review, the Committee has continued 
to consider the issue of diversity (including gender and ethnic 
diversity) in the context of the board and is mindful of the 
benefits that diversity brings to the board. The Committee  
has received briefings on:
◊ the Hampton-Alexander Review on improving gender balance 
in FTSE-company leadership;
◊ the Parker Report into ethnic diversity on UK boards; and
◊ the McGregor-Smith Review into race in the workplace.
The board welcomes these reports.
The board’s diversity policy is to recruit the best candidate 
having regard to the skills and experience required, but with a 
mind to diversity, including gender and ethnic diversity. The 
board continues to aim to achieve 33% female representation 
on Rank’s board. The Committee has also agreed to set a target 
of 33% women on Rank’s executive committee and of direct 
reports to the executive committee by 2020. Additionally, the 
board aims to have at least one director of colour by 2024 as 
recommended by the Parker Report.
As far as the recent appointment of a new non-executive 
director is concerned, the Committee did consider and discuss 
the selection of Mr Thursby as the preferred candidate in  
the context of gender and ethnic diversity. Given that his 
appointment did not advance the board’s gender and diversity 
aspirations, the Committee was of the view that it would be 
beneficial to start a process to look for a further non-executive 
director and has requested that sub-committee to progress this.
Further details of the gender breakdown of directors, senior 
management and the Group can be found on page 30 of the 
strategic report.
Governance: strengthening the employee, customer and 
wider stakeholder voice
During the year, the Committee received briefings on corporate 
governance reform and specifically the UK Government’s Green 
Paper on corporate governance: strengthening the employee, 
customer and wider stakeholder voice. The Committee discussed 
the benefits that could be obtained from having a worker 
representative on the board and whether there were other  
ways of obtaining those benefits without formal appointment. 
The Committee will continue to explore this.
Chairman succession planning
Led by the senior independent director, the Committee has  
had two discussions about chairman succession planning  
and the process and length of time that would be required  
to identify and recruit a successor. The Committee has also 
discussed contingency succession planning in the event of 
unforeseen circumstances.
Committee terms of reference
During the year, the Committee reviewed its terms of  
reference and agreed to recommend changes to the board so that  
certain matters would be expressly stated. The recommended 
amendments were approved by the board on 31 March 2017. 
The formal terms of reference of the Committee are available  
on our website at www.rank.com/en/investors/corporate-
governance/terms-of-reference.html, or by written request  
to the company secretary.
Board and committee composition and succession planning
The Committee keeps the board’s size and structure under 
review. The Committee is of the view that the board is well 
balanced, providing a collective competence to suit the Group’s 
developing needs and an appropriate blend of executive and 
non-executive skill. We believe that all our directors are suitably 
qualified to help steer and challenge Group strategy.
The composition and chairmanship of our board committees 
are considered annually and have been considered once during 
the period under review. Additionally, details of skills and 
length of tenure can be found on page 67.
The Committee considered the comments of the Institute of 
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on a chief executive’s 
membership of a board’s nominations committee and agreed 
that Henry Birch would step down as a formal member of the 
Committee although he would still attend meetings of the 
Committee at the invitation of the Committee chairman.
It was agreed that Susan Hooper would join the responsible 
gambling committee with effect from 1 July 2017.
The Committee also recommended that Alex Thursby join the 
audit, remuneration and nominations committees with effect 
from 1 August 2017 and that he chair the audit committee  
with effect from the conclusion of the 2017 annual general 
meeting upon the retirement of Owen O’Donnell.

COMMITTEE
Lord Kilmorey
Chairman
Other committee members
Chris Bell, Henry Birch, Ian Burke, Susan Hooper
The responsible gambling committee (the ‘Committee’) has 
now completed its first full year, having been formed in the 
second half of 2015/16.
The Committee met on four occasions during the year.
The Committee exists to assist in the formulation and 
monitoring of the Group’s responsible gambling strategy.  
The formal terms of reference for the committee are available  
at www.rank.com/en/investors/corporate-governance/terms-of-
reference.html or by written request to the company secretary.
During the year, the Committee benefited from the insight  
and thoughts of Dr Simon Tanner of the Responsible Gambling 
Strategy Board and separately Professor Ian McHale from Salford 
University who, along with his colleague Professor David Forrest, 
undertook an extensive examination of machine play and loss- 
chasing behaviour using data from Grosvenor Casinos. We shall 
continue to invite guests to attend Committee meetings so as to 
expand and renew our understanding in the fields of problem 
gambling research, education and treatment.
The Committee has contributed to the close examination of a 
number of key matters. We have considered and contributed to 
Rank’s response to a call for evidence issued by the Department 
for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; the review of gaming 
machines and social responsibility.
The review reinforces that every gambling service provider must 
be actively involved and investing in developing our collective 
understanding of gambling-related harm. We must achieve 
continual improvement.
We welcome the Gambling Commission’s insistence that 
customer welfare and fairness come first. We understand  
the requirement to make demonstrable progress and we are 
determined to meet that objective. The Annual Assurance 
Statement process has led to positive discussion and debate  
and given focus to the Group’s activities. The Committee  
will continue to monitor and support this process.
During the year, we have increased responsible gambling 
resources, not least through two appointments dedicated to  
this area: a head of responsible gambling and a data scientist. 
We have created a two-year plan of activity which we will  
be discussing at the first meeting of 2017/18 and will be 
monitoring thereafter.
The Group’s commitment to the welfare of its customers is clear 
and the Group’s culture supports this. This is a complex and 
challenging subject everyone in Rank understands, as we 
continue to invest in the wellbeing of customers.

Annual statement
Introduction
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present Rank’s 
remuneration report which will be subject to the usual annual 
advisory vote at the 2017 annual general meeting.
Performance in 2016/17
It was a challenging year for our retail businesses, with the Group 
delivering revenue (before customer incentives) marginally  
up on prior year. However, a strong digital performance and 
improved cost discipline across the Group contributed to a  
1% increase in operating profit (before exceptional items).
Our performance resulted in annual bonus pay-out of 63%  
of maximum opportunity for the chief executive and 42% of 
maximum opportunity for the finance director. These outcomes 
were lower than last year reflecting underperformance against 
the Group profit after tax target.
Taking account of comments from some investor bodies made 
last year, this year we have improved disclosure on the 2016/17 
bonus outcome by clearly setting out how the bonus pool was 
calculated and the basis upon which allocations were made to 
the two executive directors.
The performance period for the 2014/15 long-term incentive 
plan (2014/15 LTIP) ended on 30 June 2017, the performance 
conditions for which were based 50% on Group EBITDA,  
Group profit after tax and Group digital revenue and 50% on  
a balanced scorecard of non-financial and strategic measures 
linked to business objectives. Performance, details of which  
are set out on pages 79 and 80, resulted in 37.5% of the award 
vesting, 45% of which is due to vest on 1 December 2017 with 
the remainder of the award vesting 30% on 1 December 2018, 
and 25% on 1 December 2019, subject to continued employment.
The Committee believes the bonus and long-term incentive 
outcomes are fair reflections of performance over their respective 
performance periods. Further details for both the annual bonus 
and LTIP are described in the annual report on remuneration 
on pages 78 to 81.
The 2014/15 LTIP award was a ‘block award’ covering three 
annual awards with no awards made in 2015/16 and 2016/17. 
This structure results in a reported LTIP vesting value every 
three years and no vesting value in the two intermittent  
years. 2016/17 marked the end of the performance period  
and therefore the single total figure of remuneration for both 
directors increased significantly this year reflecting no potential 
vesting event in the prior year, 2015/16. This was despite 
relatively modest vesting at 37.5% of maximum.
Base salaries were reviewed during the year and the Committee 
was minded to increase executive directors’ salaries by the 
general increase of the workforce. However, the directors 
requested that they have no increase and therefore salaries 
remained unchanged at 1 April 2017, the effective date 
for increases.
Directors’ remuneration report
Governance
70 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Remuneration policy
The key focus of the Committee this year was to design a new 
remuneration policy and to ensure that the annual bonus and 
long-term incentive schemes being proposed enable Rank to 
attract, retain and reward Rank’s senior executives to deliver 
optimal and sustainable returns to shareholders. In order to 
allow sufficient time for us to consult with our shareholders  
and their representative bodies on our proposals for short- and 
long-term plans, we will bring our proposed new remuneration 
policy to shareholders for approval at a general meeting to be 
held as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event no  
later than 22 April 2018 when the current policy expires.
The shareholder circular for the general meeting will contain 
our proposed new remuneration policy and all the disclosures 
for that policy including an explanation of the structure of the 
new policy, the key changes to the policy and the rationale  
for such changes. Therefore, the remuneration policy in this 
remuneration report is the policy approved at the general 
meeting on 22 April 2015. This policy has been included to 
comply with Section 421(2A) of the Companies Act 2006 and 
will be replaced by any new remuneration policy approved by 
shareholders at the general meeting.
Conclusion
The Committee has made significant efforts to improve 
disclosure this year and believes that the annual and long-term 
incentive outcomes are reflective of performance over their 
relative measurement periods. At the annual general meeting, 
the annual report and this annual statement for 2016/17 will  
be put to a single advisory vote which we hope you will be able 
to support.
We will be returning with a new remuneration policy for 
shareholder approval later this year and this will have taken 
into account the views of our major shareholders.
I and my fellow Committee members will be present at  
the annual general meeting to answer any questions that 
shareholders might have. We look forward to receiving 
your support.

The Committee reviews the Company’s remuneration philosophy 
and structure each year to ensure that the remuneration 
framework remains effective in supporting the Company’s 
strategic objectives and fairly rewards individuals for the 
contribution that they make to the business, having regard  
to the size and complexity of the Group’s operations and the 
need to motivate and attract employees of the highest calibre.
The performance of Rank is dependent upon the quality of its 
directors, senior executives and employees and therefore the 
Group seeks to attract, retain and motivate skilled directors  
and senior executives of the highest calibre, without paying 
more than is necessary. In order to attract such individuals,  
the Committee needs to ensure that the remuneration packages 
properly reflect an individual’s duties and responsibilities, are 
appropriate and competitive, sensitive to pay elsewhere within 
the Group and directly linked to performance.
Committee’s approach to setting pay policy
The Committee intends that the base salary and total 
remuneration of executive directors should be competitive 
against other similar gaming peers and companies of a broadly 
similar size. Remuneration is benchmarked against rewards 
available for equivalent roles in suitable comparator companies, 
with the aim of paying neither significantly above nor below 
market levels for each element of remuneration at target 
performance levels.
The Committee also considers general pay and employment 
conditions of all employees within the Group and is sensitive  
to these, to prevailing market and economic conditions and  
to governance trends when assessing the level of salaries and 
remuneration packages of executive directors and other 
members of the executive committee.
The total remuneration package links corporate and individual 
performance with an appropriate balance between short-  
and long-term elements, and fixed and variable components. 
The policy is designed to incentivise executives to meet the 
Company’s key objectives, and so a significant proportion  
of total remuneration is performance-related.
The Committee will set targets for the different components  
of performance-related remuneration so that they are both 
appropriate and sufficiently demanding in the context of the 
business environment and the challenges facing the Group.

Mechanics
Operation and performance framework Maximum
Base 
salary
To attract and 
retain skilled, high-
calibre individuals 
to deliver the 
Group’s strategy.
Base salaries are reviewed annually and are appropriately set to reflect:
◊ the role’s scope, responsibility and accountabilities;
◊ market data;
◊ general rates of increase across the Group, and
◊ the performance and effectiveness of the individual.
Any increase will take effect on 1 January of the following year.
Ordinarily any increases in executive directors’ 
base salaries will be limited to those received  
by the wider workforce during the year (except  
for reasons of promotion or salary being 
determined to be significantly out of line  
with market median).
Insured 
and other 
benefits
Insured and other 
benefits are offered 
to executive 
directors as part  
of a competitive 
remuneration  
package.
Insured benefits comprise private healthcare insurance for executive directors and dependants, life 
assurance and permanent health insurance.
Other benefits comprise a cash car allowance and the fuel cost of all mileage (private and business). 
The amount of the cash car allowance is reviewed periodically by the Committee in the light of 
market conditions.
The Committee retains the discretion to offer relocation assistance in the 
form of an allowance or otherwise to support the movement of executive 
talent across the business. If provided, the Committee aims to ensure 
payments are not excessive and support business needs. As such, relocation 
assistance will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis taking into account factors 
such as the individual’s circumstances and the geographies involved, 
meaning that there is no prescribed formula for calculating the level  
or structure of payments.
It is anticipated that the provision of insured  
and other benefits will not exceed 10% of salary.
The Committee may exceed this should the cost  
of the benefits provided change in accordance 
with market conditions or in the event of the 
payment of relocation assistance. 
Retirement

Rewards sustained 
contribution and

Executive directors are automatically enrolled in The Rank Group Workplace Pension Scheme  
(the ‘Pension Scheme’) in accordance with the Company’s obligations under the Pensions Act 
2008. The Company will contribute into the Pension Scheme at the rate of 10% of the executive 
director’s base salary. If the executive director chooses to opt out of his automatic enrolment in the 
Pension Scheme he is entitled to receive a cash allowance of an annual amount equivalent to 10% 
of basic salary.
The Committee retains the discretion to honour all contractual pension 
arrangements agreed prior to the application of this Policy. Details of such 
arrangements are disclosed in the Annual Remuneration Report. 
For all new appointments, the maximum pension 
contribution (defined contribution or cash 
supplement) will be 10% of base salary.

the Company.
Rank operates an annual cash bonus scheme in which executive directors participate. Under  
the scheme an annual bonus pool is created based on the return on shareholder funds over a 
one-year period.
The bonus plan operates on a pool system with sharing rates varying based on performance  
above a threshold. The mechanics of the plan are set by the Committee at the start of the year with 
payment made after the year end following the Committee’s assessment of performance relative  
to targets. The primary performance measure is the return on shareholder funds, as this determines 
the size of the pool. The allocation of the pool between individuals is at the Committee’s discretion 
in light of the achievement of annual financial and strategic goals as well as individual performance. 
A full description of the performance measures in place and how this determines the bonus pool 
will be provided in the Annual Remuneration Report.
The scheme operates a threshold level of performance below which no bonus is paid. However, the 
resulting pay-out, as a percentage of salary, will vary year-on-year in line with bonus pool funding.
The measures governing the allocation of the pool to executive directors will 
be set and disclosed retrospectively on an annual basis, to the extent this is 
not commercially sensitive.
The annual bonus plan is discretionary and the Committee reserves the  
right to adjust payments up or down. Any such adjustment would only be  
in exceptional circumstances which would be outlined in the relevant year’s 
Annual Remuneration Report. Clawback provisions do not apply to the 
annual bonus plan.
To allow the Committee to assess the quality of earnings over the year and to 
introduce an element of retention into the scheme, any cash bonuses earned 
by the executive directors will be subject to a six-month deferral period and 
will be paid in the December following the 30 June financial year end. 
CEO: 100% of base salary
FD: 80% of base salary
Long-term

plan
The long-term 
incentive plan is 
intended to align 
the interests of the 
executive directors 
and shareholders 
through the 
creation of 
shareholder value 
over the long-term. 
The Rank Group Plc 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan is currently the only long-term equity-based 
incentive scheme in place for the executive directors and other senior executives.
Executive directors may receive contingent share awards which have the ability to vest after a 
three-year period based on the achievement of specified performance targets. The Committee may 
apply a further holding period to all or part of the award to further align directors’ interests with 
those of shareholders.
The Committee will determine measures and targets at the beginning of each cycle to ensure 
continuing alignment with strategy. Performance targets may relate to both financial and 
non-financial measures linked to the Company’s long-term business strategy, including  
but not limited to:
◊ Group EBITDA;
◊ Group profit after tax;
◊ Group annual active customers;
◊ Group digital revenue;
◊ Group ROCE; and
◊ Strategic objectives of the Group.
The following amounts will vest in accordance with performance:
There is no threshold level of performance under the plan.
Maximum: 100%
Other points on the vesting schedule will be determined by the Committee 
when the performance targets are set.
At the end of the performance period, the Committee will have absolute 
discretion to determine the extent to which the awards will vest, if at all,  
on account of underlying Company performance. If discretion is applied,  
the level and reasons for its application will be fully disclosed in the 
following year’s Annual Remuneration Report.
Clawback and malus provisions will apply to awards made under the plan.
Normal maximum per annum award levels

An exceptional maximum per annum award  
level of 400% of salary is also effective under the 
Policy. The Committee does not intend to use  
the exceptional maximum beyond the first year  
of the policy where, for technical reasons, a higher 
maximum is required to implement the new 
long-term incentive plan. In this first year the 
actual value, at grant, of active awards will not 
exceed the normal maximum levels specified 
above. More detail will be available in the

www.rank.com | 73 Additional notes to the Policy table
Setting of performance measures and targets
The Committee reviews and selects performance measures  
at the beginning of each award cycle under both the annual 
bonus plan and the long-term incentive plan, being informed 
by the short- and long-term priorities of the Group at the  
time. The Committee considers the Group’s key performance 
indicators and strategic business plan when selecting measures 
and calibrating targets. Details of these are included in the 
annual report each year. Factors that the Committee may 
consider include the benchmark return rate on shareholder 
funds, the strategic plan, the annual budget, analysts’ forecasts, 
economic conditions, individuals’ areas of responsibility, the 
Committee’s expectations over the relevant period and input 
from the major shareholder.
Differences in the remuneration policy for executives relative 
to the broader employee population
The remuneration policy in place for the executive directors  
is informed by the structure operated for the broader employee 
population. Pay levels and components vary by organisational 
level but the broad themes and philosophy remain consistent 
across the Group:
◊ salaries are reviewed annually with regard to the same factors 
as set out in the Policy table for executive directors;
◊ consistent with executive directors, senior executives together 
with general and some operational managers of our business 
units participate in an annual bonus plan with bonus pool 
funding dependent on profit performance of the Group or 
brand depending on their level;
◊ members of the senior management team can be considered 
for awards under the long-term incentive plan. This is intended 
to encourage share ownership in the Company and align the 
management team with the strategic business plan; and
◊ eligibility for and provision of benefits and allowances varies 
by level and local market practice. It is standard for senior 
executives to receive a company car allowance. Pension 
provision below board level is overall at lower contribution 
rates, with the majority of Rank’s eligible employees now  
being automatically enrolled into the NEST workplace  
pension scheme. However, a significant proportion of 
employees remain in Rank’s stakeholder pension plan,  
where the standard contribution rates are the same as  
those offered to board-level members.
Potential reward opportunities at different levels  
of performance
The graphs below exhibit the remuneration policy for existing 
executive directors and show indicative total remuneration 
levels under different performance scenarios. The remuneration 
policy results in a high proportion of total remuneration being 
dependent on performance, with a majority tied to the 
long-term performance of the Group.
The annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes do not 
operate an ‘on-target’ award level. Under the bonus scheme, 
awards will depend on bonus pool funding and as such are 
variable year on year. A cap is in place under the scheme. Under 
the long-term incentive plan performance is considered against 
each selected metric independently with Committee discretion 
applied as to the level of overall vesting. Given the structure of 
incentive arrangements we have not provided an ‘on-target’ 
scenario in the following charts, rather a minimum and 
maximum only, which better reflects the operation of the 
incentive schemes at Rank. The two performance scenarios  
are calculated as follows:
◊ Minimum – performance below target which results in no 
variable remuneration being payable.
◊ Maximum – 100% of the maximum annual cash bonus and 
full vesting of the long-term incentive award achieved. Normal 
maximum awards as described under the Policy are presented.
Assumptions
◊ Fixed elements comprise base salary, pension and benefits. 
Base salary and pension levels are as at 1 July 2017.
◊ The long-term incentive award values depicted in the  
charts above represent the annualised opportunity to directors 
under the currently-operated remuneration policy. Normal 
maximum awards as described under the Policy are presented.
◊ No adjustment is made for share price growth or the payment 
of dividends.
◊ No element of pay for the chairman or non-executive directors 
varies with performance and so no separate graphs are included.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will apply the existing remuneration policy  
to new executive directors in respect of all components  
of remuneration. As such, the maximum level of variable 
remuneration which may be granted is 100% of salary on an 
annualised basis for the chief executive and 80% of salary on  
an annualised basis for other executive directors.

• • • 
• • •  The Committee may also make an additional award of cash  
or shares on the appointment of a new director in order to 
compensate for the forfeiture of an award from a previous 
employer. Such awards would be made on a comparable  
basis, taking account of performance, the proportion of  
the performance period remaining and the type of award.  
The Committee will set appropriate performance conditions 
and vesting would be on the same time horizon as the 
forfeited award.
For both internal and external appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
expenses, as set out in the Policy table.
New non-executive directors will be appointed on the same 
remuneration elements as the existing non-executive directors. 
It is not intended that variable pay, day rates or benefits in kind 
be offered.
Approach to termination payments
The Company does not believe in reward for failure. The 
circumstances of a director’s termination (including the 
director’s performance) and an individual’s duty to mitigate 
losses are taken into account in every case. Rank’s policy is to 
stop or reduce compensatory payments to former executive 
directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from 
other employment during the compensation period.
Compensatory payments are limited to 12 months’ base  
salary, cash car allowance and defined pension contributions 
(or salary supplements).
Annual bonus awards will lapse in their entirety in the event  
an individual is no longer employed or is serving their notice 
period at the time of pay-out.
If the holder of a long-term incentive award ceases, for any 
reason, to be an executive director or employee of a Rank  
Group company, that holder’s long-term incentive award  
shall lapse immediately upon them ceasing to be an executive 
director or employee. However, the Committee may in its 
absolute discretion allow awards to continue until the normal 
vesting date and be satisfied, subject to the achievement of the 
relevant performance conditions. In such circumstances, awards 
vesting will be prorated on a time-apportioned basis, unless  
the Committee determines otherwise. Any such discretion in 
respect of leavers would only be applied by the Committee to 
‘good leavers’ where it considers that continued participation  
is justified, for example, by reference to past performance to  
the date of leaving.
Change of control
In the event of a change of control, the Committee has  
absolute discretion as to whether and on what basis awards 
should vest under the long-term incentive plan. The Committee 
would normally allow awards to vest upon a change of control 
subject to satisfaction of performance conditions and reduction 
on a time-apportioned basis.
Executive directors’ service agreements
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors have rolling service agreements.
The current executive directors’ service contracts contain the key terms shown in the table below:
Provision Detailed terms
Remuneration ◊ Base salary, pension and benefits
◊ Cash car allowance
◊ Private health insurance for director and dependants
◊ Life assurance
◊ Permanent health insurance
◊ Participation in annual bonus plan, subject to plan rules
◊ Participation in long-term incentive plan, subject to plan rules
◊ 25 days’ paid annual leave
Notice period 12 months’ notice from both the Company and the director
Termination payment Payment in lieu of notice equal to:
◊ 12 months’ base salary
◊ Cash car allowance
◊ Pension supplement
All of the above would be paid in monthly instalments, subject to an obligation on 
the part of the director to mitigate his loss such that payments would either reduce,  
or cease completely, in the event that the director gained new employment.
Restrictive covenants During employment and for nine months after leaving
www.rank.com | 75 Copies of the executive directors’ service contracts are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Service agreements outline the components of remuneration 
paid to the individual director but do not prescribe how 
remuneration levels may be adjusted from year to year.
The executive directors have served on the board for the periods 
shown below and have service agreements dated as follows:
Position Name Date of contract
Length of board service

Chief executive Henry Birch 24 April 2014 3 years 2 months
Finance director Clive Jennings 27 July 2011 5 years 11 months
Chairman
The chairman, Ian Burke, has a letter of engagement dated 
22 April 2014 which is effective from 6 May 2014 and which 
replaced his service agreement dated 6 March 2006 in respect  
of his former role as chief executive. He was initially engaged  
as non-executive chairman for a period of three years. His 
appointment is terminable without compensation on three 
months’ notice from either side. The chairman receives an 
all-encompassing fee of £160,000 per annum (2016/17: £150,000) 
which includes his chairmanship of the nominations and 
finance committees. The fee is reviewed annually by the 
Committee, with reference to the size and complexity of the 
role and external market comparisons, in the final quarter of 
each calendar year, with any increase taking effect on 1 April 
the following year. The chairman is not entitled to any benefits 
in kind and is not eligible for pension scheme membership, 
bonus or incentive arrangements.

Shareholder engagement
In putting together this policy, we consulted with our major 
shareholders and received largely positive feedback.
However, some concerns remain, particularly regarding the  
use of a three-year block award. The Committee feels strongly 
that this feature remains fit for purpose and will motivate  
the executive team to deliver value for shareholders over the 
longer term. In particular, we have received strong support  
for the plan from our major shareholder.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
As described in the notes to the Policy table on page 74 the 
overarching themes of the Policy in place for executive directors 
are broadly consistent with those applied to the wider employee 
population. The Committee does not use any comparison 
metrics when reviewing pay in relation to the wider employee 
population, other than the consideration of the general rates of 
increase across the Group, nor does it deem it to be appropriate 
to consult with employees on the remuneration policy for 
executive directors.
Annual remuneration report
The directors’ remuneration report has been prepared  
on behalf of the board by the remuneration committee  
(the ‘Committee’), under the chairmanship of Steven Esom.
The Committee has applied the principles of good governance set 
out in the Corporate Governance Code and, in preparing this 
report, has complied with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations  
2013 (the ‘Regulations’).
Rank’s external auditor is required to report to shareholders on 
the audited information contained in this report and to state 
whether, in its opinion, it has been prepared in accordance  
with the Regulations.

1 Taxable benefits comprise car allowance and fuel benefit; and life, long-term disability and private medical insurances, as detailed on page 72 of the Policy report.
2 LTIP vesting values under the 2014/15 LTIP for which performance ended on 30 June 2017. The figures shown in the table are based on the average share price (217.87 
pence) for the three months to 30 June 2017 and will be restated with the actual vesting values in next year’s report. Based on the performance conditions assessed at 
30 June 2017 (see page 72 for full detail on the vesting conditions), 515,132 shares for the chief executive and 227,961 shares for the finance director are expected to  
vest provided the directors meet the service requirements.
3 Unaudited note: The 2014/15 LTIP award was a ‘block award’ covering three annual awards with no awards made in 2015/16 and 2016/17 and a performance period 
ending on 30 June 2017. This structure results in a reported LTIP vesting value every three years with no vesting value in the two intermittent years. The annualised 
vesting value (calculated by dividing the three-year block LTIP award vesting value by three) would be £374,102 for the chief executive and £165,551 for the finance 
director, making their respective 2016/17 total remunerations, £1,260,246 and £653,290 on an annualised basis.

8 Taxable benefits comprise car allowance, fuel benefit and life, long-term disability and private medical insurances.
Non-executive directors receive fees only, details of which are provided on page 84 together with the non-executive chairman’s 
fees. These amounts are within the maximum annual aggregate amount of £500,000 currently permitted by the Company’s articles 
of association.
The aggregate total annual amount received by all directors during the year ended 30 June 2017 is shown below:
2016/17 2015/16
Executive directors

£2,992,841 £1,490,563
Chairman and non-executive directors £418,500 £394,738
Total £3,411,341 £1,885,301
9 Unaudited note: The aggregate total amount received by the executive directors in 2016/17 includes the vesting value of the 2014/15 LTIP award which was a ‘block 
award’ covering three annual awards with no awards made in 2015/16 and 2016/17 and a performance period ending on 30 June 2017. This structure results in a 
reported LTIP vesting value every three years with no vesting value in the two intermittent years. If the 2014/15 LTIP vesting value is annualised (by dividing the 
three-year block LTIP award vesting value by three), the aggregate total amount received by the executive directors for 2016/17 would be £1,913,536.
www.rank.com | 77 Directors’ remuneration report continued
Base salary (Audited)
Salaries were subject to a review during the year with any increases applying from the salary review date, 1 April 2017.
The Committee was minded to increase executive directors’ salaries by the general increase of the workforce. However, the directors 
requested that they should have no increase and therefore base salaries remain unchanged at 1 April 2017:
1 April 2017 1 April 2016 % change
Chief executive £495,000 £495,000 Nil
Finance director £315,000 £315,000 Nil
Annual bonus plan (Audited)
The annual bonus plan is structured as a pool funded each year as a percentage of modified profit after tax (modified to exclude 
bonus and LTIP costs) with the sharing rate dependent on performance. Performance is based on the rate of return achieved on 
opening shareholding funds.
The concept of shareholders’ funds was introduced in July 2012 using the market value of the Company at the time. Shareholders’ 
funds are inflated annually by the difference between continuing profit after tax and exceptional items for the year and dividends 
paid to shareholders.
The target rate of return is set at the beginning of each year by the Committee. For 2016/17 the target rate of return was set at  
10%, at which point a bonus pool of 2.25% of modified
1
 profit after tax is created for the executive directors and other executive 
committee members. This pool is then subject to a bonus rate modifier adjusting the pool from 50% to 100%, dependent on 
performance versus benchmark return on shareholder funds.
Performance against target rate of return on shareholders’ funds of 10% Modifier
Share of bonus pool  
(% of modified

 profit after tax)
Greater than 95% 100% 2.25%

80%-90% 70% 1.575%
70%-80% 50% 1.125%
Less than 70% 0% 0%
The remuneration committee has the discretion to exclude items reported as discontinued or exceptional. The bonus pool is 
allocated at the discretion of the Committee with regard to individual, corporate and relative performance.
The opening shareholders’ funds for 2016/17 were £709.4m (2015/16: £663.8m).
2016/17 annual cash bonus (Audited)
The annual bonus payment is determined by modified
1
 profit after tax (PAT) for the year ending 30 June 2017, being £63.4m. This 
performance resulted in a return on opening shareholders’ funds (ROSF) of 8.9%. As this was between 80%-90% of the 10% target 
rate of return, a 70% bonus modifier was applied in determining the bonus pool.
The bonus pool for 2016/17 was based on a share of modified
1
 PAT as follows:

1 Actual PAT of £63.1m modified to add back the executive annual bonus pool and deduct the credit arising from revising vesting expectations on the 2014/15 LTIP –  
a net adjustment of +£0.3m.
The bonus pool of £0.9m was significantly lower than last year’s pool of £1.4m, reflecting profit performance during the year.
The Committee carefully reviewed the individual performance of the chief executive and finance director during the year. The 
resulting payouts were 36% of the pool for the chief executive and 12% for the finance director, or 63% and 42% of maximum 
opportunity for the chief executive and finance director respectively.
Set out below are key achievements of the chief executive and finance director during the year that the Committee took into 
account, when determining the bonus pool allocation:
Chief Executive
◊ Three out of four business segments delivered their budgets, with a particularly strong performance in digital;
◊ exercise of strong cost control throughout the business on the back of an inflationary environment;
◊ new revenue-generating initiatives in place, including the launch of Luda; and
◊ the launch of sports betting.
Governance
78 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Finance director
◊ Group simplification;
◊ cost reductions; and
◊ progress with implementation of new general ledger system.
The entire cash bonus will be subject to a six-month deferral period and therefore will be paid in December 2017.
Long-term incentives (Audited)
The Rank Group Plc 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) is currently the only long-term incentive scheme in place for the 
executive directors and other senior executives. A single award was made in 2014/15 under the LTIP and no awards were made  
in 2015/16 or 2016/17.
LTIP awards were granted on 22 April 2015 to Henry Birch and Clive Jennings, based on performance over the three-year period 
ending 30 June 2017.

Of the award, 50% was subject to Group and brand financial performance measured over the three financial years to 30 June 2017 
with the remaining 50% based on a balanced scorecard of non-financial and strategic measures linked to business objectives.
Subject to continued employment to the relevant vesting dates, the awards will vest at 37.5% based on performance against the 
original targets. Performance against targets is shown below:

www.rank.com | 79 Directors’ remuneration report continued
The remaining 50% of the award was based on a balanced scorecard of non-financial and strategic measures linked to business 
objectives. Performance against each objective is shown below:
Business objective Strategic measure Performance 
Building Rank’s digital 
capabilities
New digital platform in place during the 
course of the 2015/16 financial year
Weighting: 20.4%
Achievement: 20.4%
A new digital platform for Mecca and Grosvenor went live at the  
end of February 2016. The modules included content management 
system, player management, cashier, bonus, notifications etc. The 
committee perceived the platform to be of a high standard and that 
it was delivered on time. Therefore, this objective was met in full.
New and differentiated poker product Weighting: 7.5%
Achievement: 3.8%
New product from Microgaming successfully implemented with 
good revenue growth since launch but below the anticipated level. 
The Committee therefore decided that 50% of the objective had  
been achieved.
Creating a multi-channel 
offering
Single account and wallet functionality  
by the end of calendar year 2016
Weighting: 33.8%
Achievement: 0%
The single account and wallet will launch in 2017/18, and therefore  
the Committee decided that the objective had not been achieved.
New retail management systems for  
Mecca and Grosvenor 
Weighting: 11.4%
Achievement: 5.8% (Grosvenor)
Achievement: 0.0% (Mecca)
The new retail management system for Grosvenor has been 
successfully deployed but the Mecca system was put on hold. The 
Committee decided only the Grosvenor objective had been achieved.
Using technology to 
improve efficiency and 
customer experience
Mecca services app Weighting: 5.6%
Achievement: 2.8%
The Mecca services app has been deployed but customer take-up  
has been lower than expected so the Committee decided to restrict 
achievement to 50%.
Grosvenor services app Weighting: 5.8%
Achievement: 1.9%
The Grosvenor services app has been deployed with less 
functionality than planned and customer take-up has been lower 
than expected, so the Committee decided to restrict achievement  
to one-third.
Other strategic imperatives Positive trending proposition from  
new-format bingo club
Weighting: 15.5%
Achievement: 3.5%
The new format was fully developed and ready to launch but delays 
in securing sites and planning resulted in the first site not opening 
until 7 August 2017. The Committee decided to award 3.5% to  
reflect the considerable progress made against the objective.
Total (max 100%) 38.2%
Non-financial performance accounted for 50% of the overall vesting, and therefore 19.1% of the award vests.
As well as the financial and non-financial/strategic targets outlined above, the Committee considered the Group’s average return on 
capital employed (ROCE) over the performance period. The Committee concluded that an average 18% return had been achieved 
which was in excess of the minimum 15% it had expected.
Therefore, based on the performance set out in the above table, 37.5% of the award will vest in three tranches – 45% in December 
2017, 30% in December 2018 and 25% in December 2019. The Committee believes the overall vesting outcome based on 
performance is a fair reflection of performance over the three-year performance period.

Other payments and obligations (Audited)
No executive directors left the Company during the year ended 30 June 2017 and therefore no payments for compensation for loss 
of office were paid to, or receivable by, any director (30 June 2016: £nil). With the exception of a payment to the widow of John 
Garrett, a former executive director who resigned on 2 February 1998, who received £46,722 (2015/16: £46,213) in respect of an 
unfunded pension obligation, no payments were made during the year ended 30 June 2017 to any past director of the Company.
External appointments (Unaudited)
Executive directors are not permitted to take up non-executive directorships outside the Group.
Share ownership guidelines and directors’ interests in shares (Audited)
Below we set out details of the share ownership guidelines that were in operation until June 2016. In light of the Company’s free 
float position (see page 86), these have been re-suspended until a higher free float position is achieved.
Similarly, the Group had guidelines for executive shareholding which was set as a percentage of base salary and which executives 
had five years from appointment to build up. These guidelines were as follows:
Chief executive 150%
Finance director 100%
Other executive committee members 50%
Shareholdings of directors of the Company and its subsidiaries are not considered to be in public hands for the purposes of 
determining the sufficiency of the percentage of shares in public hands (the ‘free float’) in the context of qualification for a listing 
on the UK Listing Authority’s premium market. In view of the low level of free float following the completion of Guoco Group 
Limited’s general offer for Rank in July 2011, the non-executive director quarterly share purchase programme and the shareholding 
guidelines for executive directors and other members of the executive committee who are directors of Rank subsidiary companies 
were suspended on 14 December 2011. The suspension was lifted on 2 March 2015 when free float was comfortably in excess of 
25% but was reactivated on 22 June 2016 pending a restoration of the Company’s free float to a higher level. For further 
information with regard to the Company’s free float position, please see page 86.
Subject to achieving a higher free float position, the Committee will review the above percentage guidelines in light of good 
practice in this area with a view to increasing the guideline to 200% of salary for inclusion in the next remuneration policy.
Directors’ shareholdings as at 30 June 2017 are set out in the table below:

Governance
82 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Dilution limits
The LTIP, being the Company’s only equity-based incentive plan, incorporates the current Investment Association guidelines  
on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a 10-year period in relation to  
the Company’s issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any 10-year period for executive plans.
The Committee regularly monitors the position and prior to the making of any award considers the effect of potential vesting of 
awards to ensure that the Company remains within these limits. Any awards which are required to be satisfied by market-purchased 
shares are excluded from the calculations. No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 30 June 2017.

Advisers to the committee (Unaudited)
The Committee has access to external information and research on market data and trends from independent consultants. During 
the first half of the year Willis Towers Watson were advisors to the Committee and, following a tender process, New Bridge Street 
(‘NBS’), part of Aon plc, were appointed as external remuneration advisors to the Committee. They have been sole advisors to the 
Committee since January 2017. NBS is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and complies with its Code  
of Conduct which sets out guidelines to ensure that its advice is independent and free of undue influence.
The chief executive, the company secretary, the finance director and the human resources director provided assistance to the 
Committee during the year. They attended meetings of the Committee, although none of them was involved in any decision 
relating to his or her own remuneration.
During the year, the Committee requested NBS to advise on all aspects of Rank’s remuneration policy and practice and to review its 
structures against corporate governance best practice. NBS also provided the TSR performance graph for the directors’ remuneration 
report. NBS was paid fees totalling £25,250 for services provided to the Committee during the year (fees are based on hours spent). 
NBS did not provide any other services to the Group during the period under review.
Committee evaluation (Unaudited)
The Committee’s performance during the period under review was assessed via confidential questionnaires with Committee 
members and other individuals who support its work. Results were then reviewed by the Committee chairman and discussed  
with the board. The board agreed that the Committee continued to perform effectively. Further details can be found on page 57.
Shareholder vote on 2015/16 directors’ remuneration report at 2016 annual general meeting (Unaudited)
The table below shows the voting outcome for the 2015/16 directors’ remuneration report at the 2016 annual general meeting, 
both including and excluding the Company’s majority shareholder:

Implementation of Policy in 2017/18 (Unaudited)
Salaries
Salaries will be reviewed, with any changes effective 1 April 2018.
Pension policy
There have been no changes to the Company’s pension policy during the year.
Non-executive director annual base and additional fees effective 1 April 2017 comprise:
Base non-executive annual fee £50,000
Audit committee chair £9,000
Remuneration committee chair £7,500
Senior independent director £2,500
The Company chairman’s fee was increased by 6.67% to £160,000, with effect from 1 April 2017. The Committee considered that 
an increase in the Company chairman’s fee was warranted to reflect the time commitment, the experience of the individual and 
the fact it had not been increased since 1 January 2007.
Annual bonus and long-term incentive
The bonus and long-term incentive provision will be in line with the new Policy which is expected to be put to a shareholder vote 
at a general meeting before the expiry of the current remuneration policy in April 2018. We will be consulting with shareholders in 
advance and we welcome shareholder feedback on issues related to executive remuneration.

Hong Leong Company (Malaysia) Berhad (‘Hong Leong’), the ultimate parent company of Guoco Group Limited (‘Guoco’),  
has a controlling interest in Rank consequent upon the general offer made by its Hong Kong listed subsidiary company, Guoco,  
via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Rank Assets Limited (then known as All Global Investments Limited), and which completed on  
15 July 2011. As at 30 June 2017 and as at the date of this report, Hong Leong’s interest is held as follows:
◊ 52.03% – Rank Assets Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Guoco;
◊ 4.05% – GuoLine Overseas Limited, Guoco’s immediate parent company; and

On 10 November 2014 Rank entered into an agreement with Hong Leong and Guoco (together the ‘Controlling Shareholder’) in

provisions included in the Relationship Agreement have been complied with during the period under review by the Controlling 
Shareholder and its associates. So far as Rank is aware, the procurement obligations included in the Relationship Agreement have 
been complied with during the period under review by the Controlling Shareholder.

Governance
86 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Rights and restrictions attaching to shares
Voting rights
Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at general 
meetings of the Company.
Meeting rights
Registered holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and 
speak at general meetings and to appoint proxies.
Information rights
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s 
annual report and financial statements.
Share transfer restrictions
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of shares 
contained in the Company’s articles of association.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between  
the holders of Rank shares that may result in restrictions  
on the transfer of shares or that may result in restrictions  
on voting rights.
Variation of rights
Subject to applicable legislation, the rights attached to Rank’s 
ordinary shares may be varied with the written consent of the 
holders of at least three-quarters in nominal value of those 
shares, or by a special resolution passed at a general meeting  
of the ordinary shareholders.
Directors’ powers in relation to shares
Allotment and issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the CA 2006, and subject to any 
resolution passed by the Company pursuant to the CA 2006 
and other shareholder rights, shares in Rank may be issued with 
such rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary 
resolution decide. If there is no such resolution or so far as the 
Company does not make specific provision, they may be issued 
as Rank’s board of directors may decide. Subject to the Company’s 
articles of association, the CA 2006 and other shareholder 
rights, unissued shares are at the disposal of the board.
The Company currently has no shareholder authority to  
allot and grant rights over any proportion of the Company’s 
unissued share capital, nor does it have shareholders’ authority 
to allot and grant rights over ordinary shares without first 
making a pro-rata offer to all existing ordinary shareholders. 
Neither of these authorities is required for the purpose of 
allotting shares pursuant to employee share schemes. Since  
the board has no present intention of allotting shares for any 
other reason, these shareholder authorities will not be sought  
at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Market purchases of own shares
The Company currently has no shareholder authority to make 
market purchases of its own shares. Shareholder approval will 
be sought at the 2017 annual general meeting to obtain the 
standard authority for one year.
Directors’ other powers
Subject to legislation, the directors may exercise all the powers 
permitted by the Company’s memorandum and articles of 
association. A copy of these can be obtained by writing to  
the company secretary, or from Companies House.
Articles of association
During the year, the Company reviewed its articles of 
association and at the forthcoming annual general meeting  
will be proposing changes, details of which are set out in the 
notice of annual general meeting.
The articles contain provisions to empower the directors in 
certain specific matters, including:
◊ appointment of directors, subject to subsequent  
shareholder approval;
◊ delegation of powers to a director, secretary or committee  
of one or more persons;
◊ the Company’s powers to borrow money; and
◊ the ability of a director to vote on matters in which he has  
an interest.
Changes to the Company’s articles of association can only be 
made by a resolution passed by a majority of no less than 75% 
of shareholders.
Change of control
Rank’s principal term loan and credit facility agreements 
contain provisions that, on a change of control of Rank, 
immediate repayment can be demanded of all advances  
and any accrued interest.
The provisions of the Company’s share schemes and incentive 
plans may cause options and awards granted to employees to 
vest in the event of a takeover.
A change of control may also affect licences to operate, as 
specified in the provisions of the Gambling Act 2005 and the 
Alderney eGambling Regulations 2009 (as amended) and the 
Belgian Games of Chance Act 1999 (as amended).
Political donations
No political donations were made during the period 
under review.
It has been Rank’s long-standing practice not to make cash 
payments to political parties and the board intends that this 
will remain the case. However, the CA 2006 is very broadly 
drafted and could catch activities such as funding seminars and 
other functions to which politicians are invited, supporting 
certain bodies involved in policy review and law reform and 
matching employees’ donations to certain charities. Accordingly, 
as in previous years, the directors will be seeking shareholders’ 
authority for political donations and political expenditure at 
the forthcoming annual general meeting in case any of Rank’s 
activities are inadvertently caught by the legislation.

www.rank.com | 87 Directors’ responsibilities
Annual report and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
(including the directors’ report, the strategic report, the 
directors’ remuneration report and the corporate governance 
statement) and the financial statements of the Group and the 
Company, in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare 
Group and Company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law, the directors are required to prepare 
Group financial statements under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 
As permitted by the Companies Act 2006, the directors have 
elected to prepare the Company financial statements under 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Under company  
law the directors must not approve the Group and Company 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group and Company financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
◊ present fairly the financial position, financial performance  
and cash flows of the Group and Company;
◊ select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;
◊ present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
◊ make judgements that are reasonable;
◊ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
Group and Company’s financial position and final 
performance; and
◊ state whether the financial statements have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements.
Accounting records
The directors must keep proper accounting records that  
disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial 
position of the Company and the Group and ensure that the 
Group financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, for the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
International Accounting Standard (IAS) Regulation.
Safeguarding assets
The directors are also accountable for safeguarding the assets  
of the Company and the Group and, therefore, for taking 
reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Corporate website
The maintenance and integrity of Rank’s corporate website, on 
which this annual report and financial statements are published, 
is the board’s responsibility. We would draw attention to  
the fact that legislation in the UK on the preparation and 
publication of financial statements may differ from that  
in other jurisdictions.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The annual report and financial statements are the 
responsibility of, and have been approved by, the directors.
Each of the directors named on pages 50 and 51 confirms that 
to the best of his/her knowledge:
◊ the annual report and financial statements, taken as a  
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide  
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy;
◊ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS  
as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
◊ the strategic report includes a review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole, together with a description of the risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Opinion
In our opinion:
◊ The Rank Group plc’s Group financial statements and parent 
company financial statements (the “financial statements”)  
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of  
the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the 
Group’s profit for the year then ended;
◊ the financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union  
and, in the case of the parent company financial statements,  
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006.; and
◊ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of

their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report below. We are independent  
of the Group and Company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard  
as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have  
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance  
with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
This report is made solely to the company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and 
viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
information in the annual report, in relation to which the 
ISAs(UK) require us to report to you whether we have anything 
material to add or draw attention to:
◊ the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 40-44 that 
describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
◊ the directors’ confirmation set out on page 40 in the annual 
report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the entity, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency  
or liquidity;
◊ the directors’ statement set out on page 41 in the financial 
statements about whether they considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
them, and their identification of any material uncertainties  
to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of  
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements
◊ whether the directors’ statement in relation to going concern 
required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
◊ the directors’ explanation set out on page 41 in the annual 
report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities  
as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
Financial statements
90 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Overview of our audit approach
Materiality ◊ Overall Group materiality of £3.9 million (2015/16: £3.8 million) which represents 5% of profit before tax adjusted for exceptional 
items. In our assessment profit before tax, adjusted for exceptional items, provides us with a consistent year on year basis for 
determining materiality and is the most relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the entity. 
Audit scope ◊ We performed an audit of the complete financial information of six (2015/16: six) components and audit procedures on specific 
balances for a further eight (2015/16: seven) components.
◊ The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 100% (2015/16: 98%) of profit before tax 
adjusted for exceptional items, 100% (2015/16: 100%) of Revenue and 100% (2015/16: 99%) of Total Assets.
Key audit 
matters
◊ Revenue recognition including the risk of management override.
◊ Impairment of tangible and intangible assets and adequacy of property lease provisions.
◊ Indirect tax risk exposures.
◊ Exceptional items including restructuring costs.
What has 
changed?
◊ In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to the migration of data to the new online gaming 
platform. As the migration was a non-recurring event that occurred in the prior year, this was not viewed as a key audit matter for  
the year ended 30 June 2017. In the current year we assessed that the risk relating to exceptional items including restructuring cost 
was heightened due to the additional costs that were included in exceptional items for the restructuring undertaken by the Group.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations 
communicated  
to the Audit 
Committee
Revenue recognition: £707.2 million 
(2015/16: £708.5 million)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page N/A);  
Accounting policies (page 104); and Note 2 of  
the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 110)
Our assessment is that the vast majority of revenue 
transactions, for both the venues and digital businesses, 
are non-complex, with no judgement applied over the 
amount recorded. We consider there is a potential for 
management override to achieve revenue targets via 
topside manual journal entries posted to revenue. 
Revenue could be inaccurately stated as a result.
Our procedures were designed to corroborate our assessment that 
revenue should be closely aligned to cash banked (for the Retail 
business), and to customer balances and cash (for the Digital business), 
and to identify the manual adjustments that are made to revenue for 
further testing.
We updated our understanding of the revenue processes and tested 
certain key financial and IT controls over the recognition and 
measurement of revenue.
We used our computer aided analytics tools to perform a correlation 
analysis to identify the extent to which revenue was linked to cash  
(for UK venues) and customer balances (for Digital), then investigated 
and obtained explanations for those items above a specified threshold 
where this was not the case.
Using data extracted from the accounting system, we tested the 
appropriateness of journal entries impacting revenue, as well as other 
adjustments made in the preparation of the financial statements. We 
identified and tested specific journals such as those manually posted 
directly to revenue, outside of expected hours, or by unexpected 
individuals and for large or unusual amounts.
We also verified the recognition and measurement of revenue by 
tracing a sample of transactions, selected at random, throughout  
the year to source data to verify the accuracy of reported revenue.
For venues, we attended and re-performed cash counts at a sample  
of nineteen casino and bingo venues, selected using a risk based 
approach and also included a random sample, at year end to  
verify the appropriate cut-off of revenue.
For Digital, we reconciled the year-end customer balances to the 
system report, which was tested for completeness and accuracy.
We concluded 
that revenue 
recognition,  
and adjustments 
to revenue, are 
appropriate.

Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations 
communicated  
to the Audit 
Committee
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets  
and adequacy of property lease provisions
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 62);  
Accounting policies (page 107); and Note 12 of  
the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 122)
At 30 June 2017 the carrying value of tangible and 
intangible assets was £599.4 million, £241.6 million of 
which relate to indefinite life intangible assets (primarily 
casino and other gaming licences) or goodwill.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, 
management disclosed that in addition to the 
impairment charge of £7.7 million and impairment 
reversal of £2.5 million, a reasonably possible change  
in customer visits, win margins or spend per head could 
lead to impairments in other Cash Generating Units 
(‘CGU’) where no impairment is currently recognised.
This is an area of focus due to the significance of the 
carrying value of the assets being assessed and due to 
the level of management judgement required in the 
assumptions impacting the impairment assessment. The 
main assumptions are the future results of the business 
including future cash flows, growth rates and earnings 
multiples applied to cash flows as well as discount rates.
In addition, the Group holds a provision for property 
leases of £24.6 million for unoccupied properties and 
properties which are trading at a loss. In determining 
the appropriate level of provision required, management 
judgement is required in assessing whether the costs 
provided represent the lower of the cost of fulfilling  
the contract and any compensation or penalties  
arising from failure to fulfil the contract.
In accordance with IAS 37, management recognised a 
credit to the income statement of £14.6 million relating 
to onerous property lease contracts exited during the 
period and a charge of £1.2 million for additional 
provisions. There is a high level of management 
judgement required in the assumptions impacting  
the assessment and the sensitivity of the model. This is 
primarily the amount of sub-let income and period for 
which sub-let income can be obtained where properties 
are vacant or the extent to which lease obligations are 
covered by earnings generated. We therefore consider 
there is a higher likelihood that a material misstatement 
could arise as there is a risk that these provisions may  
be incorrectly valued.
We updated our understanding of management’s annual impairment 
testing process.
We ensured that the methodology of the impairment exercise 
continues to be consistent with the requirements of IAS 36 – 
Impairment of Assets.
We assessed the forecasts underlying the impairment review and 
agreed to budgets approved by the Board, reviewing these against 
actual performance and historic accuracy of forecasting. We also 
performed sensitivity analysis on earnings multiples for all CGUs and 
growth rates applied to cash flows for certain CGUs to determine the 
parameters that should they arise, may give a different conclusion as 
to the carrying value of assets assessed.
We validated other key assumptions such as discount rates to 
supporting evidence and corroborated these to industry averages/
trends with the assistance of EY internal experts.
We compared the individual CGU projections to historic performance 
and observable external trends and corroborated the reasons for 
deviations to third party evidence as appropriate.
For property lease provisions we understood management’s process  
for identifying onerous leases and validated that the inputs to the 
calculations for onerous lease provisions were appropriate. This 
included assessing the recoverability of sub-let income and comparing 
forecast earnings to historic performance, to determine whether 
appropriate provision had been made. This also included an 
assessment of whether the appropriate discount rate had been  
applied by checking the discount rate to external market data.
We checked underlying calculations and agreed key inputs to  
third party evidence including lease agreements and invoices for  
rent and rates.
For property leases that were exited, we obtained lease exit agreements.
The net 
impairment 
charge of 
£5.5 million  
and onerous  
lease release of 
£14.7 million is 
appropriately 
recognised.  
We highlighted 
that a reasonably 
possible change  
in certain key 
assumptions 
underpinning  
the forecasts for 
certain CGUs 
could lead to 
additional 
impairment.  
We concluded 
that the property 
provisions 
recognised are 
appropriate.
Financial statements
92 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations 
communicated  
to the Audit 
Committee
Indirect taxation: £222.2 million contributed  
to indirect taxes (2015/16: £245.5 million)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 63);  
Accounting policies (page 108); and Note 21 of  
the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 136)
Indirect tax is a complex area in the betting and gaming 
industry. We focus on this to ensure that all changes to 
legislation and rates levied have been correctly applied.
Judgement is also applied in estimating amounts 
payable to regulatory authorities in certain jurisdictions. 
Due to the complexity of regulations and also the level 
of management judgement required in determining if 
an assessment could give rise to an additional liability, 
this gives rise to a risk over the completeness of  
amounts recorded related to indirect taxation. 
We updated our understanding of the process for preparing the partial 
exemption calculation, and assessed the controls that management 
has in place to prevent and detect errors in this calculation.
We employed tax specialists to assist the audit team in reviewing the 
technical support for indirect tax submissions and to perform a review 
for completeness of effected changes in indirect tax legislation to 
check they had been appropriately reflected.
We reviewed correspondence received from tax authorities during the 
period in order to assess the completeness of uncertain tax positions 
and to corroborate management’s position. We have involved our 
indirect taxation specialists in assessing the implications of matters 
subject to correspondence received from tax authorities.
We conclude  
that the positions 
taken by 
management  
are appropriate 
and accurately 
reflected in the 
financial results.
Exceptional items including restructuring costs,  
net credit of £1.0 million (2015/16: net credit of 
£12.9 million)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 62);  
Accounting policies (page 109); and Note 4 of  
the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 114)
The application of the Group’s accounting policy for 
exceptional items requires judgement by management 
and careful consideration needs to be given to the 
nature and magnitude of these items to ensure 
consistency in approach between periods. Due to the 
magnitude of these items and the level of judgement 
required, we consider there to be a potential for 
inappropriate classification of costs as exceptional items.
In the current year management have recognised  
net exceptional income of £1.0 million comprising of  
a net release of property provisions of £14.7 million, 
restructuring costs of £8.8 million, net impairment 
charge of £4.2 million and aborted acquisition costs  
of £0.7 million.
We agreed material exceptional items to supporting documentation. 
We also validated that the exceptional items are classified as such  
in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy and regulatory 
guidance.
We performed specific audit procedures to test the appropriateness  
of the costs recognised related to the restructuring, which included:
◊ Confirming that there is a detailed formal plan in place,  
represented by a business case that had gone through the 
appropriate approval process;
◊ Confirming that a valid expectation had been raised to affected 
employees, represented by a formal announcement;
◊ Corroborating management’s assumptions where the cost to the 
business is estimated at the year-end; and
◊ Testing a sample of employees selected at random to validate that 
the costs recognised are accurate.
We also performed an assessment of costs that had been included 
within the exceptional restructuring charge to validate that they were 
associated to the restructuring and therefore classified appropriately as 
an exceptional item.
Exceptional  
items have  
been disclosed  
in accordance 
with the Group’s 
accounting policy.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and 
performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, 
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial 
statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the 
nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £3.9 million 
(2015/16: £3.8 million), which is 5% (2015/16: 5%) of profit before 
tax adjusted for exceptional items. In our assessment profit before 
tax adjusted for exceptional items provides us with a consistent 
year on year basis for determining materiality and is the most 
relevant performance measure to the stakeholders of the entity.
Starting 
basis
Adjustments Materiality
◊ Profit before tax for the year ended 
30 June 2017 – £79.7 million
◊ Net release from onerous property leases

Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or 
balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the Group’s overall control environment,  
our judgement was that performance materiality was  
50% (2015/16: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely 
£2.0 million (2015/16: £1.9 million). We continue to set 
performance materiality at this percentage to take into account 
the inherently high risk nature of the industry in which the 
Group operates. We have also taken into consideration changes 
within the Group including restructuring and the impact this 
could have on the operations of the Group. Our objective in 
adopting this approach was to conclude that undetected audit 
differences in all accounts did not exceed our planning 
materiality level.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of  
obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement 
accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total 
performance materiality. The performance materiality set for 
each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the 
component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the 
risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year,  
the range of performance materiality allocated to components 
was £0.1 million to £1.1 million (2015/16: £0.1 million to 
£1.4 million).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are 
considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would  
report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess  
of £0.2 million (2015/16: £0.2 million), which is set at 5% of 
planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in 
light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming 
our opinion.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and 
our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit 
scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this 
enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the 
organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide 
controls, changes in the business environment and other  
factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing  
the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the  
Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate 
quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial 
statements, of the thirty one (2015/16: thirty two) reporting 
components of the Group, we selected fourteen (2015/16: 
thirteen) components covering entities within the United 
Kingdom, Alderney, Spain, Belgium and Gibraltar, which 
represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the fourteen (2015/16: thirteen) components selected, we 
performed an audit of the complete financial information of six 
(2015/16: six) components (“full scope components”) which 
were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the 
remaining eight (2015/16: seven) components (“specific scope 
components”), we performed audit procedures on specific 
accounts within that component that we considered had the 
potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts  
in the financial statements either because of the size of these 
accounts or their risk profile.
The reporting components where we performed full or  
specific audit procedures accounted for 100% (2015/16: 98%)  
of the Group’s Profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items, 
100% (2015/16: 100%) of the Group’s Revenue and 100% 
(2015/16: 99%) of the Group’s Total assets. For the current year, 
the full scope components contributed 62% (2015/16: 76%) of 
the Group’s Profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items, 
91% (2015/16: 92%) of the Group’s Revenue and 81% 
(2015/16: 84%) of the Group’s Total Assets. The specific  
scope components contributed 38% (2015/16: 22%) of the 
Group’s Profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items, 9% 
(2015/16: 8%) of the Group’s Revenue and 19% (2015/16: 15%) 
of the Group’s Total Assets. The audit scope of these components 
may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the 
component but will have contributed to the coverage of 
significant tested for the Group.
Of the remaining seventeen (2015/16: nineteen) components 
that together represent 0% of the Group’s Profit before tax 
adjusted for exceptional items, none are individually greater 
than 1% (2015/16: 1%) of the Group’s Profit before tax adjusted 
for exceptional items. For these components, we performed 
other procedures, including analytical review, testing of 
consolidation journals, intercompany eliminations and foreign 
currency translations to respond to any potential risks of 
material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
Financial statements
94 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Changes from the prior year
There are no significant changes in the scoping from the prior 
year. The coverage of profit before tax adjusted for exceptional 
items from our audit of full scope components has decreased 
from prior year as a result of increased profits reported by the 
component in Spain which is designated as a specific scope 
component. The key audit matters for the Group were subject 
to full audit procedures at each of the full and specific scope 
locations with significant revenue streams and balances.
Integrated team structure
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at 
each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement 
team, or by component auditors from other EY global network 
firms operating under our instruction. Of the six full scope 
components, audit procedures were performed on all six of 
these directly by the primary audit team. For the eight specific 
scope components, specific audit procedures were performed 
directly by the primary audit team for seven of these components. 
The final specific scope component is based in Spain where the 
work was performed by component auditors.
In relation to the specific scope component in Spain, the Senior 
Statutory Auditor was also involved in the risk assessment and 
determining which accounts were in scope and attended the 
audit closing meeting by conference call, made specific enquiries 
of local management and reviewed the summary audit findings 
reported by the local audit team.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in 
the annual report, including the five year review and shareholder 
information set out on pages 145-148, other than the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are 
responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in  
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If  
we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of the other information, we are required  
to report that fact.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by  
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of 
the audit:
◊ the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and 
those reports have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements;
◊ the information about internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about 
share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 
and 7.2.6 in the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules 
sourcebook made by the Financial Conduct Authority (the 
FCA Rules), is consistent with the financial statements and  
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements; and
◊ information about the company’s corporate governance code 
and practices and about its administrative, management and 
supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules

company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
◊ the parent company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
◊ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or
◊ we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit
◊ a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities 
statement set out on page 88, the directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view in accordance, and 
for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group and Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
Group or the Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Financial statements
96 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of  
the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users  
taken on the basis of these financial statements.
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify 
and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement 
due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate 
responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected 
fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary 
responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud  
rests with both those charged with governance of the  
entity and management.
Our approach was as follows
◊ We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 
frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined 
that the most significant are The UK Gambling Commission, 
Gambling Act 2005, Money Laundering regulations, The 
Alderney Gambling Control Commission and License 
Conditions & The Code of Practice 2008.
◊ We understood how The Rank Group Plc is complying  
with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, 
internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance 
procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated  
our enquiries through our review of board minutes, papers 
provided to the Audit and Risk Committees and 
correspondence received from regulatory bodies.
◊ We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial 
statements to material misstatement, including how fraud 
might occur by meeting with management within various 
parts of the business to understand where they considered 
there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered 
performance targets and their influence on efforts made by 
management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions 
of analysts. Where this risk was considered to be higher, we 
performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud 
risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and 
were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements were free from fraud or error.
◊ Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures 
to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. 
Our procedures included a review of board minutes to identify 
any noncompliance with laws and regulations, a review of  
the reporting to the Audit Committee on compliance with 
regulations, enquiries of the Director of Legal Services and 
enquiries of management.
◊ The Group operates in the gaming industry which is a highly 
regulated environment. As such the Senior Statutory Auditor 
reviewed the experience and expertise of the engagement team 
to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and 
capabilities, which included the use of an expert where 
appropriate.
◊ As the gaming industry is highly regulated, we have obtained 
an understanding of the regulations and the potential impact 
on the Group and in assessing the control environment  
we have considered the compliance of the Group to these 
regulations as part of our audit procedures, which included  
a review of correspondence received from the regulator.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of  
the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address
◊ Following the recommendation of the audit committee,  
we were appointed as auditors by the Audit Committee  
and signed an engagement letter on 31 July 2017. We were 
appointed by the company at the annual general meeting on 
22 April 2010 to audit the financial statements for the year 
ending 31 December 2010 and subsequent financial periods. 
The period of total uninterrupted engagement including 
previous renewals and reappointments is eight periods, 
covering the periods ending 31 December 2010 to 
30 June 2017.
◊ The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company  
and we remain independent of the Group and the Company 
in conducting the audit.
◊ The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to 
the audit committee.

102 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 1 General information and  
accounting policies
General information
The Rank Group Plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries 
(together ‘the Group’) operate gaming services in Great Britain 
(including the Channel Islands), Spain and Belgium.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on 
the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled 
in England and Wales under registration number 03140769. 
The address of its registered office is TOR, Saint-Cloud Way, 
Maidenhead, SL6 8BN.
Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
these consolidated and Company financial statements are set 
out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all 
periods presented.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated and Company financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention.
1.1.1 Statement of compliance
The consolidated and Company financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRIC Interpretations as adopted by the 
European Union, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS.
1.1.2 Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the 
consolidated and Company financial statements, the directors 
have considered the issues impacting the Group during the 
period as detailed in the strategic report on pages 1 to 48  
and have reviewed the Group’s projected compliance with its 
banking covenants detailed in the financial review on page 38. 
Based on the Group’s cash flow forecasts and operating budgets, 
the directors believe that the Group will generate sufficient cash 
to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements and comply 
with its banking covenants. Accordingly the adoption of the 
going concern basis remains appropriate.
1.1.3 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process  
of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The resulting 
accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
actual results. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement 
or complexity, where assumptions and estimates are significant 
to the consolidated financial statements, are set out below.
(a) Estimated impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment
Details of the Group’s accounting policy in relation to 
impairments and impairment reversals are disclosed in  
note 1.13.
The application of the policy requires the use of accounting 
estimates and judgements in determining the recoverable 
amount of cash-generating units to which the goodwill, 
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are 
associated. The recoverable amount is the higher of the  
fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Estimates  
of fair value less costs of disposal are performed internally  
by experienced senior management supported by knowledge  
of similar transactions and advice from external experts or,  
if applicable, offers received. Value in use is calculated using 
estimated cash flow projections from financial budgets, 
discounted by selecting an appropriate rate for each cash-
generating unit. Further details of the assumptions and 
estimates are disclosed in note 12.
The Company also tests annually the carrying value of its 
investments in subsidiaries. The application of this policy 
requires the use of estimates and judgements in determining 
the recoverable amount of the subsidiary undertakings. The 
recoverable amount is determined by applying an appropriate 
multiple to the earnings of the subsidiaries along with 
consideration of the underlying net assets.
(b) Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions, 
including jurisdictions of now discontinued operations. There 
are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate 
tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities 
for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether 
additional taxes will be due and when they are likely to be settled. 
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the 
amount recognised, such differences will impact the financial 
statements in the period such determination is made. Further 
details of income tax are disclosed in note 17.
(c) Provisions
Provisions are recognised in accordance with the policy 
disclosed in note 1.10. Management’s judgement is that  
the cost provided represents the lower of the cost of fulfilling 
the contract or the cost of exiting the contract. In calculating 
property lease provisions, estimates are made of the discounted 
cash flows associated with the property and its associated 
operations including sub-let income together with estimates  
of any dilapidation obligations. Estimates have also been made  
(1) in determining the amount and timing of disposal provisions, 
including legacy industrial disease and personal injury claims, 
(2) in determining the amount and likelihood of settlement of 
indirect tax provisions and (3) in determining remaining costs 
from the Group restructuring and relocation project. Further 
details of provisions made are disclosed in note 21.
(d) Contingent assets and liabilities
Management is required to apply judgement in assessing  
the probability of the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or 
more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
the Company. This judgement is supported by external advice 
and precedent case law where appropriate and is continually 
assessed to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected 
in the financial statements. Further details of contingent 
liabilities are disclosed in note 30. There were no contingent 
assets identified in the current year.
Notes to the financial statements
www.rank.com | 103 1 General information and  
accounting policies continued
(e) Recoverability of convertible loan
The Group has loaned £3.5m to its digital platform provider. 
The principal loan has the option to convert the loan into 
17.5% of the issued share capital of its digital platform provider 
at any time prior to June 2018. If there is no conversion option 
exercised, the loan note is repayable in full in January 2019. 
Management is required to apply judgement to assess 
recoverability of this loan. In determining recoverability 
management is required to estimate the fair value of the 
conversion rights and the likelihood of the digital platform 
provider having access to the required funds to settle the 
principal if it becomes due. Both estimates are dependent  
on limited publicly available information and judgement 
regarding the future success of a relatively new start-up 
business. Further details can be found in note 15.
1.1.4 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(a) Standards, amendments to and interpretations  
of existing standards adopted by the Group
The Group has not been materially impacted by the adoption of 
any standards. The Group has not early adopted any standard, 
amendment or interpretation that was issued but is not 
yet effective.
(b) Standards, amendments to and interpretations  
of existing standards that are not yet effective
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ represents a significant change, notably  
for lessees, in how leases are accounted for and reported. The 
standard will be effective for the Group for the period beginning 
1 July 2019, subject to EU endorsement, and will replace IAS 17 
‘Leases’. IFRS 16 will require all lessees to recognise a right of  
use asset and lease liability for all leases, except for leases with  
a lease term of 12 months or less or where the underlying  
asset is of low value.
The Group expects the standard to apply to the majority of its 
operating lease commitments and to have a material impact on 
the Group’s reported results and balance sheet. The recognition 
of right of use assets and lease liabilities will result in an increase 
in total assets and total liabilities reported. Within the income 
statement, the current rent expense will be replaced with a 
depreciation and interest expense. The standard will also impact 
a number of statutory reporting measures such as operating 
profit and cash generated from operations, as well as alternative 
performance measures used by the Group.
The full impact of IFRS 16 on the Group is currently being 
assessed, including the practical application of the principles  
of the standard to the Group’s leases, and it is therefore not  
yet possible to provide a reasonable estimate of its effect.  
The Group’s current operating lease commitments on an 
undiscounted basis under IAS 17 are disclosed in note 29.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers’ will be effective for our next 
financial reporting period. The Group does not anticipate a 
material impact on the results or net assets from these standards 
or any other standards that are in issue but not yet effective.
1.2 Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the parent and its subsidiaries as at 30 June 2017. 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights,  
to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
investee. Specifically the Group controls an investee if, and only 
if, the Group has a) power over the investee, b) exposure, or 
rights, to variable returns from the investee, and c) ability to use 
its power to affect those returns. The Group re-assesses whether 
or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate 
that there are changes to one or more of the three elements 
of control.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains  
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies as applied to subsidiaries have been 
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group.
The Group has no material associates or joint ventures.
1.3 Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date 
fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included 
in administrative expenses within exceptional items.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial 
assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification  
and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, 
economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the 
aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration 
transferred, over the fair value of the net identifiable amounts 
of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange 
for the business combination. Identifiable intangible assets are 
recognised separately from goodwill.
If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the 
consideration transferred is lower than the fair value of the 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities in the business 
acquired, the difference is recognised in profit and loss.
1.4 Revenue recognition
Revenue consists of the fair value of sales of goods and services 
net of VAT, rebates and discounts.
(a) Gaming win
Revenue for casinos includes the gaming win before deduction 
of gaming-related duties. Revenue for bingo is net of prizes 
before deduction of gaming-related duties. Revenue for digital 
products, including interactive games, represents gaming win 
before deduction of gaming-related duties. The fair value of free 
bets, promotions and customer bonuses (‘customer incentives’) 
are also deducted from all revenue streams.
Notes to the financial statements continued
Financial statements
104 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Although disclosed as revenue, gaming win (other than from 
poker and bingo) is accounted for and meets the definition of  
a gain under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’.
(b) Food and beverage
Revenue from food and beverage sales is recognised at the point 
of sale.
1.5 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible 
for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the management 
team (the composition of which is disclosed on page 50),  
which makes strategic and operational decisions.
In the current year, the reporting of operating segments has 
been modified following changes in management responsibilities 
and reporting to the chief operating decision-maker. As from 
1 December 2016, Grosvenor Casinos Digital and Mecca Digital 
were combined into a single operating segment which is now 
known as UK Digital. Enracha Venues and Enracha Digital were 
also combined into a single operating segment which is now 
known as Enracha.
The Group now reports five segments: Grosvenor Venues, 
Mecca Venues, UK Digital, Enracha and Central Costs.  
The prior year comparative information has been restated.
1.6 Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in UK 
sterling, which is also the Company’s functional currency. 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the  
primary economic environment in which the entity  
operates (‘the functional currency’).
(a) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation  
at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the  
income statement in finance costs or income.
(b) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group companies 
(none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary 
economy) that have a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated into the presentation 
currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented  
are translated at the closing rate on the balance sheet  
date. The closing euro rate against UK sterling was 1.14 
(30 June 2016: 1.21) and the closing US dollar rate  
against UK sterling was 1.30 (30 June 2016: 1.35);
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are 
translated at average exchange rates unless this average is 
not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of 
the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case 
income and expenses are translated at the rates prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions. The average euro rate 
against UK sterling was 1.16 (year ended 30 June 2016: 1.33) 
and the average US dollar rate against UK sterling in the 
year was 1.27 (year ended 30 June 2016: 1.47); and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as  
a separate component of equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences  
are recognised in the income statement, as part of the gain or 
loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities 
of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
1.7 Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified  
as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans  
and receivables, held to maturity investments, available for  
sale financial assets or as derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group 
determines the classification of its financial assets at 
initial recognition.
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive the 
cash flows from the asset have expired, been transferred or an 
obligation to pay the cash flows received to a third party 
without material delay has been assumed, and either:
◊ substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or
◊ substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been 
retained nor transferred, but control has been transferred.
The Group’s financial assets include loans and receivables and 
cash and cash equivalents.
(a) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, when the asset is 
expected to be realised in the normal operating cycle, otherwise 
they are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables 
are classified as other receivables in the balance sheet.
Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment.
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet include cash 
at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are 
shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the 
balance sheet.

accounting policies continued
1.8 Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
borrowings or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments 
in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the 
classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under 
the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, 
loans and borrowings (including bank overdrafts), and financial 
guarantee contracts.
(a) Trade and other payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
(b) Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition at fair value net of any directly 
attributable transaction costs, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost  
using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are 
derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate 
method amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral 
part of the effective interest rate method. The effective interest 
rate method amortisation is included in finance costs in the 
income statement.
(c) Financial guarantee contracts (Company only)
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those 
contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the 
holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to 
make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of  
a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are initially 
measured at fair value by applying the estimated probability  
of default to the cash outflow should default occur and 
subsequently amortising over the expected length of the 
guarantee, to the extent that the guarantee is not expected  
to be called.
1.9 Leases
Leases are tested at inception to determine whether the lease  
is a finance or operating lease and treated accordingly. Property 
leases comprising a lease of land and a lease of buildings within 
a single contract are split into their two component parts 
before testing.
(a) Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment which transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are 
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the  
fair value of the leased property, plant and equipment or the 
present value of minimum lease payments. Each lease payment 
is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to 
achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability for each period. The corresponding 
rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in loans 
and borrowings. Finance charges are recognised in the income 
statement. Property, plant and equipment acquired under 
finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful  
life of the asset or the lease term.
(b) Operating leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment which do not  
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  
to the Group are classified as operating leases. Operating lease 
payments (including any lease incentives or premiums) are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement on  
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1.10 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal  
or constructive obligation as a result of past events if it is more 
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditures 
required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value 
of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax 
rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a 
finance cost.
1.11 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of 
accumulated depreciation and impairment. Such cost includes 
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of  
the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are 
charged to the income statement during the financial period in 
which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on assets using the straight-line 
method to allocate their cost less residual values over their 
estimated useful lives, as follows:
◊ freehold and leasehold property 50 years or  
 lease term if less
◊ refurbishment of property 5 to 20 years or  
 lease term if lower
◊ fixtures, fittings, plant and machinery 3 to 20 years
Land is not depreciated.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from 
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of 
the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in 
the income statement.
Pre-opening costs are expensed to the income statement 
as incurred.
Notes to the financial statements continued
Financial statements
106 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 1.12 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over 
the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets 
of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill 
on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is allocated to 
the relevant cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating 
units for the purpose of impairment testing. A cash-generating 
unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates 
cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or groups of assets.
(b) Casino and other gaming licences and concessions
The Group capitalises acquired casino and other gaming 
licences and concessions. Management believes that licences, 
except for the casino concessions in Belgium, have indefinite 
lives as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which 
the licences are expected to generate net cash inflows, and each 
licence holds a value outside the property in which it resides. 
Each licence is reviewed annually for impairment.
In respect of the concessions in Belgium, the carrying value  
is amortised over the expected useful life of the concession.  
As at 30 June 2017 the licences have a remaining useful life  
of 3.5 years and 0.2 years respectively.
Any costs in renewing licences or concessions are expensed 
as incurred.
(c) Software and development
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the  
basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the 
specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives (three to five years).
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs 
are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly 
associated with the production and development of identifiable 
and unique software products controlled by the Group, and 
that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs 
beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets for both 
externally purchased and internally developed software. Direct 
costs include specific employee costs for software development.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are 
amortised over their estimated useful lives (three to five years).
(d) Property contracts
Property contracts arise on a fair value adjustment in respect of 
favourable property contracts on acquisitions. Such contracts 
are amortised over the lease term of the associated property.
1.13 Impairment of intangible assets and property,  
plant and equipment
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets 
that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable or where they indicate 
a previously recognised impairment may no longer be required.
An impairment loss is recognised as the amount by which an 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less 
costs of disposal and it’s value in use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels  
for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows (cash- 
generating units). The expected cash flows generated by the 
assets are discounted using appropriate discount rates that 
reflect the time value of money and the risks associated with 
the groups of assets.
If an impairment loss is recognised, the carrying amount  
of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense in the 
income statement immediately.
Any impairment is allocated equally across all assets in a 
cash-generating unit unless there is an indication that a class of 
assets should be impaired in the first instance or a fair market 
value exists for one or more assets. Once an asset has been 
written down to its fair value less costs of disposal then any 
remaining impairment is allocated equally amongst all 
other assets.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the  
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to 
the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating 
unit) in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income 
statement immediately.
1.14 Employee benefit costs
(a) Pension obligations
The Group operates a defined contribution plan under which the 
Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity. The Group 
has no further payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit 
expense when they are due.
The Group also has an unfunded pension commitment relating 
to three former executives of the Group. The amount recognised 
in the balance sheet in respect of the commitment is the present 
value of the obligation at the balance sheet date, together with 
adjustment for actuarial gains or losses. The Group recognises 
actuarial gains and losses immediately in the statement of  
other comprehensive income. The interest cost arising on  
the commitment is recognised in net finance costs.
(b) Share-based compensation
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees for 
awards is measured by reference to the fair value at the date  
on which they are granted. The fair value is determined by 
using an appropriate pricing model.
www.rank.com | 107 1 General information and  
accounting policies continued
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in 
which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled 
(the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement 
expense or credit for a period represents the movement in 
cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and  
end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional 
upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as 
vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/
or service conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as  
if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the 
award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-
based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as  
if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not  
yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This 
includes any award where non-vesting conditions within  
the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. 
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, 
and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is 
granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they 
were a modification of the original award, as described in  
the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled 
transaction awards are treated equally, regardless of whether  
the entity or the employee cancels the award.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as 
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings 
per share.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) 
and share premium when the options are exercised.
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured at fair value 
with the recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability  
is re-measured to fair value at each reporting date up to and 
including the settlement date.
(c) Share-based compensation – Company
The Company operates share-based payment schemes for 
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The fair value 
of shares awarded to employees of the Company are recognised 
as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The Company also makes awards of its own shares to employees 
of its subsidiaries and as such recognises an increase in the cost 
of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled 
share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiaries’ 
financial statements, with the corresponding credit being 
recognised directly in equity.
(d) Bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability in respect of the best estimate 
of bonuses payable where contractually obliged to do so or 
where a past practice has created a constructive obligation.
1.15 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost of inventory is determined on a ‘first-in, first-out’ basis.
The cost of finished goods comprises goods purchased for resale.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business. When necessary, a provision is made for 
obsolete and slow-moving inventories.
1.16 Taxation
(a) Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior 
periods are measured as the amount expected to be paid or  
to be recovered from the taxation authorities. The tax rates  
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that  
are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the reporting date.
Current tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is 
recognised in equity and not the income statement.
Management evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with 
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation at each reporting date and establishes 
provisions where appropriate.
(b) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial 
statements. However, if deferred tax arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a 
business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted 
for. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred 
tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Notes to the financial statements continued
Financial statements
108 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current taxation assets against 
current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these 
on a net basis.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising  
on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
(c) Sales tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount 
of sales tax except:
◊ where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services 
is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case 
the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of 
the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
◊ for receivables and payables that are stated with the amount  
of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to,  
the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or 
payables in the balance sheet.
1.17 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
1.18 Discontinued operations and held for sale assets
Operations of the Group are recognised as discontinued 
operations if the operations have been disposed of or meet  
the criteria to be classified as held for sale and represent a 
separate major line of business or geographic area of operations. 
Operations held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying 
amount on the date they are classified as held for sale and their 
fair value less costs of disposal.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held  
for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition 
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and  
the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in  
its present condition. Management must be committed to the  
sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
1.19 Dividends
Dividends proposed by the board of directors and unpaid at the 
period end are not recognised in the financial statements until 
they have been approved by shareholders at the annual general 
meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
1.20 Exceptional items
The Group separately discloses those items which are  
required to give a full understanding of the Group’s financial 
performance and aid comparability of the Group’s result 
between periods. Exceptional items are considered by the 
directors to require separate disclosure due to their size or 
nature in relation to the Group.

The Group reports segmental information on the basis by which the chief operating decision-maker utilises internal reporting 
within the business. In the current year the internal reporting of operating segments has been modified following changes in 
management responsibilities and reporting to the chief operating decision-maker. As from 1 December 2016 Grosvenor Casinos 
Digital and Mecca Digital were combined into a single operating segment which is now known as UK Digital. Enracha Venues and 
Enracha Digital were also combined into a single operating segment which is now known as Enracha. Further information about 
each segment is disclosed on pages 32-33 (Grosvenor Venues), 34 (Mecca Venues), 35 (UK Digital) and 36 (Enracha). Prior year 
comparatives have been updated to reflect the revised operating segments.
Assets and liabilities have not been segmented as this information is not provided to the chief operating decision-maker on a 
regular basis.
Capital expenditure comprises expenditure on property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets.

Venue impairment charges
The Group recognised impairment charges of £6.7m, of which £5.2m related to two venues within Grosvenor Casinos, £0.3m 
related to a venue within Mecca and £1.2m related to a venue within Enracha. Performance at these venues has not been in line 
with expectations and is not expected to significantly improve in the future.
Venue impairment reversals
The Group reversed previous impairment charges of £2.5m, £0.7m of which related to a venue within Grosvenor and £1.8m related 
to two venues within Enracha. This reflects a significant improvement in performance following the closure of a competitor and a 
sustained increase in performance attributed to improvements in the local economic environment within Spain.
Group restructuring including relocation costs
In the first six months of 2016/17 the Group carried out a detailed review of its entire UK organisational structure designed to 
improve customer service and simplify operations. This has resulted in changes to management and team structures at both venue 
and central levels, the decision to centralise support functions in a new office in Maidenhead and the merging of the separately  
run brand teams supporting digital into one operational team. The cost of this restructure is estimated to be £9.3m, with £8.8m 
recognised in the current financial year and the balance expected to be incurred in the first six months of 2017/18.
The costs incurred include £5.2m of redundancy costs, £2.2m of onerous lease costs, £0.6m of tangible asset impairment, £0.5m of 
loss on disposal of tangible assets and £0.3m of legal and professional fees.
Costs by segment were £1.8m Grosvenor Venues, £0.2m Mecca Venues, £2.0m UK Digital and £4.8m Central Costs.

114 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Net credit from property leases
The total net credit was £14.7m:
◊ £11.7m was recognised in Mecca. This includes £10.7m following the successful surrender of an onerous lease at a Mecca venue  
in exchange for a cash payment of £2.0m, £1.4m due to the renegotiation of lease terms at a venue, offset by a £0.4m charge from 
increasing the required provision at three venues;
◊ £1.1m was recognised in Grosvenor. This included a £1.0m credit due to advance negotiation to sub-let an onerous lease, £0.3m due 
to a final settlement agreed on a previously leased venue, offset by a £0.2m charge for a venue that required a full onerous lease; and
◊ £1.9m was recognised in Central Costs for multi-let venues. This included a credit of £1.5m due to the renegotiation of an onerous 
lease, £0.8m due to additional sub-let income from a tenant at one of the sites, offset by a £0.4m charge due to a reduction in 
variable rent expectation.
Aborted acquisition costs
Central Costs includes £0.7m of aborted acquisition cost.
Year ended 30 June 2016 exceptional items

Venue impairment charges
The Group recognised an impairment charge of £0.9m for a venue within Grosvenor Casinos. Performance at the venue has not 
been in line with expectations.
Venue impairment reversal
The Group reversed a previous impairment charge of £1.4m in Enracha. This reflects improved performance at a venue attributed to 
improvements in the commercial environment.
Net credit from property leases
The Group recognised a net release of £1.4m in relation to provisions for onerous property leases in the year. This includes a £0.7m 
and £1.0m gain, from successful onerous lease surrenders in Mecca and Grosvenor Casinos respectively, net of a charge from a 
reduction in the discount rate applied to existing provisions.
Further movements in the property leases provision are explained under ‘Closure of venues’ below.
Closure of venues
During the year the Group closed, or committed to close, seven venues of which four were within Mecca and three within 
Grosvenor Casinos. The charge in the period of £2.6m reflects additional costs of closure due to redundancy, dilapidation and 
onerous property lease costs at three clubs within Grosvenor Casinos (£0.8m), one club within Mecca (£1.5m) and one previously 
closed club within Enracha (£0.3m).
Disposal of freehold buildings
During the year Mecca sold two freehold buildings for a net profit, after associated disposal costs, of £10.0m.
Discontinued operations
Disposal of subsidiary
The Group disposed of Rank Insurance Limited for a net cost of £0.3m. The business provided insurance services to previously 
discontinued activities and represents an end of life legacy insurance company. Approximate annual operating costs from the 
business were £0.1m.
Taxation and finance costs
Income of £3.9m has been recognised in respect of discontinued operations in overseas jurisdictions. This comprises £4.4m of 
exceptional tax credit due to settlement of amounts previously paid across to an overseas tax authority, £0.3m of finance cost  
for an associated letter of credit and an additional £0.2m charge for a separate tax exposure in another jurisdiction.
The exceptional tax credit of £4.4m less £0.3m of associated finance cost in relation to the letter of credit has been disclosed 
separately on the cash flow as cash from discontinued operations.

Factors affecting future taxation
UK corporation tax is calculated at 19.75% (year ended 30 June 2016: 20.00%) of the estimated assessable profit for the period. 
Taxation for overseas operations is calculated at the local prevailing rates.
On 8 July 2015, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 19.0% for  
the year starting 1 April 2017 and a further 1.0% reduction to 18.0% from 1 April 2020. These changes were substantively enacted 
in October 2015.
On 16 March 2016, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a further 1.0% reduction to the previously announced 18.0% main 
rate of UK corporation tax to 17.0% from 1 April 2020. This change was substantively enacted in September 2016. The rate 
reductions will reduce the amount of cash tax payments to be made by the Group.
7 Results attributable to the parent company
The Company has elected to take the exemption under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present the parent company 
income statement. The loss for the year ended 30 June 2017 for the Company was £17.1m (year ended 30 June 2016: loss of £23.9m). 
The loss includes an impairment charge of £nil (year ended 30 June 2016 impairment charge of £5.1m) in respect of its investment 
in subsidiary undertakings. Further details are provided in note 13.

i) Goodwill
Digital goodwill
£53.4m of goodwill arose on the acquisition of Rank Digital Limited. During the year there was a change to segmental reporting  
to reflect the combination of the UK Digital operations. As a consequence of this, the UK Digital goodwill is now monitored and 
allocated to this segment as a whole.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on the Group’s 
budget for 2017/18, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2016: 2.0%) 
thereafter. Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board of directors.
The discount rate applied was 11% (30 June 2016: 12%). This is derived from the weighted average cost of capital and reflects the 
risks specific to this CGU.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are settled stakes, gaming win margins, gaming duty and the discount rate. 
Settled stakes represent monies placed by customers for interactive games and are estimated taking into account the product mix 
and industry developments. Gaming win margins are based on values achieved in the past and amended for any anticipated 
changes in the budget period. Gaming duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
As a result of the impairment testing, the directors do not believe that the carrying value of the goodwill was impaired as the  
value in use exceeded the carrying value of goodwill. The key factors which impact the calculation of the carrying value include:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Settled stakes, Gaming win margin
Poor or decreased marketing activity Settled stakes
Failure to respond to technological advances Settled stakes
Deterioration in economic conditions Settled stakes
Changes in regulation Settled stakes, Gaming win margin
Changes in duties Gaming duty
Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount significantly exceeds its carrying amount, by in 
excess of £200m, therefore no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would impact the carrying amount of Digital goodwill.
Casino goodwill
£80.9m of goodwill arose on the acquisition of 19 casinos from Gala Coral in May 2013. The goodwill arising on the acquisition is 
considered to benefit all acquired casinos and therefore is tested by combining the results of all of the acquired casino CGU’s.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections of the combined 
casinos from the Group’s budget for 2017/18, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% 
(30 June 2016: 2.0%) thereafter. Both the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board of directors.
The discount rate applied was 11% (30 June 2016: 10%). This is derived from the weighted average cost of capital and reflects the 
risks specific to this group of CGU’s.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty and 
the discount rate. Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to casinos and have been based on historic trends. 
Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money (net of winnings) spent per visit on gaming tables, machines and food and 
beverages. This has also been determined by historic trends. Casino duty is levied in bands of between 15% and 50% depending 
upon the level of gaming win at each casino. The bands and rates have been assumed to remain at current levels without 
indexation. Machine games duty is levied at rates of 5% or 20% depending upon certain criteria.

Financial statements
122 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its 
recoverable amount. These are:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit
Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in duties Casino duty, Machine games duty
Based on these key assumptions and resulting projections, the recoverable amount of the casinos exceeds its carrying amount  
by £10.0m (30 June 2016: £113.0m). Headroom is less than the previous years which is attributed to a temporary decrease in 
performance at a couple of significant clubs. A decrease of approximately 4% in either customer visits or spend per visit would be 
required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value. A rise in gaming-related taxes from the current blended rate of 
18% to 19% across the combined casinos would be required for the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value of the CGU. 
These calculations assume all other assumptions remain constant and therefore do not reflect any cost saving measures that may  
be identified should a key assumption be impacted to this magnitude.
ii) Casino licences
The carrying value of indefinite life casino licences as at 30 June 2017 was £231.9m (30 June 2016: £231.9m).
The casino licences are assessed for impairment by reference to the associated clubs’ (CGU’s) performance or through consideration 
of fair value less estimated costs to dispose.
The inherent value of a casino licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of the operation of a casino as a whole and 
licences are therefore not split out from each casino in an impairment review. Each casino has been treated as a separate CGU, and 
tested for impairment on that basis. The recoverable amount of each casino, including the licence, has been determined based on 
the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The value in use has been determined using cash flow projections, over 
the length of the associated lease or 50 years for freehold properties, based on the Group’s budget for 2017/18, the Group’s strategic 
plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2016: 2.0%) thereafter. Both the Group’s budget and strategic 
plan have been approved by the board of directors. Estimates of the fair value less costs of disposal are performed internally by 
experienced senior management supported by knowledge of similar transactions or, where applicable, offers received.
The discount rate applied was 11% (30 June 2016: 10%). This is derived from the weighted average cost of capital and reflects the 
risks specific to this group of CGU’s.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, casino duty, machine games duty and 
the discount rate. Customer visits are the number of discrete visits by customers to the casino and have been based on historic 
trends. Spend per visit comprises the average amount of money (net of winnings) spent per visit on gaming tables, machines  
and food and beverages. This has also been determined by historic trends. Casino duty is levied in bands of between 15% and  
50% depending upon the level of gaming win at each casino. The bands and rates have been assumed to remain at current  
levels without indexation. Machine games duty is levied at rates of 5% or 20% depending upon certain criteria.
The table below outlines the possible changes in key assumptions that could cause the carrying value of individual licences to 
exceed their recoverable amount. These are:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit
Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in duties Casino duty, Machine games duty
For UK casino licences, the directors do not believe that, with the exception of a prolonged non-operation of a UK casino licence, 
there are any reasonably foreseeable changes to the key assumptions that would result in a material impairment.
No impairment charges were made during the year against indefinite life casino licences (year ended 30 June 2016: £nil).
The casino concessions in Belgium are being amortised over their expected useful life. At 30 June 2017, the concessions had a 
carrying value of £2.9m (30 June 2016: £3.9m). The casino concessions have also been treated as a separate CGU for impairment 
testing purposes.
www.rank.com | 123 12 Impairment review continued
iii) Spanish bingo licences
The carrying value of Spanish bingo licences as at 30 June 2017 was £9.7m (30 June 2016: £7.4m).
The inherent value of each Spanish bingo licence is deemed to be an intrinsic part of the value of a club as a whole and is  
not therefore split out from the assets of each individual bingo club in an impairment review. Each individual bingo club has  
been treated as a separate CGU, and tested for impairment on that basis. The recoverable amount of each Spanish bingo club, 
including the licence, has been determined based on the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The value in  
use calculation has been determined using cash flow projections, over the length of the associated lease or 50 years in the case of 
freehold properties, based on the Group’s budget for 2017/18, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years and a growth 
rate of 2.0% (30 June 2016: 2.0%), thereafter.
The discount rate applied was 12% (30 June 2016: 12%). This is derived from the weighted average cost of capital and reflects the 
risks specific to this group of CGU’s.
The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use are customer visits, spend per visit, bingo duty and the discount rate. 
Customer visits are the number of discrete visits to the bingo club and have been based on recent trends. Spend per visit comprises 
the average amount of money (net of winnings) spent by a member on bingo games, machines and food and beverages. This has 
been determined by recent trends. Bingo duty is based upon statutory rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
However, there are possible changes in the key assumptions that could cause further impairments. These are:
Key factors Key assumption impacted
Increased or improved competition Customer visits
Poor or decreased marketing activity Customer visits
Failure to respond to technological advances Customer visits, Spend per visit
Deterioration in economic conditions Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in regulation Customer visits, Spend per visit
Changes in duties Bingo duty
As outlined above, each Spanish bingo licence has been tested for impairment by reference to the associated trading at each club. 
Accordingly, the sensitivity of each licence to future impairments, arising from changes in the key assumptions, varies from club  
to club. During the period £1.8m (30 June 2017: £1.4m) of impairment reversal was recognised on two licences. This represented  
a full impairment reversal at these clubs due to a sustained improvement in performance attributed to improvements in the local 
economy. No further reversals are expected as a significant change in budgeted performance would be required.
b) Impairment review of property, plant and equipment and definite life intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are grouped into CGUs which are defined as individual venues for Mecca, 
Enracha and Grosvenor Casinos and as the UK Digital business. Each CGU is assessed for indicators of impairment. An assessment 
is performed where there is an indicator of impairment and or reversal.
During the period the following indicators of impairment were identified:
◊ a sustained period of club underperformance;
◊ significant idle assets from Group restructuring and relocation; and
◊ a decline in the value attributed to the local economic environment.
During the period the following indicators of reversal were identified:
◊ a sustained period of club over performance;
◊ an increase in the value attributed to the local economic environment; and
◊ closure of a local competitor.

The key assumptions and sensitivities in the impairment reviews are the same as outlined above for intangible assets.
The recoverable amount of each CGU, including the licence if applicable, has been determined based on the higher of fair value 
less costs of disposal and value in use. The value in use has been determined using cash flow projections from the Group’s budget 
for 2017/18, the Group’s strategic plan for the following two years and a growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2016: 2.0%) thereafter. Both 
the Group’s budget and strategic plan have been approved by the board of directors. Estimates of the fair value less costs of disposal 
are performed internally by an experienced surveyor supported by external estate agent advice or, where applicable, offers received. 
For a limited number of CGU’s any failure to achieve the anticipated growth in future performance could result in further 
impairment charges being made.

The directors consider that the carrying value of other receivables and convertible loan notes approximate to their fair value.
As at 30 June 2017, other receivables of £0.2m (30 June 2016: £nil) were past due but not impaired.
The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables have been included in other operating costs in the income 
statement. Amounts charged to the provision for impairment are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering 
additional cash.
The other classes within receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable mentioned above. The Group 
does not hold any collateral as security.
The Group’s convertible loan note is due from its digital platform provider and at 30 June 2017, £3.5m has been loaned under the 
agreement with £0.2m of interest also outstanding. The Group has the option to convert the loan note into 17.5% of the issued 
share capital of its digital platform provider at any time prior to June 2018. If conversion does not take place, then the loan note  
is repayable in full in January 2019.
The digital platform provider is currently loss making and is reliant on continued funding from a related company and its 
shareholders. However, the Group considers that the market value of the convertible option, as evidenced by third party offers for 
all or part of the company, at least equates to the current loan value. The convertible option provides a mechanism whereby the 
Group can recover its loan through exercising the option and then selling the shares. The Group therefore believes no impairment 
of the loan principal and interest is required at this time. As the business is a private enterprise and a relatively new start up, 
attributing fair value to the convertible option requires significant judgement. The Group has concluded that, based on the limited 
available information, the loan note will be recoverable through conversion but there is no certainty of any incremental value 
attaching to the option at this time.

amounts, largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments;
◊ the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is based on price quotations at the reporting date;
◊ the fair value of floating rate borrowings and obligations under finance leases approximates to their carrying amounts; and
◊ the fair value of onerous property leases to approximate their carrying amount as they are discounted at current rates.

Financial statements
130 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 19 Financial risk management objectives and policies
Financial risk factors
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these 
financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that 
derive directly from its operations.
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks. The finance committee is supported by the Group’s 
senior management, which advises on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group.  
The finance committee provides assurance that the Group’s financial risk-taking activities are governed by appropriate policies  
and procedures and the financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with Group policies and risk appetite.
The board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
(a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings and deposits.
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the positions at 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016.
The sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating rates of the debt 
and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
(i) Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes  
in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Group’s functional currency) and 
the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Group policy is not to hedge foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of a possible change in the US dollar and euro, with all other variables held 
constant, to the Group’s profit before tax and the Group’s equity. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other 
currencies is not material.

www.rank.com | 131 19 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
(ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term 
debt obligations with floating interest rates.
Historically the Group had managed its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and 
borrowings. Due to the current economic climate the Group has exercised its right to operate outside the Group policy of 
maintaining between 40% and 60% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest. At 30 June 2017, 21% of the Group’s borrowings 
were at a fixed rate of interest (30 June 2016: 19%).
(iii) Interest rate sensitivity
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this 
movement is applied to the carrying value of loans, borrowings, cash and short-term deposits.
Effect on profit before tax

As at  
30 June 2016

Sterling:
100 basis point increase (0.4) (0.6)
200 basis point increase (0.8) (1.2)
There was no impact on equity in either year as a consequence of loan arrangements.
Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material impact on income and equity for the year. As such, 
sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates has not been presented.
The Group did not enter into any fixed-to-floating or floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps in either year.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading  
to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for other receivables) and from its 
financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other 
financial instruments.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department in accordance with 
the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to 
each counterparty. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the finance director, and may be updated throughout the year subject 
to the approval of the Group’s finance committee. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate 
financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
The credit worthiness of each counterparty is checked against independent credit ratings on at least a weekly basis, with a 
minimum rating of ‘BB’ required. The Group predominantly invests with its lending banks when appropriate.
Sales to retail customers are settled in cash or using major credit and debit cards and therefore the exposure to credit risk is not 
considered significant.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any material losses from  
non-performance of its counterparties.
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities. Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity 
requirements of the Group are produced three times a year. The cash forecasts are sensitivity tested for different scenarios and are 
reviewed regularly. Forecast financial headroom and debt covenant compliance is reviewed monthly during the month-end process 
to ensure sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12 month period.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping 
committed credit lines available. A three-year strategic forecast is prepared annually to facilitate planning for future financing 
needs. Management actively manages the Group’s financing requirements and the range of maturities on its debt.
The Group’s core debt facilities are the £90.0m (30 June 2016: £90.0m) bank facility comprising three bi-lateral bank facilities 
which expire in September 2020, and the £70.0m (30 June 2016: £80.0m) bank facility comprising three bi-lateral bank facilities 
which expire in April 2019. The Group proactively manages its relationships with its lending group.
The funding policy of the Group is to maintain, as far as practicable, a broad portfolio of debt diversified by source and maturity, 
and to maintain committed facilities sufficient to cover seasonal peak anticipated borrowing requirements.

Capital management
As a result of the difficult conditions that developed in the global capital markets in recent years, the Group’s objectives when 
managing capital have been to ensure continuing access to existing debt facilities and to manage the borrowing cost of those 
facilities in order to minimise the Group’s interest charge.
Consistent with others in the gaming industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of leverage ratio. The ratio is calculated as 
net debt divided by EBITDA. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including loans and borrowings as shown in the consolidated 
balance sheet) less cash and short-term deposits, accrued interest and unamortised facility fees. EBITDA is calculated as operating 
profit before exceptional items, depreciation and amortisation from continuing operations.
The leverage ratios at 30 June 2017 and 30 June 2016 were as follows:
As at  
30 June 2017  
£m
As at  
30 June 2016

Operating profit before exceptionals 83.5 82.4
Add: Depreciation and amortisation 45.3 45.8

Taking into consideration both the Group’s capital investment requirements and the stability of the wider economic environment, 
the Group considers its progressive dividend policy to be appropriate.
Collateral
The Group did not pledge or hold any collateral at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: £nil).
Company
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of its Cash and short-term deposits of £0.4m

Provisions have been made based on management’s best estimate of the future cash flows, taking into account the risks associated 
with each obligation.
Property lease provisions
The Group is party to a number of leasehold property contracts. Provision has been made against those leases where the property  
or part of the property is now vacant and the unavoidable costs under the lease exceed the economic benefit expected to be derived 
from potential sub-letting arrangements. Provision has also been made against leases where impairment testing has indicated that, 
after recognising an impairment charge, the estimated discounted cash flows derived from the property and its associated operations 
are insufficient to cover the unavoidable lease costs and the lease is therefore deemed onerous. These leases have a weighted average 
unexpired life of 11 years (30 June 2016: 22 years). Of the provision totalling £24.6m, it is estimated £15.2m will be utilised over 
periods ranging from one to five years, £2.7m will be utilised over periods ranging from five to 10 years; and the remaining £6.7m  
will be utilised over periods in excess of 10 years.
Disposal provisions
Provision has been made for legacy industrial disease and personal injury claims, deferred payments arising from the settlement  
of property lease obligations and other directly attributable costs arising as a consequence of the sale or closure of the businesses. 
The timing of any personal injury claims is uncertain and therefore these claims have been included in the maturity analysis based 
on management’s best estimates. The disposal provisions held comprise the following:

Restructuring provisions
Provision has been made for exceptional restructuring and relocation costs. The balance includes £2.4m of redundancy costs and 
£1.3m of onerous property costs. Further details can be found in note 4.
Indirect tax provision
The indirect tax provision relates to the Group’s VAT claim on amusement machines. The balance of £1.2m represents the 
directors’ best estimate of the outflow likely to arise.

The LTIP awards vest in three tranches; 45% in December 2017, 30% in December 2018 and 25% in December 2019. All LTIP 
awards have £nil exercise price.
The fair value of the LTIP awards granted in the prior year was based on the market value of the share award at grant date less the 
expected value of dividends forgone.
To the extent that grants are subject to non-market based performance conditions, the expense recognised is based on expectations 
of these conditions being met, which are reassessed at each balance sheet date. The current scheme’s non-market performance 
conditions are subject to results as at 30 June 2017 as well as future service. Based on the performance conditions assessed at 
30 June 2017, 1.6m of the 4.1m outstanding shares at year end is expected to vest provided the employees meet the service 
requirements. The directors’ remuneration report provides further details on the vesting conditions.
The Group recognised a £0.8m credit (year ended 30 June 2016: £1.9m charge) in operating profit from accounting for share-based 
payments and related national insurance in accordance with IFRS 2.
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of some share-based payments. These contributions are payable on the date 
of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based payments, and as such are treated as cash-settled awards. Of the credit in 
the year, £0.1m (30 June 2016: £0.2m charge) is in respect of such cash-settled awards. The Group has recorded liabilities at 
30 June 2017 of £0.3m (30 June 2016: £0.4m).

Defined contribution scheme
The Group operates the Rank Group Stakeholder Pension Plan (‘the Plan’) which is externally funded and the Plan’s assets

30 June 2016: £4.3m) to the Plan. There were no significant contributions outstanding at the balance sheet date in either year.
Other pension commitment
The Group has an unfunded pension commitment relating to three former executives of the Group. At 30 June 2017, the Group’s 
commitment was £4.2m (30 June 2016: £3.7m). The Group paid £0.2m (year ended 30 June 2016: £0.2m) in pension payments 
during the year. The actuarial loss arising on the commitment, resulting from the changes in assumptions outlined below in the 
year, was £0.7m (year ended 30 June 2016: £0.1m) before taxation and £0.6m after taxation (year ended 30 June 2016: £0.1m).

Group
Property leases
Concurrent to the £211.0m sale and leaseback in 2006, the Group transferred the rights and obligations but not the legal titles of 
44 property leases to a third party. The Group remains potentially liable in the event of default by the third party. Should default 
occur then the Group would have recourse to two guarantors. It is understood that, of the original 44 leases transferred, eight of 
these have not expired or been surrendered. These eight leases have durations of between 21 months and 96 years and a current 
annual rental obligation (net of sub-let income) of approximately £0.8m.
During 2014, the Group became aware of certain information in respect of a change in the financial position of the third party and 
one of the guarantors. However, the Group has not to date been notified of any default, or intention to default, in respect of the 
transferred leases.
Stamp duty
In the prior year, the Group disclosed that it had received from HMRC a determination in respect of the amount of stamp duty 
payable on certain transactions undertaken by Gala Casino 1 Limited (now Grosvenor Casinos (GC) Limited) before its acquisition 
by the Group on 12 May 2013 from Gala Coral. The Group estimated the maximum additional stamp duty that could be due,  
if HMRC were successful and Gala Coral were to default on terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, to be £7.2m plus interest. 
During the period Gala Coral have made a payment on account to HMRC in respect of the determination and the Group has 
assigned the right to any potential refund back to Gala Coral. As payment has been made by Gala Coral, there is no longer a

Registrar
All administrative enquiries relating to shares should, in  
the first instance, be directed to the Company’s registrar 
(quoting reference number 1235) and clearly state the registered 
shareholder’s name and address. Please write to The Rank 
Group Plc Registrar, Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer 
Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA (Tel: from the UK 0371 
384 2098 and from outside the UK +44 121 415 7047).
There is a text phone available on 0371 384 2255 for 
shareholders with hearing difficulties.
Shareview
The Shareview portfolio service from the Company’s registrar 
gives shareholders more control of their Rank shares and other 
investments including:
◊ direct access to data held for them on the share register 
including recent share movements and dividend details;
◊ a recent valuation of their portfolio; and
◊ a range of information and practical help for shareholders 
including how they can elect to receive communications 
electronically.
It is easy and free to set up a portfolio – shareholders will just 
need the shareholder reference printed on their proxy form or 
dividend stationery. Please visit the following website for more 
details: www.shareview.co.uk.
Payment of dividends
The Company is no longer operating a dividend re-investment 
plan. Shareholders may find it more convenient to make 
arrangements to have dividends paid directly to their bank 
account. The advantages of this are that the dividend is credited 
to a shareholder’s bank account on the payment date, there is 
no need to present cheques for payment and there is no risk  
of cheques being lost in the post.
To set up a dividend mandate or to change an existing mandate 
please contact Equiniti Limited, our registrar, whose contact 
details are above. Alternatively, shareholders who use Equiniti’s 
Shareview can log on to www.shareview.co.uk and follow the 
online instructions.
Shareholder information
A wide range of information for shareholders and investors  
is available in the Investors area of the Rank Group website: 
www.rank.com.
Frequently asked questions
We have a shareholder ‘frequently asked questions’ section on 
our website which provides answers to many questions that 
shareholders have: www.rank.com/en/investors/shareholder-
centre/faqs.html.
Capital gains tax
For the purpose of calculating UK capital gains tax on a disposal 
of ordinary shares in the Company held since 31 March 1982 
(including shares held in the predecessor company, The Rank 
Organisation Plc), the price of the Company’s ordinary shares at 
that date was 190 pence per share. This price should be adjusted 
for the effects of the rights issue in January 1990, the enhanced 
share alternative in July 1993, the sub-division and consolidation 
of shares in March 1994, the enhanced scrip dividend in March 
1998, and the 18 for 25 sub-division and share consolidation 
(aligned with the 65 pence special dividend payment) which 
took place in March 2007. More information regarding these 
adjustments is available on the www.rank.com website.
Shareholder security
We are aware that some of our shareholders have received 
unsolicited telephone calls concerning their Rank shares. These 
communications tend to be from overseas-based ‘brokers’ who 
offer a premium price for your Rank shares but ask you to make 
an upfront payment, typically in the form of an insurance 
bond. We recommend that before paying any money you:
◊ obtain the name of the person and firm contacting you;
◊ check the FCA register at www.fca.org.uk/register/to ensure 
they are authorised;
◊ use the details on the FCA register to contact the firm;
◊ call the FCA consumer helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there are 
no contact details on the FCA register or you are told they are 
out of date; and
◊ search the FCA’s list of unauthorised firms and individuals  
to avoid doing business with: www.fca.org.uk/consumers/
unauthorised-firms-individuals.
If you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares or  
other investments, you will not have access to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.
Below please find the link to the FCA’s website which gives 
information on scams and swindles which shareholders may 
find helpful: www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams.

Action Fraud’s helpline is 0300 123 2040.
Other information
146 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 We recommend that you report any attempted share frauds to 
the authorities since providing information with regard to how 
the fraudsters have contacted and dealt with you will assist the 
authorities in understanding the fraudsters’ way of operating so 
as to enable them to disrupt and prevent these activities and 
prosecute them.

which may make it uneconomical to sell, may wish to consider 
donating them to charity through ShareGift, a registered charity
