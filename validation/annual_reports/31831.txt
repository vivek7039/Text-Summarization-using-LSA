Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement  
Peter Hill, CBE
Strong results created through 
excellence in ventilation. 
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present our Annual Report and Accounts for the 
year ended 31 July 2017, a year in which we have continued to 
make strong progress in building a more valuable Volution Group. 
This was despite the vote for the UK to leave the European Union 
and the resulting devaluation of Sterling against both the US Dollar 
and the Euro. While we expect some uncertainty ahead as the 
UK negotiates the terms of Brexit, we remain confident in the 
long‑ term prospects for the Group based on our clear strategy 
of building our brand portfolio while diversifying in markets and 
geographies. Our businesses performed well with excellent trading 
performance during the year with 19.8% growth in revenue, an 
increase in adjusted operating profit of 9.6% to £35.6 million and 
strong cash generation, making this the sixth consecutive year 
the business has recorded revenue and underlying operating 
profit growth.
During the year the Group made further progress with its strategy 
of making selective value‑ adding and strategically important 
acquisitions in our ventilation segment, acquiring Breathing 
Buildings in the UK and VoltAir System in Sweden. This strategic 
pillar, acquiring selective value‑ adding acquisitions, together with 
organic growth, has supported the achievement of another year 
of strong performance and growth. You can find further details 
on the Group’s three strategic pillars on pages 18 to 19.
Summary
 > A further set of strong results in line with 
our expectations 
 > Completed two value‑ adding acquisitions, 
enhancing our strategic positioning
 > Strong cash generation which supports our 
continuing strategy to grow through acquisition
 > Full year dividend increased by 9.2% 
 > Product innovation receiving industry accolades 
and underpinning our growth 
It was a historic year in which Vent‑ Axia, 
the UK’s leading ventilation company, 
celebrated 80 years of innovation since 
the brand was founded by Joe Akester in 
1936. Since then Volution has gone from 
strength to strength, by building on the 
heritage of our brands.
Peter Hill, CBE
Chairman Strategic Report
Volution Group plc
Annual Report 2017 07
Performance and results
Another strong set of results reflects the growth achieved, both 
organically and through acquisitions, with the Group’s revenue 
increasing by 19.8% to £185.1 million. Adjusted operating profit 
was £35.6 million, representing 19.3% of revenue and a £3.1 million 
improvement compared to the prior year. Reported profit before 
tax declined by 2.5% to £17.9 million (2016: £18.4 million), driven 
by the increased amortisation of acquired intangible assets and 
the movement in the fair value of financial instruments.
The basic and diluted earnings per share for the year was 
7.0 pence (2016: 7.8 pence). Our adjusted earnings per share 
was 13.6 pence, representing a 7.9% increase over the adjusted 
earnings per share for the prior year (2016: 12.6 pence). 
Revenue from the ventilation segment grew by 21.6% (16.3% 
at constant currency) to £163.1 million. Strong organic growth 
in the Nordics and the UK Residential New Build sector was 
partly offset by the continued challenging performance in the 
UK Residential Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (RMI) 
sector. Revenue from the OEM (Torin‑ Sifan) segment grew by 
7.7% (2.8% at constant currency) to £22.0 million. The Group’s 
inorganic revenue growth of 12.5% benefited from the full year 
effect of the prior year acquisitions and the acquisitions of 
Breathing Buildings in the UK and VoltAir System in Sweden 
during the year. 
Cash generation was strong with adjusted operating cash flow 
of £35.9 million (2016: £31.1 million). Net debt at the year end 
of £37.0 million (2016: £36.1 million) was only £0.9 million higher 
than last year, despite having completed two acquisitions 
incurring a net cash outflow of £18.1 million.
Acquisitions
The acquisition of Breathing Buildings widens Volution’s capability 
with a market leader in natural and hybrid ventilation for commercial 
buildings, in particular focusing on new construction in the UK 
education sector. VoltAir System is a strong player in the residential 
and commercial new build ventilation markets in Sweden in the 
growing market for energy‑ efficient air handling units.
Both acquisitions were funded from the Group’s existing cash 
and banking facilities. As a Board, we evaluate each acquisition 
opportunity very carefully to ensure that it meets our strategic 
objectives as well as the financial hurdles set for investment. More 
details can be found in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review and 
in the Financial Review. We very much welcome the employees 
of all these companies to the Volution Group.
Dividends
We aim to deliver shareholder value through organic and inorganic 
growth and a sustainable dividend policy. We paid an interim 
dividend of 1.35 pence per share in May 2017. On the basis of 
our strong results, the Board has recommended a final dividend 
of 2.80 pence per share, giving a total dividend for the financial 
year of 4.15 pence per share (2016: 3.80 pence per share), an 
increase of 9.2% on the previous year. As a consequence of this 
recommendation, the resulting adjusted earnings dividend cover 
for the year is 3.3x (2016: 3.3x). Subject to approval by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting on 13 December 2017, the final 
dividend will be paid on 18 December 2017 to shareholders on 
the register at 24 November 2017.
Innovation
It was a historic year in which our subsidiary Vent‑ Axia, the UK’s 
leading ventilation company, celebrated 80 years of innovation 
since the brand was founded by Joe Akester in 1936 when he 
invented the world’ s first electrically operated window fan. Vent‑ Axia 
has been a leading British manufacturer ever since and the brand 
has become a household name featuring annually in the UK 
Superbrands league table and holding the prestigious Royal Warrant. 
This ethos of innovation has continued and we were delighted 
when Vent‑ Axia celebrated winning three separate awards during 
the year, two for the Kinetic Advance mechanical ventilation with 
heat recovery unit and one for the Revive fan. More information 
on these awards can be found in the Chief Executive Officer’ s Review 
on pages 9 to 11. This spirit of innovation and continuous 
improvement is applied across our brand portfolio.
During the year we commenced a project to rationalise part of 
our UK manufacturing footprint into one location. The facilities in 
Reading and Slough are being relocated to a newly built facility at 
Suttons Business Park in Reading, with the move to be complete 
by the middle of 2018. This new facility is state of the art and is 
aligned with our ethos of innovation and “Excellence in Ventilation”. 
UK leaving the European Union
Since the UK’s vote to leave the European Union, the Group 
has continued to monitor business performance closely. Although 
it is still too early to assess the implications for our business and 
operations over the longer term, we do not believe that there will be 
any material near‑ term impact on demand for our products. However, 
the weakness of Sterling against foreign currencies has persisted 
and has led to increasing cost pressures in the UK, primarily from the 
direct import of components whose costs are tied to the US Dollar. 
Our exposure to US Dollar‑ denominated purchases from Asia is 
substantially hedged for the balance of the 2018 financial year 
and we continue to mitigate the effect on costs by implementing 
price increases and product cost reductions.
Following the completion of ten acquisitions since September 2012, 
Volution is now a more diversified and flexible business. With our 
proven track record of performing well in challenging trading 
environments and our strong balance sheet, we are confident 
about delivering on our strategy over time. Volution Group plc

Governance
The Group continues to be committed to high levels of corporate 
governance, in line with its status as a company with a premium 
listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. Details 
of our processes and approach, including those relating to the 
role and effectiveness of the Board, and compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, are set out in the Governance 
Report on pages 50 to 57.
Board
As part of the Board’s ongoing remit to set the right tone from the 
top and build its understanding of Volution’s business, the Board 
visited the Hälleforsnäs facility in Sweden, following its visit to our 
German operations in 2016. It is the Board’s intention to continue 
to visit other facilities across the Group to build its understanding 
of each business unit. 
As previously reported in August 2016, we welcomed Claire Tiney 
to the Board as an independent Non‑ Executive Director. Claire 
has over 20 years of board‑ level experience encompassing executive 
and non‑ executive roles in blue‑ chip retailing, property development 
and the services sectors, across the UK and Continental Europe. 
The Board has welcomed Claire’s contribution since her 
appointment reflecting her board experience. 
In June 2017 we celebrated three years as a listed company. At 
that time the four Non‑ Executive Directors who were appointed 
at listing (Tony Reading, Paul Hollingworth, Adrian Barden and 
me) were re‑ appointed as Non‑ Executive Directors following the 
end of the three‑ year term of office. Adrian Barden was initially 
appointed to the former holding company of the Group, Windmill 
T opco Limited, on 3 February 2012 and provided important continuity 
on the Board whilst the business moved from private‑ equity 
ownership to a listed company. With the need to progressively 
refresh the Board and given that Adrian will have served just under 
six years on the current and pre‑ IPO Board at the time of the 
2017 Annual General Meeting, he will be retiring at the AGM and 
will not be seeking re‑ election from shareholders. I would like to 
extend my thanks to Adrian for his contributions during his tenure. 
To ensure an orderly succession plan, the Nomination Committee 
has recently initiated a search for a new Non‑ Executive Director 
and an announcement will be made in due course. Further information 
can be found in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 58 
to 59. 
People
It has been another year of growth for the Group with the addition 
and integration of two new businesses and the Volution team has 
performed well against this continued backdrop of change. Our 
strategy would not succeed were it not for the positive attitude 
and sheer hard work of our people in adapting to the constant 
change across the Group. Volution has a clear idea of where it is 
going and how to get there and we also have excellent leadership 
in our management teams. 
Our second internal Management Development Programme 
concluded during the year. We place considerable value on this 
programme which, as well as helping to develop the effectiveness 
and scope of our people, has significantly assisted in the integration 
of new acquisitions as our high potential managers are made to 
feel part of a wider group network and assist in the formation of 
the overall Group culture. Given its success, a third programme is 
due to commence later in 2017.
In accordance with the relevant regulations, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy will be put to a shareholder vote at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and a number of changes 
have been proposed to reflect current best practice. The 
proposed changes are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 67 to 84. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our employees 
for their hard work, commitment and contribution towards the 
Group’s performance, making this another successful year.

Volution Group plc
Annual Report 2017 09
Chief Executive Officer’s Review  
Ronnie George
Using our knowledge to create 
excellence in ventilation. 
Overview
I am pleased to report another year of strong results as we 
continue to build on the success of the past. We completed 
two acquisitions in the year, in line with our strategy of making 
selective value‑ adding acquisitions, and also successfully 
integrated the acquisitions made in the prior year. The acquisition 
of Breathing Buildings, a natural and hybrid ventilation system 
provider to the education sector in the UK was completed in 
December 2016 and more recently VoltAir System, a Swedish 
producer of heat recovery ventilation solutions for primarily the 
commercial new build market was completed in May 2017.
The integration of the National Ventilation and Airtech brands was 
completed in the year with a significant increase in their operating 
margins through the pre‑ planned product “swap‑ out” initiatives, 
product upgrades and the closure of the small manufacturing 
assembly operation in Lasham, Hampshire. The closure of the 
Lasham facility (part of our factory relocation project) was made 
possible through a product range development initiative, which 
resulted in the integration of the product supply inside the existing 
UK manufacturing footprint. I am also pleased to advise that all ten 
factory operatives at the facility were able to find alternative, local 
employment post closure.
The Group delivered organic revenue growth of 2.1% on a constant 
currency basis, in spite of the weakness in the Residential Public 
Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (RMI) market and the 
small decline in the UK commercial sector; all of our other market 
sectors across the Group delivered organic growth in the financial 
year. Input cost inflation has been rising, largely as a result of the 
weakness of Sterling versus the US Dollar; in mitigation we achieved 
more traction on our selling price initiatives towards the end of 
the financial year.
Torin‑ Sifan, after a decline in revenue in the first half of our 
financial year, delivered a full year organic revenue growth of 
2.8% on a constant currency basis, assisted by the sales of the 
new, more energy‑efficient and quieter electronically commutated 
(EC) 3 phase motorised impeller range. 
Summary
 > Revenue of £185.1 million achieved by both 
organic and inorganic growth totalling 19.8%
 > Another year of strong financial results with 
adjusted operating profit of £35.6 million, an 
increase of 9.6% over the prior year
 > Two acquisitions completed in the year have 
further diversified the Group’s market exposure, 
which now extends to new construction in the 
Nordics and a greater exposure to commercial 
projects in the UK
 > Continuing investment in new product development 
including the upgraded offer to public housing 
refurbishment in the UK and a further extension 
of our market‑ leading residential heat recovery 
systems range
 > The completion of our second Management 
Development Programme, developing our 
managers and leaders of tomorrow Volution Group plc

Strategic Report
Chief Executive Officer’s Review continued 
Ronnie George
Ventilation Group segment
The Ventilation Group’s performance resulted in a 21.6% increase 
in revenue on prior year (16.3% at constant currency). Organic 
growth was 7.3% (2.0% at constant currency) including the 
organic decline in revenue from the UK Residential Public RMI 
market, offset by the continuing strong organic growth in the UK 
Residential New Build market and in the Nordics.
United Kingdom
Sales in our UK Residential New Build sector were £23.4 million 
(2016: £19.8 million), growth of 18.2%, assisted in the year by the 
additional revenues from National Ventilation, acquired in May 2016. 
Organic growth achieved was 8.3% with continuing growth in 
the order book. The Kinetic Advance, initially launched in 2016, 
is now gaining good revenue traction and is now being widely 
specified in a number of residential new projects for our financial 
year 2018. This product won “Energy Efficient Product of the Year” 
at the widely acclaimed Chartered Institution of Building Services 
Engineers Building Performance Awards in February 2017 
together with “Domestic Ventilation Product of the Year” at the 
prestigious Heating and Ventilation News Awards in April 2017. 
The UK Residential Public RMI market remained challenging with 
total revenue of £15.8 million up 10.1% on the prior year assisted 
by the acquisition of Airtech in May 2016. In this market, although 
our overall share has increased as a result of this acquisition, we 
experienced an organic decline of 9.2% in the year. The Revive, 
one of the most efficient, quiet and discreet bathroom and 
kitchen fans available to the public market sector, established 
itself during the year as did the upgraded Airtech product range. 
The Revive also won an award in the Air Movement category at 
the Heating and Ventilation News Awards in April 2017. Further 
new product launches are planned for later in 2017 and we have 
now combined the public housing resources of the acquired 
Airtech business with that of the Vent‑ Axia team, to provide a 
more diverse and compelling offer to the public market sector. 
The UK private refurbishment sector performed better in the year 
with revenue of £22.7 million, an increase of 7.4% on prior year 
mainly due to the acquisition of National Ventilation. The second 
half of the financial year delivered an organic growth of 1.6% 
having declined in the first half of the year, resulting in a flat 
performance overall. Despite the market being subdued, we 
gained some significant new accounts towards the end of our 
financial year and have had greater success with price increase 
delivery in recent months. These successes, together with 
upselling our silent range of products across all our UK brands, 
give us a more optimistic outlook for revenue growth in this 
market sector for our financial year 2018. 
UK Commercial revenue grew by 51.0% in the year to 
£32.7 million (2016: £21.7 million) mainly as a result of the 
acquisition of Breathing Buildings in December 2016 and the 
full year effect of Diffusion, acquired in the prior year. Organic 
revenue declined by 0.3% in the year. Since the acquisition of 
Diffusion in December 2015, sales have performed very strongly, 
requiring us to increase the manufacturing capacity of the business 
to support the increasing demand. The acquisitions of Diffusion 
and Breathing Buildings have improved our access to the 
attractive new build commercial projects market and provide 
us with a more balanced exposure in the UK to both the new 
and refurbishment opportunities in the commercial sector.
UK Export sales were £10.2 million (2016: £7.8 million), strong 
growth of 30.8% (20.7% at constant currency), benefiting from 
the additional export sales from Diffusion with an organic growth 
of 21.0% (10.8% growth at constant currency). Sales of our 
market‑ leading residential heat recovery products and our fan coil 
range have performed particularly well in Eire with exports from 
the UK also benefiting from weaker Sterling.
Nordics
Sales in the Nordics sector were £30.8 million (2016: £25.5 million), 
an increase of 20.8% (8.8% at constant currency) with organic revenue 
growth of 16.5% (5.1% growth at constant currency). Sales of the 
Calima fan, the first app‑ controlled extractor fan on the market, 
have developed well in the year extending our leadership position 
in the Nordic RMI market for high end, near silent, energy‑ efficient 
solutions. Welair, acquired in December 2015, has provided us 
with the capability to manufacture heat recovery ventilation 
systems for the new construction market in the Nordics and our 
focus on this market has been enhanced with the acquisition of 
VoltAir System in May 2017.
VoltAir System has a capability to supply highly configurable, 
specialised solutions for heat recovery ventilation in new construction 
projects. A modular system that can be completed onsite enables 
us to supply ventilation products for applications where our 
competitors are restricted due to the size and configuration of 
their units. VoltAir System had a strong order intake following its 
acquisition and this strong forward order book provides us with 
confidence for the year ahead.
Central Europe
Sales in Central Europe were £27.5 million, growth of 15.3% 
(1.3% at constant currency). Sales in Germany grew 17.6% 
on the prior year (3.3% at constant currency) with stronger 
performance towards the end of the financial year. We have 
continued to invest in new product development, marketing and 
the sales team in Central Europe in order to support the targeted 
higher organic growth in the future. In Belgium, where we are a 
leading supplier of heat recovery ventilation systems for the new 
build market, the Kinetic Advance has started to gain traction in 
sales and further enhancements to the range are to be added in 
the financial year 2018.
OEM (Torin-Sifan) segment
Our OEM (T orin‑ Sifan) segment’ s revenue in the year was £22.0 million 
(2016: £20.4 million), an increase of 7.7% (2.8% at constant currency), 
with a stronger performance from sales in the second half of the year. 
The UK had a generally mild winter and our sales volume of traditional 
spares for gas boilers declined slightly, mitigated by a price increase 
in other products. Our new EC 3 motorised impeller range was 
launched in the second half of the year and sales to both UK 
and export customers are progressing well. The market for sales 
of EC direct current motorised impellers is expected to grow, 
underpinned by new construction growth and regulatory drivers, 
both in the UK and in Continental Europe. Strategic Report

Three strategic pillars 
Our strategy continues to focus on three key pillars:
Our core markets were again extended in the 2017 financial year 
as we acquired Breathing Buildings in the UK and VoltAir System 
in the Nordics. Both businesses focus on the new construction 
markets and improve our product portfolio, which now has a 
more diversified mix of RMI and new construction. 
The acquisitions made in the 2016 financial year have all been 
progressing well and, although not classed as delivering organic 
growth until one year after acquisition, did grow revenue in their 
first year. The expected synergies from the acquisition of NVA 
Services (National Ventilation and Airtech brands) were largely 
delivered in the year. Further synergies are expected resulting 
from more recent changes including the closure of the Lasham 
production facility and launch of new upgraded products 
manufactured at our other UK production facilities.
These new markets, as well as the original core markets for 
Volution, continue to benefit from the favourable regulatory 
backdrop that focuses on reducing carbon emissions from 
buildings (in particular new buildings) and improving air quality, 
as well as the need to improve energy efficiency. 
The ventilation market remains highly fragmented and we will 
continue to pursue acquisition opportunities leveraging the Group 
capabilities in operations, procurement, distribution and finance, 
which we have and will continue to invest in.
We will continue to provide strong central leadership in research 
and development to facilitate the Group’s growth. Investment in 
our own sourcing team in China is delivering good value to the 
procurement efforts around the enlarged Group.
The investment we made during the year in the new production 
facility for T orin‑Sifan has helped support the organic growth during 
the year. Sales of the new EC 3 motorised impeller range are gaining 
traction and production of the range at this new facility is going well 
with dedicated space reserved for further production lines to 
underpin the expected growth of the range.
People
As our Group becomes more complex and more diverse through 
acquisition and organic growth, it is essential that we have a talent 
pool to support our development plans. In April 2017 we completed 
our second internal Management Development Programme (MDP), 
which consisted of 15 high potential managers from across the 
Group. Such has been the success of this programme that we 
have decided not to wait a further year before commencing the 
next programme and will be starting our third MDP in November 2017. 
The programme itself is always oversubscribed and this time will 
consist of 18 delegates.
During the year we completed two new acquisitions in existing 
Volution geographies. The integration of new acquisitions has 
become easier as our experience of this process grows. I am 
extremely proud of the dedication and commitment of our talented 
group of employees, who show a great deal of sensitivity when 
new acquisitions join the Group, and as a result of these actions 
and behaviour we have been able to successfully build a more 
geographically and market diverse Group since listing in 2014. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every 
one of our employees for their part in this success.
Outlook
The new financial year has started well with organic growth ahead 
of that achieved in the same period in the prior year. Our significant 
investment in new product development as well as specific initiatives 
in both public and private RMI are translating into benefits as 
anticipated. As a result, the Board is confident of delivering good 
progress in this financial year.

Excellence in Ventilation
Hybrid and natural ventilation systems can help reduce 
energy consumption by up to 60% for a building that would 
otherwise be mechanically ventilated and air conditioned.
Breathing Buildings was formed in 2006 following 
a major research programme between the 
University of Cambridge and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology resulting in the development 
of a proprietary e‑ stack mixing ventilation system. 
The technology was initially patented by the 
University of Cambridge, with Breathing Buildings 
having exclusive rights to the intellectual property. 
Since then, Breathing Buildings’ technology has 
influenced how designers and consultants choose 
to ventilate buildings. The company is now the UK’s 
leading provider of controlled hybrid and natural 
ventilation systems, which can help reduce energy 
consumption by up to 60% for a building that 
would otherwise be mechanically ventilated 
and air conditioned.
By joining the Volution Group in December 2016, 
Breathing Buildings has greatly widened its 
market potential.
What does it mean for customers?
From the moment a customer has a query about 
how to ventilate their building, they are supported 
by a team of MEng and PhD engineers who help 
clients design low‑ energy buildings with stimulating 
environments, superb air quality and thermal comfort. 
Our consulting engineers work with the design team 
to discuss the different ventilation options and provide 
in‑ depth analysis to ensure their buildings do not 
overheat. Breathing Buildings can provide the whole 
range of tools to model ventilation in buildings: dynamic 
thermal modelling, computational fluid dynamics, 
water‑ bath modelling, zonal modelling, analytical 
modelling and bespoke energy modelling. The 
widening of its product range to include mechanical 
systems helps to ensure that the tool kit available 
to Breathing Buildings continues to develop and that 
we provide the widest range of solutions available.

Strategic Report
High heat recovery efficiency, 
flexible configuration and low 
power consumption lead to 
the lowest life cycle cost 
on the market.
VoltAir System was formed in 2006 with the purpose 
of developing an efficient and cost effective heat 
recovery system that could be flexible in configuration 
and was a superior alternative to the rotary wheel 
solution which was then preferred in the cold, dry 
climate of the Nordic region. The VoltAir System 
solution incorporates a patented cross‑ flow heat 
exchanger specifically designed with high thermal 
efficiency, and to eliminate cross‑ contamination 
of airflows. The VoltAir System is designed to be 
inherently resistant to frosting and can therefore 
compete with rotary wheel systems in this regard 
in the extreme cold of a Nordic winter. 
What does this mean for customers?
The specific characteristics of the VoltAir System 
heat exchanger mean that dirt and ice adhere 
poorly to the heat exchanger’s surface, which 
contributes to the product’ s high resistance to freezing. 
The design, with low air velocities, laminar flow and 
a large heat exchange surface, means the product 
provides high efficiencies of up to 90% without the need 
for defrosting. This makes them highly suitable for colder 
climates without the issues associated with rotary heat 
exchangers and provides VoltAir System with a unique 
and marketable benefit. In addition, VoltAir System is 
capable of designing highly flexible configurations for its 
modular systems. This means that installation in difficult 
to access locations in a building or the use of lower 
value, sub‑ optimal shaped rooms for the ventilation 
equipment become possible. This can be attractive 
in building consultants’ calculations of whole life 
costs for VoltAir System products.
Excellence in Ventilation continued
The acquisition of VoltAir System strengthens our 
product solutions by offering unique air handling 
unit design to deliver high efficiencies.
VoltAir System has market‑ leading flexible 
products which have low environmental 
impact and provide good, healthy indoor 
climates. We are delighted to have VoltAir 
System as part of the Volution Group, 
which is highly complementary to our 
strong position in the Nordic residential 
refurbishment ventilation products 
market and further develops our 
commercial proposition.

Our Strategy
The three strategic pillars.
We will continue to build on our core strengths and strong industry track record to gain 
further market share in each of our preferred markets. We intend to achieve our goals 
through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions. To achieve this, 
we have identified three key strategic pillars.
Continue to grow through a focused sales strategy for 
each of our core market sectors. Focus on opportunities 
arising from favourable regulatory environments and 
continue to build public awareness of indoor air quality 
issues and the benefits of higher value ventilation options 
to grow our markets and increase margins. Continue to 
develop new products and deliver benefits from recently 
acquired businesses, and drive cross‑ selling initiatives.
Actions
 > Drive demand growth in our core markets benefiting 
from regulation and educated end users
 > Bespoke sales and marketing strategy to address 
each market sector
 > Provide innovative products to address evolving 
market demand and generate upselling opportunities
 > Promote sales opportunities for Group products 
through newly acquired companies
Organic growth in our core markets
We will continue to seek to acquire and integrate 
select businesses in the residential market and, where 
appropriate, in the commercial ventilation market. Our 
focus will be principally on opportunities in Europe where 
there are clear synergistic benefits available and, for key 
strategic opportunities, outside of Europe.
Actions
 > Make acquisitions to establish leading positions in new 
markets and expand our presence in existing markets
 > Deliver revenue and cost synergies from acquisitions
 > Increase cross‑ selling and export growth
Growth through a disciplined and value‑ adding acquisition strategy
In the context of a favourable legislation‑ led shift towards 
more technologically advanced, more energy‑ efficient 
and quieter EC/DC motorised impellers, we will develop 
our product range and enhance our customer offer.

Developing our connectivity strategy
Developments for Momento II
The new Momento II towel rail controller is being designed 
to enable the home owner to control their towel rail through 
the Group’s application software (app). It will allow the customer 
to set the length of operation as well as the heat output level as 
desired. In addition the Momento II will also link with other devices 
in the bathroom enabling both the Calima fan and Momento II to 
communicate to optimise their effect. An example would be if the 
fan detects high levels of humidity from a shower, the towel rail 
would automatically activate to ensure the towel is warmed ready 
for when you have finished your shower. The warmed towel rail 
will then help evaporate water from the towel and ensure the 
fan exhausts the resulting humidity. These relationships between 
our products will continue to deliver optimised performance 
and automation, therefore increasing value over time. 
Demonstrating technical excellence through Intellivent Sky
We have continued to focus on product excellence this year, and 
nowhere more so than in the Nordics, where the new Intellivent Sky 
was previewed at the Elfack exhibition in Gothenburg, Sweden. 
This introduced a new generation of the Intellivent fan, which is our 
most sophisticated to date. With built‑ in touch controls and smart 
capability, it has been designed to provide the owner with the most 
discreet, flexible and intelligent fan to date. New functions such 
as cruise control, which ensures that the fan delivers the required 
airflow constantly, along with reduced noise whilst delivering 40% 
more pressure, will make this fan our most innovative to date. 
In addition, the Intellivent Sky was also nominated for an 
Elfack Design Award due to its innovative interface and 
modern aesthetics.
Expanding the horizon for the Torin-Sifan EC 3 motor
T o supplement the extensive range of electronically commutated 
(EC) motors, motorised impellers, fans and blowers officially 
launched at the ISH Exhibition in Frankfurt in 2017, T orin‑ Sifan has 
made further advances in the area of energy efficiency. By working 
closely with customers and understanding the input options they 
have to drive the new EC 3 fans, T orin‑ Sifan is able to adjust the 
specification of the printed circuit board by removing redundant 
energy using electrical components, thereby enhancing the 
Specific Fan Power (SFP) of the EC 3 fan in our customer 
applications. Low SFP is a critical consideration within residential 
ventilation units. T orin‑ Sifan has also worked very closely with a 
customer in the design of an application‑ specific EC 3 motorised 
impeller, further improving the energy efficiency of the fan in 
application. This particular application is one of the most 
efficient ventilation units in its class.
Extending the power capability of the current EC 3 product 
platform above our current capability of 90 watts is being 
developed to satisfy the requirements of commercial 
market applications. 
The Intellivent Sky will set new standards of Nordic design 
and will continue to build on our successful Intellivent range. 
With focus on the customer experience, we have developed 
a discreet high performance fan targeted to provide a 
compelling DIY and trade proposition.

Value-adding acquisitions and continuous expansion
Launching a range of mechanical ventilation products 
through Breathing Buildings
Breathing Buildings provides customers with unique natural 
and hybrid ventilation product solutions. Its relationships in 
the specification of ventilation systems for schools provide an 
excellent channel to also market the Group’s wider mechanical 
ventilation systems. Since the acquisition, we have introduced 
the first of what is expected to be a line of mechanical ventilation 
product ranges. This will ensure we can supply a broader range 
of solutions to our customers. 
Acquisition of VoltAir System
VoltAir System provides a unique air handling unit design that delivers 
high efficiencies of up to 90% in cold climates. The technology 
behind the highly efficient heat recovery lies in a patented heat 
exchanger with unique features that provide long, economical 
and trouble‑ free ownership. 
The VoltAir System application is applied, designed and installed 
in a modular way. The flexible design means a solution can 
be created to fit into any building, no matter how it is configured. 
The technology can therefore be used in residential buildings, offices, 
schools, hospitals, nursing homes and industry, all with great results. 
This unique approach is often preferred by customers as the VoltAir 
System units are significantly easier to accommodate in a building. 
The integration of VoltAir System into our Nordics business will 
help deliver efficiencies of scale, expose us to the attractive new 
build market in the Nordics and broaden our product offering in 
the region.
Launching Group products through our National 
Ventilation (including Monsoon) and Airtech brands
The integration of both the National Ventilation and Airtech brands 
has progressed as planned during the year. Rationalisation of fan 
platforms has ensured continued cost optimisation as well as 
range extension across both new businesses. This not only assists 
with production and purchasing efficiencies, but has also assisted 
in the extension of product ranges across our sales channels.

The Management Development Programme
As reported last year, the Management Development Programme 
(MDP) started in April 2016 and ran over a twelve‑ month period. 
It is based around four learning modules: personal effectiveness, 
managing business finance, managing change and coaching and 
development. These modules are taken over a twelve‑ month period 
and run in parallel with a real life business case that applies directly 
to our business. It concludes with a presentation to the Senior 
Management T eam and an award to the “Best Participant”. This 
year’ s intake was the most international to date and represented 
all of our businesses. The programme has not only assisted in 
developing new managers and leaders for the future, but also 
ensured that participants have built strong networks across the 
organisation and a better understanding of our diverse businesses. 
These new networks mean that implementation of synergies across 
businesses flows more freely as colleagues have already met and 
discussed their businesses in that context. The next MDP will 
start later in 2017 with the selection process complete. 
Torin-Sifan’s graduate training programme
We have previously reported on Torin‑ Sifan’s commitment to

Growth opportunities for our brands
Launch of our wider product 
portfolio through Breathing Buildings
Breathing Buildings has been pioneering natural and hybrid 
ventilation systems since 2006, with which it has become very 
successful within the new build education sector. The acquisition 
of Breathing Buildings has strengthened the Group’s product 
range and broadened its channels to market. In addition, 
Breathing Buildings now has access to the Group’s entire 
portfolio of products making it possible for it to offer a more 
comprehensive project solution to customers when all aspects 
of a building’s ventilation cannot be met by natural and hybrid 
systems. We are now capable of quoting for more parts of every 
project in line with our ambition to ensure that we can provide our 
customers with more of their ventilation needs for every project.
Continued internationalisation of the Vent-Axia brand
Following the acquisition of the Ventilair Group in 2015, we have 
been extending the product range and the coverage of the 
Vent‑ Axia brand that we offer in the Benelux region and Germany. 
Last year we reported on the roll‑ out of the Vent‑ Axia brand in 
the Netherlands and this year we have continued with the roll‑ out 
in Germany. To support this activity, over the last twelve months 
we have further developed the Vent‑ Axia website to be an 
international platform with consistent branding across multiple 
geographies. The site enables us to activate appropriate products 
across the platform by geography. Geolocation then enables us 
to direct searches as appropriate. The consistent branding, 
literature style and web platform enable us to optimise product 
launches and manage content and printed materials. 
Multi-branding of the Group product portfolio
We continue to focus on leveraging our product portfolio across 
our many strong brands and on making sure that we maximise 
our sales opportunities through all of our channels. For example, 
in the last year we have introduced a number of the Group’s 
mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) units across 
more of our brands. We continue to provide differentiation for 
each of our brands through advanced controls, modified 
functionality and other added value features. Centralised platform 
development then allows cost optimisation and leverage across 
product development projects. The extension of product ranges 
continues to provide new revenue opportunities, helping to grow 
market share through our existing sales channels.
The international roll‑ out of the Vent‑ Axia brand gives us an exciting 
opportunity to provide new propositions to customers. This allows us 
to grow brands in new geographies and ensures wider product category 
exposure without compromising on existing channel and brand positions.

Strategic Report
The Board is committed to protecting and enhancing the 
Group’s reputation and assets, while safeguarding the interests 
of shareholders. It has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of risk management and internal control.
The Group’s businesses are affected by a number of risks and 
uncertainties. These may be impacted by internal and external 
factors, some of which we cannot control. Many of the risks are 
similar to those found by comparable companies in terms of 
scale and operations.
The risks and uncertainties facing the Group have also been 
considered in the context of the UK leaving the European Union. 
Whilst negotiations continue between the UK and the European 
Union, it is still too early to judge the long‑ term implications, and 
at the current time we consider that the principal risks affecting 
the Group are unchanged. The Board will, however, continue 
to closely monitor market conditions and will react accordingly.
Our approach
Risk management and maintenance of appropriate systems of 
control to manage risk are the responsibilities of the Board and 
are integral to the ability of the Group to deliver on its strategic 
priorities. The Board has developed a framework of risk management 
which is used to establish the culture of effective risk management 
throughout the business by identifying and monitoring the material 
risks, setting risk appetite and determining the overall risk tolerance 
of the Group. This framework of risk management has been 
enhanced this year and additional processes have been introduced 
across the Group which will assist the Board to monitor and 
assess the principal risks throughout the year. In addition, to 
enhance risk awareness, embed risk management and gain greater 
participation in managing risk across the Group, a programme of 
employee communication commenced during the year. 
The Group’s risk management systems are monitored by the 
Audit Committee, under delegation from the Board. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for overseeing the effectiveness of the 
internal control environment of the Group.
BDO LLP (BDO) continued to act in the capacity of internal 
auditor and provide independent assurance that the Group’s risk 
management, governance and internal control processes are 
operating effectively. BDO continued to act in this capacity 
throughout the financial year ended 31 July 2017.

Identifying and monitoring material risks
Material risks are identified through a detailed analysis 
of individual processes and procedures (bottom‑ up approach) 
and a consideration of the strategy and operating environment 
of the Group (top‑ down approach).
The risk evaluation process begins in the operating businesses 
with a biannual exercise undertaken by management to identify 
and document the significant strategic, operational, financial and 
accounting risks facing the businesses. This process ensures 
risks are identified and monitored and management controls 
are embedded in the businesses’ operations.
The risk assessments from each of the operating businesses 
are then considered by Group management, which evaluates 
the principal risks of the Group with reference to the Group’s 
strategy and operating environment for review by the Board.
Our principal risks and uncertainties
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) states that the 
Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the 
principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives 
and that it should maintain sound risk management and internal 
control systems. In accordance with provision C.2.1 of the 
Code, the Directors confirm that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those which would threaten the business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
Set out in this section of the Strategic Report are the principal 
risks and uncertainties which could affect the Group and which 
have been determined by the Board, based on the robust risk 
evaluation process described above, to have the potential to 
have the greatest impact on the Group’s future viability. These 
risks are similar to those reported last year, although with some 
movement on the direction of the perceived risk. For each risk 
there is a description of the possible impact of the risk to the 
Group, should it occur, together with strategic consequences 
and the mitigation and control processes in place to manage 
the risk. This list is likely to change over time as different risks 
take on larger or smaller significance.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of 
the Group over the next three‑ year period, taking into account 
the Group’s current position and the potential impact of the 
principal risks documented on pages 34 to 37 of the Annual 
Report and Accounts. Based on this assessment, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period to 31 July 2020. 
The Directors have determined that a three‑ year period to 
31 July 2020 is an appropriate period over which to provide 
its viability statement given the dynamic nature of the sector 
and as it is in line with our business planning cycle. 
In making this statement, the Board carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. Principal risks are identified through our risk management 
process and are set out on pages 34 to 37. They are recorded 
in a Group Risk Register which is reviewed and discussed by the 
Board at least twice a year. These risks have also been considered 
in the context of the UK leaving the European Union and, whilst it 
is too early to judge the longer‑ term impact on the UK market, we 
consider the principal risks affecting the Group to be unchanged.
The Board considers annually a three‑ year strategic plan. The 
output of this plan is used to perform central debt and headroom 
profile analysis, which includes a review of sensitivity to key principal 
risks. It also considers the ability of the Group to raise finance 
and deploy capital.
Whilst the review has considered all the principal risks identified 
by the Group, the following were focused on for enhanced stress 
testing: economic slowdown which has been considered in the 
context of the UK leaving the European Union, increased debt 
from acquisitions, supply chain risk affecting gross margins and 
combinations of the above scenarios. Stress tests using more 
significant revenue sensitivities than that seen during the most 
recent global financial crisis in 2008/9 have been applied. None 
of the individual sensitivities applied change the Director’s 
assessment of viability. The geographical and sector diversification 
of the Group’s operations helps minimise the risk of serious 
business interruption or catastrophic damage to our reputation. 
Furthermore, our business model is structured so that the Group 
is not reliant on one particular group of customers or sector. In 
addition, our ability to flex our cost base protects our viability in 
the face of adverse economic conditions and/or other political or 
regulatory uncertainties. 
Going concern
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity 
position are set out in the Financial Statements section. Furthermore, 
note 28 on page 134 to the consolidated financial statements 
includes the Group’s objectives and policies for managing its 
capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its 
financial instruments and its exposure to credit and liquidity risk. 
The Directors believe the Group is in a strong financial position 
due to its profitable operations and strong cash generation and 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
The Directors have made this assessment after consideration 
of the Group’s budgeted cash flows and related assumptions. Volution Group plc

IT systems 
including cyber 
breach
We may be adversely affected by a 
breakdown in our IT systems or a 
failure to properly implement any 
new systems.
Failure of our IT and communication 
systems could affect any or all of our 
business processes and have significant 
impact on our ability to trade, collect 
cash and make payments.
 
We could temporarily lose sales and market share 
and could potentially damage our reputation for  
customer service.
We believe there is an increasing 
risk as the frequency and 
sophistication of cyberattacks on 
businesses has been increasing.
Disaster recovery and data backup processes are in place, operated 
diligently and tested regularly.
A significant Enterprise Resource Planning system upgrade is underway 
for several key sites, managed by a dedicated team of experienced senior 
employees from the business. A disaster failover site has been implemented.
We have a three‑layered system of network security protection against 
cyberattack or breaches of security. This infrastructure is maintained to 
withstand the increasingly sophisticated worldwide cyber threats. We also 
undertake regular cyber security testing.
Customers
A significant amount of our revenue 
is derived from a small number 
of customers and from our 
relationships with heating and 
ventilation consultants. We may 
fail to maintain these relationships.
Any deterioration in our relationship 
with a significant customer could have 
an adverse significant effect on our 
revenue from that customer.
 
Our organic growth ambitions would be 
adversely affected. 
Our underlying risk of losing the 
revenue of any one customer 
continues unchanged; however, 
our recent acquisitions have 
further served to diversify 
our customer base.
We have strong brands, recognised and valued by our end users, and this 
gives us continued traction through our distribution channels and with 
consultants and specifiers.
We have a very wide range of ventilation and ancillary products that enhance 
our brand proposition and make us a convenient “one‑stop‑shop” supplier.
We continue to develop new and existing products to support our product 
portfolio and brand reputation. 
We provide an excellent level of customer service.
Legal and 
regulatory 
environment
Changes in laws or regulation 
relating to the carbon efficiency 
of buildings, the efficiency 
of electrical products, or 
compliance may change.
The shift towards higher value‑ added and 
more energy‑ efficient products may not 
develop as anticipated resulting in lower 
sales and profit growth.
If our products are not compliant and 
we fail to develop new products in a 
timely manner we may lose revenue 
and market share to our competitors.
Failure to manage certain compliance risks 
adequately could lead to death or serious 
injury of an employee or third party, and/or 
penalties for non‑ compliance in health  
and safety, anti‑ bribery, data protection 
or competition law.
  
Our organic growth ambitions may be adversely affected.
We may need to review our acquisition criteria to reflect 
the dynamics of a new regulatory environment.
We may have to redirect our new product 
development activity.
There has been no significant 
new legislation or regulation, or 
changes to current legislation or 
regulation, which has had, or 
could have, a material impact 
on the business. 
We participate in trade bodies that help to influence the regulatory environment 
in which we operate and as a consequence we are also well placed to 
understand future trends in our industry.
We are active in new product development and have the resource to react 
to and anticipate necessary changes in the specification of our products.
We employ internal specialist expertise, supported where needed by 
suitably qualified and experienced external providers. Local operational 
compliance audits are undertaken. 
We have training and awareness programmes in place such as health 
and safety and anti‑bribery. We have a whistleblowing hotline managed 
by an independent third party providing employees with a process to 
raise non‑compliance issues.
Supply chain 
and raw materials
Raw materials or components may 
become difficult to source because 
of material scarcity or disruption 
of supply. 
Sales and profitability may be reduced 
during the period of constraint.
Prices for the input material may 
increase and our costs may increase.
 
Organic growth may be reduced.
Our product development efforts may be redirected 
to find alternative materials and components.
Our pattern of purchasing and 
relationships with our long‑term 
supplier base remains unchanged. 
Our policy of ensuring a resilient 
supply base remains a priority.
We establish long‑term relationships with key suppliers to promote continuity 
of supply and where possible we have alternative sources identified.
Innovation
We may fail to innovate commercially 
or technically viable products to 
maintain and develop our product 
leadership position.
Scarce development resource 
may be misdirected and costs 
incurred unnecessarily. 
Failure to innovate may result in an 
ageing product portfolio which falls 
behind that of our competition.
 
Our organic growth ambitions depend in part upon our 
ability to innovate new and improved products to meet 
and create market needs. In the medium term, failure to 
innovate may result in a decline in sales and profitability.
We continue to demonstrate 
innovation with new product 
launches, and a number of awards 
were received during the year. 
Our product innovation is driven by a deep understanding of the ventilation 
market and its economic and regulatory drivers. The Group starts with a 
clear marketing brief before embarking on product development.
People
Our continuing success depends 
on retaining key personnel and 
attracting skilled individuals.
Skilled and experienced employees 
may decide to leave the Group, 
potentially moving to a competitor. 
Any aspect of the business could 
be impacted with resultant reduction 
in prospects, sales and profitability.
  
Our competitiveness and growth potential, both organic 
and inorganic, could be adversely affected.
There have been no significant 
changes to the supply and 
retention of quality employees. 
Regular employee appraisals allow two‑way feedback on performance 
and ambition.
A Management Development Programme was initiated in 2013 (with the latest 
to be launched in late 2017) to provide key employees with the skills needed to 
grow within the business and to enhance their contribution to the business.

Risk Impact Strategic consequence Likelihood
Potential 
impact Risk direction Mitigation
IT systems 
including cyber 
breach
We may be adversely affected by a 
breakdown in our IT systems or a 
failure to properly implement any 
new systems.
Failure of our IT and communication 
systems could affect any or all of our 
business processes and have significant 
impact on our ability to trade, collect 
cash and make payments.
 
We could temporarily lose sales and market share 
and could potentially damage our reputation for  
customer service.
We believe there is an increasing 
risk as the frequency and 
sophistication of cyberattacks on 
businesses has been increasing.
Disaster recovery and data backup processes are in place, operated 
diligently and tested regularly.
A significant Enterprise Resource Planning system upgrade is underway 
for several key sites, managed by a dedicated team of experienced senior 
employees from the business. A disaster failover site has been implemented.
We have a three‑ layered system of network security protection against 
cyberattack or breaches of security. This infrastructure is maintained to 
withstand the increasingly sophisticated worldwide cyber threats. We also 
undertake regular cyber security testing.
Customers
A significant amount of our revenue 
is derived from a small number 
of customers and from our 
relationships with heating and 
ventilation consultants. We may 
fail to maintain these relationships.
Any deterioration in our relationship 
with a significant customer could have 
an adverse significant effect on our 
revenue from that customer.
 
Our organic growth ambitions would be 
adversely affected. 
Our underlying risk of losing the 
revenue of any one customer 
continues unchanged; however, 
our recent acquisitions have 
further served to diversify 
our customer base.
We have strong brands, recognised and valued by our end users, and this 
gives us continued traction through our distribution channels and with 
consultants and specifiers.
We have a very wide range of ventilation and ancillary products that enhance 
our brand proposition and make us a convenient “one‑stop ‑ shop” supplier.
We continue to develop new and existing products to support our product 
portfolio and brand reputation. 
We provide an excellent level of customer service.
Legal and 
regulatory 
environment
Changes in laws or regulation 
relating to the carbon efficiency 
of buildings, the efficiency 
of electrical products, or 
compliance may change.
The shift towards higher value‑added and 
more energy‑efficient products may not 
develop as anticipated resulting in lower 
sales and profit growth.
If our products are not compliant and 
we fail to develop new products in a 
timely manner we may lose revenue 
and market share to our competitors.
Failure to manage certain compliance risks 
adequately could lead to death or serious 
injury of an employee or third party, and/or 
penalties for non‑compliance in health  
and safety, anti‑bribery, data protection 
or competition law.
  
Our organic growth ambitions may be adversely affected.
We may need to review our acquisition criteria to reflect 
the dynamics of a new regulatory environment.
We may have to redirect our new product 
development activity.
There has been no significant 
new legislation or regulation, or 
changes to current legislation or 
regulation, which has had, or 
could have, a material impact 
on the business. 
We participate in trade bodies that help to influence the regulatory environment 
in which we operate and as a consequence we are also well placed to 
understand future trends in our industry.
We are active in new product development and have the resource to react 
to and anticipate necessary changes in the specification of our products.
We employ internal specialist expertise, supported where needed by 
suitably qualified and experienced external providers. Local operational 
compliance audits are undertaken. 
We have training and awareness programmes in place such as health 
and safety and anti‑ bribery. We have a whistleblowing hotline managed 
by an independent third party providing employees with a process to 
raise non‑ compliance issues.
Supply chain 
and raw materials
Raw materials or components may 
become difficult to source because 
of material scarcity or disruption 
of supply. 
Sales and profitability may be reduced 
during the period of constraint.
Prices for the input material may 
increase and our costs may increase.
 
Organic growth may be reduced.
Our product development efforts may be redirected 
to find alternative materials and components.
Our pattern of purchasing and 
relationships with our long‑ term 
supplier base remains unchanged. 
Our policy of ensuring a resilient 
supply base remains a priority.
We establish long‑ term relationships with key suppliers to promote continuity 
of supply and where possible we have alternative sources identified.
Innovation
We may fail to innovate commercially 
or technically viable products to 
maintain and develop our product 
leadership position.
Scarce development resource 
may be misdirected and costs 
incurred unnecessarily. 
Failure to innovate may result in an 
ageing product portfolio which falls 
behind that of our competition.
 
Our organic growth ambitions depend in part upon our 
ability to innovate new and improved products to meet 
and create market needs. In the medium term, failure to 
innovate may result in a decline in sales and profitability.
We continue to demonstrate 
innovation with new product 
launches, and a number of awards 
were received during the year. 
Our product innovation is driven by a deep understanding of the ventilation 
market and its economic and regulatory drivers. The Group starts with a 
clear marketing brief before embarking on product development.
People
Our continuing success depends 
on retaining key personnel and 
attracting skilled individuals.
Skilled and experienced employees 
may decide to leave the Group, 
potentially moving to a competitor. 
Any aspect of the business could 
be impacted with resultant reduction 
in prospects, sales and profitability.
  
Our competitiveness and growth potential, both organic 
and inorganic, could be adversely affected.
There have been no significant 
changes to the supply and 
retention of quality employees. 
Regular employee appraisals allow two‑ way feedback on performance 
and ambition.
A Management Development Programme was initiated in 2013 (with the latest 
to be launched in late 2017) to provide key employees with the skills needed to 
grow within the business and to enhance their contribution to the business.

email or online. The confidentiality of the information reported is 
protected. In addition, web‑ based anti‑ bribery and corruption 
training is carried out by all employees in areas of the business 
where risk is deemed to be highest.
Health and safety
We are committed to achieving and maintaining the highest 
standards in health and safety practice. An open culture towards 
health and safety engages our employees and helps maintain our 
excellent safety record. Each business invests in specialist roles 
and training to support this process. Each employee and contractor 
is given information, instruction and the training necessary to 
enable safe working. Our employees and contractors recognise 
that it is their legal duty to take reasonable care for their own 
safety and the safety of others in their work area with working 
safely a condition of employment.
All accidents, dangerous incidents and near‑ miss situations 
are promptly investigated. The details of such incidents as well 
as the remedial and preventative measures taken are shared 
between sites as a means of raising awareness and reducing 
the risk of repetition. The Board reviews health and safety 
at every meeting.
Our safety record at every facility has benefited in recent years 
from the establishment of global standards, measurement and 
direction, and over the last year we have continued to introduce 
improvements with further independent health and safety audits 
and management focus on accidents in the workplace. 
Diversity
Although the Group has no specific gender and diversity targets 
as we believe that appointments should be based on merit, 
we strongly support diversity throughout the workforce. We 
employ a diverse workforce and pride ourselves on providing 
equal opportunities for all. High value is placed on rewarding our 
people for their commitment, their integrity and their service. We 
aim to ensure that no employee is discriminated against, directly 
or indirectly, on the grounds of colour, race, ethnic or national 
origins, sexual orientation or gender, marital status, disability, 
religion or belief, being part time, or age. We believe that better 
business decisions can be made by having representation from 
different genders and cultural backgrounds with differing skill 
sets, experience and knowledge, which reflects our customer 
base and the wider population in our markets.
The building materials industry traditionally attracts a higher 
than average proportion of male employees. This is reflected 
in the Group’ s split between male and female employees as 
shown opposite:
Overview
We are committed to operating in a manner that protects human 
rights, provides real opportunities for our employees, protects the 
environment and makes a positive contribution to the community.
We embrace a culture of continual improvement in all aspects of 
our business. We aim to understand and respond to the needs of 
employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, the communities 
in which we work and the wider public.
As part of our commitment to corporate social responsibility we 
aim to align our business values, purpose and strategy with the 
needs of our stakeholders, whilst embedding such responsible 
and ethical principles into everything we do.
 
People
 
Business and ethics
Our core values and principles, and the standards of behaviour to 
which every employee and agent across the Group is expected 
to work, are set out in the Volution Code of Conduct. These 
values and principles are applied to dealings with our customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders.
We have a zero‑ tolerance approach to all forms of bribery and 
corruption. Our Anti‑ Bribery and Corruption Policy has been approved 
by the Board and rolled out across the Group. It applies to all 
businesses, Directors, employees and agents within the Group to 
ensure compliance with all laws and regulations governing bribery 
and corruption in the countries in which the Group operates.
The Group has a “Speak‑ Up” facility operated by an independent 
external company, where employees can report any incidents or 
inappropriate behaviours in their own language by telephone, by 
Volution Group is founded upon 
the excellence of its people.

Note
1.  Legislation requires that we define “senior 
managers” as the directors of our subsidiary 
companies. However, the Board believes this 
information does not provide a meaningful 
analysis of how the Group operates so the 
data shown reflects the proportion of senior 
managers by our own internal grading system. 
The number also excludes Board Directors.
 
Human rights
Breaches of human rights are not considered to be a material risk 
for the business owing to the fact that our activities are substantially 
carried out in developed countries that have strong legislation 
governing human rights. We support human rights as set down by:
 > International Labour Organisation standards;
 > the United Nations Global Compact (covering the areas of 
human rights, labour, the environment and anti‑ corruption); and
 > the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Modern Slavery Act
We are opposed to slavery, servitude, forced labour and human 
trafficking. We take a zero‑ tolerance approach to modern slavery in 
the supply chain and businesses under our control. The Board has 
approved a statement setting out the steps that have been taken to 
combat modern slavery. This statement can be found on the Group’ s 
website at www.volutiongroupplc.com. 
 
Community
 
Each company within the Group understands the importance 
of being a contributing member of society and its impact on 
the long‑ term development and sustainability of the business. 
Each business takes responsibility for managing its relationship 
with its local community. This responsibility involves the positive 
engagement with, and support of, worthwhile projects and 
programmes as a company, as well as the volunteering activities 
and efforts of its employees. Support is given to local initiatives 
such as manufacturing and business forums and talks and 
training are given to local groups. Our policy on donations and 
community involvement is to support local educational and 
charitable causes. 
We continue to work with the Engineering Development Trust to 
help inspire children and young people to choose a future career 
in science and engineering. In addition, we support initiatives 
creating opportunities for work experience within our Group. 
 
Environment
We recognise the impact that our businesses may have on 
the environment and, as a minimum standard, we comply with 
current applicable legislation in the countries in which we operate.
We endeavour to limit the impact on the environment within which 
we operate and also protect the environment that we all share. 
Across the Group, energy‑ reducing initiatives will continue, 
including using recycled plastics in manufacturing, recycling 
waste paper and cardboard and working with our customers 
to reduce waste onsite. Our Lo‑ Carbon range of products 
will continue to be donated to environmental projects to 
demonstrate innovative energy reduction techniques.
Our product development programme continues to focus on 
low‑ carbon initiatives, using technology which reduces power 
consumption and recovers, recycles and reuses energy that 
would otherwise be wasted. At all times the Group will produce 
products that are as energy efficient as possible and will continue 
to research and develop energy‑ efficient solutions for the marketplace.
Greenhouse gas emissions
We are required to measure and report our direct and indirect 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pursuant to the Companies Act 
2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. 
The mandatory requirement is for the disclosure of the scope 1 
and 2 emissions only. These are direct emissions such as heating, 
vehicle fuel and indirect emissions, for example purchased electricity. 
Our total GHG footprint in line with DEFRA’s mandatory reporting 
requirement is shown in the table below.

Operational Review
The Ventilation Group segment
The Ventilation Group has sector‑ leading positions in the UK, the Nordics and Central Europe. 
During the year, we completed two acquisitions which have expanded our residential and commercial proposition and sales channels 
as follows:
 > Breathing Buildings in the UK has been pioneering natural and hybrid ventilation systems since 2006, with which it has become 
very successful within the new build education sector. The acquisition has widened our capability into this new niche, strengthened 
our product range and broadened our channel to market; and
 > VoltAir System has a strong presence in the commercial and residential new build ventilation markets in Sweden where demand 
is increasing for energy‑ efficient air handling units. The business is highly complementary to our strong position in the Nordic 
residential refurbishment ventilation products market.

During the year a project was commenced to consolidate the UK 
Ventilation Group’s plastic injection moulding facility and its main 
plastic fan assembly facility into a single site in order to improve 
logistical efficiency and provide capacity for expansion. The new 
leased facility is located at Suttons Business Park in Reading in 
the UK and construction of the purpose built premises is well 
underway. The relocation will begin in early 2018.
In May 2017 the Vent‑ Axia business successfully implemented a 
new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) business management 
system. Amongst the many benefits, the new system allows 
greater transparency of the customer order book and allows 
the business to further improve its on‑ time delivery performance. 
In the same month Fresh in the Nordics migrated to a common 
ERP platform for the Nordics region.
The plastic injection moulding facility located in Gemla in Sweden 
benefited from an investment programme which enabled the 
installation of a new, highly efficient injection moulding machine 
together with a pair of pick and pack robots, enabling lights‑ out 
night‑ time operation to increase capacity and reduce cost. 
In line with the Group’s philosophy of striving to achieve the highest 
standards of quality across the business, both inVENTer and 
Ventilair achieved accreditation to the quality standard, ISO 9001, 
for their facilities in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
The Diffusion business located in West Molesey in the UK has 
continued to benefit from strong demand for its products in the 
fan coil market. To enable production to meet demand, a satellite 
assembly unit was opened and Diffusion moved to a 24‑ hour 
shift pattern.  Strategic Report

The Vent‑ Axia facility in Dudley in the UK continued to grow 
its output of mechanical ventilation with heat recovery units 
to supply the New Build Residential ventilation market. Sales of 
the Kinetic Advance MVHR product are growing and a second 
assembly cell is in the process of being installed at the facility 
to ensure sufficient capacity to support growing demand.
Breathing Buildings in Cambridge in the UK, acquired in 
December 2016, has been integrated into the Group and is 
benefiting from cost optimisation of its supply chain. The Group 
technical resource is also leading a number of new product 
development initiatives.
VoltAir System in Torsby in Sweden, acquired in May 2017, 
has expanded our ventilation product portfolio in the Nordic 
region into the new build market and especially the market for 
large ventilation projects. We expect to benefit from new product 
development, operational leverage, procurement effectiveness 
and from higher sales resulting from the combination of VoltAir 
System’s highly energy‑efficient and tailor ‑ made air handling 
units with Welair’s high quality conventional technology units.

Overall, our OEM (Torin‑ Sifan) business enjoyed strong demand 
for both traditional AC and EC motor technology, particularly during 
the second half of the year, with sales growth in the year of 7.7%.
Sales within the residential market grew by 2.8% on a constant 
currency basis, with a particularly strong performance in the 
combined production of EC fans and spares for AC fans for gas 
boilers. Our residential sales were also strengthened by the launch 
of our new high‑ efficiency Revolution 360 range of EC fans into 
volume production during the year. This new product range was 
officially launched at the 2017 ISH Exhibition in Frankfurt (the world’ s 
leading exhibition for building, ventilation and plumbing solutions) 
and offers benefits in both high efficiency and low noise to the 
European heating, ventilation and air conditioning industry. Interest 
in the new EC fans has been strong and the product line has already 
moved to two‑ shift production, operating 18 hours a day within 
our EC Manufacturing & Technology Centre in Swindon in the UK. 
Sales within the commercial market have remained stable, 
with some sales erosion in traditional AC technology fans due 
to energy‑ related product legislation changes being offset by 
high growth within our EC Fandeck product family, particularly 
within the fan coil industry. Our range of large EC blowers has 
also performed well within the fan refurbishment and OEM 
production segments. 
The sustained demand in the second half of the year has created 
some productivity and service challenges with initiatives in place 
aimed at ensuring the necessary production capacity and component 
supply. Cost pressures in the year caused by adverse exchange 
rates on imports and inflation in commodity materials have been 
managed effectively through a combination of cost saving initiatives 
and sales price re‑ alignment. Investment in enhanced management 
capability in both engineering and procurement has been made 
to ensure optimisation of production costs through design and 
supply chain activities. 
During the year, resources have been committed to ensure the 
successful implementation of a new ERP system within T orin‑ Sifan, 
which is scheduled to be fully implemented in early 2018.  Volution Group plc

Financial Review
Ian Dew
Organic growth, two acquisitions 
and strong cash generation created 
through excellence in ventilation.
Revenue
The Group continued its strong revenue growth during 2017. 
Revenue for the year ended 31 July 2017 was £185.1 million 
(2016: £154.5 million), a 19.8% increase (14.5% at constant 
currency). Growth was achieved both organically, 7.3% (2.1% at 
constant currency), and inorganically, 12.5% (12.4% at constant 
currency). The inorganic growth was a result of the two acquisitions 
made in the year and the full year effect of the four acquisitions 
made in the prior year. 
The Ventilation Group revenues grew by 21.6% (16.3% at constant 
currency), of which organic growth represented 7.3% (2.0% at 
constant currency). OEM (Torin‑ Sifan) grew, entirely organically, 
by 7.7% (2.8% at constant currency). 
Due to the significant weakening of Sterling in June 2016 and its 
low value throughout the financial year, the movements in foreign 
currency exchange rates for the year as a whole have had a 
favourable translation effect on the reported revenue of our 
overseas businesses. If we had translated the full year revenue 
of our business at our 2016 exchange rates, the reported Group 
revenues would have been £176.9 million.
Profitability 
Our underlying result, as measured by adjusted operating profit, was 
£35.6 million (2016: £32.5 million), 19.3% of revenues (2016: 21.0%), 
delivering a £3.1 million improvement compared to the prior year. 
The Group benefited from the acquisition of Breathing Buildings 
in December 2016 and VoltAir System in May 2017 and the full 
year effect of the prior year acquisitions. 
On sales growth of 19.8%, adjusted profit before tax improved 
by £3.3 million to £34.6 million, growth of 10.3%. Our Group 
adjusted profit before tax margin declined by 1.6 percentage 
points to 18.7% as a consequence of the acquisition of businesses 
that operated with profit margins lower than our Group average, 
exchange rate linked inflation in the UK and a decline in the 
profitable UK RMI (public) sector revenue. 
The Group’s reported profit before tax in the year was £17.9 million 
compared to £18.4 million in 2016. The reported profit before tax 
for the period has declined by £0.5 million in spite of a £3.3 million 
increase in underlying profitability largely because:
 > in the reported results there was a finance cost of £1.4 million 
in the year relating to the revaluation of financial instruments carried 
at fair value (2016: a gain of £1.1 million) which uncrystallised 
movement we do not include in our adjusted results; and
 > the amortisation of acquired intangible assets increased by 
£1.1 million in the year, as a consequence of recent 
acquisitions, to £13.8 million (2016: £12.7 million).
Summary
 > Strong revenue growth of 19.8% 
(14.5% at constant currency) 
 > Strong growth in adjusted profit before 
tax of 10.3% (4.7% at constant currency) 
 > Two acquisitions completed in the year
 > Adjusted operating cash inflow of £35.5 million 
(2016: £31.1 million) 
 > Closing debt leverage of 0.9x
I am proud to announce another 
year of strong financial performance.

Reconciliation of statutory measures to adjusted performance measures
The Board and key management personnel use some alternative performance measures to track and assess the underlying performance 
of the business. These measures include adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted basic and diluted EPS and 
adjusted operating cash flow. These measures are deemed more appropriate as they remove income and expenditure which is not 
directly related to the ongoing trading of the business. A reconciliation of these measures of performance to the corresponding 
reported figure is shown below and is detailed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

The following are the items excluded from adjusted measures:
 > Amortisation of acquired intangibles 
On acquisition of a business, where appropriate, we value identifiable intangible fixed assets acquired such as trademarks and 
customer base and recognise these assets in our consolidated statement of financial position; we then amortise these acquired 
intangible assets over their useful lives. In the year the amortisation charge of these intangible assets increased to £13.8 million 
(2016: £12.7 million) as a consequence of recent acquisitions. We exclude this accounting adjustment in the calculation of our 
adjusted earnings because it is a cost associated with acquisitions, not the underlying trading of the businesses. Volution Group plc

 > Exceptional items 
Exceptional items, by virtue of their size, incidence or nature, 
are disclosed separately in order to allow a better understanding 
of the underlying trading performance of the Group. During the 
year, exceptional items were £1.4 million (2016: £1.2 million) 
and relate to the cost of acquisitions £0.8 million (2016: £1.2 million) 
and the factory relocation £0.6 million (2016: £nil). Details of 
these exceptional items can be found in note 5 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
 > Non-recurring items not  
meeting the definition of exceptional  
These are items of expense incurred by the Group which are 
non‑ recurring but do not meet the IFRS definition of exceptional 
items; they have been adjusted to give a fairer representation 
of the underlying performance of the business. There were no 
such costs this year (2016: £0.2 million).
 > Fair value adjustments 
At each reporting period end date, we measure the fair value 
of financial derivatives and recognise any gains or losses 
immediately in finance cost. During the year, we recognised a 
loss of £1.4 million (2016: gain of £1.1 million). We exclude these 
gains or losses from our measures of adjusted earnings because 
they are accounting adjustments which will reverse in future 
periods and do not reflect the underlying trading of the business.
Acquisitions
Two acquisitions were completed during the year:
 > Breathing Buildings, based in the UK, acquired in December 2016 
for a consideration of £11.6 million net of cash acquired; and
 > VoltAir System, based in Sweden, acquired in May 2017 
for a cash consideration of SEK 72.9 million (approximately 
£6.5 million) net of cash acquired. In addition there is an 
element of consideration which is contingent upon the level 
of EBITDA for the twelve months ended 31 December 2017, 
with a fair value of SEK 16,930,000 (approximately £1.5 million). 
Finance revenue and costs
Net finance costs of £2.5 million (2016: £nil) increased in the year as 
a consequence of the loss of £1.4 million in the fair value of financial 
derivatives in the year (2016: gain of £1.1 million) as discussed above. 
Our net finance cost before these revaluations has decreased 
slightly in the year to £1.1 million (2016: £1.2 million).
Taxation
The UK Finance (No. 2) Act 2015, which was enacted on 
18 November 2015, introduced a reduction in the UK headline 
rate of corporation tax to 19% and 18% from 1 April 2017 and 
1 April 2020 respectively. A further reduction in the headline rate 
to 17% from 1 April 2020 was included in the UK Finance Act 
2016, enacted on 15 September 2016.
The effective tax rate for the year was 22.5% (2016: 15.0%), the 
prior year benefited from a one‑ off deferred tax credit of £1.6 million, 
mainly arising from the changes to the UK corporation tax rates 
mentioned above.
Our underlying effective tax rate, on adjusted profit before tax, 
was 21.8% (2016: 20.0%). The increase of 1.8 percentage points, 
over the prior year, was partly as a result of a higher proportion 
of our profits, in the year, being earned in jurisdictions with higher 
tax rates (an expense of £0.2 million) and partly because the prior 
year’s adjusted tax charge benefited from a £0.4 million one‑ off 
deferred tax credit, part of the £1.6 million credit outlined above.
The Group’s medium‑ term adjusted effective tax rate is expected 
to remain around 21% of the Group’s adjusted profit before tax.
Operating cash flow
The Group continued to be strongly cash generative in the year with 
adjusted operating cash inflow of £35.9 million (2016: £31.1 million). 
This represents a cash conversion, after capital expenditure and 
movement in working capital, of 99% (2016: 95%). The Group 
continues to manage its working capital efficiently with operating 
working capital representing 10.5% of revenue (2016: 11.7%). 
In addition, the Group continues to invest for the future with net capital 
expenditure of £3.9 million (2016: £4.3 million) including investment in 
new product development and improved IT systems. See the glossary 
of terms in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements for a 
definition of adjusted operating cash flow and cash conversion.

Employee Benefit Trust
In the period the Group loaned £0.5 million to the Volution Employee 
Benefit Trust for the exclusive purpose of purchasing shares in 
Volution Group plc in order to partly fulfil the Company’s obligations 
under its Long Term Incentive Plan and Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan. The Employee Benefit Trust acquired 250,000 shares at an 
average price of £1.95 per share in the period for an aggregate 
consideration of £0.5 million. The Employee Benefit Trust has been 
consolidated into our results and the shares purchased have been 
treated as treasury shares deducted from shareholders’ funds.
Net debt
Year‑ end net debt was £37.0 million (2016: £36.1 million), comprised 
of bank borrowings of £51.5 million (2016: £51.8 million), offset by 
cash and cash equivalents of £14.5 million (2016: £15.7 million). 
The net debt of £37.0 million represents leverage of 0.9x 
adjusted EBITDA. Strategic Report

Bank facilities, refinancing and liquidity
The Group’s bank facilities at the year end consisted of a 
£90 million revolving credit facility, maturing April 2019.
As at 31 July 2017, we had £37.0 million of undrawn, committed 
bank facilities and £14.5 million of cash and cash equivalents on 
the consolidated statement of financial position.
Foreign exchange
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in the foreign 
currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies 
other than the functional currency of our operating businesses. 
We have significant Euro income in the UK which is mostly balanced 
by Euro expenditure in the UK. We have little US Dollar income 
but significant expenditure. We limited our transactional foreign 
exchange risk by purchasing the majority of our forecast US 
Dollar requirements for the 2017 financial year in advance, 
and similarly we have purchased the majority of our forecast 
US Dollar requirements in advance of the 2018 financial year. 
We are also exposed to translational currency risk as the Group 
consolidates foreign currency‑ denominated assets, liabilities, 
income and expenditure into Group reporting denominated in 
Sterling. We hedge the translation risk of the net assets in the 
Nordics with £23.2 million of borrowings denominated in SEK 
(2016: £15.9 million). We have partially hedged our risk of 
translation of the net assets in Belgium, the Netherlands and 
Germany by having Euro‑ denominated bank borrowings in the 
amount of £23.3 million as at 31 July 2017 (2016: £22.0 million). 
The Sterling value of our foreign currency‑ denominated loans and 
cash increased by £2.4 million in the year as a consequence of 
exchange rate movements. We do not hedge the translational 
exchange rate risk to the results of overseas subsidiaries.
During the year, movements in foreign currency exchange 
rates have had a favourable effect on the reported revenue and 
profitability of our business. If we had translated the full year 
performance of our business at our 2016 exchange rates, our 
reported Group revenues would have been £8.2 million or 4.4% 
lower and adjusted operating profit would have been £1.8 million 
or 4.9% lower. 
At the end of the financial year the weakening of Sterling increased 
the value of foreign currency‑ denominated working capital by 
£0.3 million compared to the foreign exchange rates applying 
at the beginning of the year.
Earnings per share
The basic and diluted earnings per share for the year was 7.0 pence 
(2016: 7.8 pence). Our adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 
was 13.6 pence (2016: 12.6 pence), an increase of 7.9%. 
Dividends
In May 2017 the Group paid an interim dividend of 1.35 pence 
per share. 
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 2.80 pence per share. 
Subject to approval at our Annual General Meeting of shareholders 
on 13 December 2017, the recommended final dividend will be 
paid on 18 December 2017 to shareholders who are on the 
register on 24 November 2017.

A N R A N R A N R A N R Governance Report
Volution Group plc
Annual Report 2017 48
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
introduce you to the Governance Report. 
This review and the reports of the Nomination, 
Audit and Remuneration Committees that 
follow summarise the Board’s activities 
during the year. 
The Board remains committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance as we believe this underpins the achievement 
of the Group’s strategy and also creates and maintains value for 
shareholders and other stakeholders. We make our decisions based 
on what we believe is likely to be for the benefit of shareholders and 
other stakeholders by promoting and maintaining the long-term 
success of the Company and its reputation.
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Our approach to governance is based on the concept that good 
corporate governance enhances longer-term shareholder value 
and sets the culture, ethics and values for the rest of the Group. 
Consistent with our belief in the importance of corporate governance, 
I am pleased to report that the Company has complied in full with 
the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code which was published in April 2016 (the Code). A copy of 
the Code can be found at www.frc.gov.uk. 
Composition of the Board
In August 2016 we welcomed Claire Tiney to the Board as an 
independent Non-Executive Director, bringing with her over 
20 years of board-level experience encompassing executive and 
non-executive roles in blue-chip retailing, property development 
and the services sector, across the UK and Continental Europe. 
After serving just under six years in office on the current and pre-IPO 
Board, Adrian Barden will be retiring from the Board at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 13 December 2017. 
Adrian provided important continuity on the Board whilst the 
business moved from private-equity ownership to a listed 
company and I would like to thank him for his contributions 
during his tenure. To ensure an orderly succession plan, the 
Nomination Committee has initiated a search for an independent 
Non-Executive Director and an announcement will be made in 
due course. 
Further information on these changes to the Board is set out 
in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 58 to 59.
Succession planning and diversity
This year we have continued to review Board and senior management 
succession planning. Although the Group has no specific gender 
and diversity targets as we believe that appointments should 
be based on merit, we strongly support diversity throughout 
the workforce. We believe that better business decisions can 
be made by having representation from different genders and 
cultural backgrounds with differing skill sets, experience and 
knowledge, which reflects our customer base and the wider 
population in our markets. Our recruitment of Claire Tiney has 
expanded the Board’s diversity by adding board-level experience 
across executive and non-executive roles in blue-chip retailing, 
property development and the services sector, across the UK 
and Continental Europe, in addition to improving gender diversity. 
Further information on the Group’s diversity and inclusion is 
provided on pages 38 to 39.
Introduction to Governance
High standards of governance.
The Board remains committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance as we believe this underpins the achievement 
of the Group’s strategy and also creates and maintains value for 
shareholders and other stakeholders.

Evaluating the Board’s effectiveness
Each year, the Board undertakes a formal evaluation of its 
effectiveness. This year, for the first time since the IPO in June 2014, 
we carried out an externally facilitated evaluation in accordance 
with the provisions of the Code. The results of the Board evaluation 
confirmed that the Board continues to function effectively and 
that there are no significant concerns among the Directors about 
its effectiveness. A number of actions were identified to further 
enhance the Board’s effectiveness and these can be found on 
page 55.
Appointment and re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Code Provisions and following performance 
evaluation of those Directors standing for re-election at the Annual 
General Meeting, I can confirm that they all continue to be effective, 
committed to their roles and have sufficient time available to perform 
their duties. Accordingly, as recommended by the Nomination 
Committee, all Directors, except Adrian Barden, will be offering 
themselves for re-election at the Company’ s Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 13 December 2017, in accordance with the Code. 
Further information on the Directors can be found in the Directors’ 
biographies on pages 46 to 47 and in the Directors’ Report on 
page 86.
Remuneration Policy review
During 2017 a review of Volution’s Remuneration Policy was 
completed and a revised Policy has been designed to operate 
for three years. The Policy is being proposed for approval by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 13 December 2017. 
Further details are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
which can be found on pages 67 to 84.
Annual General Meeting
I look forward to meeting any shareholders who can join us at our 
Annual General Meeting in December and extend my thanks to you 
all for your continued support as we look forward to the year ahead.

Strategy development, growing shareholder value, oversight and corporate governance

Note
Where a Director is not a member of the Committee, this is indicated as a dash. During the year, certain Directors who were not Committee members attended 
meetings of the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee by invitation. These details have not been included in the table.
Agendas for the Board meetings are set out at the beginning of the year and new items are added to this as and when appropriate. 
All Directors receive papers in advance of Board meetings. These include a business and market update report with updates from the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. Members of the Group’s Senior Management Team may also be invited to present 
at Board meetings as appropriate so that Non-Executive Directors keep abreast of developments in the Group. All Directors attended 
the Annual General Meeting in 2016. 
Board balance and independence
The Code recommends that at least half the board of directors 
of a UK listed company, excluding the chairman, should comprise 
non-executive directors determined by the Board to be independent 
in character and judgement and free from relationships or 
circumstances which may affect, or could appear to affect, the 
directors’ judgement. For the first two days of the financial year, 
the Company’s Board consisted of a Non-Executive Chairman, 
three independent Non-Executive Directors and two Executive 
Directors. On 3 August 2016 Claire Tiney was appointed to the 
Board as an independent Non-Executive Director. Accordingly, 
the Company’ s Board since then has consisted of a Non-Executive 
Chairman, four independent Non-Executive Directors and two 
Executive Directors. A list of the Directors is provided on pages 
46 to 47. Accordingly, the composition of the Board has remained 
in compliance with the Code throughout the financial year ended 
31 July 2017.
Appointment and tenure 
The appointment dates of Directors are shown in their 
biographies on pages 46 to 47. 
The Board believes that all Directors are effective and committed 
to their roles and have sufficient time available to perform their duties. 
Accordingly, all members of the Board, except for Adrian Barden, 
who is retiring from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting, will be offering themselves for re-election at the Company’ s 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 December 2017.
All of the Directors have service agreements or letters of 
appointment and the details of their terms are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 84. The service 
agreements and letters of appointment are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours. 
No other contract with the Company or any subsidiary undertaking 
of the Company in which any Director was materially interested 
subsisted during or at the end of the financial year other than the 
Relationship Agreement, further details of which can be found on 
page 86. Under the Relationship Agreement, Windmill Holdings B.V ., 
which was our controlling shareholder from listing until 8 April 2016, 
had the right to nominate one person to the Board of the Company 
for so long as its shareholding was at least 15% of the Company’s 
ordinary shares. This right expired when Windmill Holdings B.V. 
disposed of its remaining holding of ordinary shares in the Company 
on 31 October 2016, when the Relationship Agreement also ended.

Non-Executive Directors and independence
The independence of each Non-Executive Director is considered 
each year immediately prior to the signing of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. The Company’s Non-Executive Directors provide 
a broad range of skills and experience to the Board which assists 
both in their roles in formulating the Company’s strategy and 
in providing constructive challenge to the Executive Directors. 
All of the Non-Executive Directors are regarded by the Company 
as independent Non-Executive Directors within the meaning 
defined in the Code and free from any business or other 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgement.
From listing until 8 April 2016, the Group had a controlling 
shareholder, Windmill Holdings B.V. On 31 October 2016 
Windmill Holdings B.V. disposed of its remaining holding 
of ordinary shares in Volution Group and until that disposal, 
under a Relationship Agreement with the Company, had the 
right to nominate one person to be a Director of the Company. 
Their nominated Director from listing until 18 March 2016 was 
Gavin Chittick, and following his resignation, Windmill Holdings B.V . 
had no representative Director on the Board. 
Board evaluation and effectiveness
Since listing in June 2014, two internal Board and Committee 
performance evaluations have been conducted. The main 
recommendations from each of these evaluations were set out 
in the Annual Report and addressed during each year. During the 
2017 financial year, an external evaluation of the performance of 
the Board and its Committees was carried out. 
The process of evaluating the performance to identify areas for 
further development was undertaken by Lintstock Limited, under 
the direction of the Chairman. Lintstock is an independent specialist 
corporate governance consultancy which provides board evaluation 
services and has no other connection with the Company.
The evaluation process involved Lintstock engaging with the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary to discuss and agree the 
scope and to develop a series of comprehensive questionnaires 
tailored to the specific circumstances of the Company.
The evaluation took the form of web-based questionnaires 
addressing the composition and performance of the Board 
and its Committees, and the performance of the Chairman. 
Directors were required to score certain aspects of the Board’s 
and Committees’ performance, and to comment on the areas 
of focus, which included leadership and accountability, strategy 
and risk, Board culture, Board composition and roles and 
responsibilities. All respondents were then interviewed by 
Lintstock during which their responses to the questionnaire 
were reviewed. The anonymity of all respondents was ensured 
throughout the process in order to promote the open and frank 
exchange of views.
The responses to the evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
were collated and analysed by Lintstock and then reviewed by 
them with the Chairman and Company Secretary prior to being 
considered by the full Board. The Chairman also appraised the 
performance of individual Directors following feedback from 
Lintstock through the questionnaires.
The results of the evaluation demonstrated that the composition and 
performance of the Board and its Committees (and the performance 
of the Chairman) were rated highly and continue to operate effectively. 
Whilst there are no significant concerns among the Directors 
about the Board’s effectiveness, some detailed observations 
and recommendations were made which were considered by 
the Board. The key areas of recommendation set out in the 
report resulting in actions agreed by the Directors are set out 
below and will be monitored by the Board over the next year.
All Directors completed a web-based questionnaire 
developed by Lintstock, the Company Secretary, the 
Chairman and each Committee chair

2017 Board evaluation recommendations
 > Enhancing information to enable more in-depth Board focus on the strategic agenda, including Volution’s potential acquisition 
pipeline and growth opportunities, the industry, market dynamics and competition.
 > Ensuring the Non-Executive Directors could explore opportunities to further grow their understanding of the business, 
in particular as Volution’s presence in Continental Europe grows.
 > Devoting further Board time to discussions concerning talent management and Executive and Non-Executive succession 
planning, ensuring that the Board is exposed to the Senior Management Team and rising stars as part of the annual cycle 
of presentations and dinners.
 > Further enhancing the Board’s understanding of the new products being developed by the Group.
As a separate exercise the Senior Independent Director, together with the Non-Executive Directors, conducted the Chairman’s 
performance evaluation. It was agreed that Peter Hill gave appropriate time and commitment to his role as Chairman of the Company 
and was effective in that role throughout the year. The Senior Independent Director then discussed the results with the Chairman at a 
separate one-to-one meeting.
Director induction
A formal induction programme has been developed in line with 
the Code, to ensure that any new Director receives an appropriate 
induction to the Group with the support of the Company Secretary. 
The programme covers, amongst other things, the operation and 
activities of the Group (including site visits and meeting members 
of the Senior Management Team); the Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties; the role of the Board and the decision-making 
matters reserved to it; the responsibilities of the Board Committees; 
the strategic challenges and opportunities facing the Group; and 
the opportunity to meet the Company’s main advisers. Following 
the appointment of Claire Tiney to the Board in August 2016, a 
personalised formal induction programme was developed tailored 
to her experience and background and to her own requirements. 
Any newly appointed Non-Executive Director would also have a 
personalised formal induction programme created for them. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest 
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they 
have or may have interests that conflict with those of the Company, 
unless that conflict is first authorised by the Board. This includes 
potential conflicts that may arise when a Director takes up a position 
with another company. The Company’s Articles of Association 
allow the Board to authorise such potential conflicts, and there 
is in place a procedure to deal with any actual or potential conflict 
of interest. The Board deals with each appointment on its individual 
merit and takes into consideration all the circumstances. All potential 
conflicts approved by the Board are recorded in a conflicts of 
interest register, which will be reviewed by the Board on a regular 
basis to ensure that the procedure is working effectively.
External directorships 
The Board allows Executive Directors to accept one external 
commercial non-executive director appointment provided the 
commitment is compatible with their duties as an Executive 
Director. The Executive Director concerned may retain fees paid 
for these services which will be subject to approval by the Board. 
Currently, neither of the Executive Directors holds an external 
directorship. Details of all Directors’ significant directorships can 
be found in their biographies on pages 46 to 47.
Where Non-Executive Directors have external directorships, the 
Board is comfortable that these do not impact on the time that 
any Director devotes to the Company and we believe that this 
experience only enhances the capability of the Board.
Information and support available to Directors
All Board Directors have access to the Company Secretary, 
who advises them on governance matters. The Chairman and 
the Company Secretary work together to ensure that Board papers 
are clear, accurate, delivered in a timely manner to Directors, and 
of sufficient quality to enable the Board to discharge its duties. 
Specific business-related presentations are given by senior 
management when appropriate. As well as the support of the 
Company Secretary, there is a procedure in place for any Director 
to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense 
in the furtherance of their duties, where considered necessary. 
Deloitte LLP advises on remuneration matters, Ernst & Young LLP 
on external audit matters and BDO LLP on internal audit matters.
Internal control and risk management
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for determining the 
nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives, and for the Group’s system of 
internal control. The principal risks facing the Group are set out in 
the Strategic Report on pages 34 to 37, being those risks which 
could threaten our business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity and mitigation measures are detailed against each risk. 
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, carried out a review 
of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and system 
of internal control together with a robust assessment of the risks 
facing the Group. Details can be found on page 65.
The Audit Committee Report on pages 60 to 66 describes the 
system of internal control and how it is managed and monitored. 
The Board acknowledges that such a system is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. Governance Report
Volution Group plc
Annual Report 2017 57
Whistleblowing 
An external independent whistleblowing facility is available to 
enable employees to report any concerns which they feel need to 
be brought to the attention of management concerning any possible 
impropriety, financial or otherwise, and the appropriateness of the 
facility is reviewed by the Audit Committee. The Group believes 
that it is important to have a culture of openness and accountability 
in order to prevent such situations occurring or to address them 
when they do occur.
Shareholder engagement 
Responsibility for shareholder relations rests with the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. They 
ensure that there is effective communication with shareholders 
on matters such as governance and strategy, and are responsible 
for ensuring that the Board understands the views of major 
shareholders. The Board aims to present a balanced and clear 
view of the Group in communications with shareholders and 
believes that being transparent in describing how we see the 
market and the prospects for the business is extremely important.
We have communicated with existing and potential shareholders 
in a number of different ways during the year as follows:
August 2016 Trading Update
Consultation on remuneration with major 
shareholders and principal investor 
advisory groups
October 2016 Full Year Results Announcement and  
analyst presentation
Institutional broker sales desk briefings
UK shareholder roadshow
November 2016 Annual Report and Accounts and Notice 
of AGM posted to shareholders and placed 
on website
December 2016 Annual General Meeting
March 2017 Half-year Results Announcement and 
analyst presentation
Institutional broker sales desk briefings
UK shareholder roadshow
US shareholder roadshow
In addition to the above, we communicate with existing and 
potential shareholders in a number of other ways, such as:
 > one-to-one meetings and telephone briefings for analysts 
and investors; and
 > periodic visits to the business sites to give analysts and major 
shareholders a better understanding of how we manage our 
business. These visits and meetings are principally undertaken 
by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and 
other members of the Senior Management Team.
In the above situations, any material presented is also uploaded 
to the Company’s website so it is available to all shareholders.
The Board receives regular updates on the views of its shareholders 
from the Chief Executive Officer and Company brokers. This is 
a standing agenda item for all Board meetings. In addition, the 
Senior Independent Director is available to meet shareholders 
if they wish to raise issues separately from the arrangements 
as described above.
The Company’s investor website is also regularly updated with 
news and information including this Annual Report and Accounts, 
which sets out our strategy and performance together with our 
plans for future growth.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board recognises its duty to ensure that the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the performance, strategy and business model of the Company.
The Board has placed reliance on the following to form this opinion:
 > a verification process dealing with the factual content of the 
reports and to ensure consistency across the various sections;
 > a review of the Annual Report and Accounts by senior 
management to ensure consistency and overall balance; and
 > the Audit Committee reviewed the Annual Report and Accounts 
and its compliance with the requirements, concluded that they 
had been met and recommended its approval by the Board as 
fair, balanced and understandable.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company will take 
place at 12.00 noon on Wednesday 13 December 2017 at the 
offices of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP , 3 More London Riverside, 
London SE1 2AQ, United Kingdom. All shareholders have the 
opportunity to attend and vote, in person or by proxy, at the AGM. 
The Notice of AGM can be found in a circular which is being 
posted at the same time as this Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Notice of AGM sets out the business of the meeting and 
explanatory notes on all resolutions. Separate resolutions are 
proposed in respect of each substantive issue. The Chairman 
and all Directors will be present at the AGM and will be available 
to answer shareholders’ questions. Governance Report

Nomination Committee Report
Dear shareholder,
As chairman of the Nomination Committee, 
I present our report detailing the role and 
responsibilities of the Committee and its 
activities during the year. 
Role and responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are: 
 > assessing whether the size, structure and composition of the 
Board (including its skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) 
continue to meet the Group’s business and strategic needs;
 > examining succession planning for Directors and other senior 
executives and, in particular, for the key roles of Chairman of 
the Board and Chief Executive Officer, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Group and the future 
skills and expertise needed on the Board; and 
 > identifying and nominating, for approval by the Board, 
candidates to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise 
together with leading the process for such appointments.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available 
on the Company’s website at www.volutiongroupplc.com.
Membership and attendance
The Code recommends that a majority of the members of a 
nomination committee should be independent non-executive 
directors. As the Committee is chaired by me, and its other 
members are Adrian Barden, Paul Hollingworth, Tony Reading 
and Claire Tiney, all of whom are independent Non-Executive 
Directors, the Company complies with this Code recommendation. 
Claire Tiney was appointed to the Board and as a Committee 
member on 3 August 2016 and Adrian Barden will retire from 
the Board and the Committee at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting on 13 December 2017. 
By invitation, the meetings of the Committee may be attended 
by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 
The Chairman of the Board normally chairs the Committee except 
where it is dealing with his own re-appointment or replacement. 
The Company Secretary acts as the Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met three times during the year with attendance 
disclosed on page 54. The Committee will meet formally at least 
once a year and at such other times as the Board or the Committee 
chairman requires.
Board composition
In March 2016, Gavin Chittick, our non-independent Non-Executive 
Director, stepped down from the Board. This led to a search for 
an additional independent Non-Executive Director which was led 
by an independent external search firm, Ingenium. Following due 
process, which was set out in the Nomination Committee Report 
2016, the Committee recommended the preferred candidate 
to the Board and on 3 August 2016, Claire Tiney was appointed 
to the Board. Claire is a highly experienced director with over 
20 years’ experience of board-level roles encompassing executive 
and non-executive positions in blue-chip retailing and property

development companies and in the services sector, across the 
UK and Continental Europe. Combined with the deep knowledge 
and experience of our existing Non-Executive Directors, Claire’s 
experience ensures that the Board has a well-balanced array of 
skills and is well attuned to the Group’s requirements.
I would like to extend my thanks to Adrian Barden, who will be 
retiring from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual General 
Meeting on 13 December 2017 after serving just under six years 
in office on the current and pre-IPO Board. Adrian provided 
important continuity on the Board whilst the business moved 
from private-equity ownership to a listed company and I would 
like to thank him for his contributions during his tenure. To ensure 
an orderly succession plan, the Committee has initiated a search 
for an independent Non-Executive Director and an announcement 
will be made in due course. 
Board diversity
Volution believes that diversity throughout the business is important 
in order to reflect the varied nature of the communities that it 
operates in and its customer base. The Board continues to be 
supportive of the need for diversity of its members to provide the 
necessary range of background, experience, values and diversity 
of thinking and perspectives to optimise the decision-making 
process. The recent reports by the Parker Review Committee on 
the ethnic diversity of UK boards, the Hampton-Alexander Review, 
focused on senior women below the company board, and the 
McGregor-Smith Review by Baroness McGregor-Smith, considering 
the issues affecting black and minority ethnic groups in the workplace, 
have also been noted. Gender and ethnicity are important aspects 
of diversity which the Chairman and the Committee will consider 
when deciding upon the most appropriate composition of the 
Board including Executive Director succession planning.
Appointments to the Board are always made on merit against 
objective criteria, having regard to the benefits of all forms of 
diversity, including gender diversity and the current and future 
needs of the business. The Board has not set any specific gender 
or diversity targets. When identifying candidates for appointment 
to the Board, any search firm engaged will be instructed to include 
gender diversity and a range of diverse backgrounds and capabilities 
in formulating a long-list of candidates.
Following the appointment to the Board during the year of Claire 
Tiney as an independent Non-Executive Director, I am pleased to 
report that the Company is now progressing towards the voluntary 
gender diversity target set in the Lord Davies Report published 
in October 2015. The Board’s continued commitment towards 
achievement of the voluntary target will form part of the considerations 
in the decision to appoint any new Directors to the Board as and 
when existing members step down from the Board.
Re-election of Directors
On the recommendation of the Committee and in line with the 
Code and the Company’s Articles of Association, all of the 
Company’s Directors, except for Adrian Barden, will stand for 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting 2017. The biographical 
details of the Directors can be found on pages 46 to 47. The 
Committee considers that the performance of each of the Directors 
standing for re-election at the Annual General Meeting continues to 
be effective and each demonstrates commitment to their role.
Committee performance evaluation
During the year, the Board appointed an independent specialist 
corporate governance consultancy, Lintstock, to conduct a formal 
externally facilitated evaluation of the performance of the Board, 
its Committees, the Directors and the Chairman in compliance 
with the Code. Further details can be found in the Governance 
Report on page 55. I am pleased to confirm that this process 
concluded that the Committee had fulfilled its role effectively and 
did not identify any significant development points requiring action.
I look forward to meeting with shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting in December to answer any questions on the work of 
the Committee.
Peter Hill, CBE
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
10 October 2017
Nomination Committee activities during the year
The following matters were considered at the Committee meetings held during the year:
 > evaluated the size and composition of the Board including the balance of skills, experience, independence, diversity 
and knowledge on the Board;
 > commenced a process to find a new independent Non-Executive Director;
 > reviewed succession planning for the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Team;
 > considered the re-appointment of those Directors appointed at IPO in June 2014; 
 > reviewed and approved the recommendations to be made to shareholders for the re-election of Directors at the 
Annual General Meeting; 
 > reviewed the results of the Committee performance evaluation; and 
 > reviewed the Committee’s report in the Annual Report and Accounts and recommended approval to the Board.
After the year end, the Committee considered the outcome of the performance evaluations when discussing the effectiveness 
of the Non-Executive Directors seeking re-election at the Annual General Meeting 2017.  Governance Report

Audit Committee Report
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Audit Committee 
Report for the year ended 31 July 2017, which 
outlines the activities of the Committee 
during the year. 
During the year, the Committee’s focus has, as in previous years, 
centred on the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting and 
ensuring an effective system of risk management and internal 
controls is in place. The Committee has continued to follow a 
detailed programme of work and to respond to the increasing 
depth of review and reporting that is now required of audit 
committees. The Committee can also confirm, on behalf of the 
Board, that the Annual Report and Accounts 2017, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable.
The Committee members have been selected to provide the wide 
range of financial and commercial expertise necessary to fulfil the 
Committee’s duties and responsibilities and the Board considers 
the Committee members’ financial experience to be recent and 
relevant for the purposes of the 2016 edition of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code). Further, in accordance with the 
Code, the Board has determined that the current composition 
of the Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the 
sector in which the Group operates. Claire Tiney was appointed 
to the Board and as a Committee member on 3 August 2016 and 
Adrian Barden will retire from the Board and the Committee at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 13 December 2017. 
BDO LLP (BDO) has continued to perform the internal audit 
function on behalf of the Group in accordance with an agreed 
strategic internal audit plan. This plan continues to provide the 
Committee with a means of assessing the level and effectiveness 
of controls across the Group. In addition, the Committee reviews 
the results of a biannual internal assessment of internal controls 
carried out by management across all businesses. During the 
financial year ending 31 July 2018, the Committee will continue 
to look in detail at the Group’s business operations, with a number 
of internal audits planned to take place during the period, with 
particular focus on recent acquisitions. These will cover internal 
control and compliance areas and be undertaken across 
functions in the UK and European business units.

Andy Glover, having completed five years as lead audit partner, 
and in line with FRC’s partner rotation policy, will be replaced 
by Andy Smyth on completion of the 2017 financial year audit. 
On behalf of the Committee I would like to mark our appreciation 
of the work completed by Andy Glover as lead audit partner over 
the last five years, especially during the period when Volution 
transitioned from a private-equity owned business to a listed 
company. Andy Smyth has over 25 years of audit and accounting 
advisory experience with EY and has spent the last nine years as 
a partner reporting on listed multinational businesses across a 
number of industry sectors. I would like to welcome Andy Smyth 
and on behalf of the Committee we look forward to working 
with him.
On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank everyone for 
their hard work over the past year, especially the finance teams 
across the businesses.
I look forward to meeting with shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting to answer any questions on the work of the Committee.

Membership and attendance
The Code recommends that all members of an audit committee be 
non-executive directors, independent in character and judgement 
and free from any relationship or circumstance which may, could 
or would be likely to, or appear to, affect their judgement and that 
one such member has recent and relevant financial experience. 
Accordingly, the Committee comprises four members who are 
independent Non-Executive Directors, Paul Hollingworth as 
Committee chairman, considered by the Board to have recent 
and relevant financial and accounting experience, Tony Reading, 
Adrian Barden and Claire Tiney. All members have a sufficiently 
wide range of business experience and expertise such that the 
Committee can fulfil its responsibilities. Biographies of all 
Committee members can be found on pages 46 to 47. As such, 
the Committee complies with the Code recommendations.
Regular Committee meetings are also normally attended by the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, 
the external auditor, the internal auditor and the Company Secretary, 
who acts as secretary to the Committee. Other members of 
management are invited to attend depending on the matters 
under discussion. The Committee meets regularly with the 
external auditor with no members of management present. 
Meetings are scheduled in accordance with the financial and 
reporting cycles of the Company and generally take place prior 
to Board meetings to ensure effectiveness of the collaboration 
with the Board.
Members and their attendance at meetings during the year are 
set out in the Governance Report on page 54.
The Committee has independent access to BDO, the internal 
auditor, and to EY, the external auditor. BDO and EY have direct 
access to the Chairman of the Committee outside formal 
Committee meetings.
Minutes of each Committee meeting are provided to Board members.
Role and responsibilities 
The primary function of the Committee is to assist the Board 
in fulfilling its responsibilities with regard to the integrity of 
financial reporting, audit, risk management and internal controls. 
This comprises:
 > monitoring and reviewing the Group’s accounting policies, 
practices and significant accounting judgements; 
 > reviewing the annual and half-yearly financial statements and 
any public financial announcements and advising the Board 
on whether the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced 
and understandable;
 > approving the appointment and recommending the 
re-appointment of the external auditor and its terms 
of engagement and fees;
 > considering the scope of work to be undertaken by the 
external auditor and reviewing the results of that work; 
 > reviewing and monitoring the independence of the external 
auditor and approving its provision of non-audit services;
 > monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the external auditor;
 > monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’ s internal 
audit function, and resolution of its material findings, in the 
context of the Group’s overall risk management systems;
 > overseeing the Group’s procedures for its employees to raise 
concerns through its whistleblowing policy as set out in the 
Code of Conduct;
 > monitoring and reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the risk management systems and processes; and
 > assessing and advising the Board on the internal financial, 
operational and compliance controls. Governance Report

Significant accounting matters
In reviewing the financial statements with management and the external auditor, the Committee discussed and debated the critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty. As a result of its review, the Committee identified the following 
issues that required particular judgement or had significant impact on interpretation of this Annual Report and Accounts 2017:
Area of focus Why was this significant? How did the Committee address this area?
Impairment of 
goodwill and 
other intangible 
assets
The Group’s policies on accounting for separately 
acquired intangible assets and goodwill on acquired 
businesses is set out in notes 13 and 14 to the 
consolidated financial statements. At 31 July 2017 
intangible assets relating to goodwill and other 
intangible assets amounted to £182.6 million. 
Goodwill on acquisitions and acquired intangible 
assets, which are judged to have indefinite lives, 
are initially recorded at fair value, and are subject 
to testing for impairment at each balance sheet 
date. For intangible assets amortised over finite 
lives the Group is required to determine whether 
indicators of impairment exist and, if so, perform 
a full impairment review. As is customary, such 
testing involves estimation of the future cash flows 
attributable to the asset, or cash generating unit 
of which it is part, and discounting these future 
cash flows to today’s value.
The Committee has reviewed the key assumptions 
behind these valuations and impairment reviews, 
notably the expected development of future cash flows 
and the discount rates used, as well as considering 
reasonable sensitivities to these estimates and 
concluded that these support the carrying values 
set out in note 15 to the consolidated financial 
statements and no impairment provision is required.
The Committee has also reviewed the allocation of 
goodwill and other intangible assets to the appropriate 
cash generating units (CGUs) and the level of CGUs  
at which the impairment testing is completed and 
considers it reasonable.
Rebates payable 
and receivable
The Group has a number of customer and supplier 
rebate agreements that are recognised as a reduction 
from sales or a reduction of cost of sales as appropriate 
(collectively referred to as rebates). Rebates are 
based on an agreed percentage of revenue or 
purchases, which will increase with the level of 
revenue achieved or purchases made. These 
agreements typically run to a different reporting 
period to that of the Group with some of the amounts 
payable and receivable being subject to confirmation 
after the reporting date. At the reporting date, 
management makes estimates of the amount of 
rebate that will become both payable by and due 
to the Group under these agreements based upon 
their best estimates of volumes and product mix 
that will be bought or sold over each individual 
rebate agreement period. 
The Committee received a paper from management 
setting out the process for estimating the amount 
of rebates to be recognised and considered the 
operating effectiveness of controls surrounding 
revenue recognition and management’s subjective 
assessment and recognition of rebates at the 
interim and year end. The Committee reviewed 
management’s methodology and judgement 
in assessing the recognition of rebates. 
The Committee concurred with their approach.
Exceptional items Exceptional items on a pre-tax basis of £1.4 million 
(2016: £1.2 million) represent a material item in the 
profit and loss account. Full details are set out in 
note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Included in this year’s results is a charge of 
£0.8 million relating to the costs associated with 
acquisitions (2016: £1.2 million) and factory 
relocation £0.6 million (2016: £nil).
The Committee reviewed the inclusion of costs shown 
as re-organisation and acquisition costs by virtue 
of their size, nature or occurrence, and received 
updates on the level and nature of these costs. 
In particular, exceptional costs relating to the 
consolidation of two UK production facilities in 
Reading and Slough into one new site in Reading 
were reviewed. The Committee believes that the 
treatment of re-organisation costs and costs 
associated with acquisitions has been applied 
consistently, and that separate disclosure enables 
the reader more clearly to understand the headline 
financial and operating performance of the Group.
In addition, the Committee reviewed policy and provisions with respect to warranty, doubtful debts and inventory. Audit Committee Report continued

External audit
EY was appointed as external auditor for the financial year 
commencing 1 August 2012 following a competitive tendering 
process. There are no contractual obligations restricting the 
Committee’s choice of external auditor. 
The lead partner during the 2017 financial year was Andy Glover, 
whose appointment in this role also commenced with the audit 
for the financial year ended 31 July 2013. Andy Glover had no 
previous involvement with the Group in any capacity. In accordance 
with current professional standards, the external auditor is required 
to change the lead audit partner every five years in order to protect 
auditor independence and objectivity. Accordingly, Andy Glover 
acted as lead audit partner until the 2017 financial year audit was 
completed, following which a new lead audit partner, Andy Smyth, 
was formally appointed. In preparation for the role, Andy Smyth 
shadowed Andy Glover during the 2017 financial year audit. 
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of EY and the 
external audit process using a checklist and questionnaire 
issued to senior management across the Group and involvement 
of senior management in the detailed stages of the audit process. 
A summary of the findings was prepared for consideration by 
the Committee at its October 2017 meeting. The Committee 
was satisfied with EY’s performance, the external audit process 
and that it had employed an appropriate level of professional 
challenge in fulfilling its role. There were no significant findings 
from the evaluation process. 
The Committee has reviewed the tendering and rotation provisions 
in the EU Audit Directive and Regulation and the Companies Act 
2006, which state that there should be a public tender every 
ten years and a change of external auditor at least every 20 years. 
The Company is not obliged to tender for audit services until 
2024 (ten years from listing). These provisions, together with the 
satisfactory outcome of the evaluation of EY and the external 
audit process, have led the Committee to conclude that there 
is no current intention of placing the external audit out to tender 
during the next financial year, subject to any other changes 
to the regulatory regime and continued satisfaction with the 
effectiveness of the auditor, which is evaluated annually. 
Accordingly, the Committee recommended to the Board that 
a resolution to re-appoint EY be proposed to shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting in December 2017 and the Board 
accepted and endorsed this recommendation.
The Committee confirms compliance with the provisions of the 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, as published by the 
UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA Order). In addition, 
the Committee confirms that, at the appropriate time, it will put 
the external audit out to tender to meet the requirements under 
the CMA Order.
The Committee routinely meets EY without executive 
management present. 
Non-audit services 
The Group’s external auditor may also be used to provide 
specialist advice where, as a result of its position as auditor, 
it is best placed to perform the work in question. The Committee 
agrees the fees paid to the external auditor for its services as 
auditor and a formal policy is in place in relation to the provision 
of non-audit services by the external auditor to ensure that there 
is adequate protection of its independence and objectivity. 
The policy is in line with the new EU Audit Directive and 
Regulation which states that the total non-audit fees for any 
financial year should not exceed 70% of the average of the 
external audit fee over the last three financial years. 
During the year, EY charged the Group £25,000 (2016: £25,000) 
for non-audit services relating to the half-year review, which 
represents 8.3% of the average of the external audit fee over the 
last three financial years, significantly below the 70% cap set by 
the EU Audit Directive and Regulation. A breakdown of the fees 
paid to EY during the year is set out in note 9 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
It is the Company’s practice that for any new non-audit services 
it will seek quotes from other firms, and, if appropriate, from EY, 
before work on non-audit projects is awarded. Contracts are 
awarded to our suppliers based on individual merits.
The Committee is satisfied that the overall levels of audit-related 
and non-audit fees are not material relative to the income of the 
office of EY conducting the audit or EY as a whole and therefore 
the objectivity and independence of the external auditor was 
not compromised.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the effectiveness of the Group’ s system 
of internal control, which has been designed and implemented 
to meet the particular requirements of the Group and the risks 
to which it is exposed. Details can be found below on the Group’s 
internal control environment, how risk is managed and the Committee’ s 
review of the effectiveness of the risk management and internal 
control systems. Governance Report
Volution Group plc
Annual Report 2017 65
Internal control environment
The following key elements comprise the internal control environment 
which has been designed to identify, evaluate and manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risks faced by the Group in seeking to achieve 
its business objectives and ensure accurate and timely reporting 
of financial data for the Company and the Group:
 > an appropriate organisational structure with clear lines 
of responsibility;
 > an experienced and qualified finance function which regularly 
assesses the possible financial impact of the risks facing 
the Group;
 > a comprehensive annual strategic and business planning process;
 > systems of control procedures and delegated authorities 
which operate within defined guidelines, and approval limits 
for capital and operating expenditure and other key business 
transactions and decisions;
 > a robust financial control, budgeting and rolling forecast 
system, which includes regular monitoring, variance analysis, 
key performance indicator reviews and risk and opportunity 
assessments at Board level;
 > procedures by which the consolidated financial statements are 
prepared, which are monitored and maintained through the 
use of internal control frameworks addressing key financial 
reporting risks arising from changes in the business or 
accounting standards;
 > established policies and procedures setting out expected 
standards of integrity and ethical standards which reinforce 
the need for all employees to adhere to all legal and 
regulatory requirements;
 > an annual compliance checklist; and
 > BDO acting as the internal auditor.
Following initial appointment during the financial year ended 
31 July 2015, BDO has continued to act in the capacity of internal 
auditor. The Committee agreed the BDO internal audit plan prior 
to the commencement of the last financial year. The plan was 
approved to ensure that there was appropriate coverage of the 
internal control environment, strategic priorities and key risks 
identified by the Board. At each Committee meeting, BDO gives 
an update on the progress of the internal audit plan, which is 
reviewed to ensure that it is in line with the Committee’ s expectations.
During the year, the internal audit plan was amended so that 
additional areas were added to the plan based on the changes 
that gave rise to increased levels of risk. These changes to the 
agreed audit plan were approved by the Committee. Given the 
acquisitions that were made during the year and the growth 
of the Group, the Committee spent time ensuring that an 
appropriate level of coverage was in place, including reviewing 
the control environment in recently acquired companies.
How we manage risk
As outlined on page 32, the Group has a risk management 
process that follows a sequence of risk identification, assessment 
of probability and impact, and assigns an owner to manage mitigation 
activities at the operation level. Each business unit operates a 
process to ensure that key risks are identified, evaluated, managed 
and reviewed appropriately. This process is also applied at Board 
level to major business decisions such as acquisitions. The business 
unit risk registers form the basis for the Group Risk Register, which 
is maintained for all corporate risks and is monitored by senior 
management and reviewed by the Committee. Throughout the 
year, the Group Risk Register and the methodology applied was 
the subject of review by senior management and updated to 
reflect new and developing areas which might impact business 
strategy. The Committee reviews the Group Risk Register at least 
twice a year and assesses the actions being taken by senior 
management to monitor and mitigate the risks. 
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, the areas which 
they impact and how they are mitigated are described on pages 
34 to 37.
Review of effectiveness
Provision C.2.3 of the Code states that the Board should monitor 
the Company’s risk management and internal control systems 
and, at least annually, carry out a review of their effectiveness.
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews the effectiveness 
of risk management and internal control systems on an ongoing 
basis. Following advice from the Committee, the Board is satisfied 
that an effective system of internal controls and risk management 
is in place which enables the Group to identify, evaluate and 
manage key risks and which accords with the FRC’s Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting document issued in September 2014. This 
process was in place throughout the year and post year end up 
to the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts. Audit Committee Report continued

Code of Conduct, anti-bribery and whistleblowing
The Group is committed to providing a safe and confidential 
avenue for all employees across the Group to raise concerns 
about serious wrongdoings. The Group also acknowledges the 
requirements of the Code in this area, which states that the 
Committee should review arrangements by which employees 
across the Group may, in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other 
matters and ensuring that these concerns are investigated and 
escalated as appropriate. 
The Company has a Group-wide Code of Conduct and Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption Policy. These policies set out clearly the Group’s 
values and the importance that is placed on honest, ethical and 
lawful conduct in all business dealings. The Code of Conduct 
was updated at the beginning of the financial year to address 
the Group’s policy on anti-slavery and human trafficking, in 
accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Group employees, 
agents and suppliers are asked, where relevant, to confirm that 
they do and will continue to comply with these policies. A gifts 
and hospitality register is operated by each business unit to 
ensure transparency where items are over a certain monetary 
threshold. In addition, all employees who are considered the 
most likely to be exposed to bribery and corruption are given 
web-based anti-bribery and corruption training. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the arrangements by 
which employees are able to raise, in confidence, any concerns 
they may have about possible wrongdoing or dishonest or 
unethical behaviour, such as bribery, corruption, fraud, dishonesty 
and illegal practices. An external independent whistleblowing 
provider provides a confidential web-based, email and telephone 
facility which has been communicated across the Group, branded 
as “Speak Up”, to ensure awareness. The Code of Conduct protects 
anyone who comes forward to make a disclosure under the 
Whistleblowing Policy. When a disclosure is made, the Company 
Secretary initiates an investigation to include all necessary parties 
to ensure the matter is appropriately resolved. A report on any 
investigations is submitted to the Committee to ensure it is 
satisfied that such matters have been resolved satisfactorily. 
The Committee also has the power to conduct further enquiries 
itself or any other additional actions it sees fit.
Committee performance evaluation
During the year, the Board appointed an independent specialist 
corporate governance consultancy, Lintstock, to conduct a formal 
externally facilitated evaluation of the performance of the Board, 
its Committees, the Directors and the Chairman in compliance 
with the Code. Further details can be found in the Governance 
Report on page 55. I am pleased to confirm that this process 
concluded that the Committee had fulfilled its role effectively and 
did not identify any significant development points requiring action. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Board has responsibility under the Code for preparing the 
Company’s Annual Report and Accounts, ensuring that it presents 
a fair, balanced and understandable (FBU) assessment of the 
Group’s position and prospects and that it provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. 
The review of the Annual Report and Accounts took the form of 
a detailed assessment of the collaborative drafting process, which 
involves the Board members, the Senior Management Team, 
Group Finance, the Company Secretary and Group Marketing, 
with guidance and input from external advisers. It ensured that 
there is a clear and unified link between this Annual Report and 
Accounts and the Group’s other external reporting, and between 
the three main sections of the Annual Report and Accounts – 
the Strategic Report; the Governance Report; and the Financial 
Statements. In addition, the Committee receives a report highlighting 
areas for FBU consideration to ensure compliance before approval 
of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
In particular, the Committee:
 > reviewed all material matters, as reported elsewhere in this 
Annual Report and Accounts;
 > ensured that it fairly reflected the Group’s performance in the 
reporting year;
 > ensured that it reflected the Group’ s business model and strategy;
 > ensured that it presented a consistent message throughout; and
 > considered whether it presented the information in a clear and 
concise manner, illustrated by appropriate KPIs, to facilitate 
shareholders’ access to relevant information.
A summary of the process, and of the Committee’s findings, 
was considered by the Board at its meeting in October 2017. 
The outcome of that review was that the Committee confirmed 
to the Board that the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 met 
the requirements of the Code and the Board’s formal statement 
to that effect is set out on page 50.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 July 2017. 
At the Annual General Meeting in December 2016 (2016 AGM), 
the Annual Report on Remuneration received strong support from 
shareholders with just under 100% of the votes cast being in favour 
of the resolution.
Our Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting in 2014 (2014 AGM) and we continued 
to operate under this during the year under review. We are seeking 
approval to renew the Remuneration Policy at the Annual General 
Meeting 2017 (2017 AGM), in line with the required three-year cycle.
Review of remuneration arrangements
During the year, the Committee reviewed the Remuneration Policy 
and the implementation of the Policy to ensure they remained 
appropriate going forward and continued to appropriately support 
our remuneration principles, which are to:
 > attract and retain the best talent;
 > drive behaviours that support the Group’s strategy and 
business objectives which are developed in the long-term 
interests of the Company and its shareholders;
 > reward senior management appropriately for their personal 
and collective achievements; 
 > provide incentives that help to maintain commitment over the 
longer term and align the interests of senior management with 
those of shareholders; and
 > ensure that a significant percentage of the overall package of 
the Executive Directors and senior management remains at 
risk dependent on performance, and that their pay and 
benefits adequately take account of reward versus risk.
As part of this, the Committee also reviewed total remuneration 
as a whole. When Volution listed in 2014, the remuneration 
packages for the Executive Directors were set conservatively 
to reflect Volution’s status as a newly listed company. Over the 
period since IPO, Volution has smoothly transitioned from a 
private company to an established public company, and the 
CEO and CFO have developed into the role of Executive Directors 
of a listed company.
The Remuneration Policy has been updated (see pages 69 to 75 
for more detail) to incorporate a number of best practice features 
and to further align the Executive Directors with shareholders. 
These changes include:
 > increase to the annual bonus deferral requirements –  
one-third of the total bonus will now be deferred into shares;
 > increase to the share ownership guidelines –  
increased to 200% of salary; 
 > more stringent malus and clawback provisions – 
clawback extended to the cash part of the annual bonus; and

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Review of remuneration arrangements continued
 > holding period incorporated –  
the Policy has been updated to reflect the introduction of the 
two-year holding period under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) which was introduced for 2016/17 LTIP grants.
As part of the Policy review, the Committee discussed the variable 
incentive limits, as set out in the Policy, in light of the performance 
of the Group since IPO and the strategic priorities of the business 
going forward. Taking this into account, the Committee believes 
an increase to the maximum bonus opportunity to 150% of salary 
(from 100% of salary), along with the best practice features set 
out above, is appropriate. Whilst the maximum bonus opportunity 
permissible under the proposed Policy will be increased from 100% 
to 150% of salary, it is the Committee’s intention that the total 
variable pay (annual bonus plus LTIP) maximum opportunity will 
remain the same at 275% of salary, as it is in the previous Policy. 
These changes will provide the Committee with flexibility to change 
the annual bonus and LTIP balance, if appropriate, subject to an 
overall maximum of 275% of salary.
Performance in 2016/17 and remuneration outcomes
It has been another strong year for Volution Group. Adjusted 
operating profit, adjusted EPS, working capital management 
and Group employee retention were the key measures used 
by the Committee to measure performance towards achieving 
the Group’s strategic objectives and, accordingly, were the 
performance measures used in the Annual Bonus Plan (ABP). 
Performance against these measures resulted in the Committee 
awarding an annual bonus of 87.8% of salary to Ronnie George 
and 87.8% of salary to Ian Dew. We have provided full retrospective 
disclosure of the ABP targets as well as the actual performance 
against them. In accordance with the existing Remuneration Policy, 
50% of the annual bonus payment above the target incentive (which 
was 60% of the maximum opportunity) has been deferred into 
awards over the Company’s shares which will vest after three 
years. Further details can be found on page 79.
The 2014 LTIP award, being the first grant after our IPO, had a 
performance period ending on 31 July 2017 and is due to vest 
in October 2017. Due to strong EPS growth and total shareholder 
return performance over the period, the 2014 LTIP awards will 
vest at 72% of maximum for both Ronnie George and Ian Dew. 
Further details can be found on page 78.
Remuneration decisions for 2017/18
As part of the review of remuneration arrangements set out above, 
we assessed the base salaries of the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Chief Financial Officer. The Committee determined that they 
should both be awarded an increase in base salary in line with the 
wider workforce equal to 2% with effect from 1 August 2017.
Since listing in June 2014, the Company has grown in complexity, 
successfully completed seven important acquisitions and delivered 
strong financial results. To ensure the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer are incentivised to continue the successful 
execution of the Group strategy and ensure continued strong 
financial results, as well as taking into account the development 
and performance of the CEO and the CFO as Executive Directors 
of a listed company, the Committee is proposing an increase 
to the 2017/18 maximum annual bonus opportunity and to the 
2017/18 LTIP award, in line with the Remuneration Policy being 
put forward at the 2017 AGM. These changes are in addition 
to the best practice features that have also been introduced. 
The Chief Executive Officer’s maximum annual bonus opportunity 
for 2017/18 will be 125% of base salary, with one-third to be deferred 
into shares to be held for at least two years after payment. 
The CEO’s award of shares under the LTIP will be 150% of base 
salary and the two-year holding period following the end of the 
three-year performance period will apply as it did last year. 
The Chief Financial Officer’s maximum annual bonus opportunity 
for 2017/18 will be 125% of base salary with one-third to be 
deferred into shares to be held for at least two years after payment. 
The CFO’s award of shares under the LTIP will be 125% of base 
salary and the two-year holding period following the end of the 
three-year performance period will apply as it did last year.
The Committee is mindful of the fact that the fixed elements 
of the remuneration package remain conservatively positioned 
against the market – however, we are of the view that greater 
emphasis should be given to the variable pay arrangements in 
order to manage the fixed costs and to ensure executives only 
benefit if the Company performs well against the targets set.
Taking into account feedback from shareholders and the current 
focus of the Group, the Committee is also proposing to make 
some changes to the annual bonus and LTIP performance 
measures, further detail of which can be found on page 83. 
The Committee will continue its policy of setting stretching targets 
which take into account a number of internal and external factors 
and disclose performance against targets and associated payouts 
unless the Committee considers them to be commercially sensitive. 
We have communicated with our major shareholders on the 
proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy together with the 
changes set out above on the remuneration decisions for 2017/18 
and we have been pleased with the broad support for the proposals.
Sharesave Scheme
In addition to the above, we are also implementing an all-employee 
Sharesave Scheme, which is being put forward for shareholder 
approval at the 2017 AGM, to enable employees to invest in the 
future of the Group and encourage wider share ownership. 
Annual General Meeting 2017
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank shareholders for 
their continued support and do hope that you will support the 
resolutions requesting approval of the new Remuneration Policy 
and the Annual Report on Remuneration at this year’s Annual 
General Meeting on 13 December.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the Remuneration Policy (the Policy) for Executive and Non-Executive Directors, 
which shareholders are being asked to approve by binding shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting in December 2017. 
Subject to the passing of that resolution, the Policy will become effective on 13 December 2017. 
Key changes made to the Policy that was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM are as follows, with more detail set out in the 
Chairman’s letter and the Annual Report on Remuneration:
 > an increase in the maximum opportunity available under the Annual Bonus Plan (notwithstanding that the total variable pay 
(ABP plus LTIP) will be subject to an overall cap in line with the previous Directors’ Remuneration Policy, being 275% of salary); 
 > an increase in the annual bonus deferral requirements; 
 > an increase in share ownership guidelines;
 > a strengthening of the current malus and clawback provisions; and
 > formally incorporating the holding period, which was introduced last year, into the Policy.
In addition to the above, minor changes have been made to align the Policy with evolving investor guidance and to clarify the scope 
of the practical operation of the Policy (in particular in respect of the clawback provisions) to reflect market practice. 
Remuneration Policy table
Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary  
Purpose and link to strategy: Core element of remuneration set at a level to attract, retain and reward Executive Directors of the 
required calibre to successfully deliver Company strategy.
Fixed annual sum, normally 
reviewed annually.
In determining base salaries, 
the Committee considers:
 > Company performance and external 
market conditions;
 > pay and conditions elsewhere in 
the Group; 
 > role, experience and personal 
performance; and
 > salary levels at companies of a similar 
size and complexity.
There is no automatic entitlement to an 
increase each year.
The current salaries for the Executive 
Directors are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. 
While the Committee does not consider 
it appropriate to set a maximum salary, 
annual increases will generally be in line with 
those of the wider workforce. Increases 
beyond those awarded to the wider 
workforce (in percentage of salary terms) 
may be awarded in certain circumstances 
such as progression in the role, where there 
is a change in responsibility or experience, 
or a significant increase in the scale of the 
role and/or size, value and/or complexity 
of the Group.
Company and individual performance 
are factors considered when 
reviewing salaries.
Pension 
Purpose and link to strategy: The Company aims to provide competitive retirement benefits for the role to attract, retain and 
reward Executive Directors of the required calibre to successfully deliver Company strategy. 
Executive Directors may receive an 
employer’s pension contribution to a 
personal or Group pension scheme and/or 
any other arrangement the Committee 
considers has the same economic benefit 
(including a cash allowance).

Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Annual Bonus Plan (ABP)
Purpose and link to strategy: To incentivise Executive Directors to achieve specific, pre-determined goals during a one-year period. 
Rewards achievement of objectives linked to the Company’s strategy. 
Annual bonus payment is determined by  
the Committee after the financial year end, 
based on annual performance against targets 
set at the start of the year.
Normally, one-third of any annual bonus 
payment earned by the Executive Directors 
will be deferred into awards over the 
Company’s shares under the Company’s 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) which 
normally vest after at least two years. 
150% of base salary (subject to a 
combined Annual Bonus Plan 
opportunity and Long Term Incentive 
Plan award cap of 275% of salary in 
respect of any financial year).
Performance measures are determined 
with reference to the Company’ s key 
strategic business objectives for the year.
No less than 50% of the bonus will be 
dependent on financial measures and 
the remainder will be based on 
non-financial measures that are aligned 
to the strategic priorities of the business.
At threshold performance up to 25% of 
the maximum pays out. Below this level 
of performance, no bonus pays out.
On-target bonus is set at 60% of the 
maximum opportunity. 
The Committee retains the discretion to 
vary the level of bonus paid away from 
the formulaic outcome to reflect overall 
Company and individual performance.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Purpose and link to strategy: To incentivise the delivery of key strategic objectives over the longer term and align the interests  
of Executive Directors with those of our shareholders. 
Vesting of the awards is dependent on the 
achievement of performance targets set by the 
Committee, measured over a period of at least 
three years. Shares will then normally be 
subject to an additional two-year holding 
period. During this holding period, no further 
performance measures will apply.
175% of base salary as permitted by the 
plan rules (subject to a combined Annual 
Bonus Plan opportunity and Long Term 
Incentive Plan award cap of 275% of 
salary in respect of any financial year). 
Awards vest based on challenging 
financial, operational or share 
price targets.
At least 50% will be based on financial 
and/or share price-based measures.
No more than 25% vests at threshold 
with 100% of awards vesting at 
maximum performance.
Other benefits 
Purpose and link to strategy: To provide a market-competitive package of benefits consistent with the role to attract, retain and 
reward Executive Directors of the required calibre to successfully deliver Company strategy. 
Various cash/non-cash benefits are provided to 
Executive Directors which may include (but are 
not limited to) a company car (or cash equivalent), 
life assurance, expatriate benefits, private medical 
insurance (for the Executive Director and their 
immediate family) and relocation benefits. 
Executive Directors are also eligible to participate 
in any all-employee share plans on the same 
basis as other eligible employees. 
Although the Committee does not 
consider it appropriate to set a maximum 
benefits level, they are set at an 
appropriate level for the specific nature 
of the role and the individual’s personal 
circumstances.

Share ownership guidelines 
Purpose and link to strategy: To provide close alignment between the longer-term interests of Executive Directors and shareholders. 
Executive Directors are expected to achieve and 
retain a holding of the Company’s shares worth 
200% of their base salary.
It is expected that Executive Directors will retain at 
least 50% of any shares delivered under the DSBP 
and LTIP , after the deduction of applicable taxes, 
until the guideline is met.

Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees 
Purpose and link to strategy: To enable the Company to attract and retain Non-Executive Directors of the required calibre 
by offering market-competitive fees. 
Fees are determined by the Board. 
The Chairman is paid an all-inclusive fee for all 
Board responsibilities. 
Non-Executive Directors receive a basic 
Board fee. 
Neither the Chairman nor Non-Executive 
Directors are eligible to participate in any of the 
Company’s incentive arrangements or receive 
any pension provision.
Additional fees may be payable for additional 
Board responsibilities such as chairmanship or 
membership of a committee or performing the 
Senior Independent Director role or for an 
increased time commitment.
The Committee reviews the fees paid to the 
Chairman and the Board reviews the fees paid 
to the Non-Executive Directors, periodically, with 
reference to the time commitment of the role and 
market levels in companies of comparable size 
and complexity.
Non-Executive Directors shall be entitled to have 
reimbursed all expenses (such as their travel to 
Board meetings), and any associated tax, that they 
reasonably incur in the performance of their duties. 
Fees are set within the aggregate limits set 
out in the Company’s Articles of Association.
Non-Executive Directors are eligible for 
fee increases during the three-year period 
that the Policy operates to ensure they 
continue to appropriately recognise the  
time commitment of the role and fee levels 
in companies of a similar size and complexity.
N/A
Choice of performance measures and approach to setting
The performance metrics and targets that will be set for the Executive Directors for the ABP and LTIP will be carefully selected to align 
closely with the Company’s strategic plan and key performance indicators.
Awards under the ABP will be determined by a combination of financial and strategic objectives appropriate to an individual’s role.
The long-term performance metrics relating to the LTIP awards will be set at the time of each grant but will normally include at least 
50% based on financial and/or share price performance in line with the Company’s key strategic objectives.
Challenging targets for both plans will be set each year based on a number of internal and external reference points. 
The Committee will review the choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance targets prior to each 
grant under the LTIP and will consult with major shareholders in the event of any significant proposed change. Governance Report

Legacy arrangements
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising 
any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out 
above where the terms of the payment were agreed:
(i)  before the 2014 AGM (the date the Company’s first 
shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
came into effect);
(ii)  before the Policy set out above came into effect, provided 
that the terms of the payment were consistent with the 
shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 
force at the time they were agreed; or 
(iii)  at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the 
Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director 
of the Company. 
For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over 
shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the 
award is granted.
Common award terms
The Committee will operate the LTIP and DSBP in accordance 
with the respective rules, the Policy set out above and the Listing 
Rules where relevant. Awards under the LTIP and DSBP may:
 > be granted as conditional share awards or nil-cost options 
or in such other form that the Committee determines has 
the same economic effect; 
 > have any performance conditions applicable to them amended 
or substituted by the Committee if an event occurs which causes 
the Committee to determine an amended or substituted 
performance condition would be more appropriate and not 
materially less difficult to satisfy; 
 > incorporate the right to receive an amount (in cash or additional 
shares) equal to the value of dividends which would have been 
paid on the shares under an award that vests up to the time 
of vesting (or where the award is subject to a holding period, 
release). This amount may be calculated assuming that the 
dividends have been reinvested in the Company’s shares 
on a cumulative basis;
 > be settled in cash at the Committee’s discretion; and 
 > be adjusted in the event of any variation of the Company’s 
share capital or any demerger, delisting, special dividend or 
other event that may affect the Company’s share price. 
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be 
explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as 
appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s 
major shareholders.
Malus and clawback
Malus and clawback provisions (as relevant) may be operated at the 
discretion of the Committee in respect of any awards granted 
under the ABP , DSBP and LTIP in certain circumstances including, 
but not limited to, a material misstatement of the Company’s 
financial results, a material failure of risk management by any 
member of the Group or a relevant business unit, material 
reputational damage to any member of the Group or relevant 
business unit, or if the participant is summarily dismissed. 
Clawback may be applied at the discretion of the Committee up 
to: the third anniversary of payment of the cash bonus, and the 
earlier of the sixth anniversary of grant and the third anniversary 
of satisfying awards for DSBP and LTIP awards.
Takeover or other corporate event
In the event of a change of control, outstanding DSBP awards will 
normally vest in full as soon as practicable after the date of the event. 
For outstanding LTIP awards, generally the performance period 
and holding period applicable to them will end on the date of the 
event. The Committee will determine the level of vesting of unvested 
awards taking into account the extent to which performance 
conditions have been achieved at this point. Unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, unvested awards will generally vest on a 
time pro-rata basis taking into account the period of time between 
grant and the relevant event as a proportion of the vesting period. 
Alternatively, the Committee may permit a participant to exchange 
his awards for equivalent awards which relate to shares in a different 
company. If the change of control is an internal re-organisation 
of the Group, or if the Committee so decides, participants will be 
required to exchange their awards (rather than awards vesting).
If other corporate events occur, such as a winding-up of the 
Company, demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event 
which, in the opinion of the Committee, may affect the current 
or future value of the Company’s shares, the Committee may 
determine that awards will vest on the same basis as set out 
above for a takeover.
Minor changes
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy 
set out in this report (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or 
administrative purposes or to take account of a change in 
legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval for 
the amendment. Governance Report
Volution Group plc
Annual Report 2017 73
Illustrations of the application of the Remuneration Policy
The Company’s remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the 
delivery of stretching short-term and long-term performance targets.
The charts below provide illustrative values of the remuneration package for Executive Directors under three assumed performance 
scenarios. The charts are for illustrative purposes only and actual outcomes may differ from that shown.
 
The assumptions used for these charts are as follows:
Levels of performance Assumptions
Fixed pay All scenarios > Total fixed pay comprises base salary, benefits and pension
 > Base salary – effective as at 1 August 2017
 > Benefits – as set out in the single figure table for the 2016/17 year
 > 15% of base salary pension contributions
Variable pay Below threshold performance > No payout under the ABP
 > No vesting under the LTIP
In line with expectations > 60% of the maximum potential payout under the ABP 
 > 25% vesting under the LTIP , assuming awards equivalent to 150% and 
125% of base salary are granted to the CEO and the CFO, respectively
Maximum performance > 100% of the maximum potential payout under the ABP (i.e. 125% of base salary)
 > 100% vesting under the LTIP , assuming awards equivalent to 150% and 
125% of base salary are granted to the CEO and the CFO, respectively
Note
LTIP awards have been shown at face value with no share price growth, dividends or discount rate assumptions. 
External appointments of Executive Directors
The Board allows Executive Directors to accept one external commercial non-executive director appointment provided the 
commitment is compatible with their duties as an Executive Director. The Executive Director concerned may retain fees paid for these 
services which will be subject to approval by the Board. Currently, neither of the Executive Directors holds an external directorship.

Approach to recruitment 
The Committee will aim to set a new Executive Director’s 
remuneration package in line with the Policy approved 
by shareholders.
In arriving at a total package and in considering value for each 
element of the package, the Committee will take into account 
the skills and experience of a candidate, the market rate for a 
candidate of that experience, as well as the importance of 
securing the preferred candidate. 
The maximum level of variable remuneration (excluding any buy-outs) 
in respect of an appointment will be in line with the maximum Policy 
set out above (i.e. 275% of base salary). The Committee retains 
discretion to flex the balance of the annual bonus and LTIP and the 
measures used to assess performance. 
The Committee may make additional cash and/or share-based 
awards as it deems appropriate and if the circumstances so 
demand to replace remuneration arrangements forfeited by an 
Executive Director on leaving a previous employer. This may 
include the use of the relevant provisions in the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Listing Rules allowing for exceptional awards to be 
made without shareholder approval. 
Awards to replace forfeited remuneration would, where possible, be 
consistent with the awards forfeited in terms of delivery mechanism 
(cash or shares), time horizons, attributed expected value and 
whether or not they were subject to performance conditions. 
Other payments may be made in relation to relocation expenses 
and support as appropriate. 
In the case of an internal appointment, any element of remuneration 
in respect of the prior role would be allowed to continue according 
to its original terms, or adjusted if appropriate to take into account 
the appointment.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
the fee would be set in accordance with the approved Policy. The 
length of service and notice periods will be set at the discretion 
of the Committee taking into account market practice, corporate 
governance considerations and the particular candidate at that time. 
The Committee retains discretion to make appropriate remuneration 
decisions outside the Policy to meet the individual circumstances 
of recruitment when:
 > an interim appointment is made to fill an Executive Director 
role on a short-term basis; and
 > exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or 
a Non-Executive Director takes on an executive function 
on a short-term basis.
Service agreements and letters of appointment
Each of the Executive Directors’ service agreements is for a rolling 
term and may be terminated by the Company or the Executive 
Director by giving not less than twelve months’ prior written notice. 
The Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors of the 
Company do not have service contracts. Each of these Directors 
has a letter of appointment which has a three-year term which is 
renewable and is terminable by the Company or the individual on 
one month’s written notice. 
The terms of the Non-Executive Directors’ positions are subject 
to their election by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting 2017. No contractual payments would become 
due on termination.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in cash 
or share incentive arrangements and their service does not 
qualify for pension or other benefits. No element of their fee 
is performance related.
A Non-Executive Director’s appointment may be terminated 
with immediate effect if such Director has:
 > materially breached a term of their letter of appointment;
 > committed a serious or repeated breach of his duties to 
the Company;
 > been found guilty of fraud, dishonesty or certain criminal offences;
 > acted in a way likely to bring the Company into disrepute 
or which is materially adverse to the Company;
 > been declared bankrupt; or
 > been disqualified from acting as a director.
The Executive Directors’ service agreements and Non-Executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office and will be available at the 2017 AGM.
Policy on Directors leaving the Group
The Committee must satisfy any contractual obligations agreed 
with the Executive Director. This is dependent on the contractual 
obligations not being in contradiction with the Policy set out in 
this report.
If an Executive Director’s employment is terminated, in the absence 
of a breach of service agreement by the Director, the Company may, 
although it is not obliged to, terminate the Director’s employment 
immediately by payment of an amount equal to base salary and 
benefits (including pension scheme contribution) in lieu of the 
whole or the remaining part of the notice period. Payments in lieu 
of notice may be paid in monthly instalments over the length of 
the notice period. Payments are subject to mitigation in the event 
alternative employment is taken up during the notice period.  Governance Report
Volution Group plc
Annual Report 2017 75
Policy on Directors leaving the Group continued
Discretionary bonus payments will not form part of any payments 
made in lieu of notice. Annual bonus may be payable, at the 
Committee’s discretion, with respect to the period of the financial 
year served although it would be normally paid in cash, pro-rated 
for time and paid at the normal payment date. 
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director 
under the Company’s share plans will be determined based on 
the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the LTIP is that any outstanding 
awards lapse when the individual leaves the Group. However, in 
certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill health, injury 
or disability, transfer of the employing entity outside of the Group 
or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee 
(except where the Director is summarily dismissed), “good leaver” 
status may be applied. 
For good leavers, LTIP awards will normally continue until the 
normal vesting date, or when awards are subject to a holding 
period, to the end of the holding period, although the Committee 
may allow awards to vest (and be released from any holding 
periods) as soon as reasonably practicable after leaving in the 
case of death or such other circumstances the Committee 
considers appropriate. When a good leaver leaves holding 
unvested LTIP awards, the award will vest taking into account the 
extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied 
and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period of 
time that has elapsed between grant and the date of leaving as a 
proportion of the vesting period.
If a participant of the DSBP leaves the Group for any reason, the 
award will usually vest in full at the date of cessation, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise.
In the event that a buy-out award is made on recruitment, the 
leaver provisions would be determined at the time of the award.
Differences in Policy for Executive Directors 
compared to other employees 
The Committee has regard to pay structures across the wider Group 
when setting the Policy for Executive Directors. The Committee 
considers the general basic salary increase for the broader 
workforce when determining the annual salary review for the 
Executive Directors. 
Overall, the Policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted 
towards performance-related pay than for other employees. 
The level of performance-related pay varies within the Group by 
grade of employee and is calculated by reference to the specific 
responsibilities of each role as appropriate.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group 
Although pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group 
are taken into account to ensure the relationship between the pay 
of Executive Directors and employees remains appropriate, the 
Committee does not consult with employees when formulating 
the Policy.
Consideration of shareholder views
We take an active interest in shareholder views on our executive 
remuneration policy. The Committee is also committed to maintaining 
an ongoing dialogue with major shareholders and shareholder 
representative bodies whenever material changes are under 
consideration. The Committee consulted with shareholders 
and proxy voting agencies when formulating this Policy. Governance Report

Annual Report on Remuneration
This section provides details of how the Remuneration Policy (the Policy) was implemented during the year and how the Remuneration 
Committee (the Committee) intends to apply the new Policy submitted to the 2017 AGM for shareholder approval, in the financial year 
2017/18. Certain sections of this report are audited and indicated as such where applicable. The Annual Report on Remuneration will 
be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM.
Role of the Committee
The role of the Committee is to recommend to the Board a strategy 
and framework for remuneration for Executive Directors and the 
Senior Management Team in order to attract and retain leaders 
who are focused and incentivised to deliver the Company’s 
strategic business priorities, within a remuneration framework 
which is aligned with the interests of our shareholders and thus 
designed to promote the long-term success of the Company.
The Committee has clearly defined terms of reference which are 
available on the Company’s website, www.volutiongroupplc.com. 
The Committee’s main responsibilities are to:
 > establish and maintain formal and transparent procedures for 
developing policy on executive remuneration and for fixing the 
remuneration packages of individual Directors, and to monitor 
and report on them;
 > determine the remuneration, including pension arrangements, 
of the Executive Directors;
 > monitor and make recommendations in respect of 
remuneration for the tier of senior management one level 
below that of the Board;
 > approve annual and long-term incentive arrangements 
together with their targets and levels of awards;
 > determine the level of fees for the Chairman of the Board; and
 > select and appoint the external advisers to the Committee.
Membership
The Committee currently comprises four independent Non-Executive 
Directors, Tony Reading, Adrian Barden, Paul Hollingworth and 
Claire Tiney (appointed to the Board and Committee on 
3 August 2016), and the Chairman of the Board, Peter Hill.
Adrian Barden will retire from the Board and the Committee at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 13 December 2017.
Tony Reading is the Committee chairman and he has chaired the 
Committee from his appointment to the Board on 23 June 2014. 
The Chairman of the Board is a member of the Committee because 
the Board considers it essential that the Chairman is involved 
in setting remuneration policy (although he is not party to any 
discussion directly relating to his own remuneration). 
During the year the Committee also consulted with the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Company 
Secretary, but not on matters relating to their own remuneration.
Meetings
The Committee met four times during the year and has had two 
meetings to date in 2017/18. Committee member attendance 
can be found in the table of Board and Committee attendance 
on page 54.
Committee activity and key decisions during the year 
ended 31 July 2017
Matters considered and decisions reached by the Committee 
during the year included:
 > reviewed the Policy which was last approved by shareholders 
at the 2014 AGM and recommended a new Policy for approval 
by shareholders at the 2017 AGM; 
 > considered and approved the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report 2015/16;
 > reviewed outcomes and approved payments for Executive 
Director and Senior Management Team bonuses for 2015/16;
 > reviewed and approved the parameters of the ABP , including 
performance measures and targets for 2016/17 for the 
Executive Directors and Senior Management Team;
 > considered and approved the LTIP awards to the Executive 
Directors and Senior Management Team for 2016/17;
 > reviewed market trends and developments in executive 
remuneration in advance of considering Executive Director 
and Senior Management Team remuneration proposals 
for 2017/18;
 > reviewed and approved the Executive Director and 
Senior Management Team salaries for 2017/18;
 > reviewed and approved the parameters of the ABP , including 
performance measures for 2017/18 for the Executive Directors 
and Senior Management Team;
 > reviewed and approved the performance measures to be 
used for any LTIP awards made during 2017/18;
 > agreed the process for consultation with shareholders 
on the Policy;
 > considered and approved the introduction of an all-employee 
Sharesave Scheme; and
 > evaluated the performance of the Committee. Governance Report

Committee performance evaluation
During the year, the Board appointed an independent specialist corporate governance consultancy, Lintstock, to conduct a formal 
externally facilitated evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees, the Directors and the Chairman in compliance with 
the Code. Further details can be found in the Governance Report on page 55. I am pleased to confirm that this process concluded 
that the Committee had fulfilled its role effectively and did not identify any significant development points requiring action. 
Advice to the Committee
The Committee keeps itself fully informed on developments and best practice in the field of remuneration and it seeks advice from 
external advisers when appropriate.
The Committee appoints its own independent remuneration advisers and at the time of listing appointed Deloitte LLP to that role. Deloitte 
LLP have served as advisers to the Committee since listing and throughout the year. T otal fees for advice provided to the Committee during 
the year by Deloitte LLP were £27,550 and were charged based on the time spent and seniority of the staff involved in providing the 
advice. Deloitte LLP also provided the Company with IFRS2 valuation advice and all-employee share plan advice during the year.
Deloitte LLP is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in the United Kingdom. The Committee requests Deloitte LLP to attend meetings periodically during 
the year.

Notes
1. Benefits include an annual car allowance, life assurance equivalent to four times annual salary and private medical insurance.
2.  An employer’s pension contribution of 15% of base salary was paid to each of the Executive Directors until 31 October 2015. From 1 November 2015, a cash 
payment in lieu of employer’s pension contribution, equivalent to 15% of base salary was paid to each of the Executive Directors. 
3.  The annual bonus for 2016/17 relates to annual incentive payments for performance in that financial year. The calculation of this amount is set out on page 78. 
50% of the 2016/17 annual bonus above target (which is 60% of the maximum) is deferred into shares for a minimum period of two years. Ronnie George will 
be awarded shares equivalent to £54,030 and Ian Dew will be awarded shares equivalent to £36,839.
4.  Long-term incentives: this column relates to the value of long-term awards whose performance period ends in the year under review. The first long-term 
incentive awards granted post-listing had a performance period that ended on 31 July 2017, and this has been included in the table above. This award is 
due to vest in October 2017 and therefore the value included in the table above represents an estimated value using the average share price of 192.47 pence 
over the three months to 31 July 2017. As a result of no LTIP awards having a performance period ending in 2016, there is a zero figure in the 2016 column.
5. Adrian Barden’s fees were paid through Blue Burgee Limited up until 5 April 2016.
6.  Gavin Chittick was the non-independent Non-Executive Director appointed by the Company’s major shareholder, Windmill Holdings B.V., under a Relationship 
Agreement dated 18 June 2014 between the Company and Windmill Holdings B.V. He was not entitled to receive any fees for the services he provided to the 
Company. Gavin Chittick stepped down from the Board on 18 March 2016.

Annual Bonus Plan (ABP) (audited)
The operation of the ABP during the year ended 31 July 2017 was consistent with the framework set out in the Policy. The maximum 
annual bonus potential for the Executive Directors during the year was 100% of base salary, and bonus for on-target performance was 
60% of base salary. In line with last year’s report, we have provided full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against 
those targets which are set out in the table below. In the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report we stated that the weightings of the 
annual bonus performance measures for the year ending 31 July 2017 would be the same as the previous year. However, when the 
performance targets were set at the beginning of the year, the Remuneration Committee decided to decrease the weighting on adjusted 
operating profit to 43% (from 50%) and increase the weighting on adjusted EPS to 42% (from 35%). This was considered appropriate 
to ensure that the annual bonus performance measures were suitably balanced, given that both adjusted operating profit and adjusted 
EPS are key strategic measures for the Company and closely monitored by shareholders. The actual 2016/17 weightings continue to 
be consistent with our Policy.

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited)
We believe that Executive Directors should have shareholdings in the Company to ensure that they are as closely aligned as possible 
with shareholder interests. As such, during the year the Company had share ownership guidelines in place which stated that Executive 
Directors were expected to achieve and retain a holding of the Company’s shares equal to 100% of their base salary. As set out in the 
new proposed Remuneration Policy, this is being increased to 200% of salary. It should be noted that both the Executive Directors 
currently have shareholdings well in excess of 200% of base salary. The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged 
to hold shares in the Company in order to align their interests with those of shareholders. Directors’ interests in ordinary shares held 
as at 31 July 2017 (together with the interests held by Persons Closely Associated with them) are set out below. 
There were no changes in the Directors’ shareholdings between 31 July 2017 and the date of this report.

Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy 
for the financial year ending 31 July 2018
As set out in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s letter, the Committee has recently undertaken a review of the remuneration 
arrangements for our Executive Directors, with assistance from the Committee’s advisers, Deloitte LLP . The following conclusions 
were reached by the Committee on implementation of the Remuneration Policy (the Policy) for the 2017/18 financial year. 
Executive Director base salaries
As part of the review, the Committee assessed the base salaries of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. 
The Committee determined that they should both be awarded an increase in base salary in line with the wider workforce equal 
to 2% with effect from 1 August 2017, taking the base salary for Ronnie George to £396,600 and for Ian Dew to £270,400.
Pension and other benefits
The Executive Directors will continue to receive a cash payment in lieu of an employer’s pension contribution, equivalent to 15% of base 
salary. Other benefits received comprise of an annual car allowance paid in cash of £20,000 per annum for the Chief Executive Officer 
and £15,000 per annum for the Chief Financial Officer, life assurance equivalent to four times annual salary and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus Plan (ABP) and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Award levels and time horizons
Following the review, it was recognised that since listing in June 2014 the Company had grown in complexity, successfully completed 
seven important acquisitions and delivered strong financial results. To ensure the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are 
incentivised to continue the successful execution of the Group strategy and ensure continued strong financial results, the Committee 
is proposing to increase the annual bonus maximum opportunity for 2017/18 to 125% of salary for both the CEO and the CFO 
(in line with the proposed new Policy), and the 2017/18 LTIP awards to 150% of salary for the CEO and 125% of salary for the CFO.
At the same time, the Committee is increasing the annual bonus plan deferral requirements so that one-third of the total bonus is 
now deferred into shares. This will result in significantly more of the bonus being deferred into shares, creating further alignment with 
shareholders. The LTIP will continue to be subject to a two-year holding period following the end of the three-year performance period.
Annual Bonus Plan performance measures
Following the review and feedback from shareholders, it was determined that the ABP performance measures would be changed for 
the year ended 31 July 2018 in order to further align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders. Taking into account this 
feedback from shareholders, the Committee has increased the weighting of the EPS measure and reduced the weighting of the adjusted 
operating profit measure, whilst keeping the total percentage of the bonus based on profit measures the same as last year (85%). 
The Committee has also determined that the Group employee retention measure is no longer as relevant to measuring the success 
of the business and it will therefore not be used as a measure for the 2017/18 ABP . Instead, there will be an increased weighting on 
working capital management, which remains a focus for management. The Committee is aware of the current trend of a “simplification” 
of incentive arrangements in the UK listed environment. These changes reduce the number of performance measures used (from four 
to three), therefore simplifying the arrangements in place at Volution. The performance measures and weightings for the year ended 
31 July 2018 will therefore become adjusted operating profit (35%), adjusted EPS (50%) and working capital management (15%). 
The targets set for the year ended 31 July 2018 will be disclosed in the next Annual Report on Remuneration, unless they remain 
commercially sensitive.
Long Term Incentive Plan performance measures 
Following the review and feedback from shareholders, it was determined that the LTIP framework would remain the same but the 
performance measures would be changed for the year ended 31 July 2018, in order to further align the interests of the Executive 
Directors with shareholders. The performance measures to be used for the LTIP awards will give much greater emphasis to EPS 
growth (75%) and will use a single measure of Total Shareholder Return, TSR vs Direct Peer Group (25%). The Total Shareholder 
Return measure of TSR vs FTSE companies of a similar size used last year will no longer be used. The Committee determined that 
the TSR vs Direct Peer Group was the more appropriate measure to retain as it measures the performance of Volution against our 
peer group. Again, these changes simplify the incentive arrangements in place by reducing the number of performance measures 
from three to two. Governance Report

Share ownership guidelines
Share ownership guidelines are to be increased to 200% of salary (from 100% of salary) to improve the alignment between Executive 
Directors and shareholders.
Non-Executive Director fees
Fees of Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board in their absence. The fees of the Chairman (whose fees are determined 
by the Committee in his absence) and the Non-Executive Directors were last reviewed in July 2016 and the next review is due in July 
2018. Accordingly, they will remain unchanged for the year ended 31 July 2018.
The fees with effect from 1 August 2017 are summarised in the table below:
Chairman fee covering all Board duties £139,050
Non-Executive Director basic fee £46,350
Supplementary fees to Non-Executive Directors covering additional Board duties:
– Senior Independent Director £5,000
– Audit Committee Chairman £10,000
– Remuneration Committee Chairman £10,000
Statement on shareholder voting
The Company is committed to ongoing shareholder dialogue and takes an active interest in voting outcomes in respect of the approval 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Policy. In the event of a substantial vote against a resolution in relation to Directors’ 
remuneration, the Company would seek to understand the reasons for any such vote and would set out in the following Annual Report

Corporate structure
Volution Group plc is a public company limited by shares, 
incorporated in England and Wales and its shares are traded 
on the premium segment of the Main Market of the London 
Stock Exchange (LSE: FAN).
Results and dividend
The Group’s results for the year are shown in the statement 
of comprehensive income on page 98.
An interim dividend of 1.35 pence per share was paid to 
shareholders on 4 May 2017 and the Directors are recommending 
a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 July 2017 
of 2.80 pence per share. If approved, the final dividend will be 
paid on 18 December 2017 to shareholders on the register 
on 24 November 2017. The total dividend paid and proposed 
for the year amounts to 4.15 pence per share.
Share capital and related matters
The Company has only one class of share and the rights attached 
to each share are identical. Details of the rights and obligations 
attaching to the shares are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association which are available from the Company Secretary. 
The Company may refuse to register any transfer of any share 
which is not a fully paid share. At a general meeting of the 
Company, every member has one vote on a show of hands 
and on a poll one vote for each share held. Details of the voting 
procedure, including deadlines for exercising voting rights, 
are set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting 2017.
As at 31 July 2017 the issued share capital of the Company 
was 200,000,000 ordinary shares of 1 pence each. Details of 
the share capital as at 31 July 2017 are shown in note 25 to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
Powers of the Directors
The Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company 
including, subject to obtaining the required authority from the 
shareholders in general meeting, the power to authorise the 
issue of new shares and the purchase of the Company’s shares. 
At the AGM in 2016, the Company was authorised by members 
to purchase up to a maximum of 19,908,312 of its own shares. 
During the financial year ended 31 July 2017, the Directors did 
not exercise any of the powers to issue or purchase shares 
in the Company.
Restrictions on transfer and voting rights
There are no general restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares 
in the Company other than in relation to certain restrictions that 
are imposed from time to time by laws and regulations (for example 
insider trading laws). Pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation, 
Directors and certain officers and employees of the Group require 
the approval of the Company to deal in the ordinary shares of 
the Company.
Each ordinary share in the capital of the Company ranks equally 
in all respects. No shareholder holds shares carrying special rights 
relating to the control of the Company. However, on 18 June 2014, 
the Company entered into a Relationship Agreement with our then 
controlling shareholder (Windmill Holdings B.V.) in connection with 
the exercise of its rights as principal shareholder in the Company 
and its right to appoint a Director to the Board. More details on 
the Relationship Agreement can be found on page 86.
The Company has in place certain share incentive plans and details 
can be found on pages 78 to 80. Awards under the Company’s 
Long Term Incentive Plan and Deferred Share Bonus Plan are 
normally made on an annual basis and details can be found in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 84. 
The Company also has an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) in which 
to hold ordinary shares to satisfy awards under the share incentive 
plans. As at the financial year end on 31 July 2017 and as at the 
date of this report, there were 1,166,878 ordinary shares held in 
the EBT. The trustee of the EBT has the power to exercise the 
rights and powers incidental to, and to act in relation to, the 
ordinary shares subject to the EBT in such manner as the trustee 
in its absolute discretion thinks fit.
The trustee of the EBT has waived the right to receive dividends 
on any ordinary shares held, except for a nominal amount of 
1 pence, other than for those ordinary shares held in the EBT 
which are the beneficial property of an employee or shareholder. 
For further details on the EBT please see note 25 to the 
consolidated financial statements. The trustee does not vote 
ordinary shares held in the EBT, except for those ordinary shares 
which are the beneficial property of an employee or shareholder, 
which the trustee will vote in accordance with the instructions 
received from the beneficial owner. Governance Report

Relationship Agreement
On 18 June 2014, prior to listing, the Company and our then 
controlling shareholder (Windmill Holdings B.V.) entered into a 
Relationship Agreement, the principal purpose of which was to 
ensure that the Company was capable at all times of carrying on 
its business independently of the controlling shareholder and its 
associates and to ensure all transactions and arrangements 
between it and the Group would be conducted at arm’s length 
and on normal commercial terms. 
On 8 April 2016, Windmill Holdings B.V. reduced its shareholding 
to 22.38% of the Company’s share capital and accordingly ceased 
to be a controlling shareholder at that date. On 31 October 2016, 
Windmill Holdings B.V. disposed of its remaining shareholding in 
the Company at which point the Relationship Agreement ended. 
From the start of the financial year until that date, the terms of the 
Relationship Agreement remained unchanged.
The Board can confirm that from the start of the financial year until 
31 October 2016, the Company complied with the independence 
provisions and, so far as the Board is aware, the independence 
provisions were also complied with by Windmill Holdings B.V. 
and its associates. 
Directors
The Directors of the Company and their biographies are set out 
on pages 46 to 47. Their interests in the ordinary shares of the 
Company are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on page 81. Claire Tiney was appointed as an independent 
Non-Executive Director during the financial year and her 
biography is set out on page 47. 
Appointment and removal of Directors
Directors may be appointed by ordinary resolution of the 
Company or by the Board.
Under the Relationship Agreement, the Company agreed with 
Windmill Holdings B.V. that it may appoint and remove one 
Non-Executive Director to the Board for so long as the shareholder 
(and/or any of its associates, when taken together) held 15% or 
more of the voting rights over the Company’ s shares. The Relationship 
Agreement ended on 31 October 2016 and from the start of the 
financial year until that date, no representative Director sat on the 
Board of the Company. 
All Directors will stand for re-election on an annual basis, in line 
with the recommendations of the Code.
In addition to any powers of removal conferred by the Companies 
Act 2006, the Company may by special resolution remove any 
Director before the expiration of his period of office.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Articles of Association of the Company permit it to indemnify 
the Directors of the Company against liabilities arising from or in 
connection with the execution of their duties or powers to the 
extent permitted by law. 
The Company has directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance 
in place in respect of each of the Directors. The Company has 
entered into a qualifying third party indemnity (the terms of which 
are in accordance with the Companies Act 2006) with each of the 
Directors. Neither the indemnity nor insurance provide cover in the 
event that a Director or officer is proved to have acted fraudulently.
Transactions with related parties
Details of the transactions entered into by the Company with 
parties who are related to it are set out in note 29 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The only material agreement with related parties in place during 
the year was as follows:
 > the Relationship Agreement with Windmill Holdings B.V ., which 
was our controlling shareholder from listing until 8 April 2016. 
This Relationship Agreement ended on 31 October 2016 and 
described the relationship of the Company with Windmill 
Holdings B.V., and subject to certain minimum shareholding 
requirements, the right of this shareholder to be represented 
on the Board and certain anti-dilution rights. Governance Report

Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;

and prudent;
 > state whether the Group and parent company financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU; and
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’ s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a strategic report, a directors’ report, 
a directors’ remuneration report and a corporate governance 
statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of Directors in respect 
of the Annual Report and the financial statements
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Group and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
 > the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 > the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.

Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the Annual Report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to

Overview of our audit approach
Key audit matters > Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, including the re-assessment of Cash Generating Units 
(“CGUs”).
 > Improper revenue recognition, including accounting for sales rebates.
 > Management override in respective of provisions and exceptional items.
Audit scope > We performed an audit of the complete financial information of four components and audit procedures on 
specific balances for a further ten components.
 > The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 99% of profit before 
tax, 91% of revenue and 71% of total assets.
Materiality > Overall Group materiality of £960k (FY 2016: £970k) which represents 5% of normalised pre-tax earnings 
(i.e. profit before tax after adding back non-recurring exceptional items).
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, 
including the assessment of CGUs.
The Group’s assets include £81.6 million (FY 2016: £68.2 million)  
of goodwill and £100.9 million (FY 2016: £105.4 million) of other 
intangible assets.
Our evaluation of the risk profile of the Group:
The risk profile has remained stable.
The Group has significant goodwill and other non-current assets, which comprise 66% of the Group’s total assets, and the impairment 
review involves a number of subjective assumptions. The additions to goodwill of £13.4 million and other intangible assets of £7.2 million 
principally arose from the acquisitions of Breathing Buildings and VoltAir. 
For intangible assets amortised over finite lives, the Group is required to determine whether indicators of impairment exist, and if so, perform 
a full impairment review. For intangible assets with an infinite useful life the Group is required to perform a full annual impairment review.
The identification of CGU’s is an important judgement in ascertaining whether the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
is recoverable. The Group changed its assessment of impairment of goodwill allocated to CGU’s in the year.
Risk Our response to the risk 
Key observations communicated 
to the Audit Committee
Goodwill
The Group is required to 
perform an impairment 
assessment of goodwill 
annually, which involves 
comparing each CGU’s value in 
use with its carrying amount. 
In deriving the value in use, 
the Group is required to  
make a number of subjective 
assumptions including price and 
cost inflation, discount rates 
and perpetuity growth rates.
Other intangible assets
For intangible assets amortised 
over finite lives, the Group is 
required to determine whether 
indicators of impairment exist, 
and if so, perform a full 
impairment review. There is a 
risk that the impairment has not 
been recognised appropriately.
Goodwill allocated to CGUs
The Group started assessing 
impairment of goodwill at an 
aggregated regional CGU level 
in the current year. This is 
different to the grouped CGUs 
that were presented in the 
prior year. The reasons for the 
change have been disclosed in 
note 15 to the Annual Report 
and Accounts. 
We ensured the methodology applied by management complied with 
the requirements of IAS 36, including the computation of carrying value 
and the nature of cash-flows included in determining the value in use.
 > We evaluated the reasons for the change in approach to 
assessing impairment of goodwill at an aggregated regional  
CGU level, which were set forth by management in their  
Goodwill impairment memorandum. 
 > We challenged management’s assessment by reviewing the 
internal management reporting of how the business is currently 
monitored and agreed this to management’s memorandum. 
 > We challenged the arguments in the memorandum with 
reference to compliance with IFRS and specifically around the 
impairment of goodwill allocated to CGU as indicated in IAS36.
 > We noted that on a historical basis the goodwill related to the 
CGUs would not have been impaired if the evaluation was based 
on the previous CGUs. 
 > We obtained forecasts underlying the impairment review and 
agreed these to budgets approved by the Board and against 
actual performance in order to ascertained the historical 
accuracy of forecasting.
 > Our valuation specialists assessed the reasonableness of terminal 
growth rates and WACC rates used in the model by comparing 
them to similar rates which are representative of the industry in 
which the Group operates.
 > We made enquiries of the appropriate finance and commercial 
personnel to determine whether forecasted performance 
significantly deviated from historic performance levels, observable 
trends or our expectations.
 > We also performed sensitivity analysis on key assumptions 
including sensitivities to key drivers such as sales prices and 
gross margin.
We concluded: 
 > the carrying value of 
goodwill and intangible 
assets to be supportable;
 > management’s 
identification of CGU’s 
to be appropriate and in 
accordance with changes 
to the Group from new 
acquisitions; and
 > the associated financial 
statement disclosures 
are appropriate.
The procedures set out above were carried out by the Group audit team.

Inappropriate revenue recognition, including accounting 
for sales rebates.
During the year the Group recognised revenue of £185.1 million 
(FY 2016: £154.5 million). 
Our judgement on the risk profile of the Group:
The risk profile has remained stable.
We determined that there is a risk of material misstatement associated with revenue recognition as revenue is the most significant item 
in the consolidated income statement and impacts the majority of the key performance indicators of the Group. Revenue substantially 
arises from the sale of goods, which was the focus of our audit procedures. 
Risk Our response to the risk 
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
The risk of inappropriate 
revenue recognition arises 
from the following:
 > inappropriate application 
of sales cut-off;
 > revenue not being recognised 
in line with Group policy and 
IAS18; and
 > judgemental sales 
rebate provisions. 
We tested the correct application of the timing of revenue 
recognition through substantive testing a sample of 
revenue transactions before and after the period end 
to identify revenue recognised in the incorrect period. 
We used data analytics to identify transactions beyond 
our expectation of the transaction flow. We also 
performed the following: 
 > Obtained an understanding of the significant classes 
of transactions impacting revenue and performing 
walkthroughs to confirm our understanding of these 
transactions and the controls in place.
 > Evaluated the adequacy of the design of the controls on 
the significant classes of transactions impacting revenue.
 > Performed overall analytical review procedures, which 
included comparing actual revenue against budget and 
prior year.
 > Performed revenue correlation data analytical procedures 
on Manrose, which is the only entity that has been on 
the new ERP for a full year.
 > Tested the application of cut-off and obtained the 
incoterms, supporting sales orders, proof of dispatch 
and proof of payment for a sample of sales 
transactions across all trading companies in scope.
 > Tested customer rebate accruals by obtaining formal 
agreements with a sample of customers and recalculating 
the expected sales rebate. We also noted that a consistent 
methodology was applied. 
 > Circularised a sample of customers with rebate 
agreements in place to obtain direct confirmation 
of the sales rebate terms entered into. 
We concluded:
 > we identified one audit difference 
related to revenue, however, this 
was not material in the context 
of consolidated revenue, or the 
consolidated financial statements 
as a whole;
 > the application of sales cut-off 
to be appropriate;
 > revenue was recognised in line 
with Group policy;
 > judgemental sales rebate 
provisions were appropriate; and
 > appropriate disclosure of the 
nature of rebates is included in 
the financial statements.
Instructions to perform the above were issued to all 
full and specific procedures scope locations, which 
covered 91% of consolidated revenue.

Management override arising from the recognition and 
valuation of judgemental provisions and journal entries.
Our judgement on the risk profile of the Group:
The risk profile has remained stable.
The Group’s trading transactions principally comprise of non-complex transactions, which involve limited judgement. We determined 
that certain provisions, as set out below, contain a risk of material misstatement as this is the principal area of judgement in the 
Group’s statement of financial position.
Risk Our response to the risk 
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
We identified risk to be present in 
the following:
 > Judgemental provisions, 
specifically debtors, credit 
notes, inventory and warranty 
provisions.
 > Unauthorised non-standard 
journal entries (including 
manual journal entries.
Judgemental provisions:
 > We obtained management’s calculation and 
assumptions used for calculating judgemental 
provisions. We noted the methodology is appropriate 
and consistent with prior years.
 > Where management has overridden the provision 
amounts calculated, we have enquired of management 
for the basis and obtained corroborative evidence to 
ensure the rationale is valid.
 > In order to verify the accuracy of the methodology 
used by management, we performed a retrospective 
review of prior year provisions.
Unauthorised non-standard journal entries:
 > We reviewed unusual journal entries at the subsidiary 
and Group levels.
 > We inquired of management of the risks of fraud and 
the controls put in place to address management override.
 > We assessed the possibility of fraud arising as a result 
of errors identified during our audit. 
We concluded:
 > provision balances and the 
methodology applied were 
acceptable; 
 > the bases for recognising 
judgemental provisions were 
appropriate; and
 > our testing of unusual journal 
entries raised at subsidiary and 
Group levels did not uncover 
any unusual or unauthorised 
journal entries.
Instructions to perform the above were issued to all full 
and specific scope locations.

Key audit matters continued
Management override arising from the presentation 
of recurring items as exceptional.
£1.4 million (FY 2016: £1.2 million) of costs incurred  
in the year are classified as exceptional.
Our evaluation on the risk profile of the Group:
The risk profile has remained stable.
We determined that exceptional items contain a risk of material misstatement as adjusted performance measures are regularly referred 
to by management in describing the Group’s performance and form the basis of bonuses payable to Executive Directors. The principal 
area of judgement in the adjusted measures relates to the treatment of exceptional costs.
Risk Our response to the risk 
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Costs could inappropriately be 
presented as exceptional to 
enhance underlying earnings.
We obtained an analysis of exceptional items and 
determined whether the underlying event was exceptional 
in the context of the guidance for separate presentation of 
‘material items’ provided in IAS 1, and is consistent with 
the narrative sections of the Annual Report and Accounts.
We challenged whether items presented as exceptional 
meet the definition of “material and non-recurring” and are 
consistent with Group accounting policy. 
We determined whether the disclosure of exceptional items 
is consistent with the nature of exceptional items as 
suggested in the FRC’ s press release from December 2013. 
We concluded that the presentation 
of items as exceptional is acceptable.
The audit of judgements made in classifying costs as 
exceptional was performed by the Group team.

An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into 
account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment 
and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage 
of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 23 reporting components of the Group, we selected 14 components covering 
entities within Sweden, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the 14 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of four components (“full scope components”) 
which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining ten components (“specific scope components”), we 
performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact 
on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. 
We have set out below the details of our audit procedures: 
% of Group profit before tax and 
non-recurring exceptional items % of Group revenue % of Group total assets

An overview of the scope of our audit continued
Tailoring the scope continued
The audit scope of these components may not have included 
testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have 
contributed to the coverage of significant tested for the Group. 
We also instructed three locations to perform specified procedures 
over certain aspects of risk of inappropriate revenue recognition 
and management override of controls, as described in the Risk 
section above. 
Of the remaining twelve components that together represent 1.0% 
of the Group’s profit before tax after adding back non-recurring 
exceptional items, none are individually greater than 1.0% of the 
Group’ s profit before tax after adding back non-recurring exceptional 
items. For these components, the Group Team performed other 
procedures, including analytical review of ‘review scope’ components, 
testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations and 
foreign currency translation recalculations to respond to any potential 
risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
The charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work 
performed by our audit teams.
Changes from the prior year 
The Group acquired VoltAir and Breathing Buildings during FY 2017. 
The Company has been assigned review scope for the 31 July 2017 
Group audit. There are no other changes in Group scope from 
the prior year. 
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at 
each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement 
team, or by component auditors from other EY global network 
firms operating under our instruction. Of the four full scope 
components, all of these were audited directly by the primary 
audit team. For the three specific scope components, where the 
work was performed by component auditors, we determined the 
appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that 
sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme that has 
been designed to ensure that a suitably senior member of the Group 
team physically participates in the closing meeting of all full scope 
components. During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were 
undertaken by the primary audit team to the component team in 
Crawley, Bristol and Cambridge. These visits involved discussing 
the audit approach with the component team and any issues arising 
from their work, meeting with local management, attending planning 
and closing meetings, reviewing key audit working papers on risk 
areas. The full scope components are also audited by the primary 
team. The Group audit team also attended the German, Sweden 
and Benelux closing meeting by telephone.
The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams 
where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed 
key working papers and were responsible for the scope and 
direction of the audit process. We held an audit planning meeting, 
which was attended by all component audit teams. We also 
issued detailed reporting instructions to component audit teams 
setting out our expectation of procedures to be performed, 
including those on areas of potential material misstatement. 
The above, together with the additional procedures performed 
at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on 
the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing 
the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on 
the audit and in forming our audit opinion. The key measures 
applied are illustrated and explained below:

narrative
Materiality 960 979 A
Performance materiality 720 734 B
Reporting threshold 48 49 C
A) Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually 
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent 
of our audit procedures.

Our application of materiality continued
A) Materiality continued
Our calculation of materiality is summarised below:
£000
Statutory pre-tax earnings 17,898
Add back: Non-recurring acquisition costs 1,380
Normalised pre-tax earnings 19,278
Normalised pre-tax earnings x 5% 960
Normalised earnings refers to our estimate of what the 
earnings based measure may be if certain factors affecting 
earnings are removed. We have used calculated materiality based 
on the Group’s profit before tax after adding back non-recurring 
exceptional items. 
B) Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment 
of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was 
that performance materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning 
materiality, namely £720k (2016: £734k). We have set performance 
materiality at this percentage due to the active implementation of 
controls and procedures to address comments raised in the internal 
auditor’s reports and our internal control observations; we also 
gave consideration to our low expectation of audit differences 
based on recent experience.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining 
audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. 
The performance materiality set for each component is based 
on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group 
as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at 
that component. In the current year, the range of performance 
materiality allocated to components ranged between £141k to 
£317k (2016: £130k to £160k).
C) Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered 
as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £48k (2016: £47k), 
which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Companies Act 2006;
 > the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and 
the parent company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report or the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 > the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 > certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
 > we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on page 88, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that give a true 
and fair view in accordance, and for such internal control as the 
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Company 
or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the  
audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify 
and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement 
due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate 
responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected 
fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility 
for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those 
charged with governance of the entity and management.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This 
description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address
 > Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we 
were appointed as auditors by the Board of Directors and signed 
an engagement letter on 16 May 2016. We were appointed 
by the Company at the AGM on 9 December 2016 to audit 
the financial statements for the year ending 31 July 2017 
and subsequent financial periods. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals 
and reappointments is four years, covering the years ending 
31 July 2014 to 31 July 2017.
 > The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company 
and we remain independent of the Group and the Company 
in conducting the audit. 
 > The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to 
the Audit Committee.

Treasury shares 
The treasury shares reserve represents the cost of shares in Volution Group plc purchased in the market and held by the Volution 
Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy obligations under the Group’s share incentive schemes.
Capital reserve
The capital reserve is the difference in share capital and reserves arising from the use of the pooling of interest method for preparation 
of the financial statements in 2014. This is a non-distributable reserve.
Share-based payment reserve
The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payments provided to key 
management personnel, as part of their remuneration. Refer to note 32 for further detail of these plans. 
Foreign currency translation reserve
Exchange differences arising on translation of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries into GBP are included in the foreign currency translation 
reserve. The Group hedges some of its exposure to its net investment in foreign operations; foreign exchange gains and losses relating 
to the effective portion of the net investment hedge are accounted for by entries made directly to the foreign currency translation reserve. 
No hedge ineffectiveness has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for any of the periods presented.
Retained earnings
The parent company of the Group, Volution Group plc, had distributable retained earnings at 31 July 2017 of £72,781,000

Financial Statements
1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting policies under the relevant notes. 
The preparation of the consolidated financial information in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates and requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Accounting 
policies, including critical accounting judgements and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements, that relate to a 
particular note are described in the specific note to which they relate.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£000), except as 
otherwise indicated.
The financial information includes all subsidiaries. The results of subsidiaries are included from the date on which effective control is 
acquired up to the date control ceases to exist.
Subsidiaries are controlled by the parent (in each relevant period) regardless of the amount of shares owned. Control exists when the 
parent has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting periods using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany 
transactions and balances, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation.
We have simplified the presentation in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income this year compared with the prior year 
by amalgamating administrative and distribution costs.
Going concern
The Group’s Strategic Report on page 33 shows the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence in the foreseeable future, for the period not less than twelve months 
from the date of this report.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each subsidiary are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the Group financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
entity are expressed in GBP (£000), which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency of the Group.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting 
period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
the fair value was determined.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial information, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are expressed 
in GBP using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange 
rate for the period. Exchange differences arising are classified as other comprehensive income and are transferred to the foreign currency 
translation reserve. All other translation differences are taken to profit and loss with the exception of differences on foreign currency 
borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign operations, 
in which case they are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these operations.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
The significant judgements, estimates and assumptions made in these financial statements relate to: Exceptional items (note 5), 
Intangible assets – goodwill (note 13), Intangible assets – other (note 14), Impairment assessment of goodwill (note 15), Inventories 
(note 17) and Rebates payable (note 21).
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods 
if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Financial Statements
1. Basis of preparation continued
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities within the next financial year are described 
under the relevant notes.
The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when these financial statements were prepared. Existing 
circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising 
beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
New standards and interpretations 
There were no new or amended accounting standards relevant to the Group’s results that are effective for the first time in 2017 that 
have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
The following standards and interpretations have an effective date after the date of these financial statements. The Group plans to 
adopt them from the effective dates adopted by the EU and is currently completing an impact assessment to be able to quantify the 
effect the new standards will have on the Group financial statements. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in July 2014 to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 
has been endorsed by the EU and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will be adopted by the 
Group on 1 August 2018.
IFRS 9 will impact the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial instruments and will require certain additional disclosures. 
IFRS 9 also introduces changes to impairments of financial assets, which will result in the Group moving from an incurred loss model 
to an expected loss model. Although the new standard will impact the way in which bad debt provisions are calculated, the Group 
does not anticipate that the impact of this change will be significant.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was issued in May 2014 and has been endorsed by the EU. The subsequent 
amendments, Clarifications to IFRS 15 issued in April 2016, have not yet been endorsed by the EU. IFRS 15, as amended, 
is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will be adopted by the Group, subject to EU 
endorsement, on 1 August 2018.
The Directors do not consider IFRS 15 to have a significant impact on the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods. However, 
revenue which arises from the provision of services will be impacted by the changes in the new standard.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016 to replace IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The standard 
is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and will be adopted by the Group, subject to EU endorsement, 
on 1 August 2019. 
IFRS 16 will require most leases to be recognised in the statement of financial position effectively ending the distinction between 
finance and operating leases for lessees. The new standard will require the Group to recognise a right-of-use asset and a 
corresponding lease liability. 
The Group is still assessing the impact of the new standard. However, the Directors do anticipate material changes to the following areas:
 > Operating leases would be recognised as right-of-use assets in the statement of financial position. Currently no lease assets are 
included on the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position for operating leases. 
 > Lease liabilities would be recognised in the statement of financial position for future lease payments. Currently liabilities are generally 
not recorded for future operating lease payments. Lease obligations are instead disclosed as commitments (see note 31). 
 > Depreciation expenses for right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities would be recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. The interest expense will generally be higher in the early stages of the lease and reduce over the lease 
term. Currently operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term and included within operating 
expenses (see note 8).
 > Lease cash flows would be recorded as cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows, to reflect 
the repayment of lease liabilities and related interest. Currently payments for operating leases are included within operating cash flows.
Other new standards or interpretations in issue, but not yet effective, are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s net 
assets or results. Volution Group plc

2. Adjusted earnings 
The Board and key management personnel use some alternative performance measures to track and assess the underlying 
performance of the business. These measures include adjusted operating profit and adjusted profit before tax. These measures are 
deemed more appropriate as they remove income and expenditure which is not directly related to the ongoing trading of the business. 
Such alternative performance measures are not defined terms under IFRS and may not be comparable with similar measures disclosed 
by other companies. Likewise, these measures are not a substitute for IFRS measures of profit. A reconciliation of these measures of 
performance to the corresponding reported figure is shown below.

3. Revenue
Accounting policy
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer 
returns, rebates (see note 21) and other similar allowances that are calculated based upon the price of goods, volumes and 
product mix purchased by the customer. Revenue is stated net of settlement discounts, VAT, other sales taxes and duties.
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards have passed to the buyer, usually on the 
delivery of the goods, and the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with 
ownership nor effective control over the goods sold.
Rendering of services
Revenue from the provision of services arises from the installation of products and is recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion. The stage of completion is measured by reference to costs incurred to date as a percentage of total expected costs 
for each contract. Where the contract outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of expenses 
recognised that are considered to be recoverable. Volution Group plc

4. Segmental analysis
Accounting policy
The method of identifying reporting segments is based on internal management reporting information that is regularly reviewed 
by the chief operating decision maker, which is considered to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Group.
In identifying its operating segments, management follows the Group’s market sectors. These are Ventilation UK, Ventilation Nordics, 
Ventilation Central Europe and OEM (Torin-Sifan). Operating segments that provide ventilation services have been aggregated as 
they have similar economic characteristics, assessed by reference to the gross margins of the segments. In addition, the segments 
are similar in relation to the nature of products, services and production processes, type of customer, method for distribution and 
regulatory environment. The Group is considered to have two reportable segments: Ventilation Group and OEM (Torin-Sifan).
The measure of revenue reported to the chief operating decision maker to assess performance is total revenue for each operating 
segment. The measure of profit reported to the chief operating decision maker to assess performance is adjusted operating profit 
(see note 34 for definition) from external customers for each operating segment. Gross profit and the analysis below segment 
profit is additional voluntary information and not “segment information” prepared in accordance with IFRS 8.
Finance revenue and costs are not allocated to individual operating segments as the underlying instruments are managed on a 
Group basis. 
Total assets and liabilities are not disclosed as this information is not provided by operating segment to the chief operating 
decision maker on a regular basis.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis on terms similar to transactions with third parties. Volution Group plc

5. Exceptional items
Accounting policy
The Group discloses exceptional items by virtue of their nature, size or incidence to allow a better understanding of the underlying 
trading performance of the Group. Exceptional items include, but are not limited to, significant restructuring costs, acquisition and 
related integration and earn-out costs, fair value adjustments as a result of acquisitions and material gains or losses on disposal 
of property, plant and equipment.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The Group identifies an item of expense or income as exceptional when, in management’s judgement, the underlying event giving 
rise to the exceptional item is deemed to be non-recurring in its nature, size or incidence such that Group results would be distorted 
without specific reference to the event in question. To enable the full impact of an exceptional item to be understood, the tax 
impact is disclosed and it is presented separately in the statement of cash flows.

Acquisition related costs, including inventory fair value adjustments
Inventory fair value adjustments relate to the requirement to uplift the finished goods of the acquired entities on acquisition by the 
addition of value not ordinarily considered when accounting for inventory. When these goods are subsequently sold the additional 
expense to the statement of comprehensive income is classified as exceptional. The cost of £81,000 in the period relates to 
Breathing Buildings Limited. Inventory fair value adjustments in the prior year were £332,000.
Professional fees incurred in respect of the acquisition of Breathing Buildings Limited, which completed on 16 December 2016, 
totalled £207,000 and fees incurred in respect of the acquisition of VoltAir System AB, which completed on 29 May 2017, totalled 
£117,000. Professional fees incurred in respect of prior year and potential acquisitions totalled £58,000.
The acquisition costs in the prior year relate to the acquisitions of Energy T echnique Limited (£603,000), Ventilair Group International BVBA 
(£85,000), Weland Luftbehandling AB (£22,000) and NVA Services Limited (£167,000).
Acquisition related restructuring costs relate to two of the senior management team within Energy Technique plc who have decided 
to leave the business. Within the terms of their employment, at acquisition, there was a clause which provided that, on a change 
of ownership, they could leave the business on enhanced terms. Both have now tendered their resignation and therefore triggered 
the clause at a cost of £264,000. The remaining balance relates to PAYE payable to HMRC in respect of fees invoiced to 
Energy Technique plc by its former chairman prior to acquisition.
It was deemed that the items allowable for or chargeable to tax were approximately £883,000 (2016: £332,000), with a potential tax 
benefit of £172,000 (2016: £80,000).
Factory relocation
The cost of the factory relocation relates to a project to rationalise manufacturing capacity which commenced in 2017. The affected 
UK manufacturing locations are Reading, Slough and Lasham.
A relocation project team has been established and has recruited the expertise of a professional project manager with experience 
in managing industrial relocations. A breakdown of the costs are as follows:
2017 
£000
Legal and professional fees 179
Project manager 112
Redundancy related costs 131
Stock write-off 89
Fixed asset write-off 24
Site clearance and closure 14
Total 549
The project to relocate the factories to the new facility will last until mid-2018 when we expect to finalise the production move. It is our 
intention that all costs associated with the project will similarly be treated as exceptional, given their size in aggregate and the unusual 
(one-off) nature of the project. We anticipate that the revenue expenditure associated with the project will cost, in aggregate, around 
£1.75 million. Volution Group plc
Annual Report 2017 109

6. Finance revenue and costs
Accounting policy
Finance revenue 
Finance revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to its net carrying amount.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest income on funds invested, gains/losses on the disposal of financial instruments, changes in 
the fair value of financial instruments, interest expense on borrowings and finance leases, and foreign exchange gains/losses. Interest 
income and expense is recognised as it accrues in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.

The net loss or gain on financial instruments at each year-end date relates to the measurement of fair value of the financial derivatives 
and the Group recognises any finance losses or gains immediately within net finance costs. The fair value of the Group’s financial 
derivatives can be found in notes 19 and 22.
7. Staff costs
Accounting policy
Pensions
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period they 
become payable. The cost charged to the statement of comprehensive income of providing retirement pensions for employees 
represents the amounts paid by the Group to various defined contribution pension schemes operated by the Group in the 
financial period.

The Finance Act 2016 was enacted on 15 September 2016 which reduced the headline rate from 18% to 17% to apply from 1 April 2020 
and the impact of this rate change has been included in these financial statements, leading to a credit of £351,000 to the tax charge. 
The Finance Act (No. 2) 2015 was enacted on 18 November 2015 and introduced reductions in the headline rate of corporation tax to 
19% and 18% to apply from 1 April 2017 and 1 April 2020 respectively. The implications of the rate changes were incorporated within 
the financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2016, which lead to a credit of £1,105,000 to the tax charge. 
The higher overseas tax rates relates to the Group’s profits from subsidiaries which are subject to tax jurisdictions with a higher rate 
of tax compared to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK (see note 30 for subsidiary locations).
11. Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
that would be issued on conversion of any dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. There are no dilutive potential ordinary 
shares for the years ended 31 July 2017 and 2016.

12. Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Such cost 
includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment 
are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and 
depreciates them accordingly. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
as incurred. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, except freehold land, over their estimated useful lives 
using the straight line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year 
end, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis.
The following useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:
Buildings – 30–50 years 
Plant and machinery – 5–10 years 
Fixtures, fittings, tools, equipment and vehicles – 4–10 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference 
between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income as part of administrative expenses, or if the amount is deemed significant within exceptional items, as set out in note 5.

13. Intangible assets – goodwill
Accounting policy
Goodwill
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment. Impairment of goodwill is 
determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying value of the cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, 
an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group’s impairment test for goodwill is based on a value in use calculation using a discounted cash flow model. The test aims 
to ensure that goodwill is not carried at a value greater than the recoverable amount, which is considered to be the higher of fair 
value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The cash flows are derived from the business plan for the following three years. The recoverable amount is very sensitive to the 
discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for 
extrapolation purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash generating units 
are explained further in note 15.
The identification of the Group’ s cash generating units (CGUs) used for impairment testing involves a degree of judgement (see note 15). 
Management has reviewed the Group’s assets and cash inflows and identified the lowest aggregation of assets that generate 
largely independent cash inflows.

14. Intangible assets – other
Accounting policy
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy the 
definition of an intangible asset and their fair values can be measured reliably. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value 
at the acquisition date. 
The fair value of patents, trademarks and customer base acquired and recognised as part of a business combination is 
determined using the relief-from-royalty method or multi-period excess earnings method.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Research and development
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure on an individual project is recognised as an intangible asset 
when the Company can demonstrate: the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use 
or sale; its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset; how the asset will generate future economic benefits; the 
availability of resources to complete the asset; and the ability to reliably measure the expenditure during development.
Subsequent measurement of intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Development costs – 10 years 
Software costs – 5 years 
Customer base – 5–15 years 
Trademarks – 15–25 years 
Patents – 5–25 years 
Other – 5 years
The estimated useful life and amortisation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets with finite lives to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Where it is not possible to estimate 
the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated 
to individual cash generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash generating units for which a 
reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are immediately recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of other intangible assets
The Group’s accounting policy for impairment of other intangible assets is set out above. The Group records all assets and 
liabilities acquired in business combinations at fair value. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Volution Group plc

15. Impairment assessment of goodwill 
Accounting policy
Intangible assets, including goodwill, that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s 
fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated, for impairment testing purposes, to a group of cash 
generating units (CGUs). These grouped CGUs are: UK Ventilation, Central Europe, Nordics and OEM. This is different to the 
grouped CGUs that were presented in the prior year; the changes have been made as we have taken the opportunity to review 
what is presented and bring the level of CGUs reported in line with the level at which management regularly reviews the Group’s 
performance. This is also the level at which management is monitoring the value of goodwill for internal management purposes, 
which differs from the prior year due to the recent growth of the Group.

Annual Report 2017 119
Financial Statements
15. Impairment assessment of goodwill continued
Impairment review
Under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group is required to complete a full impairment review of goodwill, which has been performed 
using a value in use calculation. A discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used, taking a period of five years, which has been established 
using pre-tax discount rates of 11.0% to 12.9% over that period. In all CGUs it was concluded that the carrying amount was in excess 
of the value in use and all CGUs had positive headroom.
Key assumptions in the value in use calculation
The calculation of value in use for all CGUs is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
 > Price inflation – small annual percentage increases specific to each CGU are assumed in all markets based on historical data.
 > Growth in the forecast period – specific growth rates have been used for each of the CGUs for the five-year forecast period based 
on historical growth rates and market expectations. 
 > Discount rates – rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each operation. The pre-tax discount rate 
ranged from 11.0% to 12.9%.
 > No growth rate has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the forecast period other than the 2% rate of inflation.
The value in use headroom, for each cash generating unit where these sensitivities would be applicable, has been set out above. 
We have modelled various sensitivities in relation to the above key assumptions and in all cases an adverse movement of more 
than 10% would be required to cause the carrying value of the cash generating units to materially exceed their recoverable value.
16. Business combinations
Accounting policy
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value. There have been no non-controlling interests in the 
business combinations to date. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in exceptional items.
When the Group acquires a business it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the acquisition date.
Contingent consideration resulting from business combinations is valued at fair value at the acquisition date as part of the business 
combination. When the contingent consideration meets the definition of a financial liability, it is subsequently re-measured to fair 
value at each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognised either in profit or loss or as a change in other comprehensive 
income (OCI). The determination of fair value is based on discounted cash flows. The key assumptions take into consideration 
the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount factor.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash 
generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether assets or liabilities of the 
acquisition are assigned to those units. Volution Group plc

nature. These items include the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition and the experience and skill of the acquired 
workforce. The fair value of the acquired tradename and customer base was identified and included in intangible assets.
The gross amount of trade and other receivables is £2,208,000. The amounts for trade and other receivables not expected to be 
collected are £12,000.
Breathing Buildings Limited generated revenue of £4,918,000 and generated a profit after tax of £337,000 in the period from 
acquisition to 31 July 2017 that is included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for this reporting period.
If the combination had taken place at 1 August 2016, the Group’s revenue would have been £188,514,000 and the profit before 
tax from continuing operations would have been £17,239,000. Volution Group plc

VoltAir System AB
On 29 May 2017, Volution Group plc, through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Volution Holdings Sweden AB, acquired the 
entire issued share capital of VoltAir System AB (VoltAir). The transaction was funded from the Group’s existing revolving credit facility. 
The acquisition is in line with the Group’s strategy of acquiring selective value-adding and strategically important businesses and will 
give Volution an enlarged presence in the new build sector in both the residential and commercial ventilation markets in Sweden and 
the Nordics in the growing and regulatory driven market for air handling units.
Total consideration for the transaction was cash consideration of SEK 79,711,000 (£7,091,000) and contingent consideration with a 
fair value of SEK 16,930,000 (£1,506,000), giving total consideration of SEK 96,641,000 (£8,597,000). The contingent consideration 
is based on the level of EBITDA achieved during the twelve months to 31 December 2017. There is a minimum level of EBITDA which 
must be achieved otherwise no contingent consideration is payable; the maximum amount of contingent consideration payable is 
SEK 28,000,000. The contingent consideration has been recognised in line with management’s best estimate of the level of EBITDA 
expected to be achieved during the earn-out period. Whilst the level of EBITDA to be achieved is as yet unobservable, management’s

17. Inventories
Accounting policy
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of raw materials is purchase cost on a first in, first out 
basis. The cost of work in progress and finished goods includes: cost of direct materials and labour and an appropriate portion of 
fixed and variable overhead expenses based on normal operating capacity, but excludes borrowing costs.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and cost to sell.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Provisions for inventory obsolescence 
Provisions for inventory obsolescence are made with reference to the inventory balances and usage. Management also considers 
sales history and the latest sales forecasts to determine whether the amounts are recoverable.

During 2017, £261,000 (2016: £258,000) was recognised as a cost of sales for inventories written off in the year.
Inventories are stated net of an allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving items which totalled £2,829,000 (2016: £2,882,000). 
This provision was split amongst the three categories: £1,526,000 for raw materials and consumables; £184,000 for work in progress; 
and £1,119,000 for finished goods and goods for resale.
A 10% increase in the inventory provision for raw material would increase the overall inventory provision by 5.4%. A 10% increase in 
the inventory provision for work in progress would increase the overall inventory provision by 0.7%. A 10% increase in the inventory 
provision for finished goods would increase the overall inventory provision by 4.0%. Volution Group plc

18. Trade and other receivables 
Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables are recognised when it is probable that a future economic benefit will flow to the Group. Trade 
and other receivables are carried at original invoice or contract amount less any provisions for discounts and doubtful debts. 
Provisions are made where there is evidence of a risk of non-payment taking into account ageing, previous experience and 
general economic conditions.
Provisions for bad debts 
Provisions for bad debts are made with reference to the ageing of receivables and the view of management as to whether amounts 
are recoverable. Bad debt will be determined with consideration given to recent customer trading and management experience.
Rebates receivable
The Group has a number of supplier rebate agreements that are recognised as a reduction of cost of sales (collectively referred 
to as rebates). Rebates are based on an agreed percentage of purchases, which will increase with the level of purchases made. 
These agreements typically are not coterminous with the Group’s year end and some of the amounts payable are subject to 
confirmation after the reporting date.

of trade receivables and the level of provisioning required.

21. Trade and other payables
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Rebates payable
The Group has a number of customer rebate agreements that are recognised as a reduction from sales (collectively referred to 
as rebates). Rebates are based on an agreed percentage of revenue, which increases with the level of revenue achieved. These 
agreements typically are not coterminous with the Group’s year end and some of the amounts payable are subject to confirmation 
after the reporting date. 
At the reporting date, the Directors make estimates of the amount of rebate that will become payable by the Group under these 
agreements, based upon their best estimates of volumes and product mix that will be sold over each individual rebate agreement 
period. Where the respective customer has been engaged with the Group for a number of years, historical settlement trends are 
also used to assist in ensuring an appropriate estimate is recorded at the reporting date and that appropriate internal approvals 
and reviews take place before rebates are recorded. 
The total rebate payable provision at 31 July 2017 included within trade and other payables is £5,061,000 (2016: £5,414,000). 
The sales rebate provision is recognised within trade payables, rather than trade receivables, as a significant proportion of the 
agreements across the Group do not provide for credit notes to be raised against receivable balances. Rather, cash payment 
of the rebate amount due is expected. Furthermore, the majority of rebate agreements do not contain a clause which provides 
a legally enforceable right to offset invoiced amounts.
The total rebate provision of £5,061,000 included within trade and other payables is based on the Directors’ best estimate of 
customer sales over the rebate agreement period. The provision as at 31 July 2017 is based on the Directors’ sales estimate 
based on prior year trading and results. Given that the rebate provision represents an estimate within the financial statements, 
there is a risk that the Directors’ estimate of the potential liability may be incorrect.

The contingent consideration included within the other financial liabilities note relates to the acquisition of VoltAir System AB. The total 
contingent consideration payable is based on VoltAir’s EBITDA performance for the twelve months to 31 December 2017. At the date 
of acquisition the Group estimated the EBITDA result for the twelve-month period and has recognised a liability based on this estimate. 
Management anticipates that the additional consideration payable will be SEK 16,930,000. This is equivalent to £1,588,000 using the 
spot rate as at 31 July 2017 or £1,506,000 using the spot rate on the date of acquisition (29 May 2017), as is disclosed in note 16. Volution Group plc

23. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Accounting policy
Borrowings and other financial liabilities, including loans, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Borrowings and other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the 
expected life of the financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

The interest rate on borrowings includes a margin that is dependent on the consolidated leverage level of the Group in respect of the most 
recently completed reporting period. For the year ended 31 July 2016, Group leverage was between 1.0:1 and 1.5:1 and therefore the 
margin was 1.25%. The consolidated leverage level fell below 1.0:1 for the year ended 31 July 2016 and therefore the margin for the first 
period of the year ended 31 July 2017 was 1.00%. At the half year, the consolidated leverage remained below 1.0:1 and therefore the margin 
for the second period of the year ended 31 July 2017 was 1.00%; this rate will continue into the first period of the year ended 31 July 2018.
At 31 July 2017, the Group had £37,010,000 (2016: £38,131,000) of its multi-currency revolving credit facility unutilised.  Volution Group plc

24. Provisions
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions for the expected costs of maintenance guarantees are charged against profits when products have been invoiced.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation taking into 
account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. The timings of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and are 
therefore best estimates. Provisions are not discounted as the time value of money is not considered material.
Provisions for warranties and property dilapidations
Provisions for warranties are made with reference to recent trading history and historical warranty claim information, and the view 
of management as to whether warranty claims are expected. 
Warranty provisions are determined with consideration given to recent customer trading and management experience.
Dilapidation provisions relate to dilapidation charges relating to leasehold properties. The timing of cash flows associated with the 
dilapidation provision is dependent on the timing of the lease agreement termination.

Product warranties
A provision is recognised for warranty costs expected to be incurred in the following twelve months on products sold during the 
year and in prior years. Product warranties can range between one and five years; however, based on management’s knowledge 
of the products, claims in relation to warranties after more than twelve months are rare and highly immaterial.
Property dilapidations
A provision has been recognised for dilapidations relating to obligations under leases for leasehold buildings and will be payable 
at the end of the lease term. Volution Group plc

is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference 
between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in share premium. Share options exercised during 
the period are satisfied with treasury shares.

At 31 July 2017, a total of 1,166,878 (2016: 916,878) ordinary shares in the Company were held by the Volution EBT, all of which 
were unallocated and available for transfer to participants of the Long Term Incentive Plan and Deferred Share Bonus Plan on exercise. 
During the year 250,000 ordinary shares in the Company were purchased by the trustees (2016: 916,878), and nil (2016: nil) were 
disposed of by the trustees. The market value of the shares at 31 July 2017 was £2,220,000 (2016: £1,421,000).
The Volution EBT has agreed to waive its rights to dividends.
26. Deferred tax
Accounting policy
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: 
 > where the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 > in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider it is probable that there will be taxable profits 
from which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only 
if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred taxes relate to the same 
taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other 
comprehensive income. Similarly, deferred tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or 
charged directly to equity. 
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based on the likely 
timing and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. Uncertainties 
exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws and the amount and timing of future 
taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing 
contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such 
assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.
At 31 July 2017, the Group had not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of gross tax losses of £5,195,000 (2016: £5,195,000) 
relating to management expenses, capital losses of £3,975,000 (2016: £3,975,000) arising in UK subsidiaries and gross tax 
losses of £385,000 (2016: £264,000) arising in overseas entities as there is insufficient evidence that the losses will be utilised. 
These losses are available to be carried indefinitely. 
At 31 July 2017, the Group had no deferred tax liability (2016: £nil) to recognise for taxes that would be payable on the remittance 
of certain of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries’ unremitted earnings. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised as the 
Group has determined that there are no undistributed profits in overseas subsidiaries where an additional tax charge would 
arise on distribution. Volution Group plc

28. Risk management
Accounting policy 
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk. 
Instruments used are principally foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps. Further details of derivative financial 
instruments are included in notes 19 and 22.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to 
their fair value at the reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is immediately recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the relationship is more 
than twelve months and as a current asset or a current liability if the remaining maturity of the relationship is less than twelve months. 
No derivative contracts have been designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
Hedge of net investments
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including a hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the net 
investment, are accounted for as follows: gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge 
are recognised in OCI while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in profit or loss. On disposal of 
the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.
The Group uses borrowings in local currencies as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign operations.
As a result of entering into financial instruments, the Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments are: 
 > interest-bearing loans and borrowings;
 > trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, cash and short-term deposits; and
 > foreign exchange forward contracts. 
This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on the specific risks the Group is exposed to.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk. 
Forward foreign currency contracts
The Group’s purchases in foreign currencies, net of Group sales in those currencies, represent less than 1% (2016: 3%) of total 
material and component purchases. Each quarter the Group enters into forward exchange contracts for the purchase of the budgeted 
monthly net expenditure in US Dollars for the following rolling 15 months. Hedge accounting is not applied for these derivatives.
The Group’s criteria for entering into a forward foreign currency contract would require that the instrument must:
 > be related to anticipated foreign currency commitment;
 > involve the same currency as the foreign currency commitment; and
 > reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Group’s operations.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. 
Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risks, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. 
The Group’s exposure is primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to these risks when appropriate. 
At 31 July 2017, the Group had commitments under forward foreign exchange contracts with varying settlement dates to 23 July 2018 
(2016: 24 July 2017). See notes 19 and 22 for fair values.
Sensitivity analysis 
The Group recognises that movements in certain risk variables (such as interest rates or foreign exchange rates) might affect the value 
of its derivatives and also the amounts recorded in its equity in the overseas entities and its statement of comprehensive income for 
the period. Therefore the Group has assessed:
 > what would be reasonably possible changes in the risk variables at the end of the reporting period; and
 > the effects on profit or loss and equity if such changes in the risk variables were to occur. Volution Group plc
Annual Report 2017 135
Financial Statements
28. Risk management continued
Interest rate risk
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on the Group’s floating rate loans 
and borrowings which at the relevant reporting dates are not hedged. With all other variables being constant the Group’s profit before 
tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows. There is only an immaterial impact on the Group’s equity.

The assigned movement in basis points for interest rate sensitivity analysis is based upon the currently observable market environment.
The Group cash balances are held in bank current accounts and earn immaterial levels of interest. Management has concluded that 
any changes in the Libor and SEK Libor rates will have an immaterial impact on interest income earned on the Group cash balances. 
No interest rate sensitivity has been included in relation to the Group’s cash balances.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily arises when revenue and expenses are denominated in a different currency 
from the Group’s presentational currency. Foreign exchange risk also arises when the individual entities enter into transactions that are 
not denominated in their functional currency.
The following tables illustrate the impact of several changes to the spot GBP/USD, GBP/EUR and GBP/SEK exchange rates of +5%. 
The tables below reflect the impact on profit before tax and equity if those changes were to occur. Only the impact of changes in the 
SEK, USD and Euro-denominated balances have been considered as these are the most significant non-GBP denominations used 
by the Group.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk for the Group arises from the management of working capital commitments and meeting its financial obligations as they fall 
due. The Group’s policy is to regularly review cash flow forecasts/projections as well as information regarding cash balances to ensure 
that it has significant cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. The Group reviews its long-term funding requirements 
in parallel with its long-term strategy, with an objective of aligning both in a timely manner. At the reporting date, forecasts indicate that 
the Group is expected to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations for the foreseeable future.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
There are no material differences between the book values and fair values for any of the Group’s financial instruments carried at amortised 
cost. Derivative financial instruments have all been valued using other techniques, for which all inputs that have a significant effect on 
the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations under a 
financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from its operating 
activities (primarily for trade receivables – credit sales) and from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial 
institutions and other financial instruments.
Trade receivables
The Group’s finance function has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed by each business unit subject 
to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer receivables 
are regularly monitored and credit insurance is used where applicable. The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due 
nor impaired is assessed by reference to external credit ratings where available; otherwise, historical information relating to counterparty 
default rates is used. The Group continually assesses the recoverability of trade receivables and the level of provisioning required. 
Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group on a prepayment/pro-forma basis. 
Refer to note 18 for the table of the age of accounts receivable that are past due.
The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance account and the amount of loss is recognised within the 
consolidated income statement. When a receivable balance is considered uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance for 
doubtful accounts. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
The Group evaluated the concentration of credit risk with respect of trade receivables as low in view of the Group’s large and 
diversified client base, which is located in several jurisdictions, and the Group’s established credit policies. Volution Group plc
Annual Report 2017 137
Financial Statements
28. Risk management continued
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Group’s policy. The Group deposits 
cash with reputable financial institutions, from which management believes the possibilities of loss to be remote. The Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk for the components of the statement of financial position at 31 July 2017 and 2016 is the carrying amount. 
The Group’s maximum exposure for derivative financial instruments is noted in either note 22 on page 129 or in the liquidity table 
on the previous page.
Capital risk management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management policy is to ensure that it has the capital required to operate and grow the 
business at a reasonable cost of capital without incurring undue financial risks. The Board periodically reviews its capital structure to 
ensure it meets changing business needs. The Group defines its capital as its share capital (excluding treasury shares), share premium 
account, foreign currency translation reserves and retained earnings. In addition, the Directors consider the management of debt to be 
an important element in controlling the capital structure of the Group. The Group may carry significant levels of long-term structural 
and subordinated debt to fund investments and acquisitions and has arranged debt facilities to allow for fluctuations in working capital 
requirements. There have been no changes to the capital management policy in the current period. Management manages capital on 
an ongoing basis to ensure that covenant requirements on third party debt are met.
Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: 
 > Level 1 – quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 > Level 2 – other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly; and
 > Level 3 – techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.
Financial instruments carried at fair value comprise the derivative financial instruments in notes 19 and 22 and the contingent consideration 
in notes 16 and 22. For hierarchy purposes derivative financial instruments are deemed to be Level 2 as external valuers are involved 
in the valuation of these contracts. Their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the DCF model. Inputs to this 
calculation include the expected cash flows in relation to these derivative contracts and relevant discount rates. Contingent 
consideration is deemed to be Level 3.
29. Related party transactions
Transactions between Volution Group plc and its subsidiaries, and transactions between subsidiaries, are eliminated on consolidation 
and are not disclosed in this note. A breakdown of transactions between the Group and its related parties is disclosed below. 
No related party loan note balances exist at 31 July 2017 or 31 July 2016. 
There were no material transactions or balances between the Company and its key management personnel or members of their close

Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Payments under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Operating lease commitments
The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain items of land and building and others. These leases have an average life of 
between five and 15 years with no renewal option included in the contracts. There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering 
into these contracts.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

32. Share-based payments
The Company operates a share-based incentive scheme for Directors and key employees, known as the Volution Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP). Share options were granted in October 2014, November 2015 and October 2016; these nil-cost options normally vest 
after three years assuming continuing employment with the Company. The extent to which the options will vest is dependent upon the 
Company’s performance over a three-year period set at the date of grant. The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the 
Company’s relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance and the other 50% by the Company’s cumulative average EPS growth. 
The TSR element of the options granted has been valued using the Group’s share price volatility, the correlation between the share 
price movements of TSR comparators and the relevant vesting schedule.

34. Glossary of terms
Adjusted basic and diluted EPS – calculated by dividing the adjusted profit/(loss) for the period attributable to ordinary equity 
holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the adjusted net profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary equity holders 
of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of any dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. There are no 
dilutive potential ordinary shares for the years ended 31 July 2017 and 31 July 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA – EBITDA removing exceptional items and other non-recurring items not meeting the definition of exceptional.
Adjusted finance costs – finance costs removing net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value.
Adjusted operating cash flow – adjusted EBITDA plus or minus movements in operating working capital, less net investments 
in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
Adjusted operating profit – operating profit removing exceptional items, other non-recurring items not meeting the definition 
of exceptional and amortisation of intangible assets associated with the customer base, trademarks and patents.
Adjusted profit after tax – profit after tax removing exceptional items, other non-recurring items not meeting the definition of 
exceptional, net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value, amortisation of intangible assets associated with the customer 
base, trademarks and patents, and the tax effect on these items.
Adjusted profit before tax – profit before tax removing exceptional items, other non-recurring items not meeting the definition 
of exceptional, net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value and amortisation of intangible assets associated with the 
customer base, trademarks and patents. 
Adjusted tax charge – the reported tax charge less the tax effect on the adjusted items.
Cash conversion – calculated by dividing adjusted operating cash flow by adjusted EBITDA less depreciation.
Constant currency – to determine values expressed as being at constant currency we have converted the income statement of 
our foreign operating companies for the year ended 31 July 2017 at the average exchange rate for the period ended 31 July 2016. 
In addition, we have converted the UK operating companies’ sale and purchase transactions in the year ended 31 July 2017, 
which were denominated in foreign currencies, at the average exchange rates for the year ended 31 July 2016. 
EBITDA – profit before tax, net finance costs, depreciation and amortisation. 
Like for like – the performance of the Group as though the position of the Group was the same as it was in the comparative period. 
Net debt – bank borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Operating cash flow – EBITDA plus or minus movements in operating working capital, less share-based payment expense, less net 
investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
Other non-recurring items not meeting the definition of exceptional – these are items of expense incurred by the Group which 
are non-recurring but do not meet the IFRS definition of exceptional items; they have been adjusted for to give a fairer representation 
of the underlying performance of the business. Volution Group plc

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 
For the year ended 31 July 2017
1. General information
These financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Volution Group plc (the Company) 
on 10 October 2017.
The Company is a public limited company and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK (registered number: 09041571). The share 
capital of the Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The address of its registered office is Fleming Way, Crawley, 
West Sussex RH10 9YX.
2. Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Volution Group plc (the Company) are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling (£), rounded to the nearest thousand (£000) unless otherwise stated. They have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act and not presented an income 
statement or a statement of comprehensive income for the Company. The profit for the year is disclosed in the statement of changes 
in equity.
The policies applied by the Company are consistent with those set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The following 
additional policies are also relevant to the Company financial statements.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including directly attributable 
transaction costs. The carrying value is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.
Dividends received 
Revenue is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when the shareholders 
approve the dividend. 
Financial instruments
For detailed disclosures of financial instruments refer to note 28 of the Group financial statements.
New standards and interpretations 
There were no new or amended accounting standards relevant to the Company’s results that are effective for the first time in 2017 that 
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The following standards and interpretations have an effective date after the date of these financial statements. The Company plans to 
adopt them from the effective dates adopted by the EU and is currently completing an impact assessment to be able to quantify the 
effect the new standards will have on the Company financial statements. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued in July 2014 to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 
has been endorsed by the EU and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will be adopted by the 
Company on 1 August 2018.
IFRS 9 will impact the classification and measurement of the Company’s financial instruments and will require certain additional 
disclosures. IFRS 9 also introduces changes to impairments of financial assets, which will result in the Company moving from an 
incurred loss model to an expected loss model. Although the new standard will impact the way in which bad debt provisions are 
calculated, the Company does not anticipate that the impact of this change will be significant. Volution Group plc

Financial Statements
Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 July 2017
2. Basis of preparation continued
New standards and interpretations continued
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was issued in May 2014 and has been endorsed by the EU. The subsequent 
amendments, Clarifications to IFRS 15, issued in April 2016, have not yet been endorsed by the EU. IFRS 15, as amended, 
is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will be adopted by the Company, subject to EU 
endorsement, on 1 August 2018.
The Directors do not consider that IFRS 15 will have a significant impact on the Company.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in January 2016 to replace IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The standard 
is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and will be adopted by the Company, subject to EU endorsement, 
on 1 August 2019. 
The Directors do not consider IFRS 16 to have a significant impact on the Company.
Other new standards or interpretations in issue, but not yet effective, are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s 
net assets or results.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the Company financial statements requires the use of certain judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom 
equal the actual results. The estimates and assumptions relevant to the financial statements are embedded with the relevant notes to 
the consolidated financial statements.
Carrying value of investments
The key source of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that has a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the parent 
company financial statements is the recoverability of the investments set out in note 9. 
The recoverability is estimated based on the expected performance and value of the investments, factoring in potential expected future 
net cash flow to be generated from the investments. The Company based its estimation on information available when these financial 
statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes 
or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected when they occur.

The interest rate on borrowings includes a margin that is dependent on the consolidated leverage level of the Group in respect of the 
most recently completed reporting period. For the year ended 31 July 2016, Group leverage was between 1.0:1 and 1.5:1 and therefore 
the margin was 1.25%. The consolidated leverage level fell below 1.0:1 for the year ended 31 July 2016 and therefore the margin for the 
first period of the year ended 31 July 2017 was 1.00%. At the half year the consolidated leverage remained below 1.0:1 and therefore the 
margin for the second period of the year ended 31 July 2017 was 1.00%; this rate will continue into the first period of the year ended 
31 July 2018.
At 31 July 2017 the Group had £37,010,000 (2016: £38,131,000) of its multi-currency revolving credit facility unutilised.  Volution Group plc

Forward-looking statements
The Annual Report and Accounts contains certain statements, statistics 
and projections that are or may be forward looking. The accuracy and 
completeness of all such statements including, without limitation, 
statements regarding the future financial position, strategy, projected 
costs, plans and objectives for the management of future operations of 
Volution Group plc and its subsidiaries is not warranted or guaranteed. 
These statements typically contain words such as “intends”, “expects”, 
“anticipates” and “estimates” and words of similar import. By their nature, 
forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they 
relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. 
Although Volution Group plc believes that the expectations reflected in 
such statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such 
expectations will prove to be correct. There are a number of factors, 
which may be beyond the control of Volution Group plc, that could cause 
actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed 
or implied by such forward-looking statements. Other than as required 
by applicable law or the applicable rules of any exchange on which our 
securities may be listed, Volution Group plc has no intention or obligation 
to update forward-looking statements contained herein. Volution Group’s commitment to environmental 
issues is reflected in this annual report which 
has been printed on Arcoprint, an FSC
