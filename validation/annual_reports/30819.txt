OUR MARKET
The Group operates in the Consumer Legal 
Services market enabling consumers to  
access support when it matters.
We are focused on Personal Injury,  
(the largest of the CLS segments),  
Critical Care and Residential Property.
Personal Injury
The PI market has been broadly static in recent years at just 
under one million claims per annum. However, we anticipate a 
softening in the overall market as a result of a reduction in Road 
Traffic Accident (RTA) claims caused by the cumulative impact 
of prior legislative change which has resulted in demand 
uncertainty.
Whilst data from April 2017 onwards is not yet available, our 
belief is that non-RTA volumes will remain broadly static and, 
coupled with our enquiry rate increasing
2
 year on year, we will 
therefore have increased our market share.   
There has been an apparent decline in Employer Liability cases 
but this is attributed to a significant reduction in noise induced 
hearing loss (NIHL) cases rather than an overall reduction in 
these claims. NAH has deliberately not been active in the volume 
NIHL market due to concerns about the nature of some claims 
and so its value to Panel Law Firms (PLFs). There has been a 
marked increase in claims categorised as “other” and this is 
driven by a spike in foreign, gastric illness claims which is an area 
that NAH is not engaged with.
External factors such as ministerial changes and Britain’s 
intended exit from the European Union have created increased 
uncertainty about the implementation of reforms proposed by 
the former Chancellor of the Exchequer. The delay in progressing 
the Civil Liability Bill will inevitably push out the timelines for 
regulatory change.

Consumer Legal Services
Consumer Legal Services (CLS) continues to be a fragmented 
market with a great deal of confusion from consumers around 
the legal process and how to access it. Ongoing media 
commentary around the market itself and changes to it 
(including Personal Injury reforms, Stamp Duty and so on) add 
to this sense of uncertainty.  The knock-on effect of this is that 
consumers can find it challenging to identify the best provider 
for their legal concern from amongst the many choices open to 
them in the market. 
In order to support consumers in making the right choice, we 
firmly believe there is a need for greater clarity and guidance and 
for the legal sector to identify trusted, knowledgeable partners 
to work with. The speed of the development of the sector and 
the myriad ways that consumers can access this help is 
increasing. NAHL Group plc has been at the leading edge of this 
change to ensure that it is in the best possible position to provide 
the support and guidance that consumers need in the wake of 
these ongoing changes. 
Our three divisions focus on the Personal Injury (PI), Critical 
Care ((CC), incorporating medical reporting/rehabilitation) and 
Residential Property (RP) markets within CLS. These markets 
are valued at £6.7bn

Critical Care
Despite being a relatively small market, in comparison to the others in 
which we operate, 2017 has, nevertheless, seen some interesting 
developments. There have been a number of mergers and 
acquisitions amongst the smaller providers whilst some of the larger 
Fast T rack companies have developed propositions in the 
catastrophic sector .
The war for talent is an ongoing and  important dynamic so 
continuing our focus on quality and supporting our consultant base 
remains a key priority and during the year we have increased the 
number of Case Managers working with Bush. 
Although the regulatory changes in PI do not directly affect Bush we 
have seen growing cost pressures and price sensitivity as firms 
grapple with the impact of overall lower claims revenue in other 
sectors of the market. In addition we anticipate government initiatives 
that focus on the use of technology to create efficiencies for the 
courts, including, reduced court time and associated expenses. This 
will have the benefit of affording our experts more time for other 
areas of their core work. Bush is further responding to these trends 
by taking steps to ensure its own report templates and processes are 
as streamlined as possible. 
We are also sensing a greater focus on a more strategic approach by 
firms who are adopting a procurement based model. Bush has 
successfully adapted to compete effectively in such initiatives, 
securing insurer contracts that help us grow joint instructions.
An additional, positive development has been a growing number of 
strategic partnerships. As an example Bush has been working with
 the Child Brain Injury T rust (CBIT) on a new commercial alliance 
which we anticipate will contribute to 2018 growth.
Residential Property
The RP market has continued to be challenging with a 25% drop in 
volume sales in 2017
1
 – resulting in a  30 year low in home 
ownership
2
. The result of this is that 46.1% of people between the 
ages of 25 and 34 are renting privately, up from 24.2% in 2005-06
3
. 
This challenge was recognised by the Government in their 
decision at the Budget to remove Stamp Duty for first time 
buyers in a bid to stem this decline and encourage a pick up at 
the entry end of the market. 
Homebuyers’ confidence is a key driver of market performance and 
research
4
 in Q4 showed that this is at its lowest level since December 
2012. Furthermore, between April and October 2017 house price 
optimism dropped 14 points
5
, matching the record fall following the 
EU Referendum result.
Whilst these difficulties in the market have made for a tough 
environment for Fitzalan and Searches, the Government’s action on 
looking to rejuvenate the first time buyer market did open the 
opportunity for the division to provide a one-stop shop for those 
looking to purchase their own home, providing all the help and 
information they will need while navigating this complex process.

BUSINESS MODEL
Providing exceptional service to our  
consumers and partners by being  
outstanding at everything we do.
What we do Value created for stakeholders
Empathise and Understand
Our teams take the time to empathise with the 
consumer’s position and gain a full understanding 
of their needs. Once they have all the necessary 
information they are best placed to recommend a 
course of action. 
Act and Deliver
Consumers are then matched with an expert who is 
most appropriate to serve their needs, be they as legal 
firm, surveyor, Expert Witness or Case Manager. They 
are then on their way to a satisfactory outcome.
How we get paid
Customers pay for these services either via commercial 
agreement for the supply of services (PI) or a fee per 
finalised instruction (RP). In our ABSs we are paid a 
pre-agreed proportion of the consumer’s final settlement. 
In CC, the Expert Witness service receives a fee per 
finalised report while the Case Management service is 
paid on an ongoing basis dependent on the level of 
support provided.
Consumers
The Group is committed to ensuring 
that consumers receive an exceptional 
service at every stage of their journey, 
constantly looking for ways to improve 
and develop in order to secure their 
trust in us when it matters.
Shareholders
The Group is focused on increasing 
long-term shareholder value through the 
execution of its chosen strategy and 
prudent capital management. 
Partners
The Group operates in a fair and 
transparent way with all corporate 
partners, delivering to agreed 
conversion rates and service levels, 
providing high quality cases and 
ensuring appropriate match and fit 
with consumers.
Attract
In our PI and RP divisions, we leverage our brands and 
digital marketing is used to attract consumers. While in 
CC, this is achieved through an awareness of the clinical 
expertise, experience, independence and reputation of 
the business and its consultants who work on behalf of 
Bush.

Values in Action Value created for stakeholders
     
Consumers supported
151,178
Proud of our Values
Our businesses take their obligation to operate responsibly 
extremely seriously and we are proud of the work that we 
have done in this area, not just within our own divisions but 
with the wider consumer law community.  This commitment 
is borne out in our Values which inspire both our personal 
and business behaviours and activities.  To this end, we are 
proud that our Values can be so evidently shown in action:
Curious 
We have been aware that the PI industry has been in need  
of a new approach for some time, with a view to improving the 
consumer experience. Being Curious about how we could be at 
the forefront of this, NAH created its own ABSs. Your Law and 
National Law Partners both enable NAH to get closer to the claim 
while also providing a streamlined experience for the consumer .
Driven 
We know that cold calling has played a large part in the 
negative public perception of the PI industry. As a business 
we have never made, and will never make, a cold call and so 
have been Driven to eradicate this blight on the industry. 
NAH has actively lobbied Government to ban this intrusive 
and damaging practice. Having led the charge, we are 
delighted, therefore, that the Government has brought 
forward legislation to make cold calling illegal in the UK.  
This is likely to be implemented in 2019. 
Passionate
Bush is Passionate about providing the best possible service 
and support to those who have suffered a catastrophic 
injury by delivering the highest clinical standards to its 
consumers. This passion has been evidenced in 2017 by 
Bush being awarded Rehabilitation Provider of the Year in 
the Lawyer Monthly Annual Awards. We were also thrilled 
when two Bush Case Managers received industry awards 
this year - Rachel Wilson as Case Management Society UK 
(CMSUK) ‘Catastrophic’ Case Manager of the Year and 
Kayur Kotecha as CMSUK Clinical Case Manager of the Year.
Unified 
Being Unified reflects not only how our colleagues interact  
with one another but also with consumers. In our RP division 
we know how overwhelming buying your first home can be 
– especially when areas of law and financing can be so 
changeable. As a result, bringing together all this vital 
information within the First Time Buyers’ Hub, including 
guidance related to the Stamp Duty changes announced in 
the Budget, was an important step towards accompanying 
homebuyers on this exciting and all-consuming journey. 
We are Passionate
We care about what we do and how we do it,  
we empathise with our customers and keep  
our promises.
We are Unified
We are one team committed to integrity, taking 
individual responsibility for our actions whilst 
trusting and respecting each other. 8 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

STRATEGY IN ACTION
Preparing for change, investing in the future.
This feedback informed our new advertising campaign 
which focuses on what our advisors  
do best – conversations – and the empathic  
and knowledgeable support that they provide.  
The Legal Support Advisors at NAH are experts  
in sensitively accompanying consumers through the 
complex and sometimes daunting process of making a 
claim. This new brand differentiates us, not only from 
our previous marketing messages, but also those of 
the majority of our competitors. For us and our 
consumers it’s about accessing justice. 
NAH’s new strapline of ‘When it’s wrong, make it 
right’ reflects this focus on justice and now 
permeates all activities throughout the business. 
Government Consultation results –  
NAH was ready
In February 2017, the Government announced the 
results of its Consultation on reforming the soft 
tissue injury (whiplash) claims process which 
included:
• Setting the small claims limit to £2,000 for 
non-RTA and £5,000 for RTA (as against 
£5,000 across the board, as could have been 
the case).
• The Government will ban pre-medical offers to 
settle RTA related whiplash claims.
• The ban will cover both the offering and 
requesting of such settlements, and there will 
be no exceptions to the ban.
• It is anticipated that these changes will take 
place no earlier than Q2 2019.
The results were better than expected for NAH and 
the business was well placed to respond.  NAH 
didn’t wait for the announcement to come in order 
to plan for its future and so had been strategising 
around the possible outcomes for some time. As a 
result, we were on the front foot when the 
announcement came, enabling us to move forward 
with our plans for growth.
Personal Injury
2017 has been a year of continued investment in 
the PI division with a number of new projects which, 
we believe, will further establish NAH as the 
company of choice for those who need to access 
justice.
A fresh, new brand
We began the year by initiating our brand redesign 
and new campaign.  Having carried out extensive 
research into the market and how it presents itself, 
our new activities were borne out of this feedback. 
We discovered that our consumers often feel that 
they have been wronged by their injury – it may 
have caused them to suffer long lasting effects 
meaning that their quality of life is changed, or they 
may have lost earnings through being unable to 
work. In these circumstances, they need the help 
that NAH can give to make it right again.

Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Increasing market share 
These plans include NAH’s medium-term strategy 
to grow its share of the personal injury market, 
whilst continuing to provide high quality marketing 
services to its PLFs. As a result, we were able to 
launch two ABSs this year.  
Your Law LLP 
The first, Your Law LLP , is a joint venture with  
NewLaw and went live in July 2017. Your Law 
operates out of offices in Cardiff and Bristol and 
services in excess of 1,000 new consumers each 
month. Your Law focuses on personal injury law 
but also has the capacity to provide other 
consumer law services. Both parties are excited 
about the potential for further growth of Your Law.  
The launch of Your Law is also important to us in 
our aim to continue to provide high quality advice 
that consumers can trust, while championing our 
ethical business model. This joint venture reflects 
our confidence in the future of the industry in the 
face of further regulatory changes.
National Law Partners
In November, we were pleased to launch our 
second ABS, National Law Partners, a further joint 
venture working with law firm Lyons Davidson. 
National Law Partners operates from Lyons 
Davidson’s offices in Cardiff and employs around 
35 staff seconded in from the firm. National Law 
Partners has also established a legal services team 
in Kettering which handles the front end of the 
claims process for the ABS, ensuring that we can 
contribute our expertise in this area.
As with Your Law, the claims being processed via 
National Law Partners don’t constrain the supply of 
enquiries to our PLFs and we remain committed to 
operating a UK-wide panel of solicitors providing 
both full geographical coverage and market leading 
expertise.  
Upfront investment for future profit
The development of the ABSs presents a change in 
how the revenue from these businesses is recognised 
as compared to the PI division as a whole. We have 
made a large upfront investment into these new 
ventures and the returns will not be seen until future 
years. This was a planned development with the 
intention that the vast majority of revenue and profits 
generated from these ventures will not materialise until  
liability for the claim is admitted, reflecting the time it 
takes to process a claim.
Investing in the consumer experience
As with all businesses, the power of digital and 
its potential impact on the bottom line, isn’t to be 
underestimated. Alongside the new brand and 
campaigns came further investment in our 
digital capabilities, both with regard to attracting 
higher numbers of consumers and ensuring 
they can complete a greater degree of the 
claim process online.   12 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
STRATEGY IN ACTION CONTINUED
“I spoke to a young lady who was very approachable and 
listened to what I had to say - asking how I was feeling 
and being worried about my injuries. I felt like I was in  
the right hands.” – David
David’s story
My name is David, I’m 69 years old and I’m retired. I 
love riding my motorbike and doing it up, I do a lot of 
my own mechanics. I was riding my motorbike when a 
van suddenly pulled across in front of me. I had no 
chance of avoiding him or to stop, and I hit the side of 
it.  I was thrown over the top and was knocked out. My 
wrist was broken and I suffered concussion.  
Having a broken wrist made life very difficult,  
I couldn’t wash myself properly and had to keep 
asking people to do things around the house. I also 
couldn’t ride my bike which was written off after the 
accident, so I had to take the bus which, where I live, is 
challenging as they’re every two hours. 
As soon as it happened I thought ‘this guy’s not going 
to get away with it’ . He didn’t even come over and 
apologise after it happened.  I rang the National 
Accident Helpline. 
I’d never had an accident before, so I didn’t know what 
to expect but I spoke to a young lady who was very 
approachable and listened to what I had to say - asking 
how I was feeling and being worried about my injuries. 
I felt like I was in the right hands.
 
They passed my details on to the solicitors who took it

Developing partnerships, 
demonstrating excellence.
Critical Care
In the last year Bush has concentrated much of its 
focus on building its new strategic affinity 
relationships, including with the Child Brain Injury T rust 
(CBIT). Our success in securing such relationships 
stems from Bush’s excellent reputation in the CC 
sector . It also demonstrates the cohesion between the 
values, aims and ambitions of our partner 
organisations. 
Developing market share
Bush remains focused on continuing to develop 
market share through the organic growth of our 
core business, building on relationships with 
solicitors firms alongside other strategic 
partnerships. These relationships are vital to us in 
our growth plans.  
 
Improving efficiencies has been an important area 
of development for us this year, with our projects  
to streamline our own templates, saving Case 
Managers and Expert Witnesses valuable time as 
well as providing uniformity. We expect these 
changes to ensure we are ahead of the curve as 
further efficiencies within the court and legal 
system work their way through. 
Demonstrating excellence
Formalising and demonstrating excellence is a 
large part of winning contracts and securing work 
for Bush. To this end, we were delighted to be 
awarded Lawyer Monthly’s Rehabilitation Provider 
of the Year as well as the Investors in People Silver 
grade at our first assessment – a great 
achievement. This second award reflected Bush’s 
success in fully engaging the staff in its aspirations 
as well as their own commitment to identifying the 
role each of them plays in delivering against Bush’s 
ambitious growth strategy.

2017 Revenue

Divisional Review – Personal Injury
During 2017 we made strong progress in preparing for 
the regulatory changes previously announced by the 
Ministry of Justice. It is anticipated that these changes 
will take place no earlier than Q2 2019.
 
Our preparation for these changes included a 
brand relaunch for National Accident Helpline and 
the establishment and operational launch of two 
ABS ventures. These ventures involve investment 
in certain types of PI cases, with a consequential 
deferral of cash flow, revenue and profit 
recognition. We continued to invest in cases with 
our strategic PLF partners. 
 
Metrics from our brand relaunch in June 2017 have 
been building and we are pleased with progress, 
operating under the theme ‘When it’s wrong, make 
it right’.
 
Investment in cases with PLFs and through our 
ABS ventures changes our medium-term profit  
and cash profiles as we build the number of cases 
in progress, and is the primary reason behind the 
reduction in Group profits in the current year. PI 
operating profits are down from £14.1m in 2016 to 
£11.0m in 2017, with the related deferral of profits 
intended to support future earnings’ stability  
and predictability. Early indications from our ABS 
ventures have been positive, moreover, we are 
already identifying ways to improve their returns, 
supporting our strategy of investing in ABS 
structures.
Our preparations for regulatory changes continue 
in 2018, particularly in relation to the 
consequences of the expected significant change 
in the small claims limit, and the potential 
compensation available for low value whiplash 
injuries in road traffic accidents (RTA). We 
anticipate a broadly unchanged landscape in terms 
of the number of accidents, and the number of 
consumers seeking redress, but expect to 
experience a progressive reduction in PLF appetite 
for these smaller value cases.
Our strategy is twofold – namely to continue to 
work with our PLF partners and ABS ventures on PI 
cases, whilst establishing processes in-house to 
support consumers who might be unable to access 
justice through more traditional channels. Whilst 
our PLF partners may be less inclined to work with 
smaller value cases, handled correctly, we believe that 
I am pleased to report the Group’s results for the 
year ended 31 December 2017.
Summary of Financial Performance
2017 has been a year of considerable change for 
the Group, primarily in our Personal Injury (PI) 
division. We performed as expected, with 2017 
revenue ahead at £51.9m (2016: £50.6m), primarily 
due to a 5.5% increase in PI revenues. Underlying 
operating profit declined as expected to £14.5m 
(2016: £18.0m), reflecting marginal growth in our 
non-PI businesses and significant structural 
changes in our PI division, as we invested in cases 
through our newly launched ABSs. Total operating 
profit was £12.6m, down from £16.2m in 2016, after 
charges for share-based payments, amortisation 
of intangible assets acquired on business 
combinations and exceptional items, with profit 
before tax of £12.4m (2016: £15.8m). Earnings per 
share declined 19.6% to 21.7p (2016: 27.0p). 
“We are enthused by the potential for 
change in PI. We have a market leading 
brand, and the leadership team to 
evolve and develop the division to 
create strong, predictable and 
sustainable earnings and cash flow.” 17 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
they still offer NAH a valuable opportunity to leverage 
its twin attibutes of process efficiency and empathic 
customer focus. With this in mind, during 2018 we 
intend to establish a third ABS, incurring set up costs in 
2018 and 2019. This ABS will be small claims ready, 
and will, in due course, provide digitally enabled 
consumer advice and support. Set up costs, including 
capital expenditure, are expected to amount to 
approximately £4.0m during the next 2 years and will 
comprise investment in people, technology and 
process capability.
 
Divisional Review – Critical Care
The Group’s Critical Care (CC) division has 
performed ahead of last year, but experienced 
slightly softer trading in Q4 compared with our 
expectations. Revenue was up 6.6% to £11.0m 
(2016: £10.4m), delivering operating profits up 
2.5% at £3.9m (2016: £3.8m). 
The division has recently secured a number of 
strategic business development opportunities that 
we expect to contribute to growth in H2 2018. 
Divisional Review – Residential Property
The Group’s Residential Property (RP) division has 
performed solidly in difficult market conditions. 
Revenue was down 7.5% to £8.3m (2016: £9.0m), 
with operating profits unchanged at £1.4m. 
Weakening consumer demand and taxation 
changes have impacted residential conveyancing 
volumes across the market. Management has 
responded to difficult market conditions by 
focusing on operational efficiency to good effect.
 
We expect trading conditions to continue to be 
difficult reflecting the macro-economic dynamics 
facing homeowners and consumers generally. 
Balance Sheet and Final Dividend
As previously indicated, cash generation across the 
Group has been lower than in prior years, with a 54.8% 
(2016: 79.7%) cash conversion of underlying operating 
profit from continuing operations into net cash flows 
from operating activities before interest and tax. 
This decline reflects the planned investment in PI 
cases, with a corresponding increase in trade 
receivables and payables on the balance sheet. We 
expect this lower level of cash conversion to continue in 
2018 as we build a sustainable business model for the 
new PI regulatory environment.
 
At the year -end we had adjusted net debt of £12.7m 
(2016: £8.2m), which includes £0.7m of other payables 
relating to the legacy pre-LASPO A TE product. During 
the year we refinanced and significantly increased our 
banking facilities with a £25.0m rolling credit facility 
(RCF) maturing in December 2021, which will support 
our investment in our PI business.
 
The Board proposes, subject to approval of 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 23 May 2018, a final dividend of 10.6p per share 
payable on 31 May 2018 to ordinary shareholders 
registered on 27 April 2018, making a total of 15.9p per 
share payable for the year . 
Dividend Policy
In 2017 , we have invested over £6.5m in PI cases 
through our ABS ventures and with our PLF partners. 
With positive early indications from both ABS 
structures, as well as the identification of ways of 
enhancing their future returns, we expect to accelerate 
this investment in  2018. Whilst our internal projections 
show significant banking facility headroom available 
we wish to maintain this to preserve maximum 
operational flexibility and to allow us to take advantage 
of opportunities which may arise in due course. 
Accordingly, the Board intends to fund further ABS 
investments, partly by amending its dividend 
policy.  With effect from the 2018 interim dividend, 
dividend cover will be increased from 1.5x to 2.0x 
EPS though the total dividend will continue to be 
paid as to one third at the interim stage with the 
balance to be paid following the full year results.  
We will review our dividend policy again in 2020 
having regard to our rate of cash generation and to 
our debt levels both in absolute terms and as 
compared to our operating profits.
Outlook
T rading during the early part of 2018 has been in line 
with expectations.
The evolution of our PI division is on track and we 
plan to counter the financial challenges caused  
by changing regulation. Whilst this necessitates 
investment in both PI cases and operational 
structures and processes, we expect to see some 
payback in 2019, accelerating thereafter. We 
continue to expect 2018 to be a year of transition 
and earnings contraction, however, we are enthused 
by the potential for change in PI. We have a market 
leading brand and the leadership team to evolve and 
develop the division to create strong, predictable and 
sustainable earnings and cash flow.
We anticipate further growth from CC, supported by 
recent commercial successes. The residential 
property marketplace is likely to remain challenging in 
the short term and our focus will be on operational 
efficiency whilst we engineer market share gains.
2017 has been a challenging year, as 2018 will be. 
Our businesses have responded to those 
challenges strongly, and I would like to thank both 
our business partners and our employees for their 
continued support.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Russell Atkinson
Chief Executive Officer
Results
We have delivered continuing underlying operating 
profit of £14.5m from underlying revenue of £51.0m.
The formation of our two ABS ventures, whilst 
working with a smaller number of more efficient 
panel law firms (PLFs), has been the main driver 
of improving our ability to manage demand. Whilst 
the traditional panel model remains core to our 
strategy, the increased flexibility provided by our 
new arrangements has enabled us to invest in the 
brand with confidence. The initial KPIs from the 
ABS ventures have been encouraging and we 
continue to manage and monitor these carefully.
Having reduced investment in the National 
Accident Helpline brand in 2016 we have been able 
to successfully relaunch the brand during the year. 
The new campaign is generating positive results 
with brand metrics improving strongly. Research 
indicates that our trust scores are almost 2.5
1
 
times better than our nearest competitor. 
Additionally, the investment in improving our digital 
functionality has resulted in growing numbers of 
enquiries generated via these new capabilities.
Our Critical Care (CC) division made progress in 
2017 although the final quarter was slightly more 
challenging as a result of a slower than expected 
rollout of some commercial initiatives. However, 
despite this, we have continued to grow market 
share and developed a solid pipeline of contract 
wins. Our credibility as brand leader has been 
further enhanced by winning Lawyer Monthly 
magazine Rehabilitation Provider of the Year.
The Group’s RP business faced further market 
headwinds during 2017 with Land Registry figures 
indicating a decline in annual volume of 25%
2
. 
However, our focus on website conversion, margin 
management and cost control enabled us to report 
profits for this division in line with those of 2016 - a 
robust performance.
Market overview 
The Group continues to operate in the large and 
fragmented Consumer Legal Services (CLS) 
market, remaining focused on PI and RP and we are 
proud to be the UK’s leading marketing services 
provider in the personal injury sector.
“All the key elements of our strategy 
are being successfully implemented 
and we continue to make strong 
progress as we adapt the business.”
Overview
2017 was an important year for the Group as we accelerated the process of 
re-engineering our Personal Injury (PI) division and navigating challenging 
market conditions in Residential Property (RP).
Despite the twin challenges of regulatory uncertainty and market 
headwinds, the Group traded well during 2017 delivering underlying 
operating profit in line with expectations. 
As we have previously indicated, the funding of work within PI impacts 
short-term profit recognition and cash conversion and this is reflected in 
year-on-year comparisons.
Having managed that aspect of our business as planned and whilst 
satisfied with the early contribution of our new ABS ventures, we believe 
that these structures offer a valuable opportunity to leverage the Group’s 
core skills in the PI market to drive future returns still further. 
It is encouraging that all the key elements of our strategy are being successfully 
implemented and we continue to make strong progress as we adapt the 
business to take advantage of the opportunities provided by change.

19 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance Strategic report
The PI market has been broadly static in recent 
years at just under one million claims per annum
3
. 
However, we anticipate there has been a softening 
in the overall market during 2017 as a result of a 
reduction in Road T raffic Accident (RT A) claims 
caused by the cumulative impact of prior legislative 
change which has resulted in reduced marketing 
activity. Whilst data from April 2017 onwards is not yet 
available, our belief is that non-RT A volumes will 
remain largely unchanged and, coupled with our 
enquiry rate increasing year -on-year
4
, we will, 
therefore, have increased our market share. 
The number of Claims Management Companies 
(CMCs) has dropped from a peak of 2,500 in 
2011/12 to approximately 670
5
. The effect of 
previous legislation combined with a continuing 
lack of clarity surrounding the timing and impact  
of regulatory reforms has driven many smaller and 
mid-sized firms to question ongoing profitability 
causing uncertainty in decision making about 
future investment. This has depressed demand in 
the market as a whole for the traditional panel 
model and we expect this trend to continue, albeit 
we plan to mitigate the effect of this through our 
combined ABS and PLF strategy. 
Critical Care focuses exclusively on the catastrophic 
injury market, where we provide expert witness and 
case management services. Whilst not directly 
impacted by the proposed regulatory changes, the 
contagion effect felt by law firms from lower value 
claims, as well as the impact on insurers arising from 
the Ogden Reforms (changes to the discount rate), has 
resulted in some small changes in solicitor and insurer 
behaviour.
The Group’s third business, RP , is focused on lead 
origination and survey and search process 
management in residential property transactions and 
the challenges in this market are well documented. 
Poor availability of housing stock, 30 year lows in home 
ownership, continuing falls in new mortgage approvals 
and low levels of consumer confidence characterise 
the current climate. The Government has taken action 
to stimulate first time buyer transactions but this will 
take time to feed through. The market overall, 
therefore, remains challenging.
PI Regulatory update
In February 2017 the Government published its 
response to the consultation into, amongst other 
things, PI related soft tissue cases and small claims 
which it first announced in November 2015. Over a 
year later, despite the visibility provided by the 
consultation response, there is currently no 
definitive timetable for the introduction of 
legislation. Clearly the political turmoil caused by 
the 2017 general election combined with the 
continuing focus of legislation related to Britain’s 
proposed exit from the European Union means that 
progress has been slow. We anticipate that these 
changes will be implemented no earlier than Q2 
2019.
Strategic development in PI
Our PI division has been making significant 
preparations in anticipation of regulatory change. 
In particular we are now processing our own work 
through ABS ventures. Whilst these are in their 
early stages, we are encouraged by current levels 
of settled income from case successes (or accrued 
income for cases where liability has been admitted, 
though which remain unsettled). 
Our first ABS, now in its eighth month of operation, 
is already profitable month-on-month and has 
covered its projected fixed costs for its first full year 
of operation. Importantly though, we are also 
identifying ways of improving ABS profitability 
through a range of initiatives to improve processes 
and, ultimately, returns. We have consequently 
further refined our business models and we are 
now confident that we understand how to manage 
the financial impact that changes to the small 
claims limit and whiplash reform will have on  
our business. 
The success of our 2017 strategy, continued panel 
demand uncertainty and increased clarity in our 
post-reform business models lead the Board to 
conclude that we are best served to accelerate our 
investment in processing capability. Our strategy 
will continue to evolve and we plan to focus our 
investment in the following areas: 
• extending our ABS capability by creating a third 
ABS that allows NAH deeper involvement in the 
process in preparation for small claims;
• further developing our commercial models  
with PLF partners;
• evolving the National Accident Helpline brand  
to build on the impact created by our new 
campaign; and
• building our digital capability to enable  
a better experience for consumers.
This investment creates a platform for growth  
that will enable us, over time, to transform the 
consumer’s journey from initial contact to 
settlement, modernising the experience and 
offering a more efficient digital proposition 
combined with the service approach for which we 
are already acknowledged. We believe that the 
platform will also enable us to transition into 
processing small claims on an efficient and 
cost-effective basis.
Increased investment means a continuing 
deferment of profit and cash flow that is realised in 
future years as cases settle. However, as the model 
matures, both profit and cash flow will normalise 
enabling us to absorb the impact of regulatory 
changes and grow our market share without 
further significant disruption to the business.

Brand
During 2017 we made an exceptional investment of 
over £1m in relaunching our PI brand, National 
Accident Helpline. The creative approach has been 
developed to reposition the brand and broaden its 
appeal to a wider segment of the market. The 
campaign has been successful and allowed us to 
adjust our media strategy to be more efficient 
using a lower weight of TV advertising than in 
previous years, enabling us to optimise other 
elements of our marketing mix. 
Our focus on enhancing our digital offering has 
seen consumers able to start their claim online. 
This initiative has seen us achieve significant 
growth in such enquiries. Further investment in this 
area will be critical to enable us to support small 
claims and modernise the claims process.
Critical Care, operating under the Bush brand, has 
always had an enviable reputation for clinical 
excellence. Throughout 2017 we continued to 
invest in building this reputation. This has led to 
significant recognition with four important industry 
award wins during the year. Once again, our highly 
successful clinical conference was the centerpiece 
of our marketing activity positioning us as an 
industry thought-leader and further underpinning 
our proposition.
In RP we have continued to evolve our portfolio of 
brands as they focus on a localised organic search 
approach. Particularly pleasing, in a challenging 
market, were the improvements that we made to 
website conversion. Our ability to plan ahead was 
demonstrated by the introduction of our First Time 
Buyers’ Hub the day after the Government 
announced changes to Stamp Duty.
Ongoing focus on the brands that underpin our 
business will always be a core feature of the Group.
Customers
Central to the Group’s strategy has been serving a 
cross-section of claimant, defendant and 
conveyancing law firms with a range of services 
and products. Our customer base is broad, 
currently standing at 697 firms. 
In PI 2017 has seen us begin the process of 
supporting consumers directly, through the 
introduction of Your Law and National Law 
Partners, our ABS ventures. In this way, we now 
earn a proportion of our revenue from successfully 
processing a consumer’s claim. Our PLFs, however, 
continue to play a critical role for us and we have 
evolved our commercial models to provide more 
flexibility and choice.
In CC we continue to grow our customer base and 
this has been crucial in supporting our market 
share growth. Particularly satisfying has been the 
development of larger more strategic relationships 
with key insurers and law firms. In addition we have 
established a contractual relationship with The 
Child Brain Injury Trust (CBIT). This is an important 
charity that helps severely injured children and 
young people and we look forward to supporting 
them.
In RP we optimised our conveyancing panel and 
continue to grow our customer base in Searches.
Operations
The Group operates from four offices across the 
UK and has contact centres in two of these - 
Kettering and London.
Our PI contact centre added new capability during 
2017 in support of our National Law Partners ABS 
and we now progress the call directly through to 
verbal retainer for this proportion of our work. 
Additionally, our ABSs commenced operations 
from the offices of our partners in Bristol and 
Cardiff with specific staff seconded to our 
operations. 35 new jobs were created as a result.
Our Daventry office remains the operational hub of 
CC and, once again, we have continued to grow our 
clinical capability through the introduction of new 
operations managers who support our consultants 
in their interactions with clients.
Our RP division has focused on sharpening our call 
handling processes and adjusting our consumer 
offering to better reflect the nature of the service 
we provide. The impact of these initiatives will be 
seen in better conversion from first contact by the 
consumer, which will be an important part of our 
growth going forward. 
People and values
Our people make us who and what we are and we 
employ a talented and motivated team of 220 staff 
across the Group. In addition, we work with a 
further 164 Expert Witnesses and Case Managers 
who form the cornerstone of the service we provide 
in CC.
Throughout 2017 we have been building our 
capabilities in our PI contact centres which has 
resulted in us employing a further 15 staff. 
Additionally we have strengthened the operational 
management team in CC where we have been 
awarded silver status by Investors in People.
The development of our people continues and we 
have instituted a series of management 
development days and a Group-wide leadership 
school to supplement the on-the-job training that 
we have always provided.
We were encouraged by the outputs from our 
annual employee engagement survey with overall 
engagement scoring over seven times the UK 
national average (see page 28 for further 
information), performing strongly in the areas of 
trust in leadership, feeling valued and 
recommending the Group as a great place to work. 
Additionally staff turnover dropped by 6.8 
percentage points year-on-year.

Outlook
Within PI the pace of regulatory implementation 
has been frustratingly slow, causing continued 
market uncertainty, but we have been very active  
in adapting and developing our business model in 
preparation for the changes. 
Our policy remains to increase investment in self 
processing. Whilst this results in some profits and 
cash being returned over future years as cases 
settle, it inevitably impacts returns during the next 
18 to 24 months as the initial investment continues 
to be made. However, we remain firmly of the view 
that the PI market, despite the well publicised 
regulatory changes of the last few years, remains a 
valuable market to operate in, particularly so for 
NAH with its long history, brand strength and deep 
understanding of the marketplace. 
Properly served, the PI market is still able to 
generate attractive returns provided the operating 
model is cost-effective and case screening is 
rigorous. Increasing our own involvement in the 
end-to-end economics of a PI case enables us to 
leverage our know-how to maximum advantage 
and allows us to absorb the potential impact of the 
small claims and whiplash reforms without 
significant disruption to the business.
Critical Care has established an excellent pipeline 
of business with some significant new contract 
wins. Whilst work continues to convert the 
opportunity into instructions we remain confident 
in the outlook for this division.
Residential Property has managed the headwinds 
of a downturn in the market well. In the short term, 
it is difficult to see the market improving, therefore, 
our focus is on growing market share through a 
number of business development initiatives.
Due to a lack of opportunities aligned with our 
business strategy, we paused our acquisition 
strategy in 2017 but continue to monitor the market 
for suitable small-scale, earnings accretive 
acquisitions to bolster our existing operations.
Whilst there is, undoubtedly, much work to do I am 
confident that we have the strategy and team in 
place to achieve our aims and I am excited by the 
challenge of the year ahead.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REPORT
Overview
The Group performed in line with the Board’s 
expectations in 2017, against a backdrop of 
uncertainty created by regulatory change and 
continued soft markets experienced by some of 
our businesses. It was also a year of progress, 
as our PI division successfully evolved its 
business model in response to these challenges 
and relaunched the National Accident Helpline 
brand, to good effect.
Revenue increased in 2017 by 2.5% to £51.9m 
(2016: £50.6m) but the investments made to 
establish the basis for future growth came with 
significant cost resulting in a decrease to 
underlying operating profit of 19.4% to £14.5m 
(2016: £18.0m). This was as expected. 
The Group continues to maintain a robust 
balance sheet with modest levels of debt and 
a prudent capital model.

Profit before tax 12.4 15.8
Underlying operating profit before share-based 
payments, amortisation of intangible assets 
acquired on business combinations and 
exceptional items decreased by £3.5m. The 
decrease was a consequence of our strategy to 
invest in our PI division in order to grow future 
market share and expand our placement strategy 
ahead of the previously announced regulatory 
changes. 
Financial results for each division are presented in 
note 2, Operating segments. Underlying operating 
profit in the PI division reduced in 2017 by 21.8% to 
£11.0m (2016: £14.1m) as we invested in the 
working capital required to fund cases through our 
two new ABS businesses. These joint operations 
with two of our PLFs will deliver profit as their cases 
begin to settle.
Critical Care had a good year and increased 
underlying operating profit by 2.5% to £3.9m 
(2016: £3.8m). Residential Property delivered a 
creditable performance, delivering £1.4m of 
underlying operating profit (2016: £1.4m) at an 
expanded margin. 
Underlying revenue increased by 3.3% to £51.0m. 
This was mainly a result of the relaunch of the 
National Accident Helpline brand during the year 
and we experienced an increase in leads generated 
year-on-year. PI underlying revenue increased by 
5.5% to £31.7m (2016: £30.0m). Our CC division 
experienced 6.6% growth in revenue to £11.0m 
(2016: £10.4m) and the future outlook for this 
business is encouraging.  23 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Residential Property revenues contracted by 7.5% 
to £8.3m (2016: £9.0m) in a subdued residential 
property market that continues to lack sales 
momentum. The management team is focused on 
growing market share through optimising our 
operations and developing a number of business to 
business (B2B) initiatives. 
After allowing for share-based payments, 
amortisation of intangible assets acquired on 
business combinations, exceptional costs and 
financial income and expense, the Group returned 
a profit before tax of £12.4m, a 21.4% decrease on 
2016 (2016: £15.8m).
Exceptional items
The Group incurred £0.4m of exceptional costs 
during the year (2016: a £0.6m exceptional credit). 
This comprises £1.2m (2016: £0.5m) of costs 
associated with the National Accident Helpline 
brand relaunch and a £0.8m credit relating to 
releases from the pre-LASPO ATE liability and 
associated costs (2016: £1.2m). 
Taxation
The Group’s tax charge of £2.5m (2016: £3.6m) 
represents an effective tax rate of 19.9% (2016: 
22.6%).
Earnings per share (EPS) and dividend
Basic EPS is calculated on the total profit of the 
Group and most closely relates to the ongoing cash 
which will be attributable to shareholders and in 
turn the Group’s ability to fund its dividend 
programme. The Group also has a number of share 
options outstanding (see note 21 of the financial 
statements) which resulted in a Diluted EPS.
Basic EPS for the year was 21.7p (2016: 27.0p) and 
Diluted EPS was 21.6p (2016: 26.5p) which was 
ahead of the Board’s expectation due to the lower 
level of exceptional costs and a better than 
expected level of net debt during the year.
Subject to approval at the AGM on 23 May 2018, 
the Board has proposed a final dividend of 10.60p 
(2016: 12.70p) which, when added to the interim 
dividend of 5.30p (2016: 6.35p) gives a total 
dividend of 15.90p. This is a decrease of 16.5%  
on last year.
For 2018, the Board intends to amend its dividend 
policy to 2.0x cover of retained earnings, which it 
will review again in 2020 once our third ABS is fully 
established. We believe this to be a prudent 
solution to funding our new strategy whilst also 
maintaining sufficient flexibility within our debt 
facility at a relatively low leverage.

The Group’s net assets at 31 December 2017 
increased by £2.0m to £61.8m (2016: £59.8m) 
which reflects the profits for the financial year,  less 
the dividend paid to shareholders.
The significant balance sheet items are goodwill 
and intangible assets, adjusted net debt and other 
net assets/(liabilities).
(i) Goodwill and intangible assets
The Group‘s goodwill and intangible assets of 
£67.6m (2016: £68.8m) arise from the past 
business acquisitions undertaken by the Group. 
Each year the Board reviews the goodwill value for 
impairment and, as at 31 December 2017, they have 
concluded that goodwill is not impaired (see note 
13). Included within the total are £6.6m (2016: 
£7.9m) of intangible assets identified on business 
combinations, such as customer contracts, brands 
and IT related assets.
(ii) Other net assets/(liabilities)
At 31 December 2017 the Group had other net 
assets of £6.9m (2016: other net liabilities of 
£0.8m). The increase is largely in trade receivables 
and reflects the Group’s decision to fund certain 
cases in its PI division.
(iii) Net debt and adjusted net debt
The Group’s net debt at 31 December 2017 was 
£12.0m (2016: £6.3m), being cash and cash 
equivalents less borrowings. In addition to this, 
management monitor adjusted net debt, which the 
Group defines as net debt less other payables 
relating to a discontinued pre-LASPO ATE product. 
At 31 December 2017, adjusted net debt was 
£12.7m (2016: £8.2m). 24 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Further detail on net cashflows from underlying 
activities and net cashflows from non-underlying 
activities is given in note 2 to the financial 
statements. The individual elements of net debt 
and adjusted net debt are as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents
At 31 December 2017 the Group had £0.9m of cash 
and cash equivalents (2016: £4.8m). All of the 
Group’s cash is held in its trading entities and the 
Group takes advantage of short-term deposit rates 
in maximising its interest returns.
Borrowings
During the year the Group renewed its banking 
facilities with Yorkshire Bank and entered into a 
new £25.0m RCF which is repayable in full on 
31 December 2021. 
The new RCF was used to repay the previous 
outstanding balance on the Term Loan of £9.4m 
and replaces the previous £5.0m RCF . The new 
facility provides financial flexibility for the Group 
and can be utilised for general business purposes, 
including working capital and the payment of 
dividends, and supports the Group’s long-term 
business strategy.
At 31 December 2017 the Group had a balance of 
£13.1m on the RCF (2016: £11.3m of other interest-
bearing loans and borrowings ). The reported total of 
£12.9m is net of £0.2m of prepaid bank arrangement 
fees that are being expensed over the term of the loan. 
The current rate of interest payable on these 
borrowings is 1.25% above LIBOR.
The Group has an additional undrawn balance of 
£11.9m (2016: £5.0m) under this facility which can be 
utilised for working capital or for acquisitions. The 
current rate of interest payable on this undrawn facility 
is 1.0%. Once drawn the interest payable would be a 
maximum of 1.45% above LIBOR.
 
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REPORT CONTINUED
Other payables relating to a discontinued 
pre-LASPO ATE product
At 31 December 2017 the Group had £0.7m of other 
payables relating to a legacy pre-LASPO ATE 
product (2016: £1.9m). This amount is payable to 
Allianz for previously received commissions when 
certain policies either fail or are abandoned. The 
liability is calculated using actuarial rates and 
during 2017 £0.9m was released to exceptional 
items as a result of more favourable settlements 
during the year. The balance of £0.7m is likely to be 
repaid over the next two years.

As indicated in last year’s report, the level of 
operating cash generated on underlying activities 
as a percentage of underlying operating profit 
decreased in 2017 to 54.8% (2016: 79.7%). This 
was a result of the Group’s decision to fund certain 
cases in its PI division and the investment in its new 
PI business model.
This rate of conversion is expected to remain at 
lower levels than traditionally experienced as the 
Group continues to re-engineer its business and is 
expected to return to previously experienced levels 
once the transition is more advanced.
New accounting standards
The Group has not had to apply any new or  
revised IFRS accounting standards during the year. 
IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
becomes effective next year. The Group has 
undertaken an impact assessment of this new 
standard and does not foresee a material impact 
on the financial statements in the year of adoption.
In conclusion, I believe the Group is financially 
strong and, through the successful execution of our 
new strategy, is well placed to capitalise on the 
opportunities ahead of us.

In PI, revenue is generated within NAH from PLFs paying for 
marketing and triage services resulting in the supply of qualified 
enquiries. Commission is also receivable from our product 
suppliers where our products are used by the PLFs in progressing 
cases. In the case of our ABSs, revenue is generated from 
consumers for the provision of legal services. Revenue increased 
by 5.5% in 2017, largely as a result of the relaunch of the National 
Accident Helpline brand which resulted in an increase in enquiries 
placed with PLFs.
In CC, revenue is generated from law firms and insurers for the 
provision of expert witness reports and case management support 
within the medico-legal framework for multi-track cases. Revenue 
increased by 6.6% in 2017 following significant investment in the 
previous year in new leadership roles and clinical leads.
In RP , revenue is generated from lead generation services for PLFs 
and surveyors through the provision of online marketing services 
to homebuyers and sellers in England and Wales. Revenue is also 
generated from the provision of conveyancing searches to 
solicitors and licenced conveyancers. Revenue decreased by 7.5% 
in 2017, which resulted from a contraction in the total market.

Group underlying operating profit decreased by £3.5m in 2017.  
This was in line with our expectation and resulted from our chosen 
strategy to invest in our PI division in response to changing 
regulation and PLF demand, including the establishment of two 
ABS ventures. These ventures will start to generate profit in future 
years as the cases they are processing start to mature. This 
investment also resulted in a reduction in the underlying operating 
profit margin from 36.4% to 28.4%

As planned, operating cash generation has decreased from 79.7%  
in 2016 to 54.8% in 2017 as a result of the Group’s strategy of 
investment in the PI division. As a result, net debt has increased by 
£4.5m to £12.7m.
The Board considers the Group to be well funded and during the 
year the Group entered into a new £25.0m RCF with Yorkshire 
Bank, which can be utilised for general business purposes.  
At 31 December 2017, £11.9m of this facility remained undrawn. 26 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Board has ultimate responsibility for 
setting the Group’s risk appetite and for 
effective management of risk.
An annual assessment of key risks is performed by the Executive Directors and presented to the Board. A risk register is maintained
and regularly reviewed by the Executive Directors. All risks take into consideration the likelihood of the event occurring and the
impact of that event. Once the risks have been assessed appropriate mitigation actions are determined for each key risk identified.
The principal risks identified are as follows:
Principal risk Description Mitigation
Regulation
The Group, its PLF partners and ABSs are subject to an extensive 
regulatory and legal framework, including the provisions of the LASPO 
Act 2012 and regulation by either the Claims Management Regulation 
Unit (CMRU) or the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). Regulatory 
oversight for claims management companies will transfer to the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2019.
The Government announced plans to change the small claims limit and 
restrict compensation for soft tissue injury in February 2017, which they 
intend to implement in 2018. These changes will have a significant 
impact on the PI sector, upon which the Group is reliant on for a 
significant part of its revenue and profits. If the Group or its customers 
fail to, or are unable to, adapt their business models then this could have 
a significant impact on the Group’s future revenue and profits.
The Group monitors regulatory and legal developments closely 
and this informs our strategic plans and consumer proposition. 
Management continue to work with the Regulators to ensure 
compliance and are already interacting with the FCA as it plans 
its transition.
 
The business model has proven to be adaptable and resilient to 
change in the past and continues to develop in response to the 
various regulatory changes including our current re-
engineering of our personal injury division. The Board will 
continue to review the model for appropriateness as the 
regulatory environment develops and adapt accordingly. 
The Group’s investments in its CC and RP divisions help to 
mitigate its reliance on the PI sector.
Reputation Corporate Profile and Brands
The Group’s success and results are dependent, in part, on the strength 
and reputation of the Group and its brands. The Group relies on its 
brands which includes National Accident Helpline, the various 
residential property brands and the Bush & Company Rehabilitation 
brand and is exposed to the risk of these brands being tarnished via any 
significant adverse publicity.
Quality and Independence
In CC, Bush’s success is largely dependent on the quality of written 
materials, its consultants and the preservation of clinical independence. 
Failure to maintain such quality and independence exposes the business 
to a tarnished reputation for handling and processing cases which could 
result in a deterioration in financial performance.
The Group engages external advisors to help protect its 
corporate profile and advise on public relations. Brand 
performance is tracked and measured on an ongoing basis to 
ensure that it remains ahead of competitors and delivers 
compelling messages which drive consumer contacts. 
Bush is registered as a Domiciliary Care Service accredited with 
the CQC and adheres to various care standards by the relevant 
registered authorities. This ensures the Group maintains its 
brand trust ratings and its reputation. Quality is maintained by a 
clinical supervision process and highly trained teams of 
administration support. Clinical independence is the cornerstone 
of Bush’s business and all consultants have a mixed caseload of 
claimant and defendant instructions.
Technology
The Group utilises various IT systems in support of the business and 
depends on these to deliver the various service offerings to customers 
and consumers. A major IT or system failure could interrupt our ability to 
provide those services and impact the business.
Furthermore, within PI and RP , technology is becoming an increasingly 
important part of the consumer proposition and is used to reach out to 
consumers and differentiate the business from its competitors. Should 
this technology fail, it could result in reputational as well as financial 
risks.
Through the normal course of its business, the Group handles personal 
data and it commits to consumers that this data will be protected and 
only used for the purposes for which it was provided. If this data is not 
safeguarded, there is a risk that it could be used for malicious purposes, 
including identity theft, which could result in reputational damage for 
the Group and/or a significant fine if the Group was found to have not 
complied with the regulations.
The Group does not rely on one single system or platform, 
rather having individual systems for specific purposes.
These systems are supported by appropriately experienced 
individuals and third parties and subject to back up and disaster 
recovery processes. Critical systems fail over and recovery 
processes have been successfully tested with no issues 
identified. The Group operates Information Security policies to 
the principles of ISO 27001.
The Group continues to invest heavily in optimising the 
consumer journey through the use of technology to ensure it 
remains competitive and attractive to its consumer base. The 
Group takes data security very seriously and has put in place 
robust data protection procedures to ensure it is compliant with 
the Data Protection Act 1998 and other relevant regulations.  
The Group has planned carefully for the forthcoming GDPR 
regulations to ensure compliance. 27 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Principal risk Description Mitigation
Market Panel Capacity
In NAH, the Group is dependent upon its PLF customers in order to 
maintain a flexible distribution strategy. The announcement of the 
planned regulatory changes described has prompted some law firms to 
review their investments in the PI sector and consequently some 
demand reduction has already been evident. Depending on the 
long-term impact of the reforms it is likely that PLF demand will be 
permanently affected for specific claim types which could negatively 
impact the financial performance of the Group.  
ABS Performance
In response to forthcoming reforms and the changes to panel demand, 
the Group has launched two ABSs ventures and announced plans for a 
third ABS aligned with further investment in case load and capability.  
The Group is planning for an increasing proportion of claims generated 
by NAH to be processed via these ABSs and this will require increased 
investment in working capital as the cases may take a number of years 
to settle.  
Should cases not be progressed in line with the Group’s expectations or 
perform in a way that wasn’t predicted, it could lead to significant impact 
on the quantum and timing of revenue recognition and cash conversion 
thereby having a material impact on Group performance.
Online Marketing
The Group relies on its marketing strategy to retain its market leading 
position in both the PI and RP sectors. Any significant change in 
technology, cost increases, changes to search engine algorithms or 
terms of services could impact the Group’s ability to maintain its 
rankings on search results and ultimately lead to it having to spend more 
resource and expenditure to meet its financial returns.
The Group continues to provide its customers with high quality 
business that ensures they maximise their financial 
performance. In recent years, the Group has rationalised its 
panel and built strategic partnerships with a fewer number of 
larger PLFs whom the Group believes have the operational 
experience and financial strength to succeed in this market.  
That said, the Group ensures that no single customer accounts 
for a disproportionate amount of the Group’s business each 
month. 
In response to these challenges, NAH continues to explore new 
relationships with its customer base, including offering PLFs 
different funding models whilst ensuring it is able to service the 
needs of the Group.
Like the rest of the Group, the ABSs are subject to budgetary 
control and ABS business plans reflect both the Group’s 
significant experience of PLF operating models and 
performance metrics and those of the ABS partners, who are 
themselves successful PI law firms. This provides reasonable 
assurance over the accuracy of the ABSs forecasts. 
Additionally, as the controlling partner, the Group conducts 
ongoing reviews of the key performance parameters on a 
weekly and monthly cycle. These metrics are monitored by the 
Board and management at an ABS, divisional and Group level. 
Any significant deviations from plan are investigated and 
improvement plans implemented in line with contractual 
Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
The Group has extensive experience of managing its marketing 
strategy through a combination of internal marketing experts 
and external agencies. In 2017, the Group has strengthened its 
internal capabilities to ensure it has the flexibility and speed 
required to react to the potential risks outlined.
Financial
Following the acquisition of subsidiary companies the Group and 
Company have recognised investment and goodwill assets on their 
balance sheets, the value of which is supported by their future cash 
flows. If the performance of these acquisitions falls below expectation, 
there is a risk that these assets may become impaired and require a 
writedown in value which could negatively impact financial performance 
of the Group and its ability to pay future dividends to its shareholders.
As the Group has diversified and operates a number of distinct business 
models there is increased risk that revenue and profit may be incorrectly 
recognised, or recognised in the wrong period.   
The headroom, or difference between the valuation of 
investment and goodwill assets and their carrying value in the 
financial statements, is assessed regularly and reviewed by the 
Board at least annually and upon discovery of any indicators of 
impairment. Assessment is conducted with reference to the 
Group’s long-term forecasting model and is subject to 
stress-testing and scenario planning. 
 
The Group has put in place formal revenue recognition policies 
covering each of the businesses and implemented financial and 
operating systems with a series of controls to ensure revenue is 
not materially misstated. This is supported by monthly 
reconciliation procedures conducted by the Group’s finance 
function and periodic internal audit reviews, backed up by 
independent assurance from the Group’s auditors.  
People
The Group’s future growth and success depends, in part, on the 
leadership and performance of its Executive Directors and Senior 
Management Team. The loss of any key individual or the inability to 
attract appropriate personnel could impact its ability to execute its 
business strategy successfully which could negatively impact the 
Group’s future performance.
The Group maintains competitive and attractive employment 
terms and conditions, fully empowering key individuals and 
allowing them to maximise their job satisfaction. The Group 
incentivises key management through annual incentive plans in

OUR PEOPLE 
Recruiting against our Values of Curious, Driven, 
Passionate and Unified as well as our business 
needs means that we can be sure that we’re 
equipped for all the challenge and complexity that 
the future might bring.
Keeping staff engaged
Research from Gallup
1
 in 2016 showed that only 8% of employees in 
the UK are engaged at work. We are, therefore, delighted that the 
engagement figures for staff employed across the Group sits at 60%
2
.
We have always shown real commitment to ensuring that our 
employees are engaged in the business and happy in their work.  
In 2017, we rebranded our staff survey as OwnIt! to emphasise the 
autonomy that staff can have for their own learning, development  
and engagement – as well as to making improvements to their own 
working lives where they identify them. 
We were proud of these results from across the Group, consistently 
showing that staff at NAHL ’s businesses have trust in their leadership, 
feel valued and rewarded and would recommend the Group as a great 
place to work.
Keeping staff informed
Our programme of Brown Bag Lunches (all staff briefings over lunch) 
which have been very successful at National Accident Helpline, was 
extended further into the Group in 2017. A great mix of updates from 
senior leaders and presentations by staff ensured that colleagues 
were involved in the delivery, not just the receiving of, these 
messages. These events will continue to evolve to ensure they are 
keeping staff engaged and active.
Bringing leaders together
Following on from some key leadership appointments made in 2016, 
2017 was a time of stability and cohesion. This allowed the Group to 
bring the four businesses together to learn with and from one another 
and to build supportive relationships across our geographically 
diverse teams. 
2017 signalled this intention with our inaugural Leadership 
Conference. Assembling the Group’s top 30 leaders, its primary focus 
was to reflect on how we operate as a Group, its successes and 
challenges, as well as to give the team the time and space to get to 
know one another and to share experiences and expertise.

Investing in our future leaders – succession planning
Identifying, developing and retaining our future leaders is vital if the 
business is to ensure strong succession planning. Taking a long-term 
view of this progression has been an important part of the development 
of our people this year. With that in mind, we have a development 
approach which is flexible depending upon a colleague’s current level 
within the business – and staff are able to dip in and out of offerings as 
appropriate. 
It’s about who we are
Beginning with our Management Development Days, leaders are able  
to both attend these sessions as well as recommend a future leader . These 
training days don’t focus solely on business critical topics like Finance for 
non-Finance Managers and Project Management but also learning about 
who our colleagues are as people and how we work together .  
One of our most successful development days focused on Strengths 
Based Leadership where managers and teams got to really understand 
their own strength sets and how these can be viewed by others and so 
benefit the Group through cross-business working. 
Leading the leaders
Following on from our Management Development Days came the 
Leadership School where colleagues came together for intensive 
training on topics to equip and inspire them to be excellent people 
managers and leaders.
The final step on the leadership journey comes in the form of our 
Pathway to Leadership (P2L) programme where our future leaders 
benefit from six training days, two mentoring sessions with a senior 
leader from a different part of the business and two development 
discussions with their manager. This strategy of Management 
Development Days, Leadership School and P2L gives our stars of the 
future a clear direction of travel to ensure they can maximise their 
potential and that we can retain our best colleagues for the ultimate 
benefit of the business.

We are proud to be part of our communities 
– both those local to us and those that 
reflect our business activities.
OUR COMMUNITIES
For two years now the Group has supported the Paul Bush 
Foundation Trust (PBFT) both with fundraising and grants and 
over this time has donated over £120,000. In 2016 Russell 
Atkinson, was appointed as Trustee of the PBFT and takes an 
active role in the running of the Trust. Paul, a paraplegic since 
1975 and his daughter, Rachel, a specialist spinal nurse, 
ploughed their passion for improving the lives of people with a 
disability into both Bush & Company Rehabilitation and the 
PBFT. Paul sadly passed away in 2017 but his passion lives on in 
both the PBFT and the values and principles by which Bush 
operates its business. The Group is proud to support it. 
As well as the Group’s commitment to the PBFT, each division 
selects its own charities and activities to support.
Personal Injury
NAH staff are enthusiastic and generous charity supporters.  
In 2017, NAH went into partnership with Warwickshire and 
Northamptonshire Air Ambulance to raise funds for this vital 
service. Three members of staff kicked off the fundraising by 
taking part in an abseil down the Northampton Lift Tower 
followed by a team from the business taking part in 
Northampton’s Dragon Boat Race. 
NAH MD, Simon Trott, also led from the front by cycling the great 
Mont Ventoux…twice… in 35 degree heat! During December, 
colleagues from our newly formed National Law Partners 
themed their office as a traditional German Market selling festive 
food and drink. The staff have raised over £3,300 altogether, 
which will be matched by NAH for this most important cause.  
NAH staff’s support for the local community was demonstrated by 
their overwhelming generosity for the second year running towards 
the Kettering Food Bank, donating hundreds of pounds worth of food 
through the Reverse Advent Calendar scheme. This activity provides 
a real helping hand to those struggling in the run up to Christmas. 
NAH’s ongoing relationship with Latimer Arts College, a local senior 
school, included the sponsoring and presenting of one of their 
awards at their annual prize night. For the second year running, 
several members of NAH’s Executive T eam took part in the school’s 
Dragon’s Den event, fostering the student’s creativity and business 
thinking, with Debbie Britton, NAH's Marketing Director , giving the 
keynote address at the beginning of the day as well as providing 
specialist marketing advice to the groups as they worked. 
Critical Care
Staff at Bush have always been keen to raise money and 2017 
was no different. 
The year began with the announcement that Bush & Company would 
be the first Fundraising Baton Holder for the Mary Seacole T rust; a 
charity that inspires young people to challenge exclusion  
and promotes increasing participation through equality of 
opportunity. The team threw themselves into their fundraising with 
themed lunches including Super Soup Mondays and Mexican Day. 
Bush’s continued support of the PBFT and the staff’s passion for 
their cause, ensured it benefitted from the proceeds of the 
Summer Raffle drawn at the Bush Annual Conference Gala 
Dinner in July. The raffle raised over £2,000 which will be well 
used by the Trust in their work to support individuals who have 
an acquired disability and the organisations that help them.
The team also took part in GLOW Day, organised by CBIT, to 
encourage parents to ensure their children can Be Seen Not Hurt 
during the winter months. Staff wore their brightest clothes and 
held a tombola, raising approximately £200 for this great charity.  31 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Residential Property
Our RP division supports a number of local and national charities 
and organisations throughout the year. 
A long-standing commitment of Searches, in partnership with 
Portfolio Magazine, is the hosting of the quarterly Property 
Professionals Lunch. This networking lunch includes a 
fundraising prize draw to support the Rockinghorse Children’s 
Charity. The event has already raised enough money to buy two 
incubators for premature and ill babies. Rockinghorse also 
receives support from the Searches team through its annual 
Hallowe’en Quiz night where the team’s enthusiasm was 
rewarded by winning the fancy dress competition.
The staff at Searches are always ready to get involved too  
with baking and dress up days for breast cancer awareness and 
Macmillan’s coffee morning alongside Christmas jumper day for 
Save The Children. The business also supports a number of 
individual fundraising activities undertaken by key contacts in 
the industry with sponsorship and donation of prizes.

Group response to Modern Slavery Act 2015
• Organisational structure and recruitment processes
The Group’s organisational structures include the Board, Senior Management teams across all three organisational divisions, 
Contact Centres at two of the four locations and standard support functions across all sites.
Recruitment processes include the monitoring of passport documentation, with all new recruits expected to show their passport 
as a proof of identity. The Group also reviews shared addresses. In addition, the Group monitors the ongoing wellbeing of its 
employees through line management relationships and an Employee Assistance Programme.
Where recruitment agencies are used to employ staff, the Group ensures these agencies also have an approved statement in 
support of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
As these structures and recruitment processes apply to UK-based operations, the Group considers these to be very low risk.
• Services
The services NAHL Group plc provides to its customers and consumers are UK office-based, with minimal UK field-based 
services.
The Group’s supply chain in relation to services consists, on the whole, of marketing and processing services across personal 
injury, critical care and residential property. The Group considers these to be very low risk in relation to slavery and human 
trafficking so takes no specific action in relation to these relationships.
• Goods
In terms of goods supplied to the Group, the majority of goods will be goods for use in an office environment such as stationery 
and office equipment. The Group considers these to be very low risk in relation to slavery and human trafficking so takes no 
specific action in relation to these relationships.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The UK corporate governance code
Companies listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange are required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. NAHL Group plc’s shares are traded on AIM and as such, the Group is not subject to the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code on corporate governance, nor is it required to disclose its specific policies in relation to corporate governance.
However, as a publicly quoted company, the Company maintains appropriate standards of corporate governance. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code represents the ‘gold standard’. However, the UK Corporate Governance Code was not designed with smaller 
companies in mind. Adherence to the full UK Corporate Governance Code is often impractical for smaller companies. In the past, in 
the absence of an alternative code, many AIM companies have adopted the UK Corporate Governance Code ‘to the extent 
applicable’.
In July 2005 the Quoted Companies Alliance (QCA) introduced a simple set of guidelines for corporate governance for AIM 
companies, which were updated in July 2007, September 2010 and again in May 2013. According to the QCA, the guidelines have 
been devised in consultation with a number of significant institutional smaller company investors.
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and the Company holds membership of the QCA and 
complies with the QCA Guidelines and the main provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, insofar as is practicable to do so 
for a company of NAHL Group plc’s current size and stage of development, save in relation to certain Directors, who will not be 
independent because of the grant or proposed grant of options to them by the Company.
The Board of Directors operates within the framework described below.
Table of committees
The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets and corporate actions. Board 
meetings are held at least every two months and at such other times as the Directors deem necessary. The Group has appointed 
Steve Halbert as the Group’s Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. The Board has created an Audit Committee, a 
Remuneration Committee and a Nomination Committee where the current composition and responsibilities of the committees are 
as follows:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of Steve Halbert as Chairman, Gillian Kent and Tim Aspinall. It meets at least twice each year and is 
responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored and reported on and for meeting with the 
Auditor and reviewing findings of the audit with the external Auditor. It is authorised to seek any information it properly requires from 
any employee and may ask questions of any employee. It meets with the Auditor at least twice a year and is also responsible for 
considering and making recommendations regarding the identity and remuneration of such Auditor.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of Gillian Kent as Chairman, Steve Halbert and Tim Aspinall. It meets at least twice each year 
and considers and recommends to the Board the framework for the remuneration of the Executive Directors of the Group and any 
other senior management. It further considers and recommends to the Board the total individual remuneration package of each 
Executive Director including bonuses, incentive payments and share options or other share awards. In addition, subject to existing 
contractual obligations, it reviews the structure of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and, for each such plan, 
recommends whether awards are made and, if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards to Executive Directors 
and the performance targets to be used. No Director is involved in decisions concerning his own remuneration.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee consists of Steve Halbert as Chairman, Gillian Kent and Tim Aspinall. The Nomination Committee meets 
at least once each year and considers the selection and re-appointment of Directors. It identifies and nominates candidates to all 
Board vacancies and regularly reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board (including the skills, knowledge and 
experience) and makes recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes. The Group has adopted a share dealing code 
(based on the AIM Rules and with reference to the Market Abuse Regulations (MAR)) and the Group takes all proper and reasonable 
steps to ensure compliance by the Directors and relevant  employees.
The Board is also responsible for ensuring the Group’s compliance with all applicable anti-corruption legislation, including, but not 
limited to, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977. The Group complies and always has complied 
with all applicable anti-corruption laws. In view of the requirement in the UK Bribery Act 2010 for relevant companies to have 
adequate anti-bribery procedures, the Group has devised and implemented a suite of anti-corruption policies and procedures 
designed to prevent corruption by anyone working on its behalf. The Group has adopted a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to corruption 
and is committed to ethical business practices. 39 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Internal control
The Group has implemented policies on internal control and corporate governance. These have been prepared in order to 
ensure that:
• proper business records are maintained and reported on, which might reasonably affect the conduct of the business;
• monitoring procedures for the performance of the Group are presented to the Board at regular intervals;
• budget proposals are submitted to the Board no later than one month before the start of each financial year;
• accounting policies and practices suitable for the Group’s activities are followed in preparing the financial statements;
• the Group is provided with general accounting, administrative and secretarial services as may reasonably be required; and
• interim and annual accounts are prepared and submitted in time to enable the Group to meet statutory filing deadlines.

STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2017, which sets 
out the future Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, intended to take effect from the 
close of the 2018 Annual General Meeting 
and the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Our previous Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy was approved by an advisory vote 
at the 2015 Annual General Meeting and 
became effective for three years from the 
close of that meeting. The Committee 
believes that the current remuneration 
framework continues to effectively 
support the delivery of our business 
strategy and the creation of shareholder 
value. Consequently, the Committee has 
decided to make minor amendments only 
to ensure that the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy is appropriate for the 
next three years and to reflect 
developments in best practice for large 
AIM listed companies. The future 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be 
subject to an advisory vote at the 2018 
Annual General Meeting.
The Annual Report on Remuneration 
provides details of the amounts earned in 
respect of the year ended 31 December 
2017 and how the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy will be applied for 
2018.
Review of the 2017 financial year
As highlighted earlier in the Executives’ 
reports, the Company has performed in 
line with expectations, with good progress 
in the restructure of the PI division in 
preparation for regulatory changes, 
trading through strong headwinds in RP 
and growth in market share in CC.
The 2017 annual bonus was assessed 
against operating profit performance as 
regards 75% of the award and individual 
objectives as regards 25% of the award. 
Based on 2017 operating profit 
performance of £14.5m and performance 
against individual objectives, the CEO will 
receive a payout of 35% of his maximum 
annual bonus opportunity. Further details 
are set out on page 42.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards 
granted on 13 April 2015 in the form of 
market value share options were subject 
to EPS performance over the three-year 
period ended 31 December 2017. The EPS 
target was not achieved and the awards 
will therefore lapse in full. Further details 
are set out on page 42.
Appointment of new CFO
James Saralis was appointed as CFO on  
1 January 2018 following Steve Dolton’s 
resignation as a Director on 1 January 
2018. James Saralis was granted an LTIP 
award following his appointment subject 
to the same terms and performance 
measures as those awards granted to the 
CEO on 31 October 2017. Details of the 
awards will be disclosed in the 2018 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Outlook for the 2018 financial year
Details in relation to the application of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2018 
are set out on page 45, however, the key 
elements will be as follows:
• The CEO has been awarded a 2% 
increase in base salary with effect from 
1 March 2018, in line with the 
percentage increase in base salary 
awarded to the wider workforce. No 
salary increase was awarded to the 
CFO.
• The CEO’s annual bonus opportunity 
for 2018 will continue to be subject to a 
maximum of 100% of base salary. 
• It is proposed that the CFO’s annual 
bonus opportunity for 2018 will be 
subject to a maximum of 80% of base 
salary. Notwithstanding that, the new 
Policy allows for a maximum 
opportunity of 100% of base salary for 
the CFO. 
• Annual bonus awards for 2018 will be 
based on operating profit and 
individual objectives which are aligned 
to the Group’s strategy.
• It is proposed that LTIP awards will be 
granted to Executive Directors during 
2018, the details of which will be 
provided at the time of grant.
• Non-Executive Directors’ basic fee and 
the Chairman’s fee were increased by 
2% with effect from 1 March 2018.
• The Committee now has authority to 
reduce or withdraw unvested LTIP 
awards where the participant is guilty 
of gross misconduct, in addition to a 
material misstatement of the Group’s 
financial results. 
• In line with best practice, clawback 
provisions have been included within 
the annual bonus and LTIP . For two 
years following the determination of an 
annual bonus and the date an LTIP 
vests, the Committee has the authority 
to ‘claw-back’ vested LTIP awards and 
any annual bonus payments.
Conclusion
We are committed to a responsible and 
transparent approach in respect of 
executive pay. The Committee believes 
that subjecting the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and Annual Report 
on Remuneration to an advisory vote 
provides a greater degree of 
accountability and gives shareholders a 
say on this important area of corporate 
governance.

Implementation of Directors’ Remuneration Policy for the financial year commencing 1 January 2018
Information on how the Company intends to implement the Directors’ Remuneration Policy for the financial year commencing on  
1 January 2018 is set out below:
Salary/Fees
The CEO was awarded a 2% increase to base salary, with effect from 1 March 2018, in line with the percentage increase awarded to 
the wider workforce. No salary increase was awarded to the CFO.
Non-Executive Directors’ basic fee and the Chairman’s fee were increased by 2% with effect from 1 March 2018.
Annual bonus plan
The maximum bonus opportunity for the CEO and CFO will be 100% of salary. It is proposed that the CFO will be granted an annual 
bonus opportunity of 80% of salary for the 2018 financial year. 
75% of the annual bonus will be assessed against operating profit performance and 25% will be assessed against individual 
objectives. Performance targets will continue to be  set at the challenging levels of previous years. The individual objectives are likely 
to focus around key areas such as the continued restructure of the PI division, development of the CC and RP divisions and a smooth 
transition in CFO role. The actual performance targets are not disclosed as they are considered to be commercially sensitive at this 
time. The targets will be disclosed in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report or at such point that the Committee considers that 
the performance targets are no longer commercially sensitive.
Long-term incentives
 LTIP awards are made to Executive Directors on an annual basis to ensure they are appropriately incentivised and aligned with 
shareholders’ interests over the longer term. The Committee has yet to determine details of the awards to be made to Executive 
Directors for 2018. Full details of the size of the awards and the performance measures attaching to the awards will be disclosed at 
the time of grant and in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee is composed of the Company’s independent  Non-Executive Directors, Gillian Kent (Chairman),  
Steve Halbert and Tim Aspinall. Executive Directors only attend meetings by invitation.
The Committee’s key responsibilities are:
• reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of remuneration policy;
• reviewing and approving the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors;
• monitoring the level and structure of remuneration of the senior management; and
• production of the Annual Report on the Directors’ remuneration.
Advisors
During  the financial year, the Committee received independent advice from Deloitte LLP . Deloitte is a founder member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under its code of conduct in its dealings with the Committee.
Approval
This report was approved by the Board on 19 March 2018 and signed on its behalf by:

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 45 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Financial statements Governance
This section sets out the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which will apply from the date of the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting. The Policy is determined by the Committee of the Company.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was first approved at the 2015 Annual General Meeting. No significant changes have been made 
to the Policy. Minor amendments have been made to ensure that the Policy is appropriate for the next three years. The amendments 
to the Policy are as follows: 
• The CFO’s maximum annual bonus opportunity has been increased from 70% to 100% of salary, in line with the annual bonus 
opportunity available to the CEO. 
• The Committee has introduced a normal maximum LTIP opportunity of 100% of salary for both the CEO and CFO. The overall 
maximum LTIP award remains at 300% of salary.
• The Committee has extended the operation of malus under the LTIP to include the ability to reduce unvested awards where the 
participant is guilty of gross misconduct.
• The Committee has introduced clawback into the operation of the annual bonus and LTIP . The Committee is now able to claw 
back annual bonus payments and vested LTIP awards for up to two years following the date of the bonus determination and LTIP 
vesting, in the case of a material misstatement of the Group’s financial results or if the participant is guilty of gross misconduct.
• The Committee has introduced flexibility to award pension contributions of up to 10% of salary. Executive Directors currently 
receive nominal or no pension contributions. 
• A Policy on the Committee’s approach to payments for loss of office has been introduced. 
Key principles
The Company’s remuneration package for Executive Directors has been designed based on the following key principles:
• promote the long-term success of the Company, with transparent and stretching performance conditions, which are rigorously 
applied;
• provide appropriate alignment between the Company’s strategic goals, shareholder returns and executive reward; and
• have a competitive mix of base salary and short- and long-term incentives, with an appropriate proportion of the package 
determined by stretching targets linked to the Company’s performance.

measures
Base salary
Core element of fixed 
remuneration to 
provide a competitive 
base salary for the 
markets in which the 
Group operates to 
attract and retain 
Executive Directors of a 
suitable calibre.
Salaries are reviewed annually taking 
into account:
• underlying Group performance;
• role, experience and individual 
performance; 
• competitive salary levels and 
market forces; and
• pay and conditions elsewhere in 
the Group.
Although there is no overall 
maximum, salary increases are 
normally reviewed in the context of 
the salary increases across the wider 
Group. 
The Committee may award salary 
increases above this level to take 
account of individual circumstances 
such as: 
• increase in scope and 
responsibility; 
• increase to reflect the Executive 
Director’s development and 
performance in the role; or
• alignment to market level. 
Not applicable.
Benefits
To provide a market 
competitive benefits 
package as part of total 
remuneration.
Executive Directors receive benefits 
in line with market practice, and 
these include principally life 
insurance, private medical insurance 
and a car allowance.
Other benefits may be provided 
based on individual circumstances.
Whilst the Committee has not set an 
absolute maximum on the level of 
benefits Executive Directors receive, 
the value of the benefit is at a level 
which the Committee considers 
appropriate against the market and 
provides sufficient level of benefit 
based on individual circumstances. 
Not applicable.
Retirement 
benefits
To provide an 
appropriate level of 
retirement benefit.
Executive Directors are eligible to 
participate in the Group’s defined 
contribution pension plan.
Executive Directors currently receive 
nominal or no pension contributions. 
The Committee retains flexibility to 
award pension contributions of up to 
10% of salary.
Not applicable.
SAYE Plan
To create alignment 
with the Group and 
promote a sense of 
ownership.
Executive Directors are entitled to 
participate in an HMRC tax qualifying 
all employee SAYE Plan.
Participation limits are those set by 
the UK tax authorities.
Not subject to  
performance measures 
in line with HMRC 
practice.
Annual bonus
Rewards performance 
against annual targets 
which support the 
strategic direction of 
the Group.
Awards are based on annual 
performance against key financial 
targets and/or the delivery of 
strategic/personal objectives.
The Committee has discretion to 
amend the payout should any 
formulaic output not reflect the 
Committee’s assessment of overall 
business performance.
For up to two years following the 
determination of a bonus payout 
the Committee has the right to 
recover some or all of the bonus 
payout in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s 
financial results or if the participant 
has been guilty of gross 
misconduct.
Maximum bonus opportunity for the 
Executive Directors is up to 100% of 
base salary in respect of a financial 
year. 
Targets are set annually 
reflecting the Group’s 
strategy and aligned 
with key financial, 
strategic and/or 
individual targets. 
At least 50% of the 
bonus is assessed 
against financial 
performance metrics of 
the business and the 
balance is based on 
strategic/personal 
objectives. 
Stretching targets are 
required for maximum 
payout.

measures
Long-term 
incentive
To drive and reward the 
achievement of 
longer-term objectives, 
support retention and 
promote share 
ownership for 
Executive Directors.
The Group operates a nominal cost 
LTIP scheme and an Enterprise 
Management Incentive (EMI) Plan, 
collectively the ‘LTIP schemes’.
Under the nominal cost LTIP , awards 
may be granted in the form of nil or 
nominal cost share options, or 
contingent rights to receive shares.
Under the EMI Plan, awards may be 
granted in the form of tax qualifying 
share options or non-tax qualifying 
share options.  
The vesting of awards granted under 
the nominal cost LTIP and EMI Plan 
will normally be subject to the 
achievement of specified 
performance conditions, normally 
over a period of at least three years.
The Committee may reduce 
unvested awards granted under the 
nominal cost LTIP and EMI Plan in 
the event of a material misstatement 
of the Group’s financial results or if 
the participant has been guilty of 
gross misconduct.
For up to two years following the 
determination of the vesting 
outcome of an award, the Committee 
has the right to cancel the award if it 
has not been exercised, or require 
repayment of some or all of the 
award in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s 
financial results or if the participant 
has been guilty of gross misconduct.
Under the nominal LTIP and EMI Plan 
rules, the overall combined 
maximum award that may be 
granted in respect of a financial year 
is 300% of base salary. Awards may 
be granted in excess of this limit in 
exceptional circumstances.
It is intended that the normal 
combined maximum award will not 
be more than 100% of salary in 
respect of a financial year.  
Relevant performance 
measures are set that 
reflect underlying 
business performance.
Performance measures 
and their weighting 
where there is more 
than one measure are 
reviewed annually to 
maintain 
appropriateness and 
relevance. 48 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Non-Executive Directors
Purpose and link to strategy Approach of the Group
Sole element of Non-Executive 
Director remuneration, set  
at a level that reflects market 
conditions and is sufficient to 
attract individuals with 
appropriate knowledge and 
experience.
Fees are normally reviewed annually.
Fees paid to Non-Executive Directors for their services are approved by the Remuneration 
Committee. Fees may include a basic fee and additional fees for further responsibilities (for 
example, chairmanship of Board committees).
 
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company’s share options schemes or 
annual bonus scheme nor do they receive any pension contributions. Non-Executive Directors may 
be eligible to receive benefits such as the use of secretarial support, travel costs or other benefits 
that may be appropriate.
Actual fee levels are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the relevant financial year. 
Explanation of performance measures chosen
Performance measures are selected that are aligned with the performance of the Group and the interests of shareholders. Stretching 
performance targets are set for the annual bonus and long-term incentive awards. When setting these performance targets, the Committee 
will take into account a number of different reference points, which may include the Group’s business plans and strategy and the economic 
environment. Full vesting will only occur for what the Committee considers to be stretching performance.
The annual bonus is based on financial metrics and strategic metrics which support the strategic direction of the Group. Long-term 
incentive awards are based on EPS growth and Total Shareholder Return. The Committee considers these to be key external 
measures of performance over the longer term in terms of delivering value to shareholders.
The Committee retains the ability to adjust or set different performance measures if events occur which cause the Committee to 
determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
Awards and options may be adjusted in the event of a variation of share capital in accordance with the rules of the nominal cost LTIP 
and EMI Plan.
Policy for the remuneration of employees more generally
Remuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group based on the same principle that reward should be achieved for 
delivery of the business strategy and should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre employees. The Group operates 
an HMRC tax qualifying SAYE Plan and invites all employees to participate at the discretion of the Committee, therefore encouraging 
wider workforce share ownership. 
There is no consultation with employees regarding Director’s remuneration.
Service contracts
Russell Atkinson’s service contract is on a rolling basis and may be terminated on nine months’ notice by the Company or the Executive. 
James Saralis’ service contract is on a rolling basis and may be terminated on six months’ notice by the Company or the Executive.
 
All Non-Executive Directors have initial fixed-term agreements with the Company of no more than three years.

Payment in lieu of notice In line with the provisions of the Executive Directors’ service contracts.
Annual Bonus At the discretion of the Committee dependent upon the circumstances of departure and 
contribution to the business during the bonus period.
Long-term incentives The extent to which any unvested award will vest will be determined in accordance with the rules 
of the nominal cost LTIP and EMI Plan. Unvested awards will normally lapse on cessation of 
employment, other than when the individual is considered to be a ‘good leaver’.
Other payments In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of accrued holiday, 
outplacement, legal fees and under the terms of the SAYE Plan.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received on remuneration matters, including issues arising in relation to the AGM, 
as well as any additional comments received during any other meetings with shareholders. The Committee will seek to engage 
directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies should any material changes be made to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. 50 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company Law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same 
basis.
Under Company Law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group 
and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
• assess the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern ;and
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 51 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF NAHL GROUP PLC
1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of NAHL Group plc (“the Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Company Balance Sheet, the Company Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Company Cash Flow Statement and the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1. 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;  
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);  
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and  
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the Group in 
accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In arriving at our audit opinion 
above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows (unchanged from 2016): 
The Risk Our response
Revenue  
recognition
Processing error and element  
of judgement:
Our procedures included:
(£51.9m; 
2016: £50.6m)
Refer to   
page 60 
(accounting 
policy) and 
page 62 
(financial 
disclosures).
The key revenue streams, being income from 
solicitors for the provisions of marketing 
services, provision of case management 
services and expert witness reports and lead 
generation services to conveyancer solicitors 
and surveyors and the provision of Search 
reports vary depending on the product/
service being delivered by the group. The 
resulting large volume of non-homogenous 
transactions creates a risk of processing 
error. The Group also receives variable 
consideration in respect of some of the 
services provided to the law firms over and 
above a guaranteed minimum, upon the 
successful outcome of each case. As revenue 
is recognised when these amounts are 
considered probable there is judgement in 
determining the anticipated outcome of 
cases. The recognition is based on historic 
data and is included within accrued revenue 
at the year end totalling £1.5m. 
— Tests of details: We performed a reconciliation of the cash 
received in the year to the revenue recognised. This included 
testing the underlying data used in the performance of this test;
— We selected a sample of revenue items recognised immediately 
prior to and immediately after the year end and obtained invoices 
and proof of delivery or service, (contracts; supporting 
calculations; timesheets; report delivery emails), to check these 
had been accounted for in the correct period;
— For a sample of deferred and accrued income at the period end, we 
determined whether revenue had been recorded in the appropriate 
period by checking delivery documentation, (contracts; supporting 
calculations; timesheets; report delivery emails);
— We inspected a sample of credit notes raised post year end  
to determine whether they related to revenue recognised in  
the year;
— We obtained 100% of the journals posted in respect of revenue 
and, using computer assisted audit techniques, analysed these to 
identify and investigate any entries which appeared unusual based 
upon the specific characteristics of the journal, considering in 
particular whether the non-revenue side of the journal entry was 
as expected, based on our business understanding;
— Our sector experience: Challenging management’s 
assumptions over the accrued variable revenue based on our 
knowledge of the Group; and
— Historical comparisons: Checking reasonableness of expected 
success rates by comparing actual experience to previous 
expected rates. 52 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued
The Risk Our response
Valuation of 
Goodwill
Forecast-based valuation: Our procedures included:
(£60.4m;  
2016: £60.4m)
Refer to page 60 
(accounting
policy) and page 67 
(financial disclosures).
Goodwill relates to all three divisions:
Personal Injury (£39.9m), Critical 
Care (£15.6m) and Residential 
Property (£4.9m). There is 
judgement with regard to 
assumptions and estimates involved 
in forecasting future cash flows, 
which form the basis of the 
assessment of the recoverability  
of goodwill balances. 
These include budgeted volumes, 
operating margin, long-term growth 
rates and the discount rate used.
— Benchmarking Assumptions: Comparing the Group’s 
assumptions to externally derived data in relation to key inputs 
such as projected economic growth, competition, and 
discount rates.
— Historical Comparisons: We assessed the reasonableness of 
assumptions we assessed the historical accuracy of the 
Group’s forecasting through checking management forecasts 
to actual results.
— Sensitivity Analysis: Performing scenario-specific analysis 
on models including changes to, and breakeven analysis on, 
the discount rate, long term growth rates and forecast cash 
flows; and
— Assessing Transparency: Assessing whether the Group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions 
reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill.
Parent: 
Recoverability of 
Parent Company 
Investment in 
Subsidiaries
Low risk, high value:
The carrying amount of the parent
company’s investments in the 
subsidiary company held at cost less 
impairment represents 74% (2016: 
67%) of the company’s total assets.
Its recoverability is not at a high risk 
of significant misstatement or 
subject to significant judgement. 
However, due to its materiality in the 
context of the parent company 
financial statements, this is 
considered to be the area that had 
the greatest effect on our overall 
parent company audit.
Our procedures included:
— Comparing valuations: comparing the carrying value of the 
investment to the market capitalisation of the Group at the 
balance sheet date.
(£52.7m;   
2016: £52.7m)
Refer to page 81 
(accounting
policy) and page 82 
(financial disclosures).
3.  Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit 
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set 
at £0.58m, determined with reference to a benchmark of group 
profit before tax, of which it represents 4.7% (2016: 4.7%). 
Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a 
whole was set at £0.46m (2016: £0.65m), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of company net assets, of which it 
represents 0.7% (2016: 0.8%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £29k, in 
addition to other identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the group’s 10 (2016: 8) reporting components, we subjected 
5 (2016: 8) to full scope audits for group purposes and 5 (2016: 
nil) to specified risk-focused audit procedures. The latter were 
not individually financially significant enough to require a full 
scope audit for group purposes, but did present specific 
individual risks that needed to be addressed.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the 
percentages illustrated opposite. 
The Group team approved the component materialities, which 
ranged from £90k to £275k, having regard to the mix of size and 
risk profile of the Group across the components.
The Group team performed the audit of the Group as if it was a 
single aggregated set of financial information. The audit was 
performed using the materiality levels set out above. The Group 
team visited 4 (2016: 4) component locations in Kettering, 
Daventry, London and Hove to assess the audit risk and strategy.

4. We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the 
use of the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate  
or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast 
significant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at  
least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements. We have nothing to report in these respects.
5.  We have nothing to report on the other information in 
the Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express 
an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form  
of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit 
work, the information therein is materially misstated or 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit 
knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information. 
Strategic report and directors’ report
Based solely on our work on the other information:
• we have not identified material misstatements in the  
strategic report and the directors’ report;
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
6.  We have nothing to report on the other matters on which 
we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 50,  
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing 
the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or 
to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance  
is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence  
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the 
financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
8.  The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention.
The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the period until 31 March 2019. Based on these, the Directors confirm that there 
are sufficient cash reserves to fund the business for the period under review, and believe that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risk successfully. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements represent a consolidation of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings as at the Statement of Financial 
Position date and for the year then ended. In accordance with IFRS 10 the definition of control is such that an investor has control 
over an investee when: a) it has power over the investee, b) it is exposed, or has the rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and c) has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. All three of these criteria must be met for an investor to 
have control over an investee. All subsidiary undertakings in which the Group has a greater than 50% shareholding have been 
consolidated in the Group’s results.
The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the Group 
statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their 
fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the Group statement of comprehensive income 
from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases. Acquisition costs are 
expensed as incurred. This policy does not apply on the acquisition of Consumer Champion Group Limited for which reverse 
acquisition accounting has been applied. The group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition 
by acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable 
assets.
Joint arrangements
Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures.  
The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint 
arrangement. NAHL Group plc has joint operations only. As the Group has overall control of these joint operations, the results of the 
joint operations have been consolidated within these financial statements.
Use of judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements and estimates that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
Revenue, other than pre- and post-LASPO ATE income, is not considered to be a key judgement or estimate.
Judgements
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact 
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Intangible assets
When the Group makes an acquisition, management determines whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately 
from goodwill and what value to attribute to those assets.
Accounting policy choice for non-controlling interests
The group recognises non-controlling interests in an acquired entity either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. This decision is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis.  
For the non-controlling interests in Your Law LLP and National Law Associates LLP (trading as National Law Partners), the Group 
elected to recognise the non-controlling interests at their proportionate share of the acquired net identifiable assets.
Estimates
Discussed below are key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that have a 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines, on an annual basis, whether goodwill is impaired. This requires an estimation of the future cash flows of the 
cash generating units (CGUs) to which the goodwill is allocated; see note 13. 59 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Recoverability of trade receivables
Trade receivables are reflected net of an estimated provision for impairment losses. This provision considers the past payment 
history and the length of time that the debt has remained unpaid; see notes 17 and 23.
New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective
The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective:
• IFRS 9: Financial Instruments – Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application 
permitted.
• IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers – Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, 
with early application permitted.
• IFRS 16: Leases – Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted for 
entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16.
A review of IFRS 16: Leases will be conducted to determine its impact on the Group. The Group has considered the impact of the 
other standards and revisions above and concluded that these will not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Use of non-GAAP measures
The Directors believe that underlying operating profit, underlying revenue, underlying operating cash and adjusted net debt provide 
additional useful information for shareholders on underlying trends and performance. These measures are used by management for 
performance analysis and are considered useful as they relate to the core underlying trading activities of the Group i.e. they reflect 
the current ongoing activities of the Group and do not include any items that relate to significant exceptional projects that are not 
expected to recur or any items that relate to activities that are outside the normal course of trading (e.g. acquisitions or share-based 
costs that are not directly related to the current operating performance of the Group). Underlying operating profit, underlying 
revenue, underlying operating cash and adjusted net debt are not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable to 
other companies’ adjusted profit, revenue, cash or debt measures. They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to IFRS 
measurements.
The adjustments made to reported revenue are:
Exceptional revenues – fees related to exceptional revenues in relation to release of the ATE liability that are not expected to recur 
and are not related to the continuing core operations of the business.
The adjustments made to reported operating profit are:
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments – non-cash Group statement of comprehensive income charge for share-based payments and 
related National Insurance costs. IFRS 2 requires the fair value of equity instruments measured at grant date to be spread over the 
period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. This is a non-cash charge and has been excluded 
from underlying operating profit as it does not reflect the underlying core trading performance of the Group.
IFRS 3 (Revised) Business Combinations – intangible asset amortisation charges and costs arising from acquisitions. Under IFRS 3 
intangible assets are required to be amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and as such this is a non-cash 
charge that does not reflect the underlying performance of the business acquired. Similarly, the standard requires all acquisition 
costs to be expensed in the Group Income Statement. Due to their nature, these costs have been excluded from underlying 
operating profit as they do not reflect the underlying core trading performance of the Group.
Other exceptional costs/income – these relate to certain exceptional costs associated with the Group’s acquisition activities 
including any costs in relation to aborted acquisitions, reorganisation costs associated with exceptional projects that are not related 
to the core operations of the business and exceptional income for the release of previously recognised liability for pre-LASPO ATE. 
These have been excluded from underlying operating profit as they do not reflect the underlying core trading performance of the 
Group.
Going concern
The Group had cash balances of £858,000 (2016: £4,814,000), net assets of £61,811,000 (2016: £59,819,000) and net current 
assets of £6,853,000 (2016: net current liabilities £1,986,000) as at each year end.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. As a consequence, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. As part of the normal management process, detailed 
forecasts of future trading, profits and cashflows on a CGU by CGU basis are prepared, which includes the impact for possible 
changes in market or regulatory conditions. Based on these projections, the Board remains positive about the Group’s short- and 
medium-term prospects.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements. 60 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Revenue
Personal Injury – Revenue is from:
a) Solicitor income (traditional) – Marketing services resulting in the provision of enquiries to Panel Law Firms, based on a cost-plus 
margin model with reference to the cost of the marketing resources needed to generate the enquiry. These revenues are recognised 
when the service is delivered. 
b) Solicitor income (variable) – Marketing services resulting in the provision of enquiries to certain Panel Law Firms where we receive 
variable consideration based on the ultimate case outcome. The revenue recognised on deferral of enquiries is equal to 
management’s best estimate of the future expected cash flows discounted for the time value of money. This is only recognised to the 
extent that the amount is probable and can be reliably estimated.
c) Product income – Commissions received from product providers for the sale of additional products to the Panel Law Firms. 
Revenue is recognised on sale of the product to a PLF to the extent that the amount is probable and can be reliably estimated. 
d) ABS income – Fees receivable from clients for the provision of legal services. Revenue is recognised once it is virtually certain that 
the case will be won.
Pre-LASPO ATE – Revenue from commissions received from the insurance provider for the use of after the event policies by Panel 
Law Firms. From 1 April 2013, this product was no longer available as a result of LASPO regulatory changes. Consequently, there is a 
remaining liability which is being unwound through revenue as historic cases are settled.
Critical Care – Revenue from the provision of expert witness reports and case management support within the medico-legal 
framework for multi-track cases. For expert witness, revenue is recognised on the completion and delivery of reports and for case 
management revenue is recognised based on the level of services provided on a monthly basis. 
Residential Property – Revenue from the provision of online marketing services to target homebuyers and sellers in England and 
Wales and offering lead generation services to Panel Law Firms and surveyors in the conveyancing sector. Revenue is recognised on 
a fixed-fee basis on the transfer of instruction to Panel Law Firms or surveyors. Search revenue is recognised as revenue in the 
period in which the search report is delivered.
All revenue is stated net of Value Added Tax. The entire revenue arose in the United Kingdom.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net 
identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment 
annually and again whenever indicators of impairment are detected and is carried at cost less any provision for impairment.  
Any impairment is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
• Technology related intangibles – 5 to 10 years
• Contract related intangibles – 3 to 10 years
• Brand names   – 3 to 10 years
• Other intangible assets  – 3 to 5 years
No amortisation is charged on assets under construction as these are not yet in use.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment by equal instalments 
over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Fixtures and fittings including:
• Office equipment  – 3 to 5 years
• Computers   – 3 years
Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. 61 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Taxation
Tax on the income statement for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is 
the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a 
business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax 
asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of equity) only to the extent that they meet the 
following two conditions:
a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver cash or other financial assets 
or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the 
Company (or Group); and
b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the 
Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so 
classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up 
share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of interest payable and similar charges.  
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as part of shareholders’ funds are dealt with as 
appropriations in the reconciliation of movements in equity.
Employee share schemes
The share option plans allow employees of the Group to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted is 
recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread 
over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is 
measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.  
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is 
only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable 
amount is estimated each year at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that 
cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use 
that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the CGU). The goodwill acquired in a business 
combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the 
purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which 
impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a 
business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the 
other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. 62 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
NOTES CONTINUED
1 Accounting policies continued
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods 
are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is 
reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only 
to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Geographic information
All revenue and assets of the Group are based in the UK.
Operating segments
The activities of the Group are managed by the Board, which is deemed to be the chief operating decision maker (CODM).  
The CODM has identified the following segments for the purpose of performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. 
These segments are split along product lines and consistent with those reported last year.
Personal Injury – Revenue from the provision of enquiries to the PLFs, based on a cost plus margin model, plus commissions 
received from providers for the sale of additional products by them to the PLFs and in the case of the ABSs, revenue receivable from 
clients for the provision of legal services.
Pre-LASPO ATE – Revenue is commissions received from the insurance provider for the use of after the event policies by PLFs. From 
1 April 2013, this product was no longer available as a result of LASPO regulatory changes. Included in the balance sheet is a liability 
that has been separately identified due to its material value. This balance is commissions received in advance that are due to be paid 
back to the insurance provider. No interest is due on this liability.
Critical Care – Revenue from the provision of expert witness reports and case management support within the medico-legal 
framework for multi-track cases.
Residential Property – Revenue from the provision of online marketing services to target homebuyers and sellers in England and 
Wales, offering lead generation services to PLFs and surveyors in the conveyancing sector and the provision of conveyancing 
searches for solicitors and licensed conveyancers.
Group – Costs that are incurred in managing Group activities or not specifically related to a product.
Other items – Costs associated with the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, reorganisation costs associated with exceptional 
projects that are not related to the core operations of the business, share-based payments and amortisation charges on intangible 
assets recognised as part of business combinations. 63 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

on 26 October 2015 and an additional reduction to 17.0% (effective from 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 
2016. This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017

of comprehensive income.
For all acquisitions, fair values remain provisional in the first year and will be finalised within 12 months of acquisition.
During 2017, the Group incorporated two new ABSs through joint partnerships with members of its PLFs. This led to  
the Group acquiring interests in Your Law LLP and National Law Associates LLP . Project Jupiter Limited, a 100% subsidiary of  
NAHL Group plc, is a member firm of Your Law LLP and National Law Associates LLP . Member capital of £75,000 was advanced  
to the LLPs. There were no other acquisition costs involved.

Where goodwill arose as part of a business acquisition, it forms part of the CGU's asset carrying value which is tested for impairment 
annually. The Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, each segment i.e. PI, CC and RP , is the appropriate 
level at which to test. Due to the discontinued nature of the pre-LASPO ATE product, no goodwill is allocated to it.
The recoverable amounts for the CGUs are based on value in use which is calculated on the operating cash flows expected to be 
generated by the division using the latest budget data for the coming year, extrapolated at a forecast growth rate for four years and 
no growth into perpetuity, discounted at a range of pre-tax WACCs of between 7.5%-8.4% (2016: 10.1%–12.7%). The range of WACCs 
represents the different risk profiles of each CGU.  68 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
NOTES CONTINUED
13 Goodwill continued
For the current year review and going forward, we have added a terminal value onto each forecast which represents the cash flows of 
the CGU into perpetuity with 0% growth assumed. Previous years have considered a forecast period of five years only. This change 
in basis has arisen due to the evolution of the PI business model. As the ABSs are expected to account for a greater proportion of 
profits and cash flows going forward we have deemed it appropriate to consider the cash flows over a longer period to reflect the 
delay and deferment of profits between initial enquiry generation and profit recognition as legal cases in the ABSs can take up to 
three years or more to settle. This is as permitted under IAS36 Impairment of assets. 
Management consider the key assumptions in the value in use calculation to be the discount rate and operating profit growth rate. 
The discount rates are based on the Group’s pre-tax cost of capital and estimated cost of equity, which the Directors consider 
equated to market participants rate. The movement in the discount rates compared to the prior year is the result of greater stability 
in the share price since the announcement in February 2017 of regulatory changes in the PI market. In preparing the formal budget 
for the next financial period, expected underlying operating profit is based on past experience of the performance of the CGUs 
adjusted for known changes.
The operating profit compound annual growth rate assumptions for years one to five were as follows:
2017 2016
Personal Injury (1.4)% (3.6)%
Critical Care 7.5% 10.0%
Residential Property 0.0% 10.0%
A negative growth assumption has been applied to personal injury to account for the new ABS models where profit recognition and 
cash profile are delayed for up to three years until settlement of cases.
Based on the operating performance of the CGUs, no impairment loss was identified in any of the CGUs and there is sufficient 
headroom (calculated as the difference between value in use and the carrying value of each CGU's goodwill) to indicate that no 
reasonable change to key assumptions would result in an impairment of this goodwill.
The available headroom for each CGU is as follows:
2017 2016
Personal Injury 80,592 1,638
Critical Care 41,377 2,580
Residential Property 17,845 5,742
The following table shows the percentage to which the discount rate would need to increase and the percentage by which the 
budgeted operating cash flows would need to decrease in order for the estimated recoverable amount of the CGUs to be equal to the 
carrying amount:
Discount Rate Cashflows
2017 2016 2017 2016
Personal Injury 49.6% 14.1% (66.9)% (4.0)%

Your Law LLP and National Law Associates LLP are both considered to be joint operations as Project Jupiter Limited, a 100% 
subsidiary of NAHL Group plc, is a member firm of each of the LLPs and National Accident Helpline Limited provides marketing 
services and supplies instructions to the LLPs. Each member firm of the LLP is required to appoint individuals to the management 
Board of the LLPs. As Project Jupiter Limited can appoint the majority of individuals to these Boards who are ultimately responsible 
for the day to day operations, decision making and strategic development of the LLPs then the Group is considered to have overall

a bonus issue of newly created Capital Reduction Shares.
21 Share based payments
The Group operates three employee share plans as follows:
SAYE plan
Options may be satisfied by newly issued Ordinary Shares, Ordinary Shares purchased in the market by an employees’ trust or by 
the transfer of Ordinary Shares held in treasury.
EMI Scheme
The EMI Plan provides for the grant, to selected employees of the Group, of rights to acquire (whether by subscription or market 
purchase) Ordinary Shares in the Company (Options). Options may be granted as tax-favoured enterprise management incentive 
options (EMI Options) or non-tax favoured Options.
Nominal Cost LTIP
The nominal cost LTIP will enable selected employees (including Executive Directors) to be granted awards in respect of Ordinary 
Shares. Awards may be granted in the form of nil or nominal cost options to acquire Ordinary Shares or contingent rights to receive 
Ordinary Shares. Awards may be satisfied by newly issued Ordinary Shares, Ordinary Shares purchased in the market by an 
employees’ trust or by the transfer of Ordinary Shares held in treasury.

share option charge and a further £nil (2016: £149,000) has been charged to the income statement in respect of a provision for 
Employer’s National Insurance contributions that are expected to arise on the exercise of the nominal cost LTIP options.
The fair value of each employee share option has been measured using the Black-Scholes formula where an expected volatility  
of 65.0% (2016: 65.0%) has been used as well as a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds) of 1.0% (2016: 1.0%). 
Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the arrangements were not taken into account in measuring fair value.
Expected volatility has been based on evaluation of historical volatility of the Company’s share price, particularly over the historical 
period commensurate with the expected term. The expected term of the instruments has been based on historical experience and 
general option holder behaviour.

23 Financial instruments
(a) Fair values of financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise interest-bearing borrowings, cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose 
of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial instruments such 
as trade and other receivables and trade and other payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees 
policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s 
exposure to financial instrument risks or its objectives, policies and processes for managing and measuring those risks during the 
periods in this report unless otherwise stated.
Trade and other receivables
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of 
interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material.
Trade and other payables
The fair value of trade and other payables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of 
interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material.
Cash and cash equivalents
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand. Where it is 
not repayable on demand then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of 
interest at the balance sheet date.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of 
interest at the balance sheet date.
The interest rate used to discount estimated cash flows of 8.4% (2016: 12.7%) is based on market rates.
The fair values of all financial assets and financial liabilities by class, which approximate to their carrying values, shown in the 
balance sheet are as follows:

Total financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 15,933 15,933 14,005 14,005
Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used 
in the value measurements:
Level 1 – inputs are quoted prices in active markets
Level 2 – a valuation that uses observable inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices in active markets and
Level 3 – a valuation using unobservable inputs, i.e. a valuation technique.
There were no transfers between levels throughout the periods under review.
(b) Credit risk
Financial risk management
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. 75 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Trade receivables 16,247 6,207
Management consider the credit risk to be mitigated as a result of a) the holding of deposits for all significant customers and b) only 
offering significant deferred terms to those PLFs with whom we hold strategic partnerships and after satisfactory credit checks have 
been obtained. As at 31 December 2017 these deposits reflect 6.4% (2016: 21.2%) of the balance of trade receivables. At each 
balance sheet date, the amount of deposit held was:

13.0% of standard terms trade receivables are 120 days or more past due (2016: 15.6%). These receivables arise primarily in Critical 
Care where our standard credit terms are 30 days. As mentioned in the Strategic Report increasing cost pressures on solicitiors 
mean they often do not settle these balances until interim funds are available or a case has settled. This is often within 12 months 
and, therefore, formal deferred terms are not utilised. We monitor these debts closely through regular contact with these solicitors 
and do not consider there to be any significant risks regarding recoverability.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:
2017
£000
2016
£000
Balance at 1 January 104 166
Allowance recognised/(released) 10 (62)
Balance at 31 December 114 104
The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the 
amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly.
(c) Liquidity risk
Financial risk management
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges on its debt instruments and 
repayments of principal. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. The 
Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and loans to 
ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due.

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
Market risk – foreign currency risk
The Group has no foreign currency risk as all transactions are in Sterling.
Market risk – interest rate risk
Profile
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from its use of interest-bearing financial instruments. This is a market risk that the fair 
value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates.
At the balance sheet dates, there were no interest-bearing financial assets; however, the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-
bearing financial liabilities was:
2017
£000
2016
£000
Variable rate instruments
Financial liabilities 13,125 11,250
Total interest-bearing financial instruments 13,125 11,250
Sensitivity analysis
A change of 0.5% in interest rates at the balance sheet date would increase/(decrease) profit or loss in the following year by the 
amounts shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk 
exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable 
interest rates. The analysis is performed on the same basis for the comparative periods.

Decrease 66 56
Market risk – equity price risk
The Group does not have an exposure to equity price risk as it holds no investment in equity securities which are classified as 
available for sale financial assets or designated at fair value through profit or loss.
(e) Capital management
Group
The Group’s objectives when maintaining capital are to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide an 
adequate return to shareholders. Capital comprises the Group’s equity, i.e. share capital including preference shares, share 
premium, own shares and retained earnings, as well as bank loans. 77 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Financial Statements
The Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial information has been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not presented 
its own income statement in these financial statements. The Group profit includes a profit after tax for the parent company of £nil 
(2016: £nil). 
Use of judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements and estimates that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
Judgements
In applying the Company’s accounting policies, management has applied the following judgement that has a significant impact on 
the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of Investment
The Directors have considered the carrying value of the investment and performed an impairment review comparing the carrying 
amount to fair value less cost to sell. The Directors have not considered value in use as under the fair value method, the fair value 
less costs to sell is sufficiently in excess of the carrying amount of the investment. It is the Directors’ opinion that, as this value 
exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, then no impairment should be recognised. Further details of the key assumptions 
used in this judgement are given in note 2.
Estimates
Discussed below are key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that have a 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Recoverability of trade receivables
Trade receivables are reflected net of an estimated provision for impairment losses. This provision considers the past payment 
history and the length of time that the debt has remained unpaid.
New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective
The Company has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective:
• IFRS 9: Financial Instruments – Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early 
application permitted.
• IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers – Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, 
with early application permitted.
• IFRS 16: Leases – Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted for 
entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of initial application of IFRS 16.
The Company has considered the impact of the above standards and revisions and has concluded that they will not have a material 
impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Going concern
The Company had net assets of £70,959,000 (2016: £78,946,000) and net current assets of £18,259,000 (2016: £26,246,000) as 
at each year end.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully. As part of the normal management process, detailed projections of future trading are prepared, 
which includes the impact for possible changes in market or regulatory conditions. Based on these projections the Board remains 
positive about the Company’s short- and medium-term prospects.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements. 82 NAHL Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
1 Accounting policies continued
Employee share schemes
The share option plans allow employees of the Group to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted is 
recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread 
over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is 
measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.  
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture  
is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Company’s non-financial assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses 
are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any 
indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.

Valuation 
Total
£000
At 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017 52,700
Impairment has been assessed on a fair value less costs to sell basis. The key assumption for the fair value less costs to sell basis is 
the control premium. The Directors believe that if the Group were to be sold then a 30% control premium would be a realistic 
premium to add. If the control premium were removed entirely then carrying value would still be less than fair value less costs to sell. 
As the control premium sensitivity is so wide, the directors have not considered additional indicators and have concluded that the 
investment is not impaired on a fair value less costs to sell basis.

Management believes there are no risks arising from these financial instruments on the grounds that the amounts are payable  
on demand and no interest is charged to Group undertakings. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks.  
There have been no substantive changes in the Company’s exposure to financial instrument risks or its objectives, policies and

A charge of £182,000 (2016: £903,000) has been made through profit and loss in the current year. This amount has been recharged 
to the subsidiary companies and as such no cost has been recognised within the Company.
The fair value of each employee share option has been measured using the Black-Scholes formula where an expected volatility of 
65.0% (2016: 65.0%) has been used as well as a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds) of 1.0% (2016: 1.0%). Service 
and non-market performance conditions attached to the arrangements were not taken into account in measuring fair value.
Expected volatility has been based on evaluation of historical volatility of the Company’s share price, particularly over the historical
