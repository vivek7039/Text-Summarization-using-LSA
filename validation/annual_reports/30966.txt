Camellia Plc is an international group – a global family of diverse companies with a 130-year history
employing approximately 80,000 people worldwide. Our operations are in Agriculture, Engineering, Food
Service and the holding of Investments. From the outset, Camellia’s ethos has been based on the highest
moral and professional integrity, and a commitment to doing the right thing – ethically and commercially,
globally and locally. Proﬁts are our lifeblood but not our soul.
Our business is built on two fundamental principles:
■ Long-termism. We see ourselves as custodians, holding our businesses in trust for future
generations. We believe we have a responsibility to ensure the stability, security and continuity of all
our businesses, so they can be passed on to the next generation as enduring operations. We
recognise that people and businesses take time to establish and grow to their full potential and we
are happy to wait for that to happen. We are deeply committed to improving the long-term stability
and well-being of our businesses, the communities and the environments in which we operate.
■ Sustainability. We are committed not only to the ultimate welfare of our employees but also to the
communities in which they live. We believe our businesses can and should grow with respect and
care for the environment rather than at the cost of it. We proactively invest in ensuring that the
environments where we do business are continually protected and improved, and seek to minimise
any damage our activities may cause.
Our continuing business is made up as follows:

I am pleased to report the results for 2017, which reﬂect a proﬁt for the year of £28.6 million (2016: loss
£5.9 million); this includes the previously disclosed exceptional gain on the sale of Duncan Lawrie’s UK
asset management business of £19.2 million, about which more is set out in the Chief Financial Oﬃcer’s
report.
There were no other signiﬁcant changes to the Group structure in the year; however in line with our
strategy and as set out in more detail in the Chief Executive’s report, we made a small acquisition of a
packet tea business in India during the year and since the year end we have acquired a majority
shareholding in Jing Tea. Jing Tea is a UK based distributor of branded speciality teas to the retail and food
service sectors internationally. 
In pursuing our strategic objectives, we have decided to sell two of our smaller engineering businesses,
BMT (Great Yarmouth) and GU Cutting and Grinding, although the sales have yet to complete. More
details are provided in the Chief Executive’s report. 
Trading in 2017 was mixed with a weak start being followed by a much better second half. Our tea
operations performed well as good yields combined with an improving tea price as the year progressed.
However, for the second year running, the macadamia crop was impacted by drought which led to
disappointing volumes. Our speciality crops continue to provide an excellent return which once again
demonstrates the beneﬁts of our diversiﬁed agricultural strategy.
Elsewhere, as previously disclosed, our associate BF&M reported a signiﬁcant reduction in proﬁtability as
a result of the two major hurricanes in September 2017.
Camellia is a business with operations across a number of geographical areas, particularly in emerging
markets, all of which are vulnerable to a global political atmosphere which is relatively unstable by recent
historical standards. Furthermore, changing weather patterns led to a severe drought in the Cape and
Kenya, ﬂooding in Bangladesh and an unprecedented hurricane season in the Caribbean. It is a credit to
our staﬀ across the world that they continue to operate successfully in the face of these challenges.
Board Members
I was delighted to announce the appointment of Gautam Dalal to the Board as a non-executive Director
with eﬀect from 1 March. Gautam’s wide experience of the markets in which we operate will be of great
beneﬁt to the executive team.
Dividend
Your Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 98p per share which, together with the interim dividend
already paid of 37p per share, brings the total distribution for the year to 135p per share compared with
130p per share for 2016.
Outlook
As so much of our result depends on crop volumes in the second half of the year it is not possible to
forecast outturns with any degree of conﬁdence. However, early signs of a better macadamia crop, some
good prices for tea in the ﬁrst quarter of 2018 and continuing strength in our UK markets give us reasons
to be optimistic at this stage.
Staﬀ
As always, my thanks go out to all our staﬀ for their eﬀorts in 2017.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CAMELLIA PLC
249229 Camellia R&A pp01-pp19  18/04/2018  18:12  Page 5 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
Camellia is a unique group, not only in our ethos and culture, but also in the diversity and quality of our
assets. Our ﬁnancial position is strong and following our withdrawal from the UK ﬁnancial services market
our ﬁnancial risks are substantially reduced. In his statement the Chairman rightly reﬂects on the
diﬃculties of operating in emerging markets, however this access to some of the world’s fastest
expanding economies also provides us with opportunities for growth.
In the Agriculture division, whilst climate change and political uncertainty in many of our operating
countries are largely outside our control, we have four key advantages. First, we are growing a selection
of crops which are increasingly in demand from an urbanising, longer living and more health conscious
consumer who is ever more concerned with the provenance of their food. Second, our focus on
sustainability has put us in a strong position to beneﬁt from these global trends. Third, we have been
operating in many of our territories for a very long time. Fourth, we have the resources to pursue our
strategic goals. Furthermore, whilst our expenditure on sustainability may not always be immediately
apparent, our long standing investment in irrigation, community welfare and better agricultural practices
is an integral part of our success. We will continue to build on these strong foundations for the beneﬁt of
all our stakeholders.
In our other divisions we continue to take steps to invest where we believe that it is in the long term
interests of the Group and to divest where we no longer believe that to be the case. 
Over the last three years we have disposed of Duncan Lawrie Asset Management at a substantial proﬁt
and closed or sold Duncan Lawrie Private Bank, AKD Engineering and Loddon all of which were loss-
making. This process of reﬁning our portfolio is an important part of our long term strategy and a
summary of the acquisitions made during 2017 and since the year end is set out below:
■ Tea City. A collection of Indian packet tea brands which was bought by Goodricke to add to its existing
brand portfolio.
■ Jing Tea. A UK based branded speciality teas business selling to the retail and food service sectors
internationally.
Both of these acquisitions will help to bring us closer to our market place and its changing trends; Jing Tea
will also enable us to distribute our high end teas more proﬁtably.
In addition to these acquisitions we are proposing to make a number of small disposals and other
changes to the portfolio as follows:
■ BMT (Great Yarmouth) and GU Cutting and Grinding. Both of these companies have been with the
Group for many years, and whilst both remain cash generative they are too small and too niche to
represent good investment opportunities or to deliver long term growth for the Group. I am pleased
to say that each is in the process of being sold to its respective management team.
■ XiMo. Having now successfully demonstrated production of sample quantities of its catalysts, the next
stage is to conﬁrm the same capabilities on a larger scale in order to prove that the process is viable
commercially. This stage will require signiﬁcant additional investment and we are actively seeking
third party funding for this next step.
I strongly believe that these changes to the portfolio support our long term strategy and will make a
positive contribution to the Group in the future.
I am also pleased that we have been able to raise the dividend again this year. Other than in 2008 when
we held the dividend, we have raised the dividend every year since the merger with Linton Park in 2005.
On other matters, I am pleased that the 2017 triennial UK pension scheme valuation shows a small
surplus of £7.1 million as against a previous deﬁcit of £7.9 million. We will continue to monitor the
position carefully, mindful of our continuing and future obligations to the members.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
BUSINESS STRATEGY
The overall Group strategy, which is set out on page 20, remains unchanged with each division expected
to perform against an agreed divisional strategy with goals and targets for the short, medium and long
term. These are summarised below:
Agriculture
■ To focus on our core crops of tea, macadamia and avocado where we have scale and geographic
spread. Where appropriate opportunities arise, to add to our production capability in these three
crops, as well as to make aligned acquisitions and investments to enable us to capture more of the
value chain.
■ To maintain and potentially to grow our portfolio of non-core crops in order to retain the diversity of
location and crop which has historically proved so valuable in shielding the Group from the impact of
climate change and commodity price ﬂuctuations.
■ To utilise our agricultural expertise to make the most of the estates that we already have and to
develop new estates where possible and appropriate.
Agriculture is the largest division and is the area where we see the best long term investment
opportunities for the Group. This will remain our focus for future investment.
Engineering
Engineering North. To take advantage of the recovering oil sector whilst diversifying into adjacent sectors
in order to create a sustainably proﬁtable engineering business.
Engineering South. To continue to grow Abbey Metal Finishing and its joint venture in Germany, Atﬁn, as
quality suppliers to the aerospace industry.
XiMo. To ﬁnd new investors to take the technology to the next phase in its development.  
Food Service
ACS&T. To continue to operate as a high quality business in the storage and distribution of frozen foods,
aiming to achieve critical mass by proﬁtable growth and if appropriate, acquisition. 
Aﬃsh and Wylax. To establish a sustainably proﬁtable business model that works in the European ﬁsh
distribution market.
Investments
Investment Portfolio. The Group has a portfolio, principally of listed investments, the strategy for which
remains to invest in high quality companies where we believe that there is long term value. This portfolio
also enables us to balance our geographic risk exposure.
Investment Property. The strategy is to continue to invest in quality assets where an appropriate yield may
be realised. The process of developing some of our existing properties to enhance yield will continue.
Collections. The Group has collections of art, philately and manuscripts which are regularly reviewed and
are added to or sold as appropriate.
Associates
The Group has three associate companies in the ﬁnancial services sector of which BF&M, the listed
Bermudian insurance business, is the most signiﬁcant. With all our associates, we continually monitor our
investment and may increase or decrease our holding in the future.

Tea pricing and operations
India
India had a record production year in the Dooars gardens. Volumes in Darjeeling for the year were
materially impacted by the previously reported strike. A new dedicated Bought Leaf factory (Jogopur) was
successfully opened at our Danguajhar factory site and Bought Leaf production was restarted in Assam
on Sessa and Borpatra gardens.
Tea prices for India were generally lower than the previous year other than those from the Dooars region.
Prices at the start of the year were under pressure due to high volumes of unsold teas from 2016’s record
production, but improved from the mid-year point to levels above the previous year’s, particularly for the
Dooars and Assam CTC’s, whilst the Assam orthodox market was down on the previous year. Darjeeling
prices were volatile due to the supply constraints inﬂicted by the strike. First ﬂush teas sold well but the
majority of the second ﬂush and main season teas were lost.
The situation was not helped by the implementation of GST in India, which hindered both the auctions
and tea sales in general as the market familiarised itself with the new system.
Our average selling price over the year was 6.4% lower than the previous year.
Goodricke Group’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certiﬁcate was renewed, as were other
certiﬁcations including FSSC and RFA for all our Assam, Darjeeling and Cachar gardens. The Trust Tea
certiﬁcation for the Bought Leaf initiative is being implemented across all our gardens in the Dooars, and
Goodricke won a social sustainability Bronze award for their WASH (Water, Air and ventilation, Sanitation
and Hygiene) programme, at the North American Tea Sustainability Awards.
In total, India’s national production volumes for 2017 were up on 2016, primarily due to higher
production in south India and increasing volumes from the Bought Leaf sector. Costs continue to rise
through wage and general inﬂation which, without compensatory increases in the market price, creates
margin pressure. To mitigate this, eﬀorts continue to reduce seasonal labour requirements through the
mechanisation of planting, pruning, spraying and plucking.
During the year, Goodricke acquired a number of well-known Indian brands including Tea City, Supercup
and Samovar. This will result in increased volumes of packet tea being produced and sold in 2018 in line
with our strategy of moving up the value chain.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
Bangladesh
Our Bangladesh operations had another successful year achieving their second highest ever production
despite the heavy rainfall which led to signiﬁcant ﬂooding in many areas.
As in India, prices in the Bangladesh market were under pressure during the ﬁrst half of the year due to
high levels of prior year’s stock remaining unsold. Import tariﬀ levels were raised again during the year
and prices recovered well in the third quarter and remained ﬁrm through to the end of the year. Our
average selling price over the year was 4.3% lower than the previous year.
Production trials were conducted on both orthodox and green teas with some very encouraging results
and feedback from the domestic and export markets. These trials will continue with the aim of reaching
commercial production in 2018. Trials have started on shear plucking in an eﬀort to reduce harvesting
costs through improved productivity.
RFA certiﬁcation was achieved on all gardens in September. Duncan Brothers being only the second, but
by far the largest, producer to achieve this certiﬁcation in Bangladesh.
Kenya
Our production was impacted by drought during the ﬁrst half of the year but saw an upturn as the
weather improved in the ﬁnal quarter.
Tea prices in Kenya ﬁrmed at the start of the year as it became apparent that the dry conditions were
going to have an impact on national production. These growing conditions did not improve until the 4th
quarter which saw record production. However, despite this, our average selling price for the year was
21.5% ahead of the previous year.
The wage negotiations remain unresolved for the Collective Bargaining Agreement years of 2014/15, and
2016/17 which creates uncertainty in the cost base and agitation, frustration and industrial action at the
operational level. To mitigate the risk of escalating labour costs, our eﬀorts to develop more mechanised
processes continue. To this end automated withering has been installed on a trial basis in our Chemomi
factory and the area under mechanised tea harvesting has expanded and will continue to do so. The
research and development initiative into new harvester technology continues with the engagement of a
UK specialist engineering company to design and fabricate a new prototype.
The number of smallholders continues to increase as does the volume derived from this sector.
Smallholder production represents a signiﬁcant proportion of our total volumes in Kenya and remains a
critical factor in the wider social responsibility and sustainability strategy of our tea operations.
All the estates and registered smallholders are RFA and FSSC certiﬁed and Eastern Produce Kenya won an
environmental sustainability Gold award for our “Wise Use” programme at the North American Tea
Sustainability Awards.
Malawi
Our Malawi operations achieved an all-time record crop and also began a project to produce and sell
commercial volumes of green tea which has met with signiﬁcant interest from buyers.
Tea prices in Malawi were ﬁrm throughout 2017 due to strong demand resulting from an undersupplied
Kenyan market. Our average tea selling price for the year was 21.2% higher than the previous year.
The Malawi Tea Revitalisation 2020 programme continues with the roll out of some excellent initiatives in
nutrition, gender empowerment and smallholder production. Eastern Produce Malawi won a social
sustainability Gold award at the North American Tea Sustainability Awards for its Diversity, Inclusion and
Women’s Welfare policy in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 5, “to achieve gender equality
and empowerment of women and girls”. 
All estates and smallholders are RFA certiﬁed and three factories have FSSC 22000 certiﬁcation; the ﬁrst
tea factories in Malawi to achieve this.

Macadamia Production
Macadamia production in 2017 was disappointing and showed a slight decrease from the already
signiﬁcantly reduced volumes in Malawi and South Africa seen in 2016. This was due to drought conditions
that aﬀected both regions and the consequential reduction in nut volumes and size.

Macadamia Pricing
Due to rising demand for macadamia products, prices remained ﬁrm and in line with the previous year’s
levels during the ﬁrst half of the year. As it became apparent in the market that supply was once again
impacted by drought, particularly in southern Africa, prices reached record highs; our average selling price
for the year was 7.4% ahead of the prior year. Signiﬁcant progress was made in the development of the
Maclands brand.
Macadamia Operations
Malawi
Overall Malawi volumes were below those of 2016 and the lowest seen in the last 15 years, which is
indicative of the drought impact. The operation is focusing on agronomic activities to mitigate the impacts
of climate change and to improve the resilience of the orchards to a changing growing environment. Such
initiatives include heavy mulching, tree thinning, plant density reduction and replanting. Currently over
50% of our orchards are still young in production potential terms so the prospects for improved volumes
going forward are positive.
The processing factory is FSSC 22000 certiﬁed.
South Africa
Volumes were disappointing though marginally up on the previous year. As with the Malawi operations,
the focus is on agronomic activities which will improve the ability of the orchards to cope with more
extreme climate challenges. There is also signiﬁcant investment being made to expand water resources
for irrigation from the Simpson Dam on Mambedi estate.
Due to the rising costs of labour, investment is being made in the mechanisation of certain activities
including harvesting, sorting and processing.
The development of Mambedi estate to macadamia continues with over 80Ha of new planting completed,
bringing the total development to just under 300Ha.
The processing factory successfully completed the second phase of upgrading and is FSSC 22000 certiﬁed.
The renewal of the lease for our Wales estate is under negotiation. If unsuccessful, it will result in Eastern
Produce South Africa having to vacate the property at the expiry of the lease in March 2020 with the last
harvest from the estate likely to be that for 2019.
Kenya
Production volumes were up on the previous year’s levels but were also impacted by the dry conditions
experienced in Kenya in the ﬁrst half of the year. To combat this, similar initiatives to those of Malawi and
South Africa are under way.
249229 Camellia R&A pp01-pp19  18/04/2018  18:12  Page 10 11
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
The footprint of the orchards continues to grow with an additional 73Ha planted to bring the total
development to 1,027Ha. The age proﬁle of the orchards is very young and volumes are expected to grow
rapidly with the developing maturity proﬁle.
The cracking facility successfully completed its second full season of processing and is FSSC 22000
certiﬁed.

Avocado Pricing and Operations
Avocado production was in line with expectations for the year despite the dry conditions which had a
negative impact on fruit size. We exported an increased volume of Hass but Pinkerton volumes were down
on the previous year. Fruit sourced from smallholders was signiﬁcantly reduced as unscrupulous exporters
took advantage of European demand to export immature fruit. As a result of these exports and the
associated reputational damage, Kenyan fruit is now frequently being discounted in the European market.
However, by maintaining the standard of our own fruit, pricing achieved through the year was ﬁrm and in
line with the previous year for similar sized fruit.
New avocado development continues with 60Ha of orchards planted. The total orchard footprint now
stands at 607Ha. In addition, Eastern Produce Kenya is undertaking a three year trial of Hass avocado near
Kitale in western Kenya to investigate the viability of avocado production in that region.

Speciality Crops Pricing and Operations
Arable. Record yields were once again achieved in soya and establishing forward contracts early for the
2017 crop ensured that the prices achieved were in line with the prior year despite an oversupplied
market. Record yields were also achieved in the maize crop which more than compensated for the lower
than expected prices which arose from oversupply in the market.
Rubber. Production was in line with the previous year. Demand was disappointing, leading to sustained
low prices throughout the year.

Citrus. In California we had a good year, with record yields being achieved for the Murcotts without an
impact on prices. Navel oranges also performed well with good yields and prices.
Wine. The continuing drought in the Cape meant that grape production was below expectations but in line
with the previous year’s volumes. Wine sales were also disappointing. Investment was made in the winery
to improve handling and quality in production.
Almonds. Production and pricing was in line with expectation for this relatively immature development. 
Pineapples. These are being phased out at Kakuzi and will be replaced with Pinkerton avocado. 
Forestry. Better sales of large poles at Kakuzi led to a much improved result.
We continue to raise cattle on those areas of the Kakuzi estate in Kenya unsuitable for crop development.
In total, the Agriculture division made a trading proﬁt of £35.6 million (2016: £29.9 million) on revenue of
£239.4 million (2016: £207.1 million).
Engineering
Engineering North
Engineering North continued to struggle in 2017 as the anticipated pick up in the oil industry failed to
translate into signiﬁcant additional sales or proﬁts. The new Site Services division, which provides services
to the hydroelectric sector, has made an encouraging start. As a result, total revenue at AJT Engineering
rose to £8.0 million from £6.9 million in 2016.
Engineering South
Abbey Metal Finishing and its subsidiary Atﬁn made a substantially increased operating proﬁt in 2017 as
demand grew for their services to the aerospace industry. The two other companies in this division are in
the process of being sold.
XiMo
XiMo, our industrial catalyst research and development business, continues to develop products with the
objective of commercial use. In common with other research based businesses, it is expected to lose
money pending the outcome of commercial trials. As stated earlier, we are now seeking partners to
ﬁnance the next stage of its development.
In total, the Engineering division made a trading loss of £2.6 million (2016: trading loss £2.6 million) on
revenue of £20.5 million (2016: £18.8 million).
Food Service
ACS&T saw revenue and proﬁts grow substantially in 2017 as demand increased for its services from its
major customers.
In the Netherlands, both Aﬃsh and Wylax succeeded in increasing revenue, but due to exchange rate
movements and a competitive market ended the year loss making.
In total the Food Service division made a trading proﬁt of £1.8 million (2016: £0.8 million) on revenue of
£37.8 million (2016: £31.6 million).
Investments
Investment Portfolio. The gains on sale for the year were £0.7 million (2016: £1.5 million). The total value of
the portfolio at 31 December 2017 was £47.0 million (2016: £37.2 million).
Investment Property. We continue to work on our estate of investment properties in order to maximise the
value and the return. Following refurbishment in 2016, No. 6 Hobart Place was let during the year as was
a property in Queen Square in Bristol. On the Linton Park estate work has commenced to convert surplus
buildings into residential property for rent.
Collections. The collections are held at cost. A number of minor additions and disposals were made during
the year.

BF&M recorded a strong operating year from its core insurance and investment advisory services.
However, two category 5 hurricanes in the Caribbean in September 2017 (Irma and Maria) resulted in
signiﬁcant costs and the need to purchase additional reinsurance cover which has led BF&M to report a
reduced proﬁt before tax of Bermudian Dollar 1.9 million (2016: Bermudian Dollar 17.9 million).
Our two associate companies in Bangladesh, United Insurance and United Finance, saw marginally lower
proﬁts than in 2016 as a result of falling interest rates and political uncertainty.
In total, the share of the results of associates amounted to £2.0 million (2016: £5.1 million).
Discontinued Operation – Duncan Lawrie
As previously stated, the wind down of the remaining assets of Duncan Lawrie continued throughout
2017 and the banking license was ﬁnally returned in December, indicating that the regulators in the UK
are satisﬁed that all issues have been dealt with. The full ﬁnancial impact of the disposals and closure are
summarised in the Chief Financial Oﬃcer’s Report.
POLITICAL, LEGISLATIVE and LEGAL ISSUES
The Group is present in many jurisdictions and is subject to local legislation. The following issues may
have a material impact on the Group:
■ At the start of 2016 the Government of Malawi put forward new legislation which proposed, inter alia,
the conversion of all freehold property into 50 year leaseholds. 
■ The Group continues to monitor and assess the impact of the UK’s exit from the EU. To date the
impact of the decision has been broadly conﬁned to currency movements which may impact the
costs of imports, particularly tea, and the prices paid to producers. 
CAPITAL INVESTMENT and DEVELOPMENT
We continued to invest in our assets during the year and £15.0 million was spent on property, plant and
equipment and investment property (2016: £10.2 million) including the following key projects:
■ Starting the rebuilding of the Simpson Dam in Mambedi, South Africa to assist with water retention
for the macadamia estates.
■ Trialing a new automated withering system at Chemomi factory, Kenya in order to improve quality
and reduce labour costs.
■ Building a Bought Leaf factory at our Dangujuar garden in India.
■ Continuing improvements to Linton Park winery in South Africa.
■ Developing the Ruo factory and irrigation in Malawi.
■ Development of our investment properties in the UK.
In addition to our continuous programme of replanting our tea areas, a programme to extend our
planted areas in macadamia and avocado has been underway for a number of years and in 2017:
■ 91Ha (2016: 65Ha) of new avocado plantings were completed in Kenya.
■ 73Ha (2016: 97Ha) of new macadamia plantings were carried out in Kenya, 82Ha (2016: 47Ha) in
South Africa and 48Ha (2016: 12Ha) in Malawi.

Responsibility
The Group’s businesses are fundamentally connected to the welfare of our communities and the
environments in which we operate. We proactively invest to ensure these environments are protected
and improved. Our focus is on the long-term stability, security and continuity of our businesses and those
communities. We support and integrate the UN Sustainable Development Goals into our sustainability
strategy.
We invest in, monitor and report on, both Environmental and Social sustainability initiatives across all our
divisions. In 2017 the Group launched a new on-line system for capturing data relating to our global
environmental footprint. The system allows us to monitor our energy use, Greenhouse Gas emissions,
Water and Waste, the results of which are summarised below. 
As part of our wider drive towards greater sustainability, we have developed a range of mid to long-term
targets to reduce, in some cases substantially, the environmental impact of our operations. As an example,
strategic improvements in our usage and sourcing of energy supports our ambition to align with Science
Based Targets. Targets adopted by companies to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions are considered
“science-based” if they are in line with the level of decarbonisation required to keep the global temperature
increase below 2 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial temperatures.
Whilst monitoring and reducing our environmental footprint is critical, so too is ensuring the well-being of
the communities in which we operate. We refer to this social sustainability as our “licence to trade”. The
level of health and educational facilities available from state governments varies widely across our
operations, and consequently so does the focus and scale of our social sustainability projects. The level of
support provided to many of these communities by the Group is substantial and is summarised below.
We also need to ensure that all our operations can demonstrate that they meet the requirements of our
customers in terms of certiﬁcations and traceability. The vast majority of our tea gardens are RFA certiﬁed
and all our macadamia, avocado and winery operations are FSSC 22000 certiﬁed. Further details of these
are included in the operational reports above.
Environmental Sustainability
The key metrics for the Group include Greenhouse Gas emissions, water usage and waste produced. The
table below sets out the Baseline (average of the three years 2013-2015) and how we have progressed
since that time.

(i) A 1.4% decrease in Greenhouse Gas emissions in 2017 has been achieved through a focus on more eﬃcient use of
energy, reduced tea production in 2017, and a reduction in emissions of electricity from the grid, oﬀset by an
increase in fossil fuel usage in certain of our operations.
(ii) Dry conditions in Kenya and South Africa as well as an expansion of our irrigation infrastructure in a number of
our operations to help address the impact of drought have increased water use.
(iii) These are restated ﬁgures and take account of the fact that we no longer consider certain types of compost to be
waste. There are ongoing initiatives to increase our waste recycling rates in a number of our operations.

249229 Camellia R&A pp01-pp19  18/04/2018  18:12  Page 14 Some of the initiatives we are undertaking include:
■ Pursuing limited resource use eﬃciency, this year alone we identiﬁed over 200 energy and water
management projects across the Group.
■ Ongoing investment in energy eﬃcient technology includes: upgrading lighting and trialing energy
eﬃcient motors and variable speed drives, continued growth in the use of renewable energy via solar
projects and the increasing use of energy eﬃcient transport across the Group. 
■ Development of modern water management solutions is aligned with energy eﬃciency and improved
sanitation projects in many of our operations. Precision Agriculture is increasingly used to determine
the water status of both soil and plant for eﬃcient use of water in irrigation. We also implement
systemic water management processes by encouraging water recycling, water harvesting through
rainwater capture and by building dams.
Social Sustainability
We believe that all employees should be remunerated fairly and that they and their families should have
access to education, healthcare and housing. The table below shows the provision of schools and
healthcare by the Group in 2017. In addition, we continue to provide housing for over 200,000 people.
2017
Schools* 284
School children educated annually 33,259
Hospitals/clinics* 114
Patient treatments annually 795,581
*The funding and operation of schools and hospitals, provided for our employees and their communities, varies by
location in accordance with local culture, practice and requirement. Some facilities are owned and operated by us
directly, whilst others are fully or partly funded by us whilst being state and/or NGO managed and owned.
Through a broad range of CSR initiatives across the Group, we contribute to improved health and
nutrition, hygiene and sanitation of our communities. We assist with the improvement of local
infrastructure by supporting road, water, healthcare and education projects. In 2017, our work in this area
was recognised by the Tea Association, USA. Our continued focus on developing sustainable housing for
our working communities is reﬂected in major housing renewal projects in India, Bangladesh, Kenya and
Malawi.
Health
All our tea estates have a hospital, clinic or dispensary. In addition in India and Bangladesh staﬀ have
access to central Group operated hospitals to which more serious cases can be referred. We provide
medical services, including where appropriate antiretroviral drugs, in those communities where HIV/AIDs
is prevalent. We also give medical support to schools that are either run locally or by our operations.
During 2017 in India, we made our hospital facilities available to visiting surgeons to perform over
400 medical treatments for cleft palates, club feet and eye conditions. In Bangladesh, our Primary Health
Care initiative is extended to all estates and provides the communities with comprehensive and specialist
health programmes.
Education
We are committed to providing the opportunity for development for all. We provide schools in areas
where we operate, either by building and running the schools or by supporting state educational projects
in our communities. Aiming to develop education and opportunity for all employees, we provide skills
development programmes and adult education. For example, in Malawi we support students from
technical colleges by providing employment opportunities. In India, over 350 adults received educational
support through a range of initiatives, including the Peter Leggatt Educational Stipend.

Female economic empowerment
In order to support our working mothers and enable them to take part in the economic process, we
provide over 16,000 places at ﬁxed and mobile crèches across our operations.
Smallholders
Demonstrating our commitment to responsible sourcing, we continue to develop smallholder
programmes including agricultural training days in Kenya, Malawi and India. In 2017, we produced
19.2 million kgs of smallholder Made Tea across the Group. In Kenya, 220,000 cartons of avocados were
packed for smallholders during the year. These initiatives enabled over 30,000 local farmers to improve
their earnings by beneﬁting from our agricultural expertise, infrastructure and access to market.
Wages
We are committed to paying fair wages, beneﬁts and allowances in accordance with local legislation and
trade union agreements and have received certiﬁcations from Fairtrade, the Rainforest Alliance and
WEITA, among others, all of which require an audit of the Group’s employment practices as part of
maintaining the accreditations. We are part of a number of other initiatives to address the issue of low
pay in developing countries. All our UK companies are Living Wage accredited employers.
Senior Appointments
Following the retirement of Arun Singh, Chief Executive of Goodricke since 2006, I am pleased to report the

Overview of results
The proﬁt for the year ending 31 December 2017 was £28.6 million (2016: loss £5.9 million). The proﬁt
improvement reﬂects, inter alia, the discontinuation of Duncan Lawrie which straddled two ﬁnancial years
and resulted in a gain in 2017 on the sale of Duncan Lawrie’s asset management business while the losses
on the sale of the loan books were reﬂected in the 2016 results. In addition, a signiﬁcant increase in proﬁts
in Agriculture as a result of a recovery in tea prices in the second half of 2017 led to the trading proﬁt from
our continuing businesses increasing to £26.4 million (2016: £19.0 million). These gains were partly oﬀset
by lower results from BF&M, and provisions and impairments in respect of GU Cutting and Grinding and
BMT (Great Yarmouth).
The Group had net assets of £417.9 million (2016: £379.6 million) and net cash and cash equivalents of
£106.8 million (2016: £71.8 million, excluding balances relating to our banking operations).
Discontinued operation
During 2017, the Group completed the sale of Duncan Lawrie’s UK asset management business as well as
the disposals of various businesses operated by Duncan Lawrie’s Isle of Man subsidiaries. The disposal of
Duncan Lawrie’s UK asset management business generated a gain on sale of £19.2 million which is
reﬂected in the results for 2017, as is a small net proﬁt on the sale of the Isle of Man asset management
business and trust operations. In December 2016, we completed the sale of the UK loan book. Duncan
Lawrie’s banking licences were surrendered in 2017 and the business is now closed.
The proﬁt from the discontinued operation in 2017 was £14.8 million (2016: loss £20.0 million) comprising
the following:
2017 2016
£’m £’m
Duncan Lawrie’s operating loss (5.5) (7.5)

BF&M
Following the two signiﬁcant hurricanes during 2017, BF&M’s share price fell signiﬁcantly. However, due
to its conservative underwriting policies, there has been no impact on its balance sheet strength. The
prospects for BF&M remain good and the underlying net asset value of the business remains signiﬁcantly
ahead of the share price and accordingly no impairment provision has been made.
GU Cutting and Grinding and BMT (Great Yarmouth)
As a consequence of the decision to sell GU Cutting and Grinding and BMT (Great Yarmouth), these
businesses have been reclassiﬁed as held for sale at the end of 2017 and an impairment charge of
£1.8 million has been recognised (2016: nil). The trading proﬁts for these businesses (£0.3 million in 2017)
are reported within Engineering.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REPORT
Currencies
Over the course of the year ending 31 December 2017, Sterling strengthened substantially against all our
key operating currencies. This has resulted in a loss on foreign exchange translation of £28.4 million
(2016: gain £52.0 million) which is reﬂected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Despite the
signiﬁcant movement in exchange rates against Sterling between the beginning and end of the year, had
we translated our proﬁt before tax for the year using the same average rates as last year, our results for
2017 would have been £0.5 million lower. Our proﬁt before tax from continuing operations includes an
exchange loss of £0.1 million on transactions during the year (2016: gain £0.4 million).
Cash
The Group’s net cash position increased to £106.8 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: £71.8 million
excluding net cash balances held within Duncan Lawrie) reﬂecting, inter alia, strong net cash inﬂows from
continuing operating activities of £30.9 million (2016: inﬂow £21.5 million) and the discontinuation of the
Duncan Lawrie business. The Group has loans outstanding amounting to £4.5 million.
A number of the Group’s key trading subsidiaries have minority shareholders such that when cash is
repatriated to the UK by way of dividends, those minorities are entitled to their share of the relevant
dividend. In a number of cases, withholding taxes are also payable from our share of those dividends.
Funds are reserved within our subsidiary companies for:
■ Long term development projects within our core crop portfolio. 
■ Ongoing wage negotiations, the largest of which is the multi-year Kenyan Collective Bargaining
Agreement (referred to below) which has been ongoing for 4 years. 
■ Disputed taxation assessments (see below).
These will reduce the net cash available to the Group in future years as they are resolved.
However, following the ﬁnalisation of the triennial valuation for the UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme,
no deﬁcit reduction payments are required for the time being.
Dividends
In line with the Group’s long term strategy, the key use of cash is reinvestment in the business. Despite
this, Camellia has a long track record of steady dividend growth and it is hoped that this historical trend is
maintained. Dividend cover in 2017 is 5.9x the total dividend for the year of 135p per share. The dividend
is covered 2.0x from our proﬁt after tax from continuing operations.
Taxation
The Group’s eﬀective tax rate of 32.5% (2016: 190.8%) reﬂects the proﬁt from the various Duncan Lawrie
sales which are expected to be non-taxable and available UK losses.
The 2016 tax charge reﬂects the losses incurred in the UK in respect of the discontinued operation which
were not able to be relieved due to the lack of taxable proﬁts in the UK.
Tax and other provisions
The wage negotiations in Kenya remain unresolved for the Collective Bargaining Agreement years of
2014/15 and 2016/17 which creates uncertainty as to the cost base of our businesses in Kenya. We also
have ongoing wage negotiations in India and Bangladesh. While we consider we have made adequate
provision for the likely outcome of this ongoing negotiation it is diﬃcult to be deﬁnitive.
We are carrying provisions for taxation arising from assessments raised by the Malawi Revenue Authority
for unpaid taxes from prior years. The amount of this provision is £2.3 million at 31 December 2017.
249229 Camellia R&A pp01-pp19  18/04/2018  18:12  Page 18 19
CAMELLIA PLC
We have been advised that the gain on sale of Duncan Lawrie’s asset management business should be
exempt from tax because of the nature of the assets sold. Accordingly, no provision has been made for
tax on this gain.
In India assessments have been received for £3.8 million of excise duties and £1.3 million of income
taxes. These are being contested and no provisions have been made.
In India, a long running dispute between our local subsidiaries and the Government of West Bengal over
the payment of a land tax, locally called ‘Salami’, remains unresolved. Lawyers acting for the Group have
advised that payment of Salami does not apply, accordingly no provisions have been made. The sums
contested amount to £1.4 million excluding penalties.
In some of our jurisdictions, the tax authorities have levied assessments in respect of prior years. In a
number of situations the liability position under statute and case law is clear and provision has been
made in line with those. Unfortunately, in other situations the law is either unclear or under developed
and in these instances we make provisions on a best estimate basis for the liabilities likely to arise, having
taken advice as appropriate.
Pensions and post-employment beneﬁts
The Group operates a number of deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes, the largest of which is in the UK. Our
2017 triennial valuation for the UK scheme has been agreed and shows a surplus of £7.1 million. I am
pleased to report that as a consequence of this surplus, no further deﬁcit reduction contributions are
required for the meantime.
The overseas deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are located in Bangladesh, India and the Netherlands. The UK
scheme was closed to future accrual during 2016. Our businesses in Kenya, India and Bangladesh also
have obligations to pay terminal gratuities based on years of service and, in some cases based on
salaries.
In aggregate, our employee beneﬁt schemes currently show deﬁcits on an IAS 19 basis of £30.9 million
(2016: £66.7 million deﬁcit).
Accounting for deﬁned beneﬁt schemes is prescribed by IAS 19 and the quantum of the deﬁcit continues
to be volatile and sensitive to small changes in assumptions as regards inﬂation and gilt yields in the
relevant jurisdictions. This year a net actuarial gain of £34.3 million (2016: net actuarial loss of £24.3
million) is reﬂected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The gain this year reﬂects:
■ For the UK Scheme, the eﬀect of updating the mortality assumptions to bring them in line with the
latest tables available together with better than expected returns on the scheme’s assets. 
■ For the overseas schemes, higher discounts rates in India oﬀset in part by higher than expected
salary increases elsewhere.
In addition, £2.7 million (2016: £2.2 million) has been charged to our Income Statement in respect of
employee beneﬁt obligations.
Contributions to externally funded deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are determined after consultation with the
respective trustees and actuaries.
Shareholders’ funds
Equity attributable to Camellia’s shareholders at the 2017 year end was £368.4 million (2016: £330.8
million).
A reconciliation is set out in the Group statement of changes in equity.

Business review
The Company is required to set out in this report a fair review of the business of the Group during the year
ended 31 December 2017 and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. A fair
review of the business of the Group is incorporated within the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief
Executive’s Report on pages 6 to 16. The Chairman’s statement and the Chief Executive’s report, together
with information contained within the Report of the Directors, highlight the key factors aﬀecting the
Group’s development and performance. Further details of the ﬁnancial performance and position of the
Group are set out in the Chief Financial Oﬃcer’s Report on pages 17 to 19. Other matters are dealt
with below.
Group strategy
The Board has adopted the following strategy for the Group:
■ To develop a worldwide group of businesses requiring management to take a long term view. 
■ The achievement of long-term shareholder returns through sustained and targeted investment. 
■ Investing in the environment and sustainability of the communities in which we do business. 
■ Ensuring that the quality and safety of our products and services meet the highest international
standards. 
■ The continuous reﬁnement and improvement of the Group’s existing businesses using our internal
expertise and ﬁnancial strength.
The progress against this strategy during the year is set out in further detail in the Chief Executive’s report
shown on pages 7 to 16 and within the Report of the Directors.
Business model
The Group consists of businesses engaged in Agriculture, Engineering and Food Service. The Group also
holds a range of Investments. Businesses are managed on a divisional basis with regular reports made to
the Board on performance against the annual budget.
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of possible risks and uncertainties that could impact the Group’s operations. As the
Group’s businesses are widely spread both in terms of activity and location, it is unlikely that any one single
factor could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term performance. The Group regularly monitors
the risks at a local and central level. Information on the Group’s ﬁnancial risks is disclosed in note 39 to the
Accounts. The following risks relating to the Group’s principal operations have been identiﬁed:

Taxation risk
Uncertainties exist in relation to the interpretation of complex tax legislation, changes in tax laws, and the
amount and timing of future taxable income. In some jurisdictions agreeing tax liabilities with local tax
authorities can take several years. This could necessitate future adjustments to taxable income and
expenses already recorded.
At the year-end, tax liabilities and assets are based on management’s best judgements around the application
of the tax regulations and an estimate of the future amounts that will be settled. Management considers tax
exposures individually, and arrives at judgements with support from experienced tax professionals and
external advisors. There is, however, a risk that the Group’s judgements are challenged by the tax authorities,
resulting in a diﬀerent tax payable or tax recoverable from the amounts that have been provided.

CAMELLIA PLC
Uncertainties impacting taxation also arise from potential changes to legislation. The OECD’s Base
Erosion and Proﬁt Shifting project is one of the most signiﬁcant multilateral initiatives in recent years
modifying international tax rules. As these recommendations are introduced into local tax legislation over
the coming years, this may impact the Group’s eﬀective tax rate.
Social and environmental policies
Further information on the Group’s activities and policies on corporate and social responsibility is set out
in the Chief Executive’s report on page 6 to 16.
Equality
We have consciously and continuously worked towards encouraging equality in management positions
across our operations.
Disability
The Group complies with local regulations to encourage employees with disabilities to work in our
operations and where appropriate, makes adjustments to working practices.
Child Labour
The use of child labour is prohibited across the Group. In some countries, it is both the cultural norm and
permissible for parents to involve their children in the productive process. We do not subscribe to this
approach.
Modern Slavery
The Group continues to comply with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, to ensure that
modern slavery and human traﬃcking is not taking place either within the wider group or in the supply
chains of our businesses. A copy of the statement of compliance for the year to 31 December 2017 is
available on the Company’s website.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption
The Board has adopted an anti-bribery policy which complies with the requirements of the UK Bribery Act
2010. The policy has been introduced across the Group and its compliance is monitored at both Group
and local level. The Board strictly prohibits bribery as part of its normal business practices.
Performance against our policies
There are no current employment or environmental issues that prejudice the continuing development of
the Group. None of the Group’s businesses were prosecuted for any signiﬁcant breach of employment
legislation during the year. The Board has established a process for ensuring that the corporate social
responsibility policy is enforced across the Group.
Key ﬁnancial performance indicators
The nature of the Group’s principal activities is such that the Board takes a long-term view on its
operations, particularly in Agriculture. 
The Board reviews monthly reports with a range of ﬁnancial and other indicators to monitor the
performance of each division depending on the nature of its operations.
For the Agriculture division, the Board receives monthly data on sales prices and volumes, cost of
production and crop yields against budget. Rainfall and other climate data are also reviewed.
For the Engineering division, the Board receives monthly data on revenue, proﬁt and margins. In addition,
the value of the outstanding order book is reviewed.
For the Food Service division, the Board receives monthly data on revenue, proﬁt and margins. In
addition, cold store utilisation is monitored.
For Investments, the value and performance of the share portfolio is reviewed each month and the
collections are periodically valued against market price.

CAMELLIA PLC
Principal responsibilities
The principal responsibilities of the audit committee are set out below and were undertaken during the
year:
■ To monitor the eﬀectiveness of the Group’s risk management practices.
■ To review the eﬀectiveness of the Group’s internal control system. The committee regularly reviews
the eﬀectiveness of internal audit activities carried out by the Group’s accounting function and senior
management.
■ To review and monitor the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and the audit of those statements
and to monitor compliance with relevant ﬁnancial reporting requirements and legislation.
■ To monitor the eﬀectiveness and independence of the external auditors.
■ To review non-audit services provided by the external auditors.
Signiﬁcant issues in relation to ﬁnancial statements
The audit committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether
management has made appropriate estimates and judgements. In the year under review, the audit
committee considered the following matters in relation to the ﬁnancial statements:
Biological assets. One of the key areas of judgement that the committee considered in reviewing the
ﬁnancial statements was the valuation of the biological assets in accordance with IAS 41. Valuations are
carried out by external professional valuers or are based on discounted cash ﬂows. These were
considered for consistency of approach and assumptions agreed as reasonable. For more details see
note 19 to the accounts.
Pensions. A key area of judgement is in relation to the value of the pension scheme obligation. Whilst this
is conducted by independent actuaries, the size of the obligation means that a relatively minor diﬀerence
in the assumptions could result in a material change in the obligation. The committee considered the
competence of the actuaries and the key assumptions adopted and concluded that the work performed
is suﬃcient to support the value.
Assets held for sale. The committee considered the reclassiﬁcation of BMT (Great Yarmouth) and GU
Cutting and Grinding as assets held for sale including reviewing the impairment provisions required.
Tax and other uncertain provisions. The basis of provisions for material uncertain tax situations were
considered by the committee as were the provision in respect of the ongoing Collective Bargaining
Agreement negotiations for 2014/15 and 2016/17. The committee is satisﬁed that the provisions
represent best estimates of the likely liabilities.
External auditor
To assess the eﬀectiveness of the external audit process, the external auditor is required to report to the
audit committee and conﬁrm their independence in accordance with ethical standards and that they had
maintained appropriate internal safeguards to ensure their independence and objectivity. In addition to the
steps taken by the Board to safeguard auditor objectivity, Deloitte operates a ﬁve year rotation policy for
audit partners for a listed entity.
The committee reviewed those non-audit services provided by the external auditor and satisﬁed itself that
the scale and nature of those services were such that the external auditors objectivity and independence
were safeguarded.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Following the appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s external auditor, the committee oversaw the
transition from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
The committee conﬁrms that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s
performance, business model and strategy.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is chaired by William Gibson and the other member is Chris Relleen.
The responsibilities of the committee include:
■ The review of the Group’s policy relating to remuneration of the Chairman, executive Directors and
the Company Secretary. 
■ To determine the terms of employment and remuneration of the Chairman, executive Directors and
Company Secretary with a view to ensuring that those individuals are fairly but responsibly rewarded.
■ To approve compensation packages or arrangements following the severance of any executive
Director’s service contract.
The Remuneration Report appears on pages 34 to 35.
Insurance
The Company purchases insurance to cover its Directors in respect of legal actions against them in their
capacity as Directors of the Company. All Directors have access to independent professional advice at the
Company’s expense.
Share capital structure
The share capital of the Company is set out in note 34.
Internal control and risk management systems
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal control.
During the year, the audit committee, on behalf of the Board, reviewed the eﬀectiveness of the
framework of the Group’s system of internal control, the principal features of which are described below.
Decentralisation is a key management philosophy with responsibility for eﬃcient day to day operations
delegated to local management. Accountability and delegation of authority are clearly deﬁned with
regular communication between Group head oﬃce and local management. Our key operating businesses
have internal audit functions reporting to local audit committees. The performance of each company is
continually monitored centrally including a critical review of annual budgets, forecasts and monthly sales,
proﬁts and cash reports. Financial results and key business statistics and variances from approved plans
are carefully monitored. Group senior management regularly visit and review the Group’s operating units.
However, any system of internal control can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against
material mis-statement or loss.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that
law the Directors are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have
also chosen to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give
a true and fair view of the state of aﬀairs of the company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company for that
period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that
Directors:
■ Properly select and apply accounting policies.
■ Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable,
comparable and understandable information.
■ Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are
insuﬃcient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and
conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance; and
■ Make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are suﬃcient to show and
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial
information included on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may diﬀer from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
■ The ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole.
■ The strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and
the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole,
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
■ The Annual Report and ﬁnancial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable
and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and
performance, business model and strategy.

REMUNERATION REPORT
This report is drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the AIM Rules for Companies.
Remuneration committee
Details of the remuneration committee (“the committee”) are set out on page 32.
Policy on Directors’ remuneration
The policy agreed by the committee is as follows:-
■ To seek to provide remuneration packages that will attract, retain and motivate the right people for
the roles.
■ So far as is practicable to align the interests of the executives with those of shareholders.
■ To reﬂect the overriding remuneration philosophy and the principles of the wider Group.
In implementing the second point, the Company does not operate proﬁt related bonus, share option or
share incentive schemes for Directors as the Group’s activities are based largely on agriculture, which is
highly dependent on factors outside management control such as the weather and market prices.
The policy is designed to ensure that the Directors manage the Group’s businesses for the long term in
line with the strategy of the Group.
In determining this remuneration policy and the remuneration of Directors, consideration has been given
to the relevant provisions of the QCA guidelines.
The remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. The committee considers any
views of the shareholders expressed on Directors’ remuneration.
At the AGM on 1 June 2017, the Remuneration Report for the year to 31 December 2016 was approved by
shareholders with 99.46% of the votes cast in favour, 0.53% of the votes cast against and 0.01 votes
withheld.

Directors’ pensions
Malcolm Perkins received no payment for pensionable service during 2017. Tom Franks receives an
excess non-pensionable salary supplement equivalent to 10% of base salary. Graham Mclean and Susan
Walker were members of the Linton Park Group Personal Pension Scheme which is a deﬁned
contribution based scheme until 5 April 2017. As a result of the change to the taxation rules on pension
annual allowances, the company ceased contributions to the Linton Park Group Personal Pension
Scheme on 6 April for Graham Mclean and Susan Walker. They instead receive an excess non-pensionable
salary supplement equivalent to 10% of base salary. These payments are included in ‘Remuneration’ in
the table above.
In addition to the above, an unfunded pension of US$200,000 per annum is paid to Gordon Fox, a former
Director of the Company.

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
for the year ended 31 December 2017
CAMELLIA PLC

249229 Camellia R&A pp36-pp42  18/04/2018  18:14  Page 42 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
43
CAMELLIA PLC
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements are set out
below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, IFRS IC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as modiﬁed by the
revaluation of biological assets, available-for-sale investments, ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities and
assets held for sale.
Where necessary, comparative ﬁgures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation in the
current year. During the year, £8.6 million of comparative amounts previously classiﬁed as other payables
have been reclassiﬁed as provisions.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements, a reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future.
They therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the ﬁnancial
statements.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets
acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deﬁciency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the
identiﬁable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the
period of acquisition. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis, at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised
amounts of acquiree’s identiﬁable net assets.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated
Income Statement from the eﬀective date of acquisition or disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the
accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All Intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not
control or joint control, through participation in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of that entity.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Under this method the
Group’s share of the post-acquisition proﬁts or losses of associates is recognised in the Income Statement
and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on
the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Translation diﬀerences on non-monetary items carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value
gain or loss. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the Income Statement, except for
exchange diﬀerences arising on non-monetary items where the changes in fair value are recognised
directly in equity.
249229 Camellia R&A pp43-pp53  18/04/2018  18:14  Page 43 The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling which is the Company’s functional and
presentation currency. On consolidation, income statements and cash ﬂows of foreign entities are
translated into pounds sterling at average exchange rates for the year and their balance sheets are
translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange diﬀerences arising from the
translation of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings designated as hedges of such
investments, are taken to equity. When a foreign entity is sold such exchange diﬀerences arising since
1 January 2004 are recognised in the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate ruling on the date of acquisition. The
Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January
2004, the date of the Group’s transition from UK GAAP to IFRS, as sterling denominated assets and
liabilities.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents
amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts,
value added tax and other sales related taxes and after eliminating intra-group sales.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) The Group has transferred to the buyer the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods:
(ii) The Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with
ownership nor eﬀective control over the goods sold;
(iii) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
(iv) It is probable that the economic beneﬁts associated with the transaction will ﬂow to the entity; and
(v) The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Invoices are raised when goods are despatched or when the risks and rewards of ownership otherwise
irrevocably pass to the customer.
In respect of food storage and distribution services, revenue for handling is recognised at the point that
the goods are actually handled.
In respect of engineering services, revenue is recognised based upon the stage of completion and
includes costs incurred to date, plus accrued proﬁts.
Investment income
Investment income is recognised when the right to receive payment of a dividend is established.
Segmental reporting
The adoption of IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identiﬁed on the basis of internal reports used
to assess performance and allocate resources by the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating
decision maker has been identiﬁed as the Group Strategy Committee led by the Chief Executive.
Inter-segment sales are not signiﬁcant.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those signiﬁcant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or
incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. Full disclosure of
exceptional items are set out in notes 5 and 6.
Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s
interest in the fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or
associate at the date of acquisition.

CAMELLIA PLC
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Any impairment is recognised
immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
(ii) Identiﬁable intangible assets
Indeﬁnite life identiﬁable intangible assets include certain brands acquired. They are not amortised but
tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an impairment indicator is triggered, any
impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises. The assessment of the classiﬁcation of
intangible assets as indeﬁnite is reviewed annually.
Finite life identiﬁable intangible assets include certain brands, customer relationships and other
intangible assets acquired on the acquisition of subsidiaries. Acquired intangible assets with ﬁnite lives
are initially recognised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, not
exceeding 20 years. Intangible assets’ estimated lives are re-evaluated annually and an impairment test is
carried out if certain indicators of impairment exist.
(iii)Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the speciﬁc software. Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a
straight-line basis over 3 to 7 years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an
expense as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with identiﬁable and unique software products
controlled by the Group and which are expected to generate economic beneﬁts exceeding costs beyond
one year, are recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment now includes biological assets (bearer plants) which are accounted for
under IAS 16.
Land and buildings comprises mainly factories and oﬃces. All property, plant and equipment is shown at
cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment, except for land, which is shown at cost less
impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of these assets.
On transition to IFRS, the Group followed the transitional provisions and elected that previous UK GAAP
revaluations be treated as deemed cost.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amount, only when it is probable that future
economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the Group and the cost of the item can be
measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the ﬁnancial
period in which they are incurred.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Depreciation of other property, plant and equipment is
calculated to write oﬀ their cost less residual value over their expected useful lives.
The rates of depreciation used for the other assets are as follows:-
Biological assets (Bearer plants) 20 to 50 years
Freehold and long leasehold buildings nil to 50 years
Other short leasehold land and buildings unexpired term of the lease
Plant, machinery, ﬁxtures, ﬁttings and equipment 3 to 25 years
No depreciation is provided on bearer plants until maturity when commercial levels of production have
been reached.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as
owned assets, or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
249229 Camellia R&A pp43-pp53  18/04/2018  18:14  Page 45 The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance
sheet date.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the diﬀerence between
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is included in the income statement.

Investment properties
Properties held to earn rental income rather than for the purpose of the Group’s principal activities are
classiﬁed as Investment properties. Investment properties are recorded at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. The depreciation policy is consistent with those
described for other Group properties.
Income from Investment properties is disclosed in ‘other operating income’. The related operating costs
are immaterial and are included within administrative expenses.
Biological assets: non-current
Biological assets are measured at each balance sheet date at fair value and are generally valued at each
year end by independent professional valuers. Any changes in fair value are recognised in the Income
Statement in the year in which they arise. Costs of new areas planted are included as “new planting
additions” in the biological assets note. As timber is harvested the value accumulated to the date of
harvest is treated as “decrease due to harvesting” and charged to cost of sales in the Income Statement.
Biological assets: current
Produce is valued on the basis of net present values of expected future cash ﬂows and include certain
assumptions about yields, selling prices, costs and discount rates. As the crop is harvested it is
transferred to inventory at fair value.
Financial assets
The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables, available-for-
sale and held-to-maturity. The classiﬁcation depends on the purpose for which the ﬁnancial assets were
acquired. Management determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnancial assets at initial recognition.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
after the end of the reporting period. These are classiﬁed as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and
receivables comprise ‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the Balance Sheet.
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not
classiﬁed in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment
matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments
and ﬁxed maturities that the Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to
maturity. Were the Group to sell other than an insigniﬁcant amount of held-to-maturity assets, the entire
category would be tainted and reclassiﬁed as available-for-sale.
Regular purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets are recognised on the trade-date, the date on which the
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus
transaction costs for all ﬁnancial assets. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash
ﬂows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are subsequently carried at fair value. Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
include shares of listed and unlisted companies. The fair values of listed shares are based on current bid
values. Shares in unlisted companies are measured at cost as fair value cannot be reliably measured.
Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classiﬁed as available-for-sale are
recognised in other comprehensive income. When securities classiﬁed as available-for-sale are sold or
impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are included in the Income Statement
as ‘proﬁt/(loss) on disposal of available-for-sale investments’.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognised in the Income Statement as part of
investment income when the group’s right to receive payments is established.
Loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are subsequently carried at amortised cost using
the eﬀective interest method.

Other investments – heritage assets
Other investments comprise ﬁne art, documents, manuscripts and philately which are measured at cost
as fair value cannot be reliably measured.
Investments in subsidiary companies
Investments in subsidiary companies are included at cost plus incidental expenses less any provision for
impairment. Impairment reviews are performed by the Directors when there has been an indication of
potential impairment.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
(i) Assets carried at amortised cost
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a
ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets is impaired. A ﬁnancial asset or a group of ﬁnancial assets is
impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result
of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss
event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash ﬂows of the ﬁnancial asset or group of
ﬁnancial assets that can be reliably estimated.
For the loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the diﬀerence between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows (excluding future credit
losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the ﬁnancial asset’s original eﬀective interest rate. The
carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated
Income Statement.
249229 Camellia R&A pp43-pp53  18/04/2018  18:14  Page 47 If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the
debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the
Consolidated Income Statement.
(ii) Assets classiﬁed as available-for-sale
In the case of equity investments classiﬁed as available-for-sale, a signiﬁcant or prolonged decline in the
fair value of the security below its cost is also evidence that the assets are impaired. If any such evidence
exists for available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the diﬀerence between the
acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that ﬁnancial asset previously
recognised in proﬁt or loss is removed from equity and recognised in proﬁt or loss. Impairment losses
recognised in the consolidated income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the
consolidated income statement. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classiﬁed
as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the
impairment loss was recognised in proﬁt or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the
consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for
impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not
be recoverable. Assets that are subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss
is recognised for the amount by which the assets’ carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an assets’ fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
identiﬁable cash ﬂows (cash-generating units).
Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at
the lower of fair value and the estimated present value of the underlying lease payments. Each lease
payment is allocated between the liability and ﬁnance charges so as to achieve a constant rate of interest
on the ﬁnance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of ﬁnance charges, are
included in liabilities. The interest element of the ﬁnance cost is charged to the Income Statement over
the lease period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under ﬁnance leases is depreciated over the
shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term.
Leases where a signiﬁcant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are
classiﬁed as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the Income
Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories
Agricultural produce included within inventory largely comprises stock of ‘black’ tea. In accordance with
IAS 41, on initial recognition, agricultural produce is required to be measured at fair value less estimated
point of sale costs.
Other inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and,
where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories
to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable
value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these
receivables. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms. The
amount of the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.

CAMELLIA PLC
Amounts due from customers of banking subsidiaries consist of loans and receivables which are non-
derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the bank provides money, goods or services directly to a customer with no intention of
trading the receivable and are carried at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for sale
A discontinued operation is a separate major line of business or geographic area of operation that has
either been disposed of, abandoned or is part of a plan to dispose of a major line of business or
geographic area. An operation is classiﬁed as a discontinued operation in the year that the above criteria
are met. In the consolidated Income Statement, proﬁt/loss from discontinued operations is reported
separately from the results from continuing operations. Prior periods Income Statement and cash ﬂow
are presented on a comparable basis.
Non-current assets classiﬁed as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair
value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is
highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must
be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within
one year from the date of classiﬁcation.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary
course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classiﬁed as current liabilities if payment is due
within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the eﬀective interest method.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct
issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue
costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the Income Statement using the eﬀective interest method
and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the
period in which they arise.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt diﬀers from net proﬁt as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on diﬀerences between the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax is not
accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than in a
business combination, that at the time of the transaction aﬀects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or
loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related tax asset is realised or the
tax liability is settled.
249229 Camellia R&A pp43-pp53  18/04/2018  18:14  Page 49 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be
available against which the temporary diﬀerences can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are oﬀset when there is a legally enforceable right to oﬀset current tax assets against current
tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by
the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or diﬀerent taxable entities where there is
an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary diﬀerences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates,
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary diﬀerence is controlled by the Group and it is
probable that the temporary diﬀerence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Employee beneﬁts
(i) Pension obligations
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are funded through payments to
insurance companies or trustee-administered funds. The Group has both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned
contribution plans.
A deﬁned contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays ﬁxed contributions into a
separate fund. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the
fund. Contributions are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement when they are due.
A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a pension plan that deﬁnes an amount of pension beneﬁt that an employee will
receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and
compensation.  The pension cost for deﬁned beneﬁt schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice
of qualiﬁed independent actuaries using the "projected unit" funding method.
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is the present
value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
Independent actuaries calculate the obligation annually using the “projected unit” funding method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial adjustments are
recognised in full in the period in which they occur, they are not recognised in the Income Statement and
are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Past service costs are recognised directly in the Income Statement.
(ii) Other post-employment beneﬁt obligations
Some Group companies have unfunded obligations to pay terminal gratuities to employees. Provisions
are made for the estimated liability for gratuities as a result of services rendered by employees up to the
balance sheet date and any movement in the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.
The estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the balance sheet
date is recognised as an accrual.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the
amount has been reliably estimated.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

CAMELLIA PLC
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the
consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted
from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax eﬀects, is included in equity attributable to the
Company’s equity holders.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s ﬁnancial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim
dividends are recognised when paid.
Sources of estimation uncertainty
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting will, by
deﬁnition, seldom equal the actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year are set
out below.
(i) Impairment of assets
The Group has signiﬁcant investments in intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, biological
assets, associated companies and other investments. These assets are tested for impairment when
circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment. Factors considered which could trigger an
impairment review include the signiﬁcant fall in market values, signiﬁcant underperformance relative to
historical or projected future operating results, a major change in market conditions or negative cash
ﬂows.
(ii) Biological assets
Biological assets are carried at fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs. Where meaningful market-
determined prices do not exist to assess the fair value of biological assets, the fair value has been
determined based on the net present value of expected future cash ﬂows from those assets, discounted
at appropriate pre-tax rates. In determining the fair value of biological assets where the discounting of
expected future cash ﬂows has been used, the Directors have made certain assumptions about expected
life-span of the plantings, yields, selling prices, costs and discount rates. Details of assumptions made and
sensitivity analysis are given in note 19.
(iii)Retirement beneﬁt obligations
Pension accounting requires certain assumptions to be made in order to value obligations and to
determine the impact on the Income Statement. These ﬁgures are particularly sensitive to assumptions
for discount rates, mortality, inﬂation rates and expected long-term rates of return on assets. Details of
assumptions made and sensitivity analysis are given in note 33.
(iv) Taxation
Tax provisions are based on management’s interpretation of country speciﬁc tax law and the likelihood of
settlement. This involves a signiﬁcant amount of judgement as tax legislation can be complex and open to
diﬀerent interpretation. Management uses professional ﬁrms and previous experience when assessing
tax risks. Where actual tax liabilities diﬀer from the provisions, adjustments are made which can have a
material impact on the Group’s proﬁts for the year.
249229 Camellia R&A pp43-pp53  18/04/2018  18:14  Page 51 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRSs as of 1 January 2017:
IAS 7 (amendments) Statement of cashﬂows - eﬀective from 1 January 2017
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 7 for the ﬁrst time in the current year.
IAS 12 (amendment) Recognition of deferred tax - eﬀective from 1 January 2017
Amendments made to IAS 12 in January 2016 clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is
measured at fair value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. Speciﬁcally, the amendments
conﬁrm that:
■ A temporary diﬀerence exists whenever the carrying amount of an asset is less than its tax base at
the end of the reporting period.
■ An entity can assume that it will recover an amount higher than the carrying amount of an asset to
estimate its future taxable proﬁt.
■ Where the tax law restricts the source of taxable proﬁts against which particular types of deferred tax
assets can be recovered, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets can only be assessed in
combination with other deferred tax assets of the same type.
■ Tax deductions resulting from the reversal of deferred tax assets are excluded from the estimated
future taxable proﬁt that is used to evaluate the recoverability of those assets.
The amendments to IAS 7 and IAS 12 have not had a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements of
the Group.
(ii) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet
eﬀective and have not been adopted early by the group
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are eﬀective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated
ﬁnancial statements. None of these is expected to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – eﬀective from 1 January 2018
The standard covers the classiﬁcation, measurement and derecognition of ﬁnancial instruments and
applies an approach where the business model of an entity and the cash ﬂows associated with each
ﬁnancial asset deﬁnes the classiﬁcation of the ﬁnancial instrument. IFRS 9 applies a forward-looking
impairment model that will replace the currently applicable incurred loss model.
Classiﬁcation and measurement
Under IFRS 9 the classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial assets is based both on the business model within which the
asset is held and the contractual cash ﬂow characteristics of the asset. There are three principal
classiﬁcation categories for ﬁnancial assets that are debt instruments: (i) amortised cost, (ii) fair value
through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and (iii) fair value through proﬁt or loss (FVTPL). Equity
investments in scope of IFRS 9 are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in proﬁt or
loss unless an irrevocable election is made to recognise gains or losses in Other comprehensive income.
At the date of initial application of IFRS 9, the Group has elected to apply the FVTOCI option for all of its
non-controlling equity interests that were classiﬁed as Available for sale ﬁnancial assets (“AFS”) under IAS
39. This election results in all gains and losses being presented in Other comprehensive income except
dividend income which is recognised in proﬁt or loss. This diﬀers from the current treatment of AFS
instruments under IAS 39 where gains and losses recognised in Other comprehensive income are
reclassiﬁed to proﬁt and loss on derecognition or impairment. There will be no other changes in the
classiﬁcation and measurement for any of the Group’s other ﬁnancial assets or liabilities.
52
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CAMELLIA PLC
249229 Camellia R&A pp43-pp53  18/04/2018  18:14  Page 52 The Group has elected not to restate comparatives on initial application of IFRS 9. The full impact of
adopting IFRS 9 on the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements will depend on the ﬁnancial
instruments that the Group holds during 2018 as well as on economic conditions and judgements will be
made at the year end. The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of the potential impact of
adopting IFRS 9 based on the ﬁnancial instruments as at the date of initial application of IFRS 9. Based on
the Group’s preliminary assessment, the adoption of IFRS 9 will not have a material impact on the
ﬁnancial statements.
Impairment
The impairment model under IFRS 9 reﬂects “expected” credit losses, as opposed to “incurred” credit
losses under IAS 39. Under the impairment approach in IFRS 9, it is not necessary for a credit event to
have occurred before credit losses are recognised. The amount of expected credit losses should be
assessed on initial recognition of the related asset and updated at each reporting date.
The Group expects to apply the simpliﬁed approach to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for its
trade receivables as required or permitted by IFRS.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers – eﬀective from 1 January 2018
The IASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue. This will replace IAS 18 which covers
contracts for goods and services and IAS 11 which covers construction contracts.
The new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service
transfers to a customer – so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards.
A new ﬁve-step process must be applied before revenue can be recognised:
■ Identify contracts with customers
■ Identify the separate performance obligation
■ Determine the transaction price of the contract
■ Allocate the transaction price to each of the separate performance obligations
■ Recognise the revenue
The adoption of IFRS 15 is not expected to have a material ﬁnancial impact on the ﬁnancial statements of
the Group as the Group’s revenue recognition practises are in line with IFRS 15 in all material respects.
IFRS 16 Leases – eﬀective from 1 January 2019
IFRS 16 will aﬀect primarily the accounting by lessees and will result in the recognition of almost all leases
on Balance Sheet. The standard removes the current distinction between operating and ﬁnancing leases
and requires recognition of an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a ﬁnancial liability to pay
rentals for virtually all lease contracts. An optional exemption exists for short-term and low-value leases.
The Income Statement will also be aﬀected because the total expense is typically higher in the earlier
years of a lease and lower in later years.
Additionally, operating expense will be replaced with interest and depreciation.
Operating cash ﬂows will be higher as cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability are
classiﬁed within ﬁnancing activities. Only the part of the payments that reﬂects interest can continue to
be presented as operating cash ﬂows.

Included in revenue is £0.6 million (2016: £0.4 million) of rental income generated from investment
properties. Direct operating expenses arising on the investment property, the majority of which
generated rental income in the period, amounted to £0.2 million (2016: £0.2 million).
At the end of the year the fair value of the investment properties was £23.4 million (2016: £22.8 million).
Investment properties were valued by the Directors (fair value hierarchy Level 2).

Biological assets are carried at fair value. Where meaningful market-determined prices do not exist to
assess the fair value of biological assets, the fair value has been determined based on the net present
value of expected future cash ﬂows from those assets, discounted at appropriate pre-tax rates. At
31 December 2017 professional valuations were obtained on a signiﬁcant proportion of assets. In
determining the fair value of biological assets where the discounting of expected future cash ﬂows
has been used, the Directors have made certain assumptions about the expected life-span of the
plantings, yields, selling prices and costs. There are no individually signiﬁcant unobservable inputs.
The fair value of livestock is based on market prices of livestock of similar age and sex.
New planting additions represent new areas planted to the particular crop at cost.
As at 31 December 2017 the area planted to Forestry amounted to 5,866 Hectares (2016: 5,946) from
which 196,121 cubic metres (2016: 169,089) were harvested during the year.
Livestock numbers were 4,502 head (2016: 4,704) at 31 December 2017.
Fair value measurement
All of the biological assets fall under level 3 of the hierarchy deﬁned in IFRS 13.
The basis upon which the valuations are determined is set out in accounting policies on page 46.

19 Biological assets (continued)
Valuations by external professional valuers and those derived from discounted cash ﬂows both make
assumptions based on unobservable inputs of: yields, an increase in which will raise the value; costs,
an increase in which will decrease the value; market prices, an increase in which will raise the value;
life span of the plantings, an increase in which will raise the value; discount rates, an increase in which
will decrease the value. These assumptions vary signiﬁcantly across diﬀerent countries, crops and
varieties. In preparing these valuations a long term view is taken on the yields and prices achieved.
The fair value of biological assets is sensitive to these assumptions, the more signiﬁcant of which are
as follows:
Non-current:
– Forestry – a 10% movement in the market price for trees or volume of trees assumed would result in
a £1.2 million (2016: £1.3 million) increase/decrease in the fair value of forestry.
Current:
– Macadamia – a 10% increase/decrease in the volumes assumed would result in a £0.2 million
(2016: £0.1 million) increase/decrease in the fair value of macadamia growing crop. A 10%
increase/decrease in selling price assumed for macadamia would result in a £1.0 million
(2016: £0.9 million) increase/decrease in the fair value.
– Avocados – a 10% increase/decrease in the volume or the price assumed would result in a
£0.1 million (2016: £0.1 million) increase/decrease in the fair value of Hass avocados growing crop.
– Soya – a 10% increase/decrease in the volume or the price assumed would result in a £0.2 million
(2016: £0.4 million) increase/decrease in the fair value of soya growing crop.
Financial risk management strategies
The Group is exposed to ﬁnancial risks arising from changes in the prices of the agricultural products
it produces. The Group does not anticipate that these prices will decline signiﬁcantly in the
foreseeable future. There are no futures markets available for the majority of crops grown by the
Group. The Group’s exposure to this risk is mitigated by the geographical spread of its operations,
selective forward selling in certain instances when considered appropriate, and regular reviews of
available market data on sales and production. The Group monitors closely the returns it achieves
from its crops and considers replacing its biological assets when yields decline with age or markets
change.
Further ﬁnancial risk arises from changes in market prices of key cost components. Such costs are
closely monitored.

Deferred tax liabilities of £23.8 million (2016: £24.3 million) have not been recognised for the
withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain
subsidiaries. Such amounts are permanently reinvested.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that the
realisation of the related tax beneﬁt through future taxable proﬁts is probable. The Group has not
recognised deferred tax assets of £10.9 million (2016: £9.5 million) in respect of losses that can be
carried forward against future taxable income.

33 Employee beneﬁt obligations
(i) Pensions
Certain Group subsidiaries operate deﬁned contribution and funded deﬁned beneﬁt pension
schemes. The most signiﬁcant is the UK funded, ﬁnal salary deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. The assets of
this scheme are administered by trustees and are kept separate from those of the Group. The
performance of the assets is monitored on a regular basis by the trustees and their investment
advisors. A full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 1 July 2017 and updated to 31 December
2017 by a qualiﬁed independent actuary. The UK ﬁnal salary deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme is
closed to new entrants and with eﬀect from 1 November 2016, the scheme was closed to future
accruals. Since that date members have participated in a deﬁned contribution scheme.
The overseas schemes are operated in Group subsidiaries located in Bangladesh, India and The
Netherlands. Actuarial valuations have been updated to 31 December 2017 by qualiﬁed actuaries for
these schemes.
Assumptions
The major assumptions used in the valuation to determine the present value of the schemes’ deﬁned
beneﬁt obligations were as follows:
2017 2016
% per annum % per annum
UK schemes
Rate of increase in salaries N/a 2.00
Rate of increase to LPI (Limited Price Indexation) pensions in payment 2.20 – 5.00 2.40 – 5.00
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 2.45 2.65
Inﬂation assumption (CPI/RPI) 2.20/3.20 2.40/3.40
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are based on advice received from independent
actuaries. The current mortality tables used are SAPS 2, males 105% and females 104%, on a year of
birth basis, with CMI_2016 future improvement factors and subject to a long term annual rate of
future improvement of 1.25% per annum. This results in males and females aged 65 having life
expectancies of 21.7 years (2016: 22.5 years) and 23 years respectively (2016: 24.4 years).
Overseas schemes
Rate of increase in salaries 1.50 – 7.00 1.50 – 7.00
Rate of increase to LPI (Limited Price Indexation) pensions in payment 0.00 – 3.00 0.00 – 5.00
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 2.00 – 7.50 1.80 – 9.00
Inﬂation assumption 0.00 – 7.00 0.00 – 7.00
(ii) Post-employment beneﬁts
Certain Group subsidiaries located in Kenya, India and Bangladesh have an obligation to pay terminal
gratuities, based on years of service. These obligations are estimated annually using the projected
unit method by qualiﬁed independent actuaries. Schemes operated in India are funded but the
schemes operated in Kenya and Bangladesh are unfunded. Operations in India and Bangladesh also
have an obligation to pay medical beneﬁts upon retirement. These schemes are unfunded.

Assumptions
The major assumptions used in the valuation to determine the present value of the post-employment
beneﬁt obligations were as follows:
2017 2016
% per annum % per annum
Rate of increase in salaries 6.00 – 10.00 6.00 – 10.00
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 7.00 – 13.50 6.75 – 14.50
Inﬂation assumptions 0.00 – 10.00 0.00 – 10.00
(iii) Leave obligations
Certain Group subsidiaries located in India have an obligation to pay leave beneﬁt, based on years of
service. These obligations are estimated annually using the projected unit method by qualiﬁed
independent actuaries. These schemes are unfunded.
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity of the UK deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
Impact
on deﬁned
Change beneﬁt 
in assumption obligation
Discount rate 0.5% higher 7.2% decrease
Discount rate 0.5% lower 8.1% increase
Rate of RPI inﬂation 0.25% higher 1.8% increase
Rate of RPI inﬂation 0.25% lower 1.7% decrease
Life expectancy +1 year 4.5% increase
Life expectancy -1 year 4.5% decrease
The above changes in assumptions may have an impact on the value of the scheme’s investment
holdings. For example, the scheme holds a proportion of its assets in corporate bonds. A fall in the
discount rate as a result of lower UK corporate bond yields would lead to an increase in the value of
these assets, thus mitigating the increase in the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to some extent. The
sensitivities have been calculated by changing the key assumption only and leaving all others ﬁxed.
Duration of the scheme liabilities
The weighted average duration of the UK scheme’s liabilities is 15 years.
Analysis of scheme liabilities
The liabilities of the UK scheme are split as follows:

Current pensioners 59

38 Contingencies
In India, assessments have been received for excise duties of £3.8 million and of £1.3 million for
income tax matters. These are being contested on the basis that they are without technical merit.
In India, a long running dispute between our local subsidiaries and the Government of West Bengal
over the payment of a land transfer tax, locally called, “Salami”, remains unresolved. Lawyers acting
for the Group have advised that payment of Salami does not apply. The sum in dispute, excluding
ﬁnes and penalties, amounts to £1.4 million. Since the year end, and pending resolution of the
dispute (which, if resolved in our favour, will result in the sums being returned), the Group has agreed
to deposit the tax in seven equal annual instalments in order to allow the normal functioning of the
estates.
The Group operates in certain countries where its operations are potentially subject to a number of
legal claims. When required, appropriate provisions are made for the expected cost of such claims.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern, while
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of its debt and equity balance. The
capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 30,
cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued
capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Board reviews the capital structure, with an objective to ensure that gross borrowings as a
percentage of tangible net assets does not exceed 50 per cent.
The ratio at the year end is as follows:

Fair value estimation
The table below analyses ﬁnancial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
diﬀerent levels have been deﬁned as follows:
■ Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1).
■ Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2).
■ Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is,
unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The following table presents the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value. See note 19 for disclosures of biological assets that are measured at fair value.

Financial risk management objectives
The Group ﬁnances its operations by a mixture of retained proﬁts, bank borrowings, long-term loans
and leases. The objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂexibility
through the use of borrowings with a range of maturities. To achieve this, the maturity proﬁle of
borrowings and facilities are regularly reviewed. The Group also seeks to maintain suﬃcient undrawn
committed borrowing facilities to provide ﬂexibility in the management of the Group’s liquidity.
Given the nature and diversity of the Group’s operations, the board does not believe a highly complex
use of ﬁnancial instruments would be of signiﬁcant beneﬁt to the Group. However, where
appropriate, the Board does authorise the use of certain ﬁnancial instruments to mitigate ﬁnancial
risks that face the Group, where it is eﬀective to do so.
Various ﬁnancial instruments arise directly from the Group’s operations, for example cash and cash
equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables. In addition, the Group uses ﬁnancial instruments
for two main reasons, namely:
■ To ﬁnance its operations (to mitigate liquidity risk);
■ To manage currency risks arising from its operations and arising from its sources of ﬁnance (to
mitigate foreign exchange risk).

39 Financial instruments (continued)
The Group, including Duncan Lawrie, the Group’s discontinued banking subsidiary, did not, in
accordance with Group policy, trade in ﬁnancial instruments throughout the period under review.
(A) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group has no material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on currencies other than
the functional currencies of the operating entities, with the exception of signiﬁcant Japanese
available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets. A movement by 5 per cent. in the exchange rate of the
Japanese Yen with Sterling, the Group’s equity balance would increase/decrease by £1.0 million
(2016: £0.8 million).
Currency risks are primarily managed through the use of natural hedging and regularly reviewing
when cash should be exchanged into either sterling or another functional currency.
(ii) Price risk
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk because of investments held by the Group
and classiﬁed on the consolidated balance sheet as available-for-sale. To manage its price risk
arising from investments in equity securities, the Group diversiﬁes its portfolio.
The majority of the Group’s equity investments are publicly traded and are quoted on stock
exchanges located in Bermuda, Japan, Switzerland, UK and US. Should these equity indexes
increase or decrease by 5 per cent. with all other variables held constant and all the Group’s
equity instruments move accordingly, the Group’s equity balance would increase/decrease by
£2.2 million (2016: £1.8 million).
The Group’s exposure to commodity price risk is not signiﬁcant.
(iii) Cash ﬂow and interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from interest-bearing assets and short and long-term
borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash ﬂow interest rate risk.
The Group’s UK borrowings of £4.6 million are at ﬁxed rates.
At 31 December 2017, if interest rates on non-sterling denominated interest-bearing assets and
borrowings had been 50 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax
proﬁt for the year would have been £0.3 million (2016: £0.3 million) higher/lower.
The interest rate exposure of the Group’s interest bearing assets and liabilities by currency, at
31 December was:

(B) Credit risk
The Group has policies in place to limit its exposure to credit risk. Credit risk arises from cash and
cash equivalents, deposits with banks and ﬁnancial institutions, as well as credit exposures to
customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. If customers are
independently rated, these ratings are used. Otherwise if there is no independent rating,
management assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account its ﬁnancial position,
past experience and other factors and if appropriate holding liens over stock and receiving payments
in advance of services or goods as required. Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits
regularly.
The Group has a large number of trade receivables, the largest ﬁve receivables at the year end
comprise 27 per cent. (2016: 27 per cent.) of total trade receivables.
(C) Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of Directors. The Group
manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously
monitoring forecast and actual cash ﬂows and managing the maturity proﬁles of ﬁnancial assets and
liabilities.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of £25.8 million (2016: £28.5
million), all of which are due to be reviewed within one year.
The table below analyses the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities which will be settled on a net
basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to
the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash ﬂows.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CAMELLIA PLC
Report on the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
Opinion
In our opinion:
■ The ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent
company’s aﬀairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s proﬁt for the year then ended;
■ The Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
■ The parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of
the Companies Act 2006; and
■ The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Camellia Plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the
‘Group’) which comprise:
■ The consolidated income statement;
■ The consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
■ The consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
■ The consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
■ The consolidated and parent company cash ﬂow statements; and
■ The related notes 1 to 41.
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs
as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company ﬁnancial statements, as applied
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s
responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements
that are relevant to our audit of the ﬁnancial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as
applied to listed entities, and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃcient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identiﬁed in the current year were:
■ Revenue recognition
■ Fair value of biological assets under IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’
■ Impairment of factories and bearer plants
■ Proﬁt on disposal of Duncan Lawrie businesses
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group ﬁnancial statements was £1.4m
which was determined on the basis of 5% of proﬁt before tax from continuing
operations.
Scoping Our scoping provides full scope audit coverage of 98% of the Group’s revenue,
91% of the Group’s proﬁt before tax and 78% of the Group’s net assets.

CAMELLIA PLC
REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Conclusions relating to going concern
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signiﬁcance in our
audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the current period and include the most signiﬁcant assessed risks of
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identiﬁed. These matters included those
which had the greatest eﬀect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and
directing the eﬀorts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue recognition
■ The directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in preparation of the ﬁnancial statements
is not appropriate; or
■ The directors have not disclosed in the ﬁnancial
statements any identiﬁed material uncertainties that
may cast signiﬁcant doubt about the Group’s or the
parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the
going concern basis of accounting for a period of at
least twelve months from the date when the ﬁnancial
statements are authorised for issue.
We have nothing to report in respect of
these matters.
Key audit matter
description
The Group’s agricultural operations involve a wide range of customer
delivery models, including auction and retail sales. Per IAS 18, revenue is
recognised when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred to the buyer. Given the complexity of the Group’s operations and
the terms of business with buyers, there is a risk of inappropriate cut-oﬀ of
revenue recognition around the balance sheet date.
The Group’s agricultural revenue is included within Sale of Goods of
£238.8m, disclosed in note 2 to the ﬁnancial statements. Further information
regarding the agricultural revenue recognition policy is in the principal
accounting policies disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements.
How our scope of
work responded to
the key audit matter
We have performed the following procedures in order to address the risk:
– We gained an understanding of the key processes used to record
revenue transactions and assessed the design and implementation of
controls.
– We performed detailed cut-oﬀ testing of revenue transactions during the
period either side of the balance sheet date with reference to the
relevant terms of business, dispatch or delivery documentation as
appropriate.
– We examined material journal entries that were posted to revenue
accounts and obtained supporting evidence to test the appropriateness
of revenue recognition.
We have concluded that revenue is appropriately recognised in the correct
accounting period in accordance with IAS18 Revenue.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Fair value of biological assets under IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’
Impairment of factories and bearer plants
Key audit matter
description
The group holds £6.6 million (2016: £7.2 million) of biological assets as
current assets. As required by IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’, management estimates
the fair value of these assets through the use of valuation models and recent
transaction prices. Signiﬁcant judgement is required for key assumptions for
each model, including the life-span of the plantings, yields, selling prices,
costs and discount rates. The valuation is sensitive to some of the underlying
assumptions.
Biological assets are disclosed in note 19 to the ﬁnancial statements, the
valuation is discussed as a key source of estimation uncertainty and the
valuation policy is disclosed in the principal accounting policies.
How our scope of
work responded to
the key audit matter
We have performed the following procedures in order to address the risk:
– We gained an understanding of key controls around the valuation of
biological assets and assessed the design and implementation of
controls.
– For a sample of fair value models,
■ We assessed the inputs by assessing the historical accuracy of
management’s forecasts and utilising third-party and market data;
■ We tested the mechanical integrity of the model.
Key observations From the work performed, we are satisﬁed that the key assumptions applied
in respect of the valuation of biological assets are appropriate.
Key audit matter
description
The Group holds £216.3 million (2016: £232.2 million) of property, plant and
equipment (PP&E), which includes factories and bearer plants. Management
identiﬁed gardens as cash generating units (CGUs) and performed an annual
review for indicators of impairment. This considered indicators such as
underutilisation,  adverse weather conditions and land use rights. There is,
therefore, a risk that an impairment is required but not recognised.
PP&E is disclosed in note 17 to the ﬁnancial statements, the valuation is
discussed as source of estimation uncertainty, and the valuation policy is
disclosed in the principal accounting policies.
How our scope of
work responded to
the key audit matter
We gained an understanding of key controls around the valuation of
biological assets and assessed the design and implementation of controls.
We challenged management’s assessment as to whether indicators of
impairment exist for factories and bearer plants with reference to disease or
crop damage, sustained generation of operating losses, long term
commodity price reductions, underutilised plant or warehousing, loss of key
customers, long term failure of water or power supply, variation in rights to
land use, signiﬁcant changes in tax or foreign exchange rates.
We also challenged management’s allocation of assets to individual cash
generating units.
We concur with management that no impairment of factories and bearer
plants is required.
Key observations
249229 Camellia R&A pp75-end  18/04/2018  18:16  Page 104 Proﬁt on disposal of Duncan Lawrie businesses
Key audit matter
description
On 19 December 2016 the Group announced that, due to lower interest rates
and other factors changing the outlook for private banking, it would sell most
of the Duncan Lawrie business and wind down the remainder. This process
began in December 2016 and each company in the Duncan Lawrie Group
prepared their accounts on a basis other than going concern.
The Group completed the disposals during the year and recognised a proﬁt
on disposal of £20.3 million, as disclosed in note 10 of the ﬁnancial
statements. Due to its materiality to the Group and the complexity of
accounting and taxation arrangements, we have identiﬁed the calculation of
the gain on the disposal of Duncan Lawrie Asset Management of
£19.2 million as representing a key audit matter.
How our scope of
work responded to
the key audit matter
We have performed the following procedures in order to address the risk
– We gained an understanding of key controls around the accounting for
the gain on disposal and assessed the design and implementation of the
controls;
– We agreed transactions and amounts to appropriate evidences including
legal agreements, cash received, board minutes and ledger entries;
– We recalculated the gain on disposal and checked the accounting for
each aspect of the transaction;
– We involved taxation specialists to assist us in auditing the taxation
position resulting from the disposal of the Duncan Lawrie Asset
Management business. In particular we assessed the reasonableness of
management’s assumption that the intangible assets sold can be treated
under the capital gains regime and the resultant conclusion that there is
no de-grouping charge or required additional disclosure.
Key observations From our work performed, we are satisﬁed that the asset disposals for the
Duncan Lawrie Group have been accounted for and disclosed appropriately
in the ﬁnancial statements.

CAMELLIA PLC
249229 Camellia R&A pp75-end  18/04/2018  18:16  Page 105 Our application of materiality
We deﬁne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements that makes it
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or
inﬂuenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results
of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the ﬁnancial statements as a whole
as follows:
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit diﬀerences in
excess of £0.07 million for the Group and £0.03 million for the parent company, as well as diﬀerences
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identiﬁed when assessing the overall presentation of the
ﬁnancial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group holds agricultural operations in countries across Africa, North and South America, and Asia,
with its principal crops grown in Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Malawi. The Group’s engineering, food
service and discontinued banking operations are located in Europe, principally in the UK. Our Group audit
was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Of the group’s 80 principal
components, 35 were subject to a full audit and 3 were subject to speciﬁed audit procedures where the
extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the
materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations.
These 38 components represent the principal business units and account for 98% of the Group’s revenue
and 91% of the Group’s proﬁt before tax and 78% of the Group’s net assets.
The group engagement team worked from the group’s London oﬃce, directing and supervising the work
of component auditors. Senior members of the group audit team visited the Bangladesh, India, Kenya
and Malawi components during the current year to discuss the component auditors’ risk assessment, and
review documentation of the ﬁndings from their work.

Rationale for the
benchmark applied
We have used a proﬁt based
measure given the Group is listed
and therefore shareholders focus on
proﬁtability. The proﬁt is adjusted
for the discontinued operations to
avoid distortion that could otherwise
arise due to non-recurring items.
We have used net assets measure
given that entity is a holding
company, generating no revenue.

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of ﬁnancial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate
the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these ﬁnancial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements is located on the
Financial Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms
part of our auditor’s report.
The directors are responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information included
in the annual report, other than the ﬁnancial statements
and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements does not cover the
other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the ﬁnancial statements,
our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the ﬁnancial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to
be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent
material misstatements, we are required to determine
whether there is a material misstatement in the ﬁnancial
statements or a material misstatement of the other
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in respect of
these matters.
