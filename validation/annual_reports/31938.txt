1 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and refers to ‘earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation’. This includes 
adjustments for certain other items charged to operating profit 
that do not reflect the underlying business performance. See page 
23 for where this measure is fully reconciled back to operating 
profit as presented in the income statement. 
2 Operating cash flow after capital and financial investment 
activities is a non-GAAP measure and represents the net cash 
generated by the business after investment in capital items. This 
represents the remaining cash available to service the capital 
structure of the business, or the return of cash to shareholders in 
the form of dividends. A full reconciliation between this measure 
and net cash generated from operations is presented on page 24.
3 Key drivers are stated along with the operating segment 
in which these business streams are aligned, i.e. T elecoms 
& M2M (‘T elM2M’) and T errestrial Broadcast (‘TB’). The 
‘disposed businesses’ principally relate to T elM2M, whilst ‘other 
movements’ reflect a number of smaller movements across the 
business as a whole. Further information and narrative is included 
in the financial review on page 21.

“Through focused 
investment in the right 
projects, the Group has 
benefited from another 
year of impressive growth in 
revenue, earnings
1
 and cash 
generation
2
.“ 
Excellent progress, reflected in our 
financial performance 
This financial year has been a year of 
significant progress. We have invested 
in the right activities that best utilise our 
assets and strengths, divested of non-
core activities that lack strategic fit, and 
right sized the operational base of the 
business. We are now seeing the positive 
impact of these actions on our financial 
performance.   
Our focus on investment in our core 
broadcast and telecoms infrastructure 
markets has supported continued growth 
in revenue. Over the last three years we 
have spent more than £500m on capital 
programmes to strengthen and extend 
our infrastructure in support of existing 
and emerging technologies. Much of this 
investment has been up-front, reflected 
in greater investment in assets and 
working capital; however as some of 
these major capital programmes near 
completion, and recurring contracted 
revenues gain significance, we are 
showing strong growth in the operating 
cash generated from the business. During 
the year we completed the divestment 
of our WiFi business which did not form 
a core component of our strategy for 
growth. 
We continue to look to drive efficiencies 
in operational delivery to further increase 
our earnings potential.
‘FutureFit’ programme 
The Group’s ‘FutureFit’ programme, 
launched early in the year, is a 
comprehensive programme changing the 
way we work. It is designed to achieve 
streamlined processes and modernising 
and making our systems more robust, 
resulting in improved customer 
service and operational delivery. In 
addition, with a focus on third party 
expenditure, it will achieve significant 
cost efficiencies and savings with the 
target of gross savings of circa £60m 
per annum by 2020. This is incremental 
to those savings already achieved in the 
previous two financial years. To date, 
good progress has been made and the 
FutureFit programme has delivered over 
£20m of gross annual savings. Further 
discussion of financial performance is 
continued within the financial review on 
page 21. 
Refinancing 
In November 2016 we completed 
the refinancing of our bank facilities 
which included a £353.5m bank term 
loan; capital expenditure and working 
capital facilities, all of which were due 
to mature in February 2018; together 
with our liquidity facility. We extended 
the maturity of our facilities and 
simplified our financing arrangements 
by establishing replacement facilities 
with maturities ranging from June 2020 
to December 2029. In line with the 
financings that have taken place since 
2013, we restructured the interest rate 
swaps linked to the £353.5m bank term 
loan to remove the breaks and match the 
profile of the new debt instruments. 
S&P and Fitch confirmed their rating of 
Arqiva’s senior debt at BBB following the 
establishment of these new facilities.

During the year we welcomed Paul 
Dollman and Neil King to the Board 
and, after close to four years with us, 
Clive Ansell has left to pursue other 
opportunities. We thank Clive for his 
valued counsel. Paul, who is a Chartered 
Accountant and has a wealth of 
experience in senior finance positions, 
joins us as an independent non-executive 
director and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. Neil was appointed to 
the board by Frequency Infrastructure 
Communications Assets Limited, and 
runs the European Infrastructure business 
at Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board.
Shareholders strategic review  
Earlier this year, Arqiva’s shareholders 
informed the Board that they are 
jointly undertaking a strategic review of 
their investment, which may lead to a 
transaction involving their interests in 
Arqiva. There is, however, no certainty 
that the strategic review will result 
in any transaction. We will make 
further announcements as and when 
appropriate.
Outlook 
Our focused investment in the right 
project has resulted in the Group 
benefitting from another year of 
impressive growth in revenue, earnings 
and cash generation. This, combined with 
the refinancing exercise undertaken in 
the year, leaves us stronger as a business.
With the timing and nature of Britain’s 
exit from the European Union still 
uncertain, I would like to reiterate 
the sentiment from my statement in 
our 2016 annual report. Whilst we 
have an overseas presence, Arqiva’s 
assets, operations and markets are 
predominantly within the UK and our 
business is driven from this region. We 
have minimal exposure to international 
markets and foreign exchange. We 
believe that the critical national 
infrastructure that we provide will 
continue to be in demand; people will 
continue to watch television, listen to 
radio, use mobile devices and consume 
increasing amounts of data. 
Recent Government strategy recognises 
the importance of this critical national 
infrastructure and aims to position 
the UK as a global leader in the next 
generation of mobile technologies and 
digital communications. We fully support 
this vision having, earlier this year, 
announced a partnership with Samsung 
to pioneer the first UK 5G field trials, now 
in operation at Arqiva’s London offices, 
using Fixed Wireless Access in the 28 GHz 
spectrum owned by the Group. 
This is an exciting time for Arqiva and 
I would like to thank all our employees 
across the business for their dedication 
and hard work, which has been central to 
our continued growth and success.

Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2017
Arqiva Group Limited    08 “Arqiva’s strong financial 
results are driven by 
excellent operating 
performances in T errestrial 
Broadcast and T elecoms & 
M2M”
We are focusing on core business 
activities that drive profitable growth and 
shareholder value in our quest to become 
the most efficient and effective provider 
of communications infrastructure in the 
UK. We will continue to play a central role 
in helping to enable an innovative and 
vibrant digital economy here in the UK.
The first point worth noting, and 
celebrating, is the strength of our 
financial performance. It has been 
another excellent year for Arqiva, as we 
continue to see the reward from the 
strategic capital investment decisions 
over recent years, with our operating cash 
flow after investing activities improving 
significantly. The strong, and sustained, 
financial improvements are driven by 
a number of factors, including major 
programme rollouts (700MHz Clearance, 
DAB, 4G and smart metering), an 
improvement in programme execution 
and our ambitious cost reduction 
activities. Our on-going commitment to 
our FutureFit programme will ensure that 
we continue to strengthen our operating 
efficiency for the future.
Our strategy for growth 
Our ambition is to be central to every 
vital connection that people in the UK 
make, every day. This means ensuring 
we remain competitive in our existing 
core markets as technology and demand 
for data drives change, and being at the 
heart of decision making about those 
markets. This has been evident with the 
DTT platform on which we worked with 
Broadcast Networks Europe and other 
global industry representatives to secure 
the continued protection of use of the 
DTT spectrum; as well as working with 
major broadcasters and Ofcom to ensure 
we are at the heart of the programme 
to clear spectrum to be used for mobile 
data services (i.e. our 700MHz Clearance 
programme). The next big evolution in 
our core markets is the emergence of 5G. 
In March 2017, the UK Government 
released “A 5G Strategy for the UK” 
supporting the views of the National 
Infrastructure Commission report. 
The strategy lays out the ambition 
and actions required to create an 
environment that positions the UK as 
a “global leader in the next generation 
of mobile technologies and digital 
communications”. The report states that 
to deliver the high speed, high capacity 
capabilities of 5G will likely require the 
deployment of a significant number of 
small cells. 
We are already well placed to play 
a leading role in the deployment of 
5G technology which will bring major 
benefits to consumers in the form of 
faster mobile data connections. In 
February 2017 Arqiva announced a 
partnership with Samsung to run the 
first UK 5G field trials using fixed wireless 
access in the 28GHz spectrum for which 
we have a national licence. In recent 
months we have also acquired a further 
licence to use this spectrum which 
covers Central and Greater London and 
bolsters Arqiva’s existing spectrum band 
ownership. The trial is now in operation 
in Arqiva’s London offices over the 
summer and showcases its solution to 
demonstrate what superfast connectivity 
will mean for UK business and residents.

reported on page 21 (2017: £332.5m; 2016: £226.6m) 9
Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017
The main drivers of growth were 
in T elecoms & M2M and T errestrial 
Broadcast, with revenues up 18.5%
1 
and 6.3% respectively. A significant 
proportion of this has come from 
recurring revenues from the core 
telecoms towers business, DTT platform 
and radio contracts, and the Group’s 
smart metering network. Added to this 
we’ve seen greater revenues driven by 
customer improvement programmes, 
specifically accelerations to 4G 
equipment upgrades to assist MNOs in 
meeting coverage requirements, and 
meter sales in relation to the smart water 
metering contract with Thames Water. 
Satellite and Media benefitted from new 
HD channel sales, a new agreement with 
Al Jazeera Media Network for global 
teleport distribution services and foreign 
exchange gains.
The visibility of revenues with a 
contracted order book of £5.7 billion, 
inflation-linked pricing, and the 
opportunity to increase utilisation of 
our infrastructure, places Arqiva in a 
very strong position to continue to 
deliver stable profitable growth. Our 
on-going and significant investment 
in digital broadcast infrastructure; 4G, 
5G, in-building solutions and small 
cells underlines Arqiva’s commitment 
to support the UK’s ambition to have 
a vibrant and globally competitive 
economy.
Alongside our growth strategy, our 
transformation programme, ‘FutureFit‘, 
is lowering our cost base; streamlining 
processes, modernising and making 
our systems more robust, resulting 
in improved customer service and 
operational delivery.
Operational delivery 
We have continued to successfully deliver, 
to our clients satisfaction a number of 
large-scale projects which leverage our 
tower infrastructure, including smart 
energy and water metering. 
During the year our smart energy 
metering contract for the North of 
England went ‘live’ bringing new, and 
recurring, revenue streams into the M2M 
business. The rollout of the network 
is currently at 92% coverage and the 
rate of rollout to consumers’ homes is 
expected to accelerate over the next 12 
months following service user testing. 
Following the excellent delivery and 
results on the smart water metering 
contract with Thames Water, our 
customer has taken the decision to 
accelerate their network deployment. 
This will help to achieve coverage of 3 
million homes several years earlier than 
originally planned in order to realise the 
benefits of extended coverage sooner. 
The Group is progressing with the DAB 
rollout programme for the BBC, and has 
completed upgrades to the analogue 
radio network as part of the BBC New 
Radio Agreement. Additionally the 
Group is now completing the final sites 
of the present phase of its commercial 
local DAB programme, meeting the 
government’s target of 90% coverage 
during this financial year; and with the 
final sites in this phase expected later 
this calendar year. At present there is no 
definitive timetable set for the switchover 
from analogue to digital; however the 
new Minister of State for Digital and 
Culture, Matt Hancock, has reconfirmed 
that a review of switchover policy will 
take place when digital radio accounts for 
more than 50% of total listening. 
Activity in relation to the 700MHz 
clearance programme has increased as 
we move into the programme delivery 
phase. Arqiva is responsible for a wide 
range of services required as part of 
the programme including spectrum 
planning, network design, programme 
management, infrastructure changes, 
service continuity, asset replacement and 
retuning of broadcast transmitters to 
enable broadcasters to move into a lower 
frequency.
Within the Satellite and Media business 
unit, technology improvements 
have been implemented to increase 
transponder capacity on existing 
transponders as well as exiting certain 
low margin contracts. UKDTH has 
achieved growth of HD channels.
Outlook 
This is an exciting time for the business 
with improvements in financial 
performance and operational efficiency. 
Combined with the continued leveraging 
of our critical national infrastructure we 
are well placed to benefit from emerging 
market opportunities, such as 5G. I am 
confident that our strategy, together with 
the support of our people, will continue 
to deliver our objectives and enable us to 
grow as a business.

The Group’s contracted orderbook value 
at 30 June 2017 was £5.7bn. In the 
year the Group won circa £340m of new 
contracts. A significant proportion of the 
value of this orderbook relates to medium 
to long-term contracts which includes DTT 
and radio transmission, site sharing and 
smart metering (energy and water), as 
well as satellite and other infrastructure 
services. The Group remains focused on 
pursuing growth opportunities in targeted, 
core infrastructure areas.
T errestrial Broadcast developments
DTT platform
In the UK, DTT is broadcast primarily 
under the Freeview brand name. As 
at 30 June 2017 Arqiva’s two main 
DVB-T Multiplexes had utilisation of 31 
videostreams. An on-going high level of 
Multiplex utilisation demonstrates the 
continued attractiveness to broadcasters 
of the Freeview DTT platform. In March 
2017 Freeview announced that sales 
of Freeview Play TVs and set-top boxes 
had surpassed the one million mark. The 
Freeview Play service was launched in 
late 2015 and provides consumers with 
a seamless combination of DTT channels 
plus catch-up and on demand content 
with no monthly subscription. Arqiva was 
responsible for developing the technical 
solution that is at the heart of the 
Freeview Play service. The achievement 
of this one million mark is a strong 
indication of the attractiveness of hybrid 
DTT / IP TV services in the UK where 
DTT remains the underlying delivery 
mechanism that has a core free-to-air 
linear content base with a variety of OTT 
services on-top.
700MHz Clearance and DTT spectrum
The DTT platform currently uses 
spectrum in the 470-790 MHz bands. 
Ofcom and industry stakeholders are 
implementing plans to clear the 700MHz 
band (694 MHz to 790 MHz) so that it 
can be auctioned for use by the mobile 
network providers. This is a change that 
will be adopted across Europe, Africa, the 
Middle East and central Asia. 
The Group has contracted with the 
major broadcasters and Ofcom 
for the delivery of the programme. 
Arqiva is responsible for the spectrum 
planning, network design, programme 
management, infrastructure changes, 
service continuity, asset replacement 
and retuning of broadcast transmitters 
to enable broadcasters to move into a 
lower frequency. The 700MHz Clearance 
programme has been a strong driver 
of revenue growth in the T errestrial 
Broadcast business during this financial 
year. The programme remains on 
schedule. 
Digital radio (DAB) rollout
The Group is progressing with the 
delivery of the DAB rollout programme 
for the BBC, and has completed upgrades 
to the analogue radio network as part 
of the BBC New Radio Agreement. 
Arqiva has built 162 new transmitters 
for the BBC since rollout began to reach 
the targeted UK national DAB network 
coverage of more than 97% of the 
population. The final site of the 163 
required to deliver the current phase of 
the rollout programme will be completed 
in the autumn.
The Group is also progressing with the 
delivery of Commercial local DAB. The 
programme is part of an initiative to 
meet the local DAB coverage threshold 
of 90% set by the UK Government in 
2010 which was achieved by the end of 
September 2016 with the completion of 
185 new sites. In total Arqiva is delivering 
new transmitters or upgrades at 221 sites 
and as at 30 June 2017 work had been 
completed at 213 sites. The final sites 
for this phase will be completed during 
autumn 2017, taking commercial local 
DAB coverage to over 91%.
Arqiva’s DAB Multiplexes have continued 
to show high utilisation levels due to 
strong demand for radio services and 
radio listening in the UK.
Telecoms & M2M developments
Small cells opportunities and 5G
In March 2017, the UK Government 
released its “A 5G Strategy for the UK” 
document which further supported the 
views of the National Infrastructure 
Commission report of December. The 
strategy lays out the ambition and 
actions required by the Government to 
create an environment that positions 
the UK as a “global leader in the next 
generation of mobile technologies and 
digital communications”. The report 
states that to deliver the high speed, 
high capacity capabilities of 5G will likely 
require the deployment of a significant 
number of small cells.
In February 2017 Arqiva announced 
a partnership with Samsung to run 
the first UK 5G field trials using Fixed 
Wireless Access in the 28 GHz spectrum 
acquired by the Group. The trial was also 
noted in the March 2017 Government 
document above as an example of a 
project to help build the case for 5G 
networks. The trial is now operational in 
Arqiva’s London offices.
Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2017
17    Arqiva Group Limited The Group has also been actively 
developing its outdoor small cells 
proposition. Arqiva’s solution uses 
low power base stations to provide 
street level network capacity to MNOs, 
particularly in dense urban areas. The 
Group expects to receive commercial 
orders during the current financial year 
from two MNOs. To drive value, Arqiva is 
also developing initiatives to explore how 
to make deployment easier and cheaper. 
Arqiva is fully committed and well placed 
to support the UK in its efforts to become 
5G ready.
Smart energy metering rollout
Arqiva is building a smart metering 
communication network in the North of 
England and Scotland as part of a 15-
year contract signed in September 2013 
with the Data and Communications 
Company (the ‘DCC’, a body licensed 
by statute and backed by the utility 
companies). 
In November 2016, the DCC entered 
operational service (‘go-live’) throughout 
Great Britain following the completion of 
integration testing. The Arqiva network, 
which forms part of that, is successfully 
transmitting and receiving test messages 
between DCC users (the energy 
companies) and consumer electricity 
and gas meters. The rollout of the service 
to consumers’ homes is expected to 
accelerate over the next 12 months 
following service user testing. The rollout 
of the Arqiva network continues to evolve 
and has achieved 92% coverage of 
premises in conjunction with the Group’s 
minimum line commitments. 
During the year, the Group’s recurring 
revenues increased under the contract 
as additional streams of revenue were 
triggered on achievement of go-live. 
Furthermore, Arqiva has signed a change 
request order with DCC which sets out 
the additional charges to be paid to 
Arqiva in relation to specification and 
timing modifications to the programme. 
Smart water metering rollout – Thames 
Water
In March 2015, Arqiva signed a contract 
with Thames Water for the provision 
of smart metering fixed network 
infrastructure and associated water 
meters that enable the collection, 
management and transfer of metering 
data. The contract is for an initial six-year 
term that is extendable up to a total of 
sixteen years. The service is expected 
to cover 3 million homes once fully 
deployed. The service is currently live with 
over 195,000 meters installed to date 
completing the initial rollout phase.
Following the excellent delivery and 
results achieved to date, Thames Water 
have taken the decision to accelerate the 
smart metering network deployment. 
This will help to achieve coverage of 3 
million homes several years earlier than 
originally planned in order to realise the 
benefits of extended coverage sooner. 
Arqiva has been instructed to deploy the 
full network coverage across London and 
we are targeting completion by the end 
of 2018. 
 Smart water metering trial contract win 
– Anglian Water
In July 2016, Arqiva won a contract 
with Anglian Water for the delivery and 
monitoring of a smart water metering 
fixed network trial for the deployment 
and operation of 7,500 new water 
meters. This is a four-year contract and is 
part of Anglian Water’s plans for a long-
term smart metering programme. With 
the coverage network build complete, 
the trial went live in December 2016. To 
date over 5,600 smart water meters have 
been installed. 
Kingston upon Thames street furniture 
concession secured
During April 2017 Arqiva added Kingston 
upon Thames to its portfolio of London 
borough concessions, giving the Group 
access to further sites. The concession will 
give Arqiva the exclusive right to design, 
implement and operate commercial 
wireless networks on municipal street 
furniture sites in this borough. This 
development supports Arqiva’s strategy 
of developing its small cells proposition 
and brings the Group’s total number of 
concessions to 17.

4G rollout
The four Mobile Network Operators 
(‘MNOs’) continue to increase their 4G 
network coverage and Arqiva continues to 
carry out large volumes of antenna and 
feeder upgrade projects. This has resulted 
in a significant year on year increase in 
Installation Services revenues. The Group 
had completed 6,787 4G equipment 
upgrades across Arqiva sites up to 30 June 
2017 since rollout began in 2014. A further 
circa 2,700 upgrades are in progress or 
have been requested by the MNOs over 
the next 12 months. Installation Services 
supports the Group’s towers business 
where activity has been ramping up as 
the MNOs leverage Arqiva’s estate and 
capability to help them achieve their 
coverage requirements.
Disposal of WiFi business
The disposal of the WiFi business, a 
business which sat outside of the core 
activities of the Group, was completed 
successfully in November 2016. Within 
the sales agreement Arqiva signed a 
partnership to provide indoor coverage 
solutions to the acquiring company’s 
customers. Approximately 120 employees 
were transferred following a consultation 
process as part of the sale. 
Internet of Things (‘IoT’)
Additionally, Arqiva continues to evolve 
its M2M and IoT business by leveraging 
its network solution to a broader range of 
industry sectors. Arqiva is targeting the use 
of its existing M2M networks in key sectors 
such as utility infrastructure operations, 
asset management optimisation and 
smart building enablement. 
The Digital Catapult’s IoT Boost 
programme is designed to help businesses 
and entrepreneurs develop IoT products 
and services, with IoTUK Boost aiming 
to tackle barriers to entry in the IoT 
marketplace across the country.
The programme gives Arqiva the 
opportunity to showcase how its 
SIGFOX network can complement other 
technologies and give access to technology 
to those currently excluded.

and deliver improvements in customer 
services; and
 	 Cost reductions in spending on third 
party suppliers in all areas, with the 
target of delivering gross annual 
savings of circa £60m per annum by 
2020. The Group is reviewing all areas 
of third party spend and progressing 
with a number of actions; consolidating
demand across the Group to ensure 
best prices, re-negotiating supplier 
contracts, reducing spare capacity and 
wherever possible eliminating spend 
through process optimisation activities.
T o date ‘FutureFit’ has delivered over £20m 
of recurring gross annual savings which was 
incremental to the cost reductions achieved 
during the previous two financial years. 
Good progress is being made to secure the 
next tranche of savings. Key developments 
in the year include a reduction in leased 
line costs; the elimination of excess satellite 
transponder capacity; and cost reductions 
in a number of other operating cost areas.

19   Arqiva Group Limited Refinancing
In November 2016 the Group successfully 
completed the refinancing of its existing 
bank facilities which included a £353.5m 
bank term loan; capital expenditure and 
working capital facilities totalling £390m, 
all of which were due to mature in February 
2018; and the Group’s liquidity facility of 
£250m. The Group extended the maturity 
of its facilities and simplified its financing 
arrangements by establishing new facilities 
with maturities ranging from June 2020 to 
December 2029. In line with the financings 
that have taken place since 2013, Arqiva 
restructured the interest rate swaps linked 
to the £353.5m bank term loan to remove 
the breaks and match the profile of the 
new debt instruments. Further information 
is set out on page 24.
S&P and Fitch confirmed their rating of 
Arqiva’s senior debt at BBB following the 
establishment of these new facilities.
Shareholders strategic review
Arqiva’s shareholders are jointly 
undertaking a strategic review of their 
investment in Arqiva, which may lead 
to a transaction involving their interests 
in the Company. There is no certainty 
that the strategic review will result in any 
transaction. Further announcements will be 
made as and when appropriate.

Total 943.8 884.7 6.7
T errestrial Broadcast revenues increased 
by 6.3% from £422.4m to £449.0m year 
on year. Recurring revenues from the 
Group’s DTT multiplexes increased mainly 
as a result of new channel launches and 
other items. The Group had utilised 31 
videostreams on its main multiplexes and 
increased channel sales on its DVB-T2 (HD 
enabled) multiplexes during the financial 
year. Radio contracts (resulting from the 
DAB rollout and increased transmission 
activity thereon), an increase in activities 
in relation to the 700MHz Clearance 
Programme, and RPI linked increases 
on broadcast contracts delivered further 
growth. 
T elecoms & M2M revenues increased by 
10.0% from £316.3m to £347.9m year 
on year. The increase in revenue resulted 
primarily from growth across the Group’s 
core telecoms towers business driven 
by increased site numbers under the 
Group’s control and associated activities, 
accelerations to Installation Services 
activity to assist MNOs in meeting 
coverage requirements, and the M2M 
business. The increase in M2M revenues 
was principally as a result of recurring 
network availability charges commencing 
in December 2015 on the Group’s smart 
energy metering contract, together with 
additional revenues from meter sales in 
relation to its smart metering contract 
with Thames Water. 
Satellite and Media revenues increased 
by 0.6% from £146.0m to £146.9m year 
on year. These benefited from new HD 
channel sales, a new agreement with 
Al Jazeera Media Network for global 
teleport and distribution services and 
foreign exchange gains. These revenue 
improvements were, however, partially 
loss includes non-cash charges (net) of 
£636.7m (2016: £435.6m) – (see page 23) offset by the continuing impact of exiting 
certain low margin contracts.
Gross profit was £586.9m, representing 
an 8.5% increase from £540.9m in the 
prior year. Gross profit from the continuing 
business
1
 increased by 9.6% year on year 
as a result of strong revenue growth and 
improvements in the efficiency of service 
delivery.
The savings generated under the FutureFit 
programme enable the growth in revenue 
to be delivered with only a modest 
increase in the cost base
Other operating expenses before 
exceptional items were £120.1m, up 
2.9% from £116.7m in the prior year. 
The increase is principally due to higher 
rewards and bonuses under management 
and employee performance frameworks 
due to the business outperforming 
expectations. This outperformance is 
primarily attributable to cost saving 
initiatives and operational efficiencies, 
which partially offset these increased 
costs, and become embedded into a 
reduced cost base for future financial 
periods.
EBITDA for the Group was £467.0m, 
representing a 10.0% increase from 
£424.4m in the prior year due to the 
increase in gross profit and the lower 
operating cost base (including the, now, 
embedded savings), partially offset by 
the increase in employee reward and 
performance costs as set out above.
EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and 
refers to ‘earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation and 
includes add-backs for certain items 
charged to operating profit that do 
not reflect the underlying business 
performance.

EBITDA for the Group’s T errestrial 
Broadcast business was £329.4m, 
representing a 6.9% increase from 
£308.0m in the prior year. The growth 
was mainly due to full utilisation of 
the increased capacity on the main 
multiplexes, on-going DAB rollout and 700 
MHz Clearance activities as well as uplifts 
on inflation linked contracts.
EBITDA for the Group’s T elecoms & M2M 
business was £154.1m, a 16.0% increase 
from £132.8m in the prior year. This was 
principally due to the growth in the core 
telecoms towers business, and the smart 
energy metering contract reaching its 
operational phase.
EBITDA for the Satellite and Media 
business was £35.0m which was a 
9.0% increase from £32.1m in the prior 
year. Revenue growth has been further 
supported by rationalisation of Satellite 
capacity costs and headcount savings to 
drive earnings growth.
The increase arising from other costs 
versus the prior year was mainly driven 
by higher rewards and bonuses under 
management and employee performance 
frameworks due to the business 
outperforming expectations. Additionally 
there were adverse movements in foreign 
exchange versus favourable movements in 
the prior year. 
Depreciation (2017: £141.6m; 2016: 
£129.4m) and amortisation (2017: 
£12.6m; 2016: £10.4m) were collectively 
10.3% higher year on year. This was 
due to an increase in the underlying 
tangible asset base of the Group 
(particularly in connection with Smart 
Metering contracts) and the accelerated 
depreciation and amortisation on certain 
assets (particularly asset replacements 
connected with the 700MHz Clearance 
Programme and software impacted by 
the Group’s FutureFit IT and system 
investment respectively). 
Exceptional items charged to operating 
profit were £29.5m, up from £13.6m, 
relating predominantly to reorganisation 
and changes to employee terms and 
conditions costs as the Group executes 
its new FutureFit operational efficiency 
programme.
Operating profit for the year was 
£284.5m, an increase of 4.9% from 
£271.1m in the prior year. The increase 
was due to the additional EBITDA 
generated from each of the Group’s 
businesses, partially offset by higher 
exceptional charges and higher 
depreciation and amortisation charges. 
A reconciliation between operating profit 
and EBITDA is presented on page 23.

Arqiva Group Limited    22 Financial review
Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2017
Finance costs (net of finance income) 
were £578.4m, an increase of 8.1% from 
£535.0m in the prior year. The increase 
was primarily due to the compounding 
effect of interest on  outstanding 
shareholder loan note principal and 
accrued interest, higher interest rates 
and different phasing of new swap 
instruments that were restructured as 
part of refinancing in November, and the 
effect of the annual margin step-up on 
the Group’s  former bank facilities prior to 
refinancing. 
The Group reported £133.1m (losses) 
within other gains and losses in the year 
(2016: £14.3m gains). This principally 
arises from adverse fair value movements 
(loss of £104.2m) recorded in respect 
of derivative contracts, attributable to 
changes in market yields and credit 
spreads. An £8.3m loss was recognised in 
relation to foreign exchange movements 
on foreign denominated debt 
instruments, however the cross currency 
swaps provide an economic hedge to 
the Group’s US$ denominated debt. The 
losses recorded in the year also include 
£15.4m losses upon closing out certain 
swap arrangements in connection with 
the refinancing in November and £5.2m 
losses on disposal of the Group’s WiFi 
business.
Loss before tax was £427.0m, up from 
a loss of £249.6m in the prior year. The 
loss before tax is reported after non-cash 
charges of £636.7m (2016: £435.6m):

Financial position
Net liabilities were £3,393.7m, representing 
an increase of 14.4% from £2,965.7m 
in the prior year. This increase principally 
arises from refinancing of borrowings and 
adverse fair value movements recorded in 
respect of derivative contracts. 
Financing
The Group established its Whole Business 
Securitisation (‘WBS’) structure in February 
2013, and since then it has continued to 
refinance elements of its debt structure 
further extending its maturity profile. The 
most recent exercise in November saw the 
refinancing of the Group’s bank facilities 
(originally entered into in February 2013) 
which comprised a £353.5m bank term 
loan, capital expenditure and working 
capital facilities, all of which were due to 
mature in February 2018; and the Group’s  
liquidity facility. The Group extended the 
maturity of its facilities by establishing the 
following: 
 	 a £218.5m amortising, sterling 
denominated, floating rate, US private 
placement with a final maturity of 
December 2029; 
 	 a £255m amortising term bank facility 
with an expected maturity of June 
2020 and a legal final maturity of 
December 2024 (of which £100.0m 
principal was repaid in the current 
year);
 	 a £250m bank facility for capital 
expenditure purposes having an 
expected maturity of March 2021
(undrawn at June 2017); 
 	 a £140m bank facility for working 
capital purposes having an expected 
maturity of March 2021 (£86.0m 
drawn as at June 2017); and
 	 a £250m liquidity facility, which 
matures in 2041, that replaces the 
existing liquidity facility and which is a 
typical requirement for securitisation 
structures (undrawn as at June 2017).
In line with the financings that have taken 
place since 2013, Arqiva restructured the 
interest rate swaps linked to the £353.5m 
bank term loan to remove the breaks 
and match the profile of the new debt 
instruments above. 
S&P and Fitch confirmed their rating of 
Arqiva’s senior debt at BBB following the 
establishment of these new facilities.
Additionally in the year the Group agreed 
with its shareholders to settle outstanding 
amounts of accrued interest (£874.5m) 
with an equivalent value of payment-
in-kind (‘PIK’) notes being issued in 
consideration, as reflected in the financial 
statements.

Liquidity 
T o ensure it has sufficient available funds

planned growth, the Group maintains cash 
reserves and access to undrawn committed 
facilities to cover forecast requirements. 
Details on the amounts drawn and 
available undrawn facilities as at 30 June 
2017 is provided in the table below. The 
Group carefully manages the credit risk 
on liquid funds and derivative financial 
instruments with balances currently 
spread across a range of major financial 
institutions, which have satisfactory credit 
ratings assigned by international credit 
rating agencies. The levels of credit risk are 
monitored through the Group’s on-going 
risk management processes, which include 
a regular review of counterparty credit 
ratings. Risk in this area is limited further 
by setting a maximum level and term for 
deposits with any single counterparty.

Going concern 
The Group meets its day-to-day working 
capital and financing requirements 
through the net cash generated from its 
operations. The Group performs a review 
of going concern through a review of 
forecasting including cash flow forecasts 
and considering the requirements of 
capital expenditure and debt repayments. 
The Group has sufficient financial 
resources which, together with internally 
generated cash flows, will continue to 
provide sufficient sources of liquidity to 
fund its current operations, including its 
contractual and commercial commitments 
both in terms of capital programmes and 
financing. For this reason the Directors are 
confident that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing this 
financial information.

The Group uses a combination of financial and non-financial key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) 
to measure progress against its strategic priorities.
Revenue Definition - Revenue is presented as per the financial statements, and in accordance with 
IAS 18.
Result - Revenue has increased 6.7% from the prior year (2017: £943.8m; 2016: £884.7m) 
and 4.6% on an annualised basis over the past four years. The primary drivers of this 
growth were within the Group’s telecoms towers business and DTT and radio platforms 
which, in each case, benefitted from greater site numbers and/or greater capacity utilisation. 
Additionally revenue growth was driven by the Group’s smart energy metering network 
reaching its operational phase.

Definition - EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and refers to ‘earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation’ and includes add-backs for certain items charged to 
operating profit that do not reflect the underlying business performance. See page 23 for its 
reconciliation to operating profit.
Result - EBITDA grew 10.0% from the prior year (2017: £467.0m; 2016: £424.4m) and 
4.6% on an annualised basis over the past four years. The growth in the year outstripped 
the aforementioned revenue growth due to improved and more efficient operational service 
delivery and the divestment of lower-margin, non-core business areas.

of the Group is to meet its contractual 
milestones on time and to the required 
quality. The Group has continued to 
achieve this and engages with all contract 
stakeholders to meet future milestones. In 
2017 this includes:
 	 The Smart Metering M2M contract, 
which went live in November and for 
which deliveries of communications 
hubs have begun triggering a number
of contracted recurring revenue 
streams; and
 	 700MHz clearance programme, which 
has continued to meet operational 
milestones. Work has commenced at 
Emley Moor to install the temporary 
mast. Air works were completed at 
ten main station sites and 45 relay 
sites. In addition, a trial at Selkirk was 
successfully completed which has 
helped to inform the UK government’s
viewer support policy. 
 	 The programme to increase UK 
DAB network coverage continues 
to progress broadly in line with the 
contract milestones with completion 
expected by the end of the calendar 
year. The Group engages closely with
programme stakeholders to ensure 
any minor delays and remedial plans 
are actioned in a timely manner.

Definition - The Group takes part in the ‘Investors in People’ accreditation for which more 
than 16,000 UK businesses take part. Since our last assessment the  award criteria have 
undergone a significant overhaul to include new, even more rigorous criteria.
Result - Whilst Arqiva understands that its drop in award rating doesn’t represent a drop 
in standards (rather a re-benchmarking of the award), we strive to make continuous 
improvements against the assessment criteria to, again, achieve Gold accreditation under 
the revised framework.

The T errestrial Broadcast business 
unit provides transmission services 
and infrastructure for all terrestrial TV 
broadcasters and more than 90% of 
the UK’s radio transmission, including 
ownership interests in the two commercial 
national digital radio multiplexes. Included 
within this business unit is the Group’s 
DTT multiplex business, which owns 
and operates two of the three main 
national commercial digital terrestrial TV 
multiplexes, plus two DVB-T2 multiplexes 
(capable of providing additional services 
including HD content).
The Group’s radio and TV broadcast 
operations (network access and managed 
transmission) are regulated by Ofcom 
on behalf of the wholesale broadcast 
customers. None of the Group’s other

There was growth in T errestrial Broadcast 
as a result of:
 	 New channel launches and associated
increases;
 	 Utilising 31 videostreams on its main 
multiplexes and increasing channel 
sales on its DVB-T2 (HD enabled) 
multiplexes;
 	 DAB roll-out and increased 
transmission activity thereon;
 	 Increased activity in relation to the 
700MHz Clearance programme; and
 	 RPI-linked increases on broadcast
service contracts.
1 Total number of broadcast sites are circa 1,500, some of which overlap to broadcast both TV and radio signals. Market environment
The DTT platform, which is broadcast 
primarily under the Freeview brand name, 
remains the most popular television 
platform in the UK with a presence in 
more than 75% of households. In March 
2017 Freeview announced that sales 
of Freeview Play TVs and set-top boxes 
had surpassed the one million mark. The 
achievement of this one million mark is 
a strong indication of the attractiveness 
of hybrid DTT / IP TV services in the 
UK where DTT remains the underlying 
delivery mechanism that has a core free-
to-air linear content base with a variety of 
OTT services on-top. 
The DTT platform currently uses spectrum 
in the 470-790 MHz bands. Ofcom and 
industry stakeholders are implementing 
plans to clear the 700MHz band (694 MHz 
to 790 MHz) so that it can be auctioned 
for use by the mobile network providers. 
This is a change that will be adopted 
across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and 
central Asia. The Group has contracted 
with the major broadcasters and Ofcom 
for the delivery of the programme.
Additionally, with the progress of the DAB 
roll out the business remains well placed to 
support any future decision to switch over 
from analogue radio broadcast.

Arqiva’s physical infrastructure gives mobile 
operators access to circa 8,000 active 
sites forming the Group’s core telecom 
tower business. Space on towers is licensed 
to national MNOs and other wireless 
network operators to enable complete 
mobile communications networks (‘site-
share’). Arqiva also works with major 
mobile providers such as BT-EE, Vodafone, 
T elefonica O2 and Three UK to upgrade 
networks to support 4G and future mobile

In March 2017, the UK Government 
released its “A 5G Strategy for the UK” 
document which further supported the 
views of the National Infrastructure 
Commission report. The strategy lays out 
the ambition and actions required by the 
Government to create an environment 
that positions the UK as a “global 
leader in the next generation of mobile 
technologies and digital communications”. 
The report states that to deliver the high 
speed, high capacity capabilities of 5G 
will likely require the deployment of a 
significant number of small cells.
In February 2017 Arqiva announced a 
partnership with Samsung to run the first 
UK 5G field trials using Fixed Wireless 
Access in the 28 GHz spectrum owned by 
the Group. The trial has also been noted in 
the March 2017 Government document 
above as an example of a project to 
help build the case for 5G networks. 
The trial is operational in London 
over the summer and showcases the 
solution, demonstrating what superfast 
connectivity will mean for UK business and 
residents. 
The Group has also been actively 
developing its outdoor small cells 
proposition. Arqiva’s solution uses low 
power base stations to provide street level 
network capacity to MNOs, particularly 
in dense urban areas. The Group expects 
to receive commercial orders during the 
current financial year from two MNOs. T o 
drive value, Arqiva is developing initiatives 
to explore how to make deployment easier 
and cheaper. The initiative combines 
shared cabinets and dark fibre in dense 
urban areas. Initial feedback from the 
MNOs has been encouraging and the 
Group anticipates further trials during the 
calendar year. 
Arqiva is fully committed and well-placed 
to support the UK in its efforts to become 
5G ready.

There has been a drive to increase 
operational efficiency and carry out 
the managed exit from certain lower 
margin business areas in order to improve 
profitability and value for shareholders. 
Despite these managed exits the business 
saw some growth in revenues (more 
than replacing the areas exited) and, in 
particular, earnings principally due to:
 	 Increased earnings from the exit of 
certain low margin wholesale business
and the termination of other low 
margin contracts;
 	 New HD channel sales;
 	 A new agreement with Al Jazeera 
Media Network for global teleport and
distribution services; and
 	 The impact of foreign exchange.

In satellite TV broadcasting the market 
has seen an increased demand for HD 
services. Since the launch of the Sky+ HD 
box nine years ago, there are around nine 
million in operation today
1
. HD services 
are seen as business critical, with big 
shows attracting the largest audience 
shares and therefore commanding the 
largest advertising revenues. 
In recent years there has been growth 
in the number of different platforms, 
including the rise of over-the-top services 
and Internet Protocol delivered content. 
The broadcast market has, however, 
seen convergence in these technologies 
through, for example, Smart TVs and 
set-top boxes providing the end-user 
with a seamless experience regardless 
of the delivery method. As a result of the 
review of the operating model carried 
out during the prior year, Hybrid TV 
activities have moved in to the Satellite 
and Media business unit. For satellite 
the amalgamation of these additional 
services provides longevity to satellite 
distribution which is often thought of 
as more ‘traditional television’. There 
has also been the launch of new cloud 
based Internet Protocol and over-the-top 
services, including remote and pop-up 
play-out as well as Internet Protocol 
streaming.

Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2017
35    Arqiva Group Limited
Arqiva endeavours to conduct its business in a way that benefits its customers, suppliers, 
employees, shareholders and the communities in which it operates. Three values are at 
the heart of the organisation. They were developed by the Group’s employees and are 
therefore owned by its people.
Arqiva never underestimates the 
contribution its people make to its business 
and its customers’ businesses. That’s why 
the values guiding how its people work 
were defined by its employees. Values 
‘champions’ from across the company led 
workshops with their colleagues to ensure 
everyone had the opportunity to contribute 
to the decision-making process.
The Group believes it has a role to 
play in shaping its dynamic industry. It 
actively engages with government, trade 
associations and other industry players as it 
knows that to keep its customers connected 
it must continually work to identify and 
develop the ideas that will enable society’s 
wireless digital future.
Environment
The Group is committed to complying with 
all applicable environmental legislation 
and annually assesses the environmental 
impact of its activities, products and 
services and aims to reduce any negative 
impacts through active environment 
management. The Group operates an 
environmental management system which 
is accredited to the international standards 
ISO14001 and ISO50001, the latter being 
the voluntary International Standard for 
“Energy Management Systems”.
Energy consumption is a key area 
of interest for the Group given it is a 
significant consumer of electricity. Arqiva 
has launched a new energy policy which 
reflects the company’s commitments to 
improving energy efficiency by:
 Reducing energy consumption,
 	 Investing in energy efficient
technology, and
 Monitoring carbon emissions. 
One of Arqiva’s business aims is to reduce 
carbon emissions and energy costs whilst 
complying with energy legislation.  The 
Group is always looking at new and 
innovative ways of driving down its carbon 
footprint. Responsible management 
of energy has a key role in minimising 
environmental impacts and is embedded 
within Arqiva.  Additionally it investigates 
how emerging technologies and ingenious 
ways of working can help it and its 
customers become more environmentally 
friendly. As new technologies emerge and 
legacy equipment is replaced Arqiva looks 
for the most environmentally-friendly ways 
to dispose of redundant hardware.
Health and safety
The Group is committed to complying with 
applicable health and safety legislation, 
and to continual improvement in achieving 
a high standard of health, safety and 
welfare in its operations and for all those 
in the organisation and others who may 
be affected by its activities. The Group 
operates a safety management system 
that is accredited to the international 
standard OHSAS18001. The Board of 
Directors regularly review health and safety 
reports in relation to the Group’s activities, 
employees and contractors.

Information security
Due to the critical importance of Arqiva’s 
sites and systems to the Arqiva Group, its 
customers and, in some cases, as part of 
the Critical National Infrastructure, the 
Group takes information security very 
seriously.
In 2014, Arqiva became the first company 
in the combined Broadcast and T elecoms 
industry to achieve ISO27001 certification 
for all platforms and services (end to 
end) for all of its UK locations. This allows 
Arqiva to compete for new business which 
requires ISO27001 accreditation and it 
can confidently demonstrate its security-
conscious culture and compliance with this 
internationally recognised standard. There 
are two physical security audits and two 
internal security audits conducted every 
month in order to maintain the certification 
and since certification, Arqiva has passed 
every audit.
Additionally Arqiva has also attained the 
UK Government Cyber Security Essentials 
accreditation which enables it to supply 
into government departments. Moving 
forward, Arqiva is working to align its 
Business continuity and Disaster recovery 
plans to ISO22301 certification.
Employees
The average number of persons employed 
by the Group during the year was 2,100 
(2016: 2,170). Arqiva recognises the 
significant contribution of its employees 
and makes every effort to create a 
rewarding and engaging working 
environment.
The Group’s policy is to provide equal 
opportunities for all employees, irrespective 
of race, nationality, gender, sexual 
orientation, marital status, religion or 
political belief, disability or age. 
The Group continues to address training 
and development requirements for 
employees at all levels within the 
organisation. The Board also reviews future 
management requirements and succession 
plans on an on-going basis.
The Arqiva Employee Board has continued 
throughout the year. The AEB is a 
democratically elected Board that acts as 
a voice for employees across Arqiva and 
provide a clear and direct link between the 
Group’s employees and Senior Executive 
Management. The AEB continues to meet 
on a monthly basis to discuss key matters 
such as performance management, or 
efficiencies and process in order to develop 
responsive action plans. The AEB (as well 
as the Senior Executive Management) also 
interacts with representatives of BECTU 
regarding employee matters.
The Group’s employee forums provide an 
effective channel for communication and 
collective consultation across the Group. 
They play an important role in enabling 
employees to help the Group manage 
change effectively. The goals of each 
forum are to act as the formal consultative 
body for its part of the business within 
Arqiva, provide a voice to management 
on employee issues, initiate and support 
division-wide social activities, and promote 
consultation and sharing information.
Significant emphasis is placed on employee 
communication. The Group intranet 
‘Connect’ makes information available 
to employees on all matters including 
company performance, growth, and issues 
affecting the industry. The embedded 
values “ingenious, straightforward, and 
collaborative – Always”, continue to 
form the fundamental basis of all Arqiva 
business conduct and communication. 
Arqiva’s monthly employee e-magazine – 
‘Stay Connected’ brings together recent 
news and events as well as the most 
important things employees need to know 
for the month ahead.
The Group wants all of its employees to 
benefit from its success and growth as 
a business. The annual bonus scheme 
recognises the importance of high 
performance and is designed to reward 
employees for achieving targets and 
constantly improving overall performance, 
in line with the values. The scheme takes 
into account the targets that have been 
set by the Group and then multiplies this 
by a personal performance rating.  The 
Group must achieve a minimum EBITDA 
performance before a bonus becomes 
payable which is then calculated based 
upon the financial KPIs of EBITDA and 
operating cash performance.  The bonus 
payment for the financial year to June 
2017 will be made in September 2017. 
In addition, certain members of senior 
executive management participate in a 
long-term incentive plan which is typically 
3 years in duration and is designed to 
recognise the value of strategic initiatives 
being undertaken by the Group during 
the long-term incentive plan period. As 
with the annual bonus scheme, the Group 
must achieve a minimum threshold of 
financial performance before a bonus 
becomes payable under the long-term 
incentive plans which is then calculated 
based upon the 3 year Group financial 
KPIs of EBITDA and operating cash 
performance. All such arrangements are 
cash based incentive schemes which 
operate against documented performance 
targets and are reviewed at least annually 
by the Remuneration Committee (which 
comprises members of the Board of 
Directors).

Arqiva Group Limited    50
Business Unit Management:
First defence is the day to day 
controls and processes put in place 
by management to  identify risks 
and develop mitigating actions.
Senior Executive Management:
Quarterly review of the corporate 
risk register to include review of 
risk management policies, setting 
of risk appetite, monitoring 
compliance and reporting of 
significant risks to the Board of 
Directors.
Audit and Risk function / Audit 
committee: 
Independent business assurance 
provided over the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal 
controls and processes, and 
the effectiveness of the risk 
management framework.
During the year Arqiva has introduced 
some additional measures to enhance 
the robustness of its risk management 
approach throughout the organisation. 
These measures include, most 
significantly, a corporate risk register 
refresh exercise and a more formalised 
approach for assessing and monitoring 
these risks. 
The Managing Director of each 
business unit has responsibility for 
maintaining and updating their line of 
business risk register, which includes 
utilising the standardised approach to 
risk assessment and risk monitoring. 
The Group’s centralised Audit and 
Risk function provides training and 
support to ensure risks are captured 
effectively and on a timely basis.  Risks 
are formally discussed with the Chief 
Executive Officer as part of the existing 
quarterly business performance reviews 
highlighting the significance of the link 
between performance and effective 
risk management. The Audit and Risk 
function works with the Chief Executive 
Officer to review and consolidate the 
most significant business risks into a 
corporate risk register for scrutiny at 
quarterly Senior Executive Management 
and Audit Committee meetings. The 
Senior Executive Management takes 
recommendations for ensuring the 
risk management framework remains 
effective going forward. Principal risks and uncertainties

Reputational All Bad publicity damages 
Arqiva’s reputation and its 
ability to do business as a 
result of:
  	 A major event or 
incident impacting our 
services;
 Untimely delivery on
major projects;
 Repeated unexpected 
service outages;
 Security breach on
networks; or
 Major network or 
equipment failure or 
obsolescence.
The Group carefully engages with its customers to 
ensure that project milestones are carefully managed 
and management regularly review the progress 
status of all projects. 
Through continuous measurement of operational 
KPIs and addressing shortfalls in performance 
through process excellence the risk around service 
reliability is carefully managed.
The Group has in place a crisis management plan 
for public relations and external communications to 
provide support should there be any major events. 
This is regularly monitored and reviewed.
The Group continues to invest in its infrastructure, 
typically spending in excess of £150m per annum.
Arqiva has continued to achieve 
its target result for ‘network 
availability’ (see page 28).
Arqiva has continued to meet 
its contractual milestones on its 
major contractual programmes, 
e.g. smart energy metering (see 
page 28). 
The Group has achieved and 
maintained ISO27001 certification 
regarding information security 
and holds periodic reviews of the 
security environment and training 
to employees.
Health and 
safety
All Risk of an incident causing 
death or serious injury 
during site works or 
engineering.
Training and rescue skills courses are required on an 
annual basis for field employees, and rescue kits are 
provided.
Arqiva maintains and regularly reviews its policy on 
workplace safety and site security.
During the year, Arqiva maintained 
its compliance with OHSA518001 
regarding safety management.
T echnological TB, SM Developments in 
alternative broadcast 
technologies, such as 
internet connected 
TV, which competes 
against the Group’s DTT 
transmission business; 
or the evolution of 
DAB against Arqiva’s 
existing analogue radio 
transmission business.
DTT retains the largest share of broadcast 
transmission in the UK, and IPTV remains 
constrained by limited high speed broadband uptake 
and variable reliability levels. In addition Arqiva has 
mitigated some of this risk by investing in YouView 
TV Limited, a joint venture formed to develop 
and promote the DTT platform, together with its 
involvement in Freeview Play.
Arqiva  has been rolling out national and commercial 
local DAB in line with its ‘New Radio Agreement’ 
with the BBC and government targets which helps 
to ensure it remains at the forefront of this future 
technological change.
In March, Freeview announced 
sales of FreeviewPlay TVs had 
surpassed the 1 million mark 
highlighting the sustained 
demand for this platform. 
Arqiva is expecting to finalise the 
roll out of its DAB network towards 
the end of the calendar year, and 
consequently remains in a strong 
position to support a future switch 
over.
Management have identified the following risks as the most significant business risks affecting the Group, presented together with 
identified mitigating actions.

Management of risk / uncertainty Recent developments
Political T, TB Change in government plans, 
policy or priorities could lead to 
unforeseen changes in scope on 
major engineering programmes.
The triggering of Article 50 to 
begin the UK’s exit from the 
European Union heightens the 
uncertainty over future policy 
and economic conditions.
Arqiva maintains regular dialogue with its 
stakeholders to ensure the delivery of its 
programmes are efficient , timely and to 
specification. Where specification changes occur 
Arqiva provides a detailed assessment of the 
potential costs of the scope change and seeks 
an informed recovery of those costs through 
mechanisms in its contracts.  
Arqiva’s assets and operations remain 
predominantly in the UK and therefore its 
business has minimal exposure to the changing 
relationships with international markets. 
Additionally we expect the infrastructure Arqiva 
provides to continue to be demanded and that 
these services evolve as markets and consumer 
tastes evolve.
Arqiva has successfully agreed 
scope change requests on 
its smart energy metering 
programme with its customer 
demonstrating the customer’s 
continued focus on network 
roll out. 
SM Potential future alternative use 
for the 3600-3800 MHz band 
(presently used for Satellite C 
Band Rx) to support LTE/5G.  
Arqiva continue to work with the regulators to 
understand the nature and timing of any decision 
on this spectrum and will seek assurance that any 
relocation of existing services are viable.
Operational All The Group maintains an ISO27001 certification 
regarding information security, which includes 
Cloud Security Services. Employee training on 
information security is mandatory and quarterly 
reviews are undertaken by external consultants 
to examine the robustness of the security 
environment. 
Arqiva ensures data is regularly backed up and 
Business Continuity Plans have been established 
for each key site and each business area. A 
Business Recovery Working Group meets regularly 
to stress test these plans and continually review 
the Group’s approach to disaster recovery.
Arqiva has continued to pass 
its quarterly security reviews 
and has consequently retained 
its ISO certification.
TB, T Arqiva maintains a robust oversight of the delivery 
of its major programmes. This includes identifying 
the key personnel and resources required for 
delivery and working closely with its suppliers and 
customer to ensure that these requirements are 
sufficiently available.
Arqiva has continued to meet 
its contractual milestones 
on its major contractual 
programmes, e.g. smart energy 
metering (see page 28). 
All
Information, networks and 
systems, or communications 
infrastructure may be subjected 
to cyber security threats leading 
to a loss or corruption of data 
and/or impacting the operational 
capacity of Arqiva.
Critical transmission structures or 
IT infrastructure supporting key 
operational processes could fail 
leading to operational outages.
The scale and complexity of 
Arqiva’s major programmes bear 
an inherent risk of unforeseen 
delays through the supply chain 
and therefore challenges to 
delivery.
Customer relationships, 
operations and project delivery 
could be damaged if there were 
significant loss of people with 
critical skills and knowledge 
unique to Arqiva’s competitive 
position.
Arqiva recognises the importance of its people and 
seeks to make Arqiva a rewarding and enjoyable 
place to work. The Group operates a competitive 
annual bonus plan for all employees and a 
long-term incentive plan for its leadership team. 
Additionally the Group operates formal retention 
and succession planning in knowledge-critical 
areas of the business. 
Arqiva has developed a new 
career framework to provide a 
more formalised approach to 
the development and growth 
of the careers of its people.
Demand T The level of demand for wireless 
communications and impact 
on demand for access to the 
Group’s towers.
The Group monitors the demand for mobile data 
which continues to grow and indications are that 
spectrum capacity, and antenna deployments, 
will need to increase to cope with this demand.   
Arqiva continues to develop its outdoor small 
cells proposition and in-building solutions in 
anticipation of growth in demand.
Arqiva is continuing to support 
the MNOs in the roll-out of 4G 
upgrades to its sites reflecting 
the surge in demand for 
mobile data.
In March 2017 the UK 
Government released its “A 5G 
Strategy for the UK” to position 
the UK as a global leader in 
the next generation of mobile 
technologies. This followed 
Arqiva’s announcement in 
February of a partnership deal 
with Samsung to run the first 
UK 5G field trials.
Financial Details of the financial risks and details of mitigating factors are set out in the Directors’ report on page 53. Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2017

Directors’ report
Risk type Description of risk / uncertainty Management of risk / uncertainty
Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk due to 
borrowing variable rate bank debt.
The Group uses derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to rising interest rates. The 
Group maintains a hedging policy to manage interest rate risk and to ensure the certainty 
of future interest cash flows and compliance with debt covenants. It currently has fixed 
rate hedging, split between interest rate swaps and inflation-linked interest rate swaps. 
Interest rate swaps convert variable rate interest costs to fixed rate interest costs while 
inflation swaps convert fixed rate interest costs to RPI-linked costs, which fluctuate in line 
with the RPI index as do a significant proportion of the Group’s revenue contracts.  
Financing  
risk
The Group will need to refinance at least 
part of its debt as it matures and may 
need additional financing to cover capital 
expenditure and certain other expenses 
to support its growth plans. The Group 
cannot be certain that such financing 
will be readily available on attractive or 
historically comparable terms.
Breach of debt covenants and/or a 
downgrade in our rating could impact 
the availability of finance or the 
comparability of terms.
The Group mitigates this risk by the strength of the stable long term investment grade 
capital structure in place, our BBB ratings reflect our strong ability to service and repay 
debt from our cash flows over a reasonable period of time, maintaining debt with a 
variety of medium and long term maturities so that over time we do not have a significant 
concentration of debt due for refinancing in any given year, and aiming to refinance debt 
well in advance of the maturity date.
With regards to covenants the Group maintains financial covenant monitoring and 
modelling, both retrospectively and prospectively and maintains regular dialogue with 
credit ratings agencies.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on 
customer receivables.
The Group is exposed to counterparty 
risks in its financing operations.
This is managed through appropriate credit checking procedures prior to taking on new 
customers; and higher risk customers paying in advance of services being provided. 
Performance is closely monitored to ensure agreed service levels are maintained reducing 
the level of queried payments and mitigating the risk of uncollectible debts. 
The Group carefully manages the credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial 
instruments with balances currently spread across a range of major financial institutions 
which have satisfactory credit ratings assigned by international credit ratings agencies. 
The levels of credit risk are monitored through the Group’s on-going risk management 
processes, which include a regular review of the credit ratings. Risk in this area is limited 
further by setting a maximum level and term for deposits with any single counterparty. 
The Directors of Arqiva Group Limited 
(‘AGL’), registered company number 
05254001, (“the Company”) and its 
subsidiaries (“the Group”) submit the 
annual report and audited consolidated 
financial statements (“financial 
statements”) in respect of the year ended 
30 June 2017.
The Company is a holding company with 
an investment in a group of operating 
companies, financing companies and 
other holding companies. 
The Directors’ report for the Company  
is set out on page 127.
Financial risk management 
The principal risks and uncertainties  
of the Group have been outlined 
previously in this section of the report 
(see page 49). 
As a result of these, as well as the on-
going business activities and strategy of 
the Group, Arqiva is exposed to a variety 
of financial risks that include financing 
risk, purchase price risk, credit risk, 
liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign 
exchange risk.
The key financial risks affecting the 
Group are set out below together with 
a summary of how these risks are 
managed: Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2017
Arqiva Group Limited    54
Risk type Description of risk / uncertainty Management of risk / uncertainty
Liquidity risk Ensuring the Group has sufficient available funds for 
working capital requirements and planned growth.
The Group maintains cash reserves and access to undrawn committed 
facilities to cover forecast requirements. As at 30 June 2017 the Group had 
£18.0m cash (and £28.5m in reserve to cover one semi-annual interest 
payment on the junior bonds) and £304.0m available undrawn facilities 
to meet planned growth and working capital requirements. In addition, 
the Group has £250.0m of liquidity facilities available to cover senior 
interest payments if required and a £30.0m facility to support ‘Comms Hub 
Receivables Purchasing’. The Board consider the availability and adequacy 
of working capital funding requirements in conjunction with forming its 
long-term financial plan for the business.
Purchase 
price risk
Energy is a major component of the Group’s cost base 
and is subject to price volatility. 
A large proportion of this is managed via pass-through arrangements 
to customers. The Group’s residual exposure to fluctuations in the 
electricity price is managed by forward purchasing the majority of power 
requirements. Key revenue and cost milestones are set on larger projects to 
ensure the financial risks of volatile market pricing are mitigated.
Foreign 
exchange risk
The Group operates from UK sites and predominantly 
in the UK market. While some customer and supplier 
contracts are denominated in other currencies (mainly 
US Dollars and Euros), the majority of the Group’s 
revenues and costs are sterling based, and accordingly 
exposure to foreign exchange is limited. 
Management regularly monitor the impact of foreign exchange risks and 
assess the need to put any mitigating financial instruments in place. During 
the year cross currency swaps were in place to fix the exchange rate in 
relation to US Dollar denominated private placement notes. Details of the 
cross currency swaps are provided in note 25. Directors’ report

Internal control over financial 
reporting
The Board of Directors review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems 
of internal control, including risk 
management systems and financial and 
operational controls (see page 49).
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Paul 
Dollman, an independent non-executive 
director, and includes representation 
from the Board of Directors. The Audit 
Committee monitors the integrity of 
the Group’s financial statements and 
the effectiveness of the external audit 
process. It has the responsibility for 
ensuring that an appropriate relationship 
exists between the Group and the 
external auditors, including a review of 
non-audit services and fees.
In addition, it has responsibilities 
of oversight of risk management 
procedures, monitoring compliance and 
regulatory issues (including whistle-
blowing arrangements), and reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and internal audit function. The 
internal audit function agrees its annual 
audit plan with the Audit Committee 
and regularly reports its finding and 
recommendations to it. 
The Committee is authorised to seek 
any information it requires from any 
employee of the Company in order to 
perform its duties, and to obtain any 
external legal or other professional 
counsel it requires.
Meetings of the Committee are 
attended, at the invitation of the 
Chairman of the Committee, by the 
external auditors, the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and 
representatives from the business as 
required.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the work undertaken by the 
Group’s internal audit function, assessing 
the adequacy of the function’s resource 
and the scope of its procedures. The 
Group’s internal audit plan incorporates 
an annual rolling review of business 
activities, and incorporates both 
financial and non-financial controls and 
procedures.
External audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
making recommendations to the Board 
on the appointment, re-appointment and 
removal of the Group’s external auditors. 
The Committee makes an assessment 
of the auditors’ independence and 
objectivity taking into account the 
relationship with the auditors as a whole, 
including the provision of any non-audit 
services.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were  
re-appointed as external auditors in 2016 
following a competitive tender process.
In the current year the auditor has 
provided certain non-audit services, 
principally in relation to transaction 
support services and non audit assurance 
services. The Audit Committee ensures 
that appropriate safeguards of audit 
independence are established and 
applied.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, chaired 
by Sally Davis, is established to make 
recommendations to the Board regarding 
executive remuneration, including pension 
rights, and to recommend and monitor 
the level and structure of remuneration 
for each member of the Senior Executive 
Management. Additional oversight is 
extended to setting and monitoring 
reward and incentive policies, including 
the group-wide annual bonus scheme, 
long-term incentive scheme, and 
reviewing and making recommendations 
in relation to wider reward policies. 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee, chaired 
by Mike Parton, is established to 
give oversight to the size, structure 
and composition (including skills, 
experience, independence, knowledge 
and diversity) of the Board to ensure 
that the continued leadership ability 
is sufficient to allow the business to 
compete effectively in the market. This 
also includes oversight of the succession 
planning for directors (and other senior 
management where appropriate).
Operational Resilience Committee
The Operational Resilience Committee, 
chaired by Mike Parton, has oversight 
of the effectiveness of the operational 
resilience strategies and procedures of the 
Group (including principles, policies and 
practices adopted in complying with all 
statutory, and sub-statutory, standards 
and regulatory requirements in respect of 
safety, health and environment (‘SHE’) 
matters affecting the activities of the 
Group). This includes consideration and risk 
management of areas of significant and 
individual cyber security, physical security, 
business continuity and SHE risk.
Equal opportunities policy
Applications for employment by disabled 
persons are always fully considered, 
bearing in mind the respective aptitudes 
and abilities of the applicant concerned. In 
the event of members of staff becoming 
disabled, every effort is made to ensure 
that their employment with the Group 
continues and the appropriate training 
arranged. It is the policy of the Group 
that the training, career development and 
promotion of a disabled person, should, 
as far as possible, be identical to that 
of a person who does not suffer from a 
disability. Further information on how 
Arqiva supports its employees can be found

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare such financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law 
the directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and company financial 
statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law. 
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the group 
and company and of the profit or loss of 
the group and company for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
	 	 Select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
	 	 State whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed for the group financial 
statements and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101, have been followed for 
the company financial statements, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
	 	 Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and
	 	 Prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group 
and company’s transactions and disclose, 
with reasonable accuracy, at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the 
Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. 
The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.  Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2017

Report on the audit of 
the financial statements 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
 Arqiva Group Limited’s Group 
financial statements and 
Company financial statements 
(the “financial statements”) 
give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s affairs as at 30 
June 2017 and of the Group’s 
loss and cash flows for the 
year then ended; 
 the Group financial statements 
have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European 
Union; 
 the Company financial 
statements have been 
properly prepared in 
accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 
“Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable 
law); and 
 the financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. 
We have audited the financial 
statements, included within the 
Annual Report and Consolidated 
Financial Statements (the “Annual 
Report”), which comprise: the 
consolidated statement of financial 
position and the Company 
statement of financial position as at 
30 June 2017, the consolidated 
income statement, the 
consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the 
consolidated cash flow statement, 
the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and the 
Company statement of changes in 
equity for the year then ended, the 
notes to the consolidated financial 
statements and the Company notes 
to the financial statements, which 
include a description of the 
significant accounting policies. 
 
 
 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in 
accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs 
(UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are 
further described in the Auditors’ 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our 
report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Independence 
We remained independent of the 
Group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, 
which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard as applicable to listed 
public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements.

Our audit approach 
Overview 
Materiality Audit Scope Key Audit Matters 
 Overall Group Materiality £15.5 
million (2016: £14.8 million) - 
Group financial statements. 
 Based on 5% of profit before 
interest, tax, other gains and 
losses and exceptional items. 
 Overall Company Materiality 
£35.3 million (2016: £14.8 
million) - Company financial 
statements. 
 Based on 2% of total assets, 
capped in the prior year at 
Group Materiality. 
 
 For the Group financial 
statements we performed an 
audit of the complete financial 
information of 10 reporting 
units. We also conducted audit 
procedures of specific line 
items for 1 reporting unit. 
 The audit work performed gave 
us coverage of 92% of revenue 
and 98% of profit before 
interest, tax, other gains and 
losses and exceptional items. 
 All entities have been audited 
by the Group team and hence 
no component auditor has 
been involved in the audit of 
consolidated financial 
statements. 
 Revenue and profit recognition 
on complex contracts (Group). 
 Valuation of financial 
instruments (Group). 
 Accruals and provisions, 
including amounts relating to 
infrastructure and bonuses and 
decommissioning of sites 
(Group). 
 Classification of exceptional 
items (Group). 
 Impairment of intangible assets 
and goodwill (Group) and 
investments in subsidiaries 
(Company only). 
 
 
The scope of our audit 
As part of designing our audit, we 
determined materiality and 
assessed the risks of material 
misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we 
looked at where the directors 
made subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are 
inherently uncertain. As in all of 
our audits we also addressed the 
risk of management override of 
internal controls, including 
evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the directors 
that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud.  
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those 
matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of 
most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements of the 
current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or 
not due to fraud) identified by the 
auditors, including those which 
had the greatest effect on: the 
overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit 
and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. These matters, 
and any comments we make on 
the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the 
context of our  
 
audit of the financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on 
these matters. This is not a 
complete list of all risks identified 
by our audit.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter 
Revenue and profit recognition on complex contracts 
(Group)  
Refer to page 75, page 82 and page 85  (note 3- 
significant accounting policies – revenue recognition, 
note 4- critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty – revenue 
recognition and note 5 – revenue and segmental 
information) 
The Group has a number of complex customer 
contracts which are delivered in phases over a 
number of accounting periods. These contracts 
include smart metering contracts, contracts with 
telecommunications network operators for access to 
communications infrastructure and contracts for the 
clearance of spectrum. 
As a result the accounting for revenue and profit 
recognition is complex.  There are multiple elements 
involved and a degree of management judgement in 
determining what is included in the total contract 
position to completion and the margin to be 
recognised. 
We obtained schedules for each contract and for 
each deliverable showing the amount of revenue and 
gross margin for the year to 30 June 2017 and for all 
prior years for which the contract was in operation 
and all future years for which there are performance 
obligations under the contract. We compared the 
total amounts of revenue to the contract and 
determined that the separate contract elements were 
separately identified and performed testing over the 
amounts of revenue allocated to each element to 
ensure this was appropriate.  
We assessed the revenue profit margins for 
consistency with contract deliverable costs by 
considering the costs incurred to date and forecast 
for the relevant revenue stream.  We also compared 
this to the consistency of past and future gross 
margins, obtaining explanations for variations where 
necessary. 
For each element we assessed the extent of 
performance of deliverables that had been achieved 
in the year, and the amount of revenue recognised, 
by, for example, reviewing the evidence of milestone 
achievement and amounts invoiced, discussion with 
project managers, and assessing management 
estimates used to determine the revenue recognised, 
verifying estimated costs to come with third party 
evidence where available or corroborating with other 
available information within the business if 
appropriate. 
Where contract variations arose we assessed the 
appropriateness and timing of the recognition of the 
related revenues by obtaining an understanding of 
the reason for the variations and the timing of their 
delivery and validated this to the signed contract 
variation addendums. 
Through our procedures performed we assessed 
whether the revenue recognised on the contracts 
was in line with the Group accounting policies and 
IAS 18. 
Our testing did not identify any material differences 
in relation to revenue and profit recognition on these 
complex contracts. 
 
  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)          63 
Valuation of financial instruments (Group)  
Refer to page 78, page 84 and page 109  (note 3- 
significant accounting policies – financial instruments, 
note 4- critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty – fair value 
measurements and valuation processes and note 25 – 
derivative financial instruments) 
The Group holds a number of derivative financial 
instruments comprising interest rate, cross currency 
and inflation linked swaps, in relation to the 
financing of the Group. These derivative financial 
instruments are significantly out of the money. The 
Group accounts for the valuations of those 
instruments using valuations provided by the counter 
party institutions with adjustments made by 
management for counter party credit risk. 
This is considered a key audit matter due to the 
complexity of the valuations and the quantum of 
balances involved. 
 
We engaged PwC valuations experts to assist with 
the audit of the counter parties’ valuations of each 
interest rate swap, cross currency swap and inflation 
linked swap, and management’s adjustments for 
counter party credit risk of those instruments.  This 
recalculated the fair value using the internal PwC 
valuation model for every instrument which was then 
compared to the amount recognised in the financial 
statements. 
There were no material differences arising between 
the Group fair values of derivative financial 
instruments recognised and our valuations. 
Accruals and provisions (Group) 
Refer to page 83 and page 115  (note 4- critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty – provisions and contingent liabilities and 
note 26 – provisions) 
Arqiva’s business results in recognising complex 
accruals and provisions including those related to 
infrastructure across the extensive asset portfolio, 
various bonus accruals and decommissioning 
provisions.  
As there is an element of estimation involved, there 
is considered to be a risk that these balances may 
not be appropriately determined. 
 
On a sample basis, we tested the accounting for 
accruals and provisions to supporting 
documentation and have challenged management 
where judgement has been applied, looking to 
corroborate the reasonableness of assumptions 
made with either historic performance or alternative 
evidence.  This included: 
 For rent, rates and power understanding the 
processes for identifying and aggregating 
accruals and testing on a sample basis for 
accuracy by testing to supporting documentation; 
 For the decommissioning provision we obtained 
management’s calculations and assumptions and 
confirmed that the methodology is appropriate.  
We then assessed the reasonableness of the 
assumptions in conjunction with the asset plan, 
decommissioning cost estimates and actual 
experience, and the appropriateness of the 
discount rate; 
 For bonuses we tied the assumptions included to 
the current year outcome and, where also 
relevant, to the long term plan which has been 
approved by the board. 
From our work performed, we have not identified 
any material differences or where the rationale for 
recognition of an accrual/provision was not 
considered appropriate.  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
64          Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)           
Classification of exceptional items (Group) 
Refer to page 90 (note 7 – exceptional items) 
Costs of £50.1m have been classified as exceptional 
items in the current year financial statements. 
One of the Group's financial reporting KPIs is EBITDA 
prior to exceptional items. There is a risk that some 
non-exceptional costs could have been incorrectly 
classified as exceptional costs. 
 
We assessed the disclosed accounting policy for 
compliance with accounting standards and for 
consistency of application. 
We scanned the listing of exceptional items for costs 
that appeared unusual to us in the context of the 
accounting policy and tested a sample of items to 
assess whether such items were appropriately 
classified. 
Our testing did not identify any material 
misstatements in the amounts or presentation of 
exceptional items. 
Impairment of intangible assets, goodwill (Group) 
and investments in subsidiaries (Company only) 
Refer to page 83 and page 95 (note 4- critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty – Impairment of goodwill and note 14 –
goodwill) 
IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ requires management 
to prepare annual impairment reviews in respect of 
all indefinite lived intangible assets, such as goodwill. 
The Group’s intangible assets and goodwill are 
material, amounting to £2,029 million and the 
impairment reviews performed over these include a 
number of assumptions which are subject to 
management judgement. 
 
 
We obtained an understanding of the allocation of 
goodwill to business units in management’s 
impairment model and assessed its appropriateness. 
We tested the impairment model, assessing its 
mathematical accuracy, the reliability of inputs to the 
model and the reasonableness of the assumptions 
applied by management in assessing the valuation of 
intangibles and goodwill for each business unit.  
These included the assumptions on revenue and cost 
growth, capital expenditure and the discount rate 
used. 
We involved our PwC valuations experts to evaluate  
the discount rate used to calculate the present value 
of the cash flows and ensure this was calculated 
using an acceptable methodology and in line with 
what we would expect for the business units. 
Based on this testing, we considered whether the 
carrying value of these intangibles was adequately 
supported by the value-in-use impairment model 
prepared by management, and found there to be a 
significant level of headroom. 
For the Company’s investment in subsidiaries we 
have compared the net assets of the subsidiary at 30 
June 2017 with the carrying value of the investment. 
For any subsidiaries where net assets do not exceed 
the carrying value, for example the entities which 
hold the Group’s debt, we have looked further down 
the Group hierarchy at the subsidiaries held by that 
entity and confirmed that, by taking into account the 
net assets of these, the carrying value of the 
investment held in the Company is supported. 
We also considered for both the Group and 
Company positions whether there are any further 
indicators which would cause there to be an 
impairment and found that to be unlikely.

How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit 
to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an 
opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into 
account the structure of the 
Group and the Company, the 
accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which 
they operate. 
Arqiva Group Limited's business is 
carried out through two principal 
trading subsidiaries, aligned into 
three customer-facing business 
units; Terrestrial Broadcast, 
Telecoms & M2M and Satellite 
and Media, supported by the 
Group’s corporate functions. In 
addition there are a number of 
entities which provide financing to 
the operations. 
All of the audit work including the 
audit of the consolidation has 
been performed by the Group 
engagement team since the 
accounting is performed in 
Arqiva’s Winchester location. 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was 
influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain 
quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped 
us to determine the scope of our 
audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on 
the individual financial statement 
line items and disclosures and in 
evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually 
and in aggregate on the financial 
statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional 
judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole as follows: 
 
  
   
Group financial statements Company financial statements 
Overall materiality 
£15.5 million (2016: £14.8 million). £35.3 million (2016: £14.8 million). 
How we determined it 
5% of profit before interest, tax, other 
gains and losses and exceptional items. 
2% of total assets, capped in the prior 
year at Group Materiality. 
Rationale for 
benchmark applied 
Based on our professional judgement, 
profit before interest and tax is an 
appropriate measure to assess the 
performance of the Group, and is a 
generally accepted auditing benchmark.
Based on our professional judgement, 
total assets is an appropriate measure 
to assess the performance of the 
Company and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark. 
   
For each component in the scope 
of our Group audit, we allocated a 
materiality that is less than our 
overall Group materiality. The 
range of materiality allocated 
across components was between 
£0.7 million and £14 million. 
Certain components were audited 
to a local statutory audit 
materiality that was also less than 
our overall Group materiality. 
We agreed with the Audit 
Committee that we would report 
to them misstatements identified 
during our audit above £0.5 
million (Group audit) (2016: £0.5 
million) and £0.5 million 
(Company audit) (2016: £0.5 
million) as well as misstatements 
below those amounts that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to 
going concern 
We have nothing to report in 
respect of the following matters in 
relation to which ISAs (UK) require 
us to report to you when:  
 the directors’ use of the 
going concern basis of 
accounting in the 
preparation of the financial 
statements is not 
appropriate; or  
 the directors have not 
disclosed in the financial 
statements any identified 
material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue 
to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting for a 
period of at least twelve 
months from the date when 
the financial statements are 
authorised for issue. 
However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a 
guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
Reporting on other 
information  
The other information comprises 
all of the information in the 
Annual Report and Consolidated 
Financial Statements other than 
the financial statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon. The 
directors are responsible for the 
other information. Our opinion on 
the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion or, except to the 
extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in this report, any form of 
assurance thereon.  
In connection with our audit of 
the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other 
information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify an 
apparent material inconsistency or 
material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to 
conclude whether there is a 
material misstatement of the 
financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material 
misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing 
to report based on these 
responsibilities. 
With respect to the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report, 
we also considered whether the 
disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been 
included.   
Based on the responsibilities 
described above and our work 
undertaken in the course of the 
audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to 
report certain opinions and 
matters as described below. 
Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report 
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the 
audit, the information given in the 
Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 30 June 
2017 is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been 
prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.  
In light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and 
parent Company and their 
environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material 
misstatements in the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report.  
Responsibilities for the 
financial statements and 
the audit 
Responsibilities of the directors 
for the financial statements 
As explained more fully in the 
Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 
57, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the 
applicable framework and for 
being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. The directors 
are also responsible for such 
internal control as they determine 
is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial 
statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial 
statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the 
Group’s and the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the Company or to 
cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial 
statements 
Our objectives are to obtain 
reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit   Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017

Notes to the Group financial statements 
1 General information, authorisation of financial statements and Statement 
of Compliance 
Arqiva Group Limited (‘AGL’) (‘the 
Company’) is a private company 
limited by shares and 
incorporated in England, in the 
United Kingdom (‘UK’) under the 
Companies Act 2006 under 
registration number 05254001. 
The address of the registered 
office is Crawley Court, 
Winchester, Hampshire, England 
SO21 2QA.  
 
These consolidated financial 
statements of the Company and 
its subsidiaries for the year ended 
30 June 2017 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries 
(together the "Group"). 
  
The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal 
activities are set out in the 
strategic report on pages 8 to 40. 
 
Statement of Compliance 
The consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards 
("IFRS") (including International 
Accounting Standards ("IAS") and 
interpretations issued by the 
International Accounting 
Standards Board ("IASB") and its 
committees) as adopted for use in 
the European Union ("EU") and 
the Companies Act 2006. 
 
The Company has elected to 
prepare its financial statements in 
accordance with FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework. These are 
presented on pages 127 to 138.

Management have performed an 
impact assessment on the 
adoption of IFRS 15 and do not 
expect it to have a material impact 
on the financial statements. With 
the exception of IFRS 16, the 
directors do not expect that the 
adoption of the other Standards 
and Interpretations listed above 
will have a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group 
in future periods. 
 
IFRS 16 Leases, which is not yet 
endorsed for use in the EU, is 
expected to have a material 
impact on the financial statements 
of the Group in future periods. 
This is primarily through the 
recognition of the Group’s 
operating leases on the balance 
sheet and reclassification of costs 
in the income statement leading 
to an increase in EBITDA, however 
it is not practicable to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the effect 
of this standard until a more 
detailed review has been 
completed. Further details of the 
Group’s operating lease 
commitments are shown in note 
28. 
 
3 Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The financial framework which 
now applies to entities preparing 
financial statements in accordance 
with legislation, regulation or 
accounting standards applicable 
in the UK and the Republic of 
Ireland is FRS 100, Application of 
Financial Reporting Requirements, 
which was issued in November 
2012. These standards are 
mandatory for statutory financial 
statements for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 
2015. Pursuant to the introduction 
of these new standards, the Group 
adopted EU-endorsed IFRS, which 
is an acceptable basis of reporting 
under FRS 100, and therefore the 
Group financial statements 
comply with Article 4 of the EU 
IAS Regulation. 
 
The financial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 as 
applicable to companies applying 
IFRS and in accordance with IFRS 
Interpretations Committee 
interpretations. 
 
The financial statements have 
been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the valuation 
of financial instruments that are 
measured at fair values at the end 
of each reporting period, as 
explained in the accounting 
policies below. Historical cost is 
generally based on the fair value 
of the consideration given in 
exchange for goods and services. 
The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below. These 
policies have been applied 
consistently across the 
comparative financial periods 
included within these financial 
statements. 
  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)          75           
The Company’s financial 
statements have been prepared 
under FRS 101 and are included in 
this report – see page 127. 
 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial 
statements incorporate the 
financial statements of the 
Company and entities controlled 
by the Company (its subsidiaries, 
together the Group) made up to 
30 June 2017.  
 
Control is achieved when the 
Company: 
 has demonstrable power 
over the relevant activities of 
the investee; 
 is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable return from its 
involvement with the 
investee; and 
 has the ability to use its 
power to affect its returns. 
 
The Company reassesses whether 
or not it controls an investee if 
facts and circumstances indicate 
that there are changes to one or 
more of the three elements of 
control listed above.  
 
Consolidation of a subsidiary 
begins when the Company 
obtains control over the 
subsidiary and ceases when the 
Company loses control of the 
subsidiary. Specifically, the results 
of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated 
income statement from the date 
the Company gains control until 
the date when the Company 
ceases to control the subsidiary. 
 
Intra-group profits have been 
eliminated.  Undertakings, other 
than subsidiary undertakings, in 
which the Group has an 
investment representing not less 
than 20% of the voting rights and 
over which it exerts significant 
influence are treated as associated 
undertakings. Where the Group 
has an investment that has joint 
control, this is treated as a joint 
venture. Associates and joint 
ventures are accounted for using 
the equity method of accounting 
in accordance with IAS 28 
‘Investments in Associates and 
Joint Ventures’. 
 
Going concern 
The Group meets its day-to-day 
working capital and financing 
requirements through the net 
cash generated from its 
operations. The Group has access 
to sufficient financial resources 
which, together with internally 
generated cash flows, will 
continue to provide sufficient 
sources of liquidity to fund its 
current operations, including its 
contractual and commercial 
commitments as set out in note 
28. For this reason the Directors 
are confident that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in 
preparing these financial 
statements.  
 
Segmental reporting 
Operating segments are reported 
in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the 
chief operating decision maker. 
The chief operating decision 
maker, who is responsible for the 
allocation of resources and 
assessment of performance of the 
operating segments, has been 
identified as collectively the Board 
of Directors, which includes the 
Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chief Financial Officer.  
 
 
 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents the gross 
inflow of economic benefit for 
services provided utilising Arqiva’s 
communications infrastructure, 
completion of significant 
engineering projects and the sale 
of communications equipment. 
Revenue is stated net of value 
added tax. Revenue is measured 
at the fair value of the 
consideration received or 
receivable.  
 
Where a contractual arrangement 
consists of two or more elements 
that are separable and have value 
to a customer on a standalone 
basis, revenue is recognised for 
each element as if it were an 
individual contract. The total 
contract consideration is allocated 
between the separate elements on 
the basis of relative fair value and 
the appropriate revenue 
recognition criteria are applied to 
each element. Likewise where 
elements of a contract, or multiple 
contracts, are so intrinsically 
linked that it is necessary to 
consider the elements on a 
bundled basis revenue is 
recognised in respect of the 
bundled contractual obligations 
taken as a whole. 
 
Cash received or invoices raised in 
advance is taken to deferred 
income and recognised as 
revenue when the services are 
provided.  Where consideration 
received in advance is discounted, 
reflecting a significant financing 
component, it is reflected within 
revenue and interest payable and 
similar charges on a gross basis. 
Revenue recognised in advance of 
cash being received or an invoice 
being raised is recognised as 
accrued income.  
   Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
 
76          Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)           
Rendering of services 
Revenue from the rendering of 
services is recognised in line with 
the service provision over the 
contractual period. Revenue is 
recognised when it is probable 
that the economic benefits 
associated with a transaction will 
flow to the Group and the amount 
of revenue and the associated 
costs can be measured reliably. 
Such revenues include television 
and radio transmission services, 
tower site rental to mobile 
network operators, installation 
services, in-building and small 
cells, network provision, media 
services, and machine-to-machine 
connectivity. 
 
For long-term services contracts 
revenue is recognised on a 
straight line basis over the term of 
the contract. However, if the 
performance pattern is other than 
straight line, revenue is 
recognised as services are 
provided, usually on an output or 
network coverage basis. Such 
revenues include Smart metering 
network build and service 
operation.  
  
Pre-contract costs incurred in the 
initial set up phase of a contract 
are deferred. These costs are then 
recognised in the income 
statement on a straight line basis 
over the remaining contractual 
term, unless the pattern of service 
delivery indicates a different 
profile is appropriate. These costs 
are directly attributable to specific 
contracts, relate to future activity, 
will generate future economic 
benefits and are assessed for 
recoverability on a regular basis. 
Costs related to delivering 
services under long-term 
contractual arrangements are 
expensed as incurred. 
Delivery of engineering projects 
Arqiva provides support to its 
customers by undertaking various 
engineering projects.  
 
Revenue from such projects, 
which are long-term (greater than 
12 months) contractual 
arrangements, are recognised 
based on the percentage of 
completion method. The stage of 
completion is estimated using an 
appropriate measure according to 
the nature of the contract. Profit is 
recognised, if the final outcome 
can be assessed with reasonable 
certainty, by including revenue 
and related costs in the income 
statement as contract activity 
progresses.  
A loss on a fixed price contract is 
recognised immediately when it 
becomes probable that the 
contract cost will exceed the total 
contract revenue. 
Sale of communications equipment 
Revenue from the sale of 
communications equipment is 
recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership 
are transferred to the buyer, which 
is typically upon delivery and 
acceptance by the customer.  
 
Business combinations, 
including goodwill 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and 
businesses are accounted for 
using the acquisition method. The 
consideration transferred in a 
business combination is measured 
at fair value, which is calculated as 
the sum of the acquisition-date 
fair values of assets transferred by 
the Group, liabilities incurred by 
the Group to the former owners of 
the acquiree and the equity 
interest issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the 
acquiree. Acquisition-related costs 
are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred. 
 
Goodwill is measured as the sum 
of the consideration transferred, 
the amount of any non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree, and the 
fair value of the acquirer's 
previously held equity interest in 
the acquiree (if any) less the net of 
the acquisition-date amounts of 
the identifiable assets acquired 
and the liabilities assumed.  
 
Goodwill is not amortised but is 
reviewed for impairment at least 
annually or where there is 
indication of impairment.  
 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the 
attributable amount of goodwill is 
included in the determination of 
the profit or loss on disposal. 
 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are initially 
recognised at cost and are 
subsequently carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged to the 
income statement on a straight 
line basis over the estimated 
useful life of the asset, on the 
following bases: 
 
Asset Description Estimated Useful Life 
Licences Length of the licence period (no more than 20 years) 
Development costs 10 years 
Access rights Length of the agreement (no more than 20 years) 
Software  5-10 years  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)          77           
Expenditure on research activities 
is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred.  
 
An internally-generated intangible 
asset arising from development 
(or from the development phase 
of an internal project) is 
recognised if, and only if, all of the 
following conditions have been 
demonstrated: 
 the technical feasibility of 
completing the intangible 
asset so that it will be 
available for use or sale; 
 the intention to complete the 
intangible asset and use or 
sell it; 
 the ability to use or sell the 
intangible asset; 
 how the intangible asset will 
generate probable future 
economic benefits; 
 the availability of adequate 
technical, financial and other 
resources to complete the 
development and to use or 
sell the intangible asset; and 
 the ability to measure reliably 
the expenditure attributable 
to the intangible asset during 
its development. 
The amount initially recognised 
for internally-generated intangible 
assets is the sum of the 
expenditure incurred from the 
date when the intangible asset 
first meets the recognition criteria 
listed above. Where no internally-
generated intangible asset can be 
recognised, development 
expenditure is recognised in profit 
or loss in the period in which it is 
incurred. 
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, 
internally-generated intangible 
assets are reported at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses, 
on the same basis as intangible 
assets that are acquired 
separately. 
 
An intangible asset is 
derecognised on disposal, or 
when no future economic benefits 
are expected from use or disposal. 
Gains or losses arising from de-
recognition of an intangible asset, 
measured as the difference 
between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset, are recognised in 
profit or loss when the asset is 
derecognised.  
 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are 
stated at historical purchase cost 
(which includes costs directly 
attributable to bringing the assets 
into working condition), being fair 
value for tangible assets acquired 
on acquisition, less accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for 
impairment. 
Assets in the course of 
construction for production, 
supply or administrative purposes, 
are carried at cost, less any 
recognised impairment loss. The 
cost of self-constructed assets 
includes the cost of materials and 
direct labour. Labour costs are 
capitalised within the cost of an 
asset to the extent that they are 
directly attributable to the 
construction of the asset. The 
value capitalised captures all 
elements of employee benefits as 
defined by IAS 19. 
 
Cost includes professional fees 
and, for qualifying assets, 
borrowing costs capitalised in 
accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy. Depreciation of 
these assets, on the same basis as 
other property assets, commences 
when the assets are ready for their 
intended use. 
 
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
 
Depreciation is recognised so as 
to write off the cost or valuation 
of assets (other than freehold land 
and properties under 
construction) less their residual 
values over their useful lives, using 
the straight-line method, on the 
following bases: 
 
 
 
 
Asset Description Estimated Useful Life 
Freehold buildings 20 – 80 years 
Leasehold buildings Length of lease (typically between 20-80 years) 
Plant and equipment  
- Communications infrastructure network 8 – 100 years 
- Network computer equipment 3 – 20 years  
- Motor vehicles 3 – 5 years 
    Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
 
78          Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)           
The estimated useful lives, 
residual values and depreciation 
method are reviewed at the end 
of each reporting period, with the 
effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective 
basis.  
 
Assets held under finance leases 
are depreciated over the shorter 
of their lease term and their 
expected useful lives (on the same 
basis as owned assets). 
 
An item of property, plant and 
equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to 
arise from the continued use of 
the asset. The gain or loss arising 
on the disposal of an asset is 
determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset, 
and is recognised in the income 
statement. 
 
Impairment of non-financial 
assets  
At each reporting period date, the 
Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its tangible and 
intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated 
to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). Where 
the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates  
the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. When a reasonable 
and consistent basis of allocation 
can be identified, corporate assets 
are also allocated to individual 
cash-generating units, or 
otherwise they are allocated to 
the smallest group of cash-
generating units for which a 
reasonable and consistent 
allocation basis can be identified.  
 
An intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life, such as 
goodwill, is tested for impairment 
at least annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the 
asset may be impaired. 
 
Recoverable amount is the higher 
of fair value less costs to sell, and 
value in use. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows 
have not been adjusted. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an 
asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying  
amount of the asset (or cash-
generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. 
 
Where an impairment loss 
subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or 
cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that 
the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset 
(or cash-generating unit) in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss unless the 
impairment relates to goodwill, in 
which case it cannot be reversed. 
 
 
 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial 
liabilities are recognised in the 
Group’s statement of financial 
position when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
 
Financial assets and financial 
liabilities are initially measured at 
fair value. Transaction costs that 
are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of financial 
assets and financial liabilities 
(other than financial assets and 
financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss) are added 
to or deducted from the fair value 
of the financial assets or financial 
liabilities, as appropriate, on initial 
recognition. Transaction costs 
directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets or 
financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss are 
recognised immediately in profit 
or loss, presented as an ‘other 
gain or loss’. 
 
All financial assets are recognised 
and derecognised on a trade date 
where the purchase or sale of a 
financial asset is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of 
the financial asset within the 
timeframe established by the 
market concerned. 
 
The Group’s financial assets are 
classified into the following 
specified categories: financial 
assets ‘at fair value through profit 
or loss’ (‘FVTPL’), ‘held-to-
maturity’ investments, ‘available-
for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets and 
‘loans and receivables’. The 
classification depends on the 
nature and purpose of the 
financial assets and is determined 
at the time of initial recognition. 
 
   Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)          79           
Loans and receivables are non-
derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are initially 
recognised at fair value and 
subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest 
method. They are included in 
current assets, except for 
maturities greater than 12 months 
after the reporting date, which are 
classified as non-current assets. 
The Group’s loans and receivables 
comprise trade and other 
receivables and cash and cash 
equivalents: 
 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry 
any interest and are stated at 
their nominal value as reduced 
by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents 
comprise cash on hand and 
demand deposits and other 
short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount 
of cash and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of change in 
value. 
 
The Group’s financial liabilities 
are classified as either financial 
liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other 
financial liabilities’ according to 
the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into.  
 
Borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans 
and overdrafts are recorded at 
the proceeds received, net of 
direct issue costs. Finance 
charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or 
redemption, and direct issue 
costs are accounted for on an 
accruals basis to the income 
statement using the effective 
interest method, and are 
added to the carrying amount 
of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise. 
 
Trade other payables 
Trade and other payables are 
not interest bearing and are 
initially recorded at fair value 
and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.  
They are included in current 
liabilities, except for maturities 
greater than 12 months after 
the reporting date, which are 
classified as non-current 
liabilities. 
 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised 
when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or 
constructive) as a result of a 
past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation and a 
reliable estimate can be made 
of the amount of the 
obligation.  
 
The amount recognised as a 
provision is the best estimate of 
the consideration required to 
settle the present obligation at 
the balance sheet date, taking into 
account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the 
obligation. Where a provision is 
measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present 
obligation, its carrying amount is 
the present value of those cash 
flows (when the effect of the time 
value of money is material). 
 
When some or all of the economic 
benefits required to settle a 
provision are expected to be 
recovered from a third party, a 
receivable is recognised as an 
asset if it is virtually certain that 
reimbursement will be received 
and the amount of the receivable 
can be measured reliably. 
 
Decommissioning provisions are 
recognised within provisions for 
liabilities and charges and 
included within property, plant 
and equipment, where the costs 
of dismantling assets are 
considered material. The amounts 
recognised within property, plant 
and equipment are depreciated 
over the useful economic life of 
the asset. The provisions are 
discounted to reflect the time 
value of money where material. 
 
When the probability that the 
Group will be required to settle an 
obligation or a reliable estimate 
cannot be made of the amount of 
the obligation the Group discloses 
a contingent liability in the notes 
to the financial information. 
 
The Group enters into a variety of 
derivative financial instruments 
to manage its exposure to interest 
rate and foreign exchange rate 
risk, including foreign exchange 
forward contracts, interest rate 
swaps and cross currency swaps.  
 
Derivative financial instruments 
are recognised at fair value at the 
date the derivative contract is 
entered into and are revalued at 
fair value at each balance sheet 
date. The fair value of these 
instruments is determined from 
the expected future cash flows 
discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. 
The future cash flows are 
estimated based on forward 
(interest/inflation/exchange) rates 
observable from rates and yield 
curves at the end of the reporting 
period, and contract rates. The 
difference between the fair value 
at the risk-adjusted rate and the  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
 
80          Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)           
fair value at the risk-free rate is 
used to determine the debit 
valuation adjustment and/or 
credit valuation adjustment to 
these instruments. The Group 
does not apply hedge accounting 
principles.  
 
A derivative is presented as a non-
current asset or a non-current 
liability if the remaining maturity 
of the instrument is more than 12 
months and it is not expected to 
be realised or settled within 12 
months. Otherwise derivatives are 
presented as current assets or 
current liabilities. Where 
derivatives have an amortising 
profile, the fair value of the 
element (i.e. the notional 
principal) that matures within 12 
months is presented as a current 
asset or current liability. 
 
Fair value measurement 
IFRS 13 defines fair value as the 
price that would be received to 
sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at 
the measurement date, regardless 
of whether that price is directly 
observable or estimated using 
another valuation technique. In 
estimating the fair value of an 
asset or a liability, the Group takes 
into account the characteristics of 
the asset or liability if market 
participants would take those 
characteristics into account when 
pricing the asset or liability at the 
measurement date. Fair value for 
measurement and/or disclosure 
purposes in these financial 
statements is determined on such 
a basis. Exceptions to this 
principle have been made for 
leasing transactions that are 
within the scope of IAS 17, and 
measurements that are 
approximations to fair value but 
are not fair value, such as value in 
use in IAS 36.  
In addition, for financial reporting 
purposes, fair value 
measurements are categorised 
into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the 
degree to which the inputs to the 
fair value measurements are 
observable and the significance of 
the inputs to the fair value 
measurement in its entirety, which 
are described as follows:  
 Level 1 inputs are quoted 
prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets 
or liabilities that the entity 
can access at the 
measurement date; 
 Level 2 inputs are inputs, 
other than quoted prices 
included within Level 1, that 
are observable for the asset 
or liability, either directly or 
indirectly; and 
 Level 3 inputs are 
unobservable inputs for the 
asset or liability. 
 
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the 
sum of the tax currently payable 
and deferred tax. 
 
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based 
on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net 
profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using 
tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date. 
 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to 
be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial information and the 
corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit, 
and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be 
utilised.  
 
The carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available to allow all 
or part of the asset to be 
recovered. 
 
Deferred tax is calculated at the 
tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and 
rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates 
to items charged or credited in 
other comprehensive income, in 
which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in other comprehensive 
income. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current 
tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the Group 
intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net 
basis. 
 
Retirement benefits 
Defined contribution schemes 
For defined contribution schemes, 
the amount charged to the  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)          81           
income statement in respect of 
pension costs and other post-
retirement benefits is the 
contribution payable in the year.  
Differences between contributions 
payable for the year and 
contributions actually paid are 
shown as either accruals or 
prepayments in the statement of 
financial position. 
 
Defined benefit schemes 
Defined benefit schemes are 
funded, with the assets of the 
scheme held separately from 
those of the Group, in separate 
trustee administered funds.  
Pension scheme assets are 
measured at fair value and 
liabilities are measured on an 
actuarial basis using the projected 
unit method and discounted at a 
rate equivalent to the current rate 
of return on a high quality 
corporate bond of equivalent 
currency and terms to the scheme 
liabilities.  
 
The Plan closed to future accrual 
of benefits on 31 January 2016. 
Prior to closing the scheme to 
future accrual, the Group 
presented current and past service 
costs within cost of sales and 
administrative expenses (see note 
30) in its consolidated income 
statement. Curtailments gains and 
losses are accounted for as a past-
service cost. 
 
Net-interest expense or income is 
recognised within finance income 
(see note 9). 
 
The retirement benefit obligation 
recognised in the consolidated 
statement of financial position 
represents the deficit or surplus in 
the Group’s defined benefit 
schemes. Any surplus resulting 
from this calculation is limited to 
the present value of any economic 
benefits available in the form of 
refunds from the schemes or 
reductions in future contributions 
to the schemes. 
 
A liability for a termination benefit 
is recognised at the earlier of 
when the entity can no longer 
withdraw the offer of the 
termination benefit and when the 
entity recognises any related 
restructuring costs. 
 
Leases 
Leases are classified as finance 
leases whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership to 
the lessee. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases. 
 
The Group as lessor 
Equipment leased to customers 
under finance leases is deemed to 
be sold at normal selling price and 
this value is recognised as revenue 
at the inception of the lease. The 
associated asset is recognised 
within cost of sales at the 
inception of the lease. Receivables 
under finance leases represent 
outstanding amounts due under 
these agreements, less finance 
charges allocated to future 
periods.  Finance lease interest is 
recognised over the primary 
period of the lease so as to 
produce a constant rate of return 
on the net cash investments. 
 
Rental income from operating 
leases is recognised on a straight-
line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Initial direct costs 
incurred in negotiating and 
arranging an operating lease are 
added to the carrying amount of 
the leased asset and recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. 
 
The Group as lessee 
Assets held under finance leases 
are recognised as assets of the 
Group at their fair value or, if 
lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each 
determined at the inception of the 
lease. The corresponding liability 
to the lessor is included in the 
statement of financial position as 
a finance lease obligation.  
 
Lease payments are apportioned 
between finance expenses and 
reduction of the lease obligation 
so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance 
of the liability. Finance expenses 
are recognised immediately in 
profit or loss, unless they are 
directly attributable to qualifying 
assets, in which case they are 
capitalised in accordance with the 
Group’s general policy on 
borrowing costs. Contingent 
rentals are recognised as expenses 
in the periods in which they are 
incurred.  
 
Rentals payable under operating 
leases are charged to income on a 
straight-line basis over the term of 
the relevant lease except where 
another more systematic basis is 
more representative of the time 
pattern in which economic 
benefits from the lease asset are 
consumed. Contingent rentals 
arising under operating leases are 
recognised as an expense in the 
period in which they are incurred. 
 
In the event that lease incentives 
are received to enter into 
operating leases, such incentives 
are recognised as a liability. The 
aggregate benefit of incentives is 
recognised as a reduction of 
rental expense on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term, except 
where another systematic basis is 
more representative of the time 
pattern in which economic 
benefits from the leased asset are 
consumed.

82          Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)           
Government grants 
Government grants are not 
recognised until there is 
reasonable assurance that the 
Group will comply with the 
conditions attaching to them and 
that the grants will be received. 
 
Government grants are 
recognised in profit or loss on a 
systematic basis over the periods 
in which the Group recognises as 
expenses the related costs for 
which the grants are intended to 
compensate. Specifically, 
government grants whose primary 
condition is that the Group should 
purchase, construct or otherwise 
acquire non-current assets are 
recognised as deferred revenue in 
the consolidated statement of 
financial position and transferred 
to profit or loss on a systematic 
and rational basis over the useful 
lives of the related assets. 
 
 
 
 
Operating profit and 
exceptional items 
Operating profit is stated after 
exceptional impairment and 
restructuring costs, and after the 
share of results of associates but 
before finance income and finance 
costs. 
 
Exceptional items are those that 
are considered to be one-off, 
non-recurring in nature or 
material, either by magnitude or 
nature, that the Directors believe 
that they require separate 
disclosure to avoid the distortion 
of underlying performance, for 
example one-off impairments, 
redundancy programmes, 
restructuring and costs related to 
significant corporate finance. The 
Directors believe the resulting 
EBITDA represents underlying 
performance, excluding significant 
one-off and non-recurring events, 
that more fairly represents the on-
going trading performance of the 
business. These items are 
therefore presented separately on 
the face of the income statement.  
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies 
are translated at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction, except in the case of 
certain financing transactions 
where hedging arrangements are 
in place and transactions are 
recorded at the contracted rate. 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities 
denoted in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the exchange rate 
ruling at the balance sheet date or 
the contracted rate if applicable. 
Any exchange differences arising 
are taken to the income 
statement. Transactions in the 
income statement of overseas 
operations are translated using an 
average exchange rate.  
 
Exchange differences on 
translation of overseas branches 
are recognised through the 
statement of comprehensive 
income. 
 
 
4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Group’s 
accounting policies, which are 
described in note 3, the directors 
are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about 
the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on 
historical experience and other 
factors that are considered to be 
relevant. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. 
 
The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an 
on-going basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which 
the estimate is revised if the 
revision affects only that period or 
in the period of the revision and 
future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future 
periods. 
 
Critical judgements and key 
sources of estimation 
uncertainty in applying the 
Group’s accounting policies 
 
The following are the critical 
judgements and those involving 
estimations that the Directors 
have made in the process of 
applying the Group’s accounting 
policies and that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in financial statements. 
 
Revenue recognition (critical 
accounting judgement and key 
source of estimation uncertainty) 
In applying the Group’s revenue 
recognition policy, as set out in 
note 3, judgements are made in 
respect of certain areas including: 
 determination of distinct 
contract components and 
performance obligations; 
 measurement of variable 
consideration; 
 determination of fair value of 
non-cash consideration; and 
 the recognition of a 
significant financing 
component. 
Such judgments are consistently 
applied across similar contracts 
and key estimates are regularly  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)          83           
monitored throughout the 
relevant contractual periods with 
reference to the stage of 
completion and any applicable 
customer milestone acceptance. 
This is particularly relevant to the 
approach for significant 
engineering projects which 
typically contain a programme 
build phase and a long-term 
operational phase. 
 
Deferred tax (critical accounting 
judgement) 
The largest element of deferred 
tax that requires judgement 
relates to tax losses carried 
forward (see note 20). Applicable 
accounting standards permit the 
recognition of deferred tax assets 
only to the extent that future 
taxable profits will be generated 
to utilise the tax losses carried 
forward. The assessment of future 
taxable profits involves significant 
estimation uncertainty, principally 
relating to an assessment of 
management’s projections of 
future taxable income based on 
business plans and on-going tax 
planning strategies in relation to 
substantively enacted tax 
legislation.  
 
Useful lives for property, plant and 
equipment and intangibles (key 
source of estimation uncertainty) 
The assessment of the useful 
economic lives of these assets 
requires estimation. Depreciation 
or amortisation is charged to the 
income statement based upon the 
useful lives selected. This 
assessment requires estimation of 
the period over which the Group 
will derive benefit from these 
assets.  
 
The Group manages its property, 
plant and equipment on a 
portfolio basis through a central 
estates team. This team contains 
qualified surveyors who have a 
wealth of experience working for 
the Group and within the industry 
as a whole. 
 
The carrying values of intangibles 
are disclosed in note 15, and 
those for property, plant and 
equipment are disclosed in note 
16.  
 
Provisions and contingent liabilities 
(critical accounting judgement and 
key source of estimation 
uncertainty) 
As disclosed in note 26, the 
Group’s provisions principally 
relate to obligations arising from 
contractual obligations, 
restructuring and property 
remediation plans and 
decommissioning obligations. 
 
Estimates have been made in 
respect of the probable future 
obligations of the Group. These 
estimates are reviewed annually to 
reflect current economic 
conditions and strategic plans.  
 
Management exercises judgement 
in measuring the exposures to 
contingent liabilities (see note 28) 
through assessing the likelihood 
that a potential claim or liability 
will arise, and in quantifying the 
possible range of financial 
outcomes. 
 
Impairment of goodwill (critical 
accounting judgement and key 
source of estimation uncertainty) 
The carrying amount of the 
Group’s goodwill is reviewed at 
each statement of financial 
position date to determine 
whether there is any indication of 
impairment, in compliance with 
the Group’s accounting policies. 
Deciding the recoverable amount 
of a line of business to which 
goodwill is attributed involves 
management estimates. The 
recoverable amount is the higher 
of the fair value less costs to sell, 
and the value in use.  
 
The Group determines these 
values using methods based on 
discounted cash flows. These 
discounted cash flows are 
founded on five-year projections 
built on financial plans approved 
by the Board.  The cash flow 
projections take account of past 
experience, and are based on 
management’s best estimates of 
future developments based on 
contracted growth and necessary 
expenditure to maintain the assets 
required to generate that 
expected revenue.  Cash flows 
beyond the planning period are 
extrapolated using an expected 
terminal growth rate. 
The key assumptions underlying 
the changes in value in use 
involve estimates of the discount 
rate (with reference to weighted 
average costs of capital), 
projected cash flows and terminal 
growth rate. 
 
The carrying amount of goodwill at 
the statement of financial position 
date is disclosed in note 14.  
 
Actuarial assumptions used to 
determine the carrying amount of 
the Group’s defined benefit plan 
liabilities (key source of estimation 
uncertainty) 
The Group’s defined benefit plan 
liabilities are discounted at a rate 
set by reference to market yields 
at the end of the reporting period 
on high quality corporate bonds. 
Significant judgement is required 
when setting the criteria for bonds 
to be included in the population 
from which the yield curve is 
derived. The most significant 
criteria considered for the 
selection of bonds include the 
issue size of the corporate bonds, 
quality of the bonds and the 
identification of outliers which are  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
 
84          Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)           
excluded. The Group selects these 
assumptions in consultation with 
an external qualified actuary. 
Additionally, the present value of 
the scheme liabilities depend on 
such factors as the life expectancy 
of the members, the salary 
progression of our current 
employees and price inflation. 
 
Estimates are used for all of these 
factors in determining the pension 
costs and liabilities incorporated 
in our financial statements. The 
assumptions reflect historical 
experience and our judgement 
regarding future expectations. The 
value of the net pension surplus at 
30 June 2017, the key financial 
assumptions used for 
measurement, the sensitivity of 
the IAS 19 (Revised 2011) pension 
surplus at 30 June 2017 and of the 
income statement charge in the 
year then ended to changes in 
these assumptions are disclosed 
in note 30.  
 
Fair value measurements and 
valuation processes (key source of 
estimation uncertainty) 
Some of the Group's assets and 
liabilities are measured at fair 
value for financial reporting 
purposes. In estimating the fair 
value of an asset or a liability, the 
Group uses market-observable 
data to the extent it is available. 
Where Level 1 inputs are not 
available, the Group uses 
estimation techniques in 
accordance with the requirements 
of IFRS 13. This includes the 
assessment of the fair value 
adjustments with respect to credit 
risk (specifically debit valuation 
adjustments to the fair value of 
the derivative liabilities) for which 
the Group incorporates market-
observable data into its valuation 
techniques. 
Information about the valuation 
techniques and inputs used in 
determining the fair value of 
various assets and liabilities are 
disclosed in notes 14 and 25.

Segmental reporting 
Information reported to the 
Group’s Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (‘CODM’) (which is 
collectively the Group’s Board of 
Directors, including the CEO and 
CFO) for the purposes of resource 
allocation and the assessment of 
segmental performance is focused 
on the three customer-facing 
business units, supported by 
central corporate functions which 
are non-revenue generating. The 
Group’s reportable segments 
under IFRS 8 are therefore: 
 Terrestrial Broadcast; 
 Telecoms & M2M; and 
 Satellite and Media. 
 
‘Other’ segment refers to our 
corporate business unit, which is 
non-revenue generating. 
 
Information regarding the nature 
of these business units is

 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and refers to ‘earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation’ and includes add-backs for 
certain items charged to operating profit that do not reflect the underlying business performance. The table above reconciles this 
adjusted profit measure back to operating profit as presented in the income statement.

 Includes add-backs for certain profit or loss on disposal of other intangibles and property, plant and equipment and includes 
deductions for non-interest related finance costs, principally bank charges that are not considered relevant in understanding the 
underlying performance of the business.

The Group recognises exceptional items in accordance with IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ 
where material items, derived from events or transactions within the ordinary activities of the Group, require 
disclosure by virtue of their size or incidence for the financial statements to give a true and fair view. Further 
information is disclosed in note 3.

Reorganisation and severance 
expenses include costs relating to 
delivery of the Group’s FutureFit 
programme. This is a 
transformation programme that 
will help Arqiva streamline 
processes, modernise IT systems 
and achieve significant cost 
efficiencies and savings. This 
includes one-off compensation 
payments to align employee 
Terms and Conditions. 
 
Corporate finance activity costs 
relate to costs associated with the 
shareholder strategic review. 
 
Loss on disposal of subsidiary 
relates to the disposal of Arqiva 
WiFi Limited, a subsidiary 
undertaking of the Group that 
operated in non-core business 
areas, specifically certain WiFi 
contracts. 
 
In November 2016 the Group 
refinanced its £353.5m term loan 
with new debt issues that extend 
the final maturity date to 
December 2029. Accordingly 
certain swap arrangements 
relating to the former term loan 
were closed out and new swap 
arrangements were entered into 
to match the maturity profiles of 
the new debt. The Group also 
disposed of the remainder of its 
swap options (total notional 
principal of £353.2m). As a result, 
certain charges crystallised in 
respect of the de-recognition of 
these instruments at their fair 
value. See note 25 for further 
information.  
 
The expense amounts included 
within exceptional items above 
are deductible for the purpose of 
taxation. The loss on disposal of 
subsidiary (see note 29 for further 
information) is not subject to 
corporation tax as a result of the 
substantial shareholding 
exemption.

annual review (see note 23). 
 
Borrowing costs included in the cost of qualifying assets during the year arose on the general borrowing pool 
and are calculated by applying a capitalisation rate on expenditure on such assets equal to the Group’s 
effective interest rate for capital expenditure (2017: n/a; 2016: 3.0%).

UK Corporation tax is calculated at the weighted average rate of 19.75% (2016: 20.00%) of the estimated 
taxable profit for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective 
jurisdictions. 
The charge / (credit) for the year can be reconciled to the loss in the income statement as follows:

Year ended

Change in unrecognised deferred tax assets 92.4 11.7 
Impact of change in tax rate 23.0 - 
Total tax charge / (credit) for the year  0.1 (0.1) 
  
 
Expenses that are not deductible in 
determining taxable profit 
principally relate to interest 
payable on shareholder loan notes, 
less the interest from earlier 
periods on the shareholder loan 
notes which is deductible in this 
year. 
Change in unrecognised deferred 
tax assets includes the changes in 
the tax losses in the year which 
have not been recognised as a 
deferred tax asset. 
The main rate of UK corporation 
tax decreased from 20% to 19% 
during the period and a 19.75% 
blended tax rate (2016: 20.00%) 
has therefore been used for the 
reconciliation of total tax. Finance 
Act 2016 was substantively 
enacted in the period ended 30 
June 2017 and further reduced the 
main rate of corporation tax from 
19% to 17% with effect from 1 
April 2020. UK deferred tax has 
been valued at 17% (2016: 18%) as 
this is the rate at which the 
deferred tax balances are forecast 
to unwind. 
There were no amounts relating to 
tax recognised in other 
comprehensive loss.

Goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated, at 
acquisition, to the cash generating 
units (‘CGUs’) that are expected to 
benefit from that business 
combination. The CGUs that have 
associated goodwill are Terrestrial 
Broadcast, Telecoms & M2M and 
Satellite & Media. These are the 
smallest identifiable groups of 
assets that generate cash inflows 
that are largely independent of the 
cash inflows from other groups of 
assets, and to which goodwill is 
allocated.  
 
The Group disposed of £6.8m of 
goodwill in relation to its 
investment in Arqiva WiFi Limited, 
which was disposed of by the 
Group on 1 November 2016. See 
note 29 for further information.

Total  1,980.0 1,986.8 
 
 
 
The Group tests goodwill annually 
for impairment, or more frequently 
if there are indications that 
goodwill might be impaired. The 
recoverable amounts of the CGUs 
are determined from value-in-use 
calculations (‘VIU’). The key 
assumptions for the VIU 
calculations are those regarding 
the discount rates, growth rates 
and expected changes to cash 
flows during the year for which 
management has detailed plans. 
Management estimates discount 
rates using pre-tax rates that 
reflect current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the CGUs. Growth 
rates are based on internal and 
external growth forecasts. Changes 
to cash flows are based on past 
practices and expectations of 
future changes in the market.  
 
 
Projected cash flows and the 
‘recoverable amount’ 
The value in use of each CGU is 
determined from the cash flow 
forecasts derived from the most 
recent financial forecasts approved 
by the Board for the next five 
years. They reflect management’s 
expectations of revenue, EBITDA 
growth, capital expenditure and 
working capital based on past 
experience and future expectations 
of performance.  
 
Discount rate 
The pre-tax discount rate applied 
to the cash flow forecasts are 
derived using the capital asset 
pricing model for comparable 
businesses. The assumptions used 
are benchmarked to externally 
available data. The pre-tax 
discount rate used is 8.0% (2016: 
7.7%). 
 
Terminal growth rates 
The terminal growth rate is 
determined based on the long-
term growth rates of the regions in 
which the CGU operates (2017: 
1.8%; 2016: 2.1%). The growth rate 
has been benchmarked against 
externally available data. This rate 
does not exceed the average long-
term growth rate for the relevant 
markets. 
 
Sensitivities 
There is significant headroom in all 
CGUs. No reasonably possible 
change in the key assumptions 
would cause the carrying amount 
of the goodwill by CGU to exceed 
the recoverable amount based 
upon the VIU.

The Group’s current and non-
current assets have been pledged 
as security under the terms of the 
Group’s external debt facilities (see 
note 23). In addition, the Group’s 
obligations under finance leases 
(see note 24) are secured by the 
lessors’ title of the leased assets, 
which have a carrying amount of 
£5.8m (2016: £6.2m) included 
within leasehold buildings. 
 
During the year, £nil (2016: £1.7m) 
of interest was capitalised, as set 
out in note 10. The carrying value 
of capitalised interest included 
within property, plant and 
equipment was £14.8m (2016: 
£20.5m). 
 
At 30 June 2017, the Group had 
entered into contractual 
commitments for the acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment 
amounting to £49.1m (2016: 
£22.4m) – see note 28 for further 
details. 
 
Included within plant and 
equipment are 
telecommunications assets initially 
recognised on a fair value basis at 
a value of £30.9m (2016: £20.6m) 
and accumulated depreciation of 
£6.1m (2016: £3.6m). Fair value was 
determined using observable 
inputs (fair value hierarchy level 2).

Share of results of associates and joint ventures was £0.3m (2016: £0.1m) for the year with the interest in 
associates and joint ventures being £5.1m (2016: £4.8m). 
  
There are no other associates or joint ventures that are considered material, either individually or in 
aggregate, to the Group’s position or performance. 
 
The Directors consider the carrying value of the Group’s investments on an annual basis, or more frequently 
should indicators arise, and believe that the carrying values of the investments are supported by the 
underlying trade and net assets. 
 
Transactions with associates and joint ventures in the year are disclosed in note 31.

The Group’s policy is to 
recommend providing for trade 
receivables outstanding for more 
than 30 days beyond the agreed 
terms, or where the business 
environment indicates a specific 
risk. Management will make an 
assessment of the level of 
provision based on the Group 
policy. Adjustments to the 
calculated level of provision will be 
made accordingly.  
 
In determining the recoverability of 
a trade receivable the Group 
considers any change in the credit 
quality of the trade receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted 
up to the reporting date. Before 
accepting any new customer, the 
Group uses an external credit 
scoring system to assess the 
potential customer’s credit quality.

Group manages credit risk see

20 Deferred tax 
The balance of deferred tax recognised at 30 June 2017 is £nil (2016: £nil). The movement in deferred income 
tax assets and liabilities during the year, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within 
the same tax jurisdiction, is as follows:

At 30 June 2017  - - - 
  
 
Deferred tax assets are not 
recognised unless it is probable 
that there are sufficient taxable 
profits against which they will be 
realised. Due to the level of tax 
deductible interest and capital 
allowances available, the Group 
has an unrecognised deferred tax 
asset of £297.8m (2016: £205.4m). 
This is in respect of tax losses of 
£91.7m (2016: £39.9m), derivative 
financial instruments £166.3m 
(2016: £163.8m), fixed asset 
temporary differences £38.1m 
(2016: £1.7m) and other temporary 
differences £1.7m (2016: £nil). 
These deferred tax assets may be 
carried forward indefinitely. 
This value has been calculated 
based on the UK corporation tax 
rate of 17.0% (2016: 18.0%); the 
rate substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. 
No deferred tax liability is 
recognised on temporary 
differences of £nil (2016: £nil) 
relating to the unremitted earnings 
of overseas subsidiaries as the 
Group is able to control the 
timings of the reversal of these 
temporary differences and it is 
probable that they will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. 
Temporary differences arising in 
connection with interests in 
associates are insignificant. 
In the March 2016 budget, the UK 
Government announced that it 
planned to introduce new rules to 
restrict the deductibility of net 
interest costs from 1 April 2017. 
The proposed changes had not 
been substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date and therefore 
their effects are not included in the 
financial statements. However, it 
remains the UK Government’s 
stated intention that the rules will 
have retrospective effect from 1 
April 2017.  
Subject to other recognition 
criteria and based on published 
draft legislation setting out these 
new rules, it is likely that the 
overall effect of the changes, if 
they had been substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date, 
would have been to recognise 
certain additional deferred tax 
assets primarily in relation to 
financial instruments and fixed 
asset temporary differences.

 During the year the Group settled £874.5m of accrued interest in consideration for payment-in-kind of additional loan notes and has 
been reclassified as a component of non-current liabilities within shareholder loan notes.  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)          105           
The fair value of the quoted senior 
bonds based upon observable 
market prices (fair value hierarchy 
level 1) was £1,020.4m (2016: 
£996.0m) whilst their carrying 
value was £914.0m (2016: 
£914.0m).  
 
The fair value of the quoted junior 
bonds based upon observable 
market prices (fair value hierarchy 
level 1) was £640.4m (2016: 
£642.1m) whilst their carrying 
value was £600.0m (2016: 
£600.0m). 
 
The fair value of fixed rate privately 
placed senior debt determined 
from observable market prices for 
quoted instruments as a proxy 
measure (fair value hierarchy level 
2) was £476.0m (2016: £458.0m) 
whilst their carrying value was 
£438.1m (2016: £429.5m). 
 
The directors consider the fair 
value of all other un-quoted 
borrowings to be a close 
approximate to their carrying 
amount.  
 
The shareholder loan notes carry a 
fixed rate of interest ranging 
between 13.0% and 14.0% 
applicable to the capital and un-
paid interest which can be deferred 
at the option of the Group subject 
to certain conditions, qualification 
of which are subject to bi-annual 
review. The Group has exercised 
this option to defer interest 
payments since June 2009. 
 
The weighted average interest rate 
of borrowings (excluding 
shareholder interest as described 
above) is 7.94% (2016: 7.86%).

Bank loans form part of the 
Group’s senior debt. Other loans 
comprise the Group’s senior 
bonds and notes and junior 
bonds. 
 
In November 2016, the Group 
completed the refinancing of all of 
the bank facilities that were due to 
mature in 2018 namely the 
£353.5m term bank loan and 
working capital and capex 
facilities. These were replaced with 
a new bank term loan with an 
expected maturity of June 2020, a 
£218.5m sterling denominated 
floating rate amortising US private 
placement with a maturity date of 
December 2029 and new working 
capital and capital expenditure 
facilities with an expected 
maturity of March 2021. In 
addition, the Group replaced the 
existing £200m liquidity facility 
with a new £250m facility that 
supports the payment of 
scheduled interest and principal.

to a number of US private 
placement issues in both sterling 
and US dollars with fixed and 
floating interest rates. The Group  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)          107           
has £518.5m of sterling 
denominated floating rate US 
private placements that are 
amortising in nature with

margin over LIBOR of between 
210 and 220 bps. In addition, the 
Group has issued £398.5m of fixed 
rate US private placements in 
sterling and US dollar 
denominated notes. These notes 
have fixed interest rates which 
range between 4.101% and 
4.420% and have amortising 
repayment profiles commencing 
December 2018 with a final 
maturity date of June 2025. Arqiva

cover ratio and a debt leverage 
ratio, and benefit from security 
over substantially all of the 
Group’s assets under a Whole 
Business Securitisation 
structure.  The Group continues to 
comply with all covenant 
requirements. 
 
Junior bonds of £600.0m 
represent amounts raised from 
the issuance of notes by Arqiva 
Broadcast Finance Plc.  These 
notes have a fixed interest rate of 
9.5% and are repayable in March 
2020. These notes are listed on 
the Luxembourg Market and have 
interest cover and debt leverage 
covenants attached. The Group 
continues to comply with all 
covenant requirements. 
 
In December 2013, the Group 
established facilities in Arqiva 
Smart Financing Limited (a Group 
company) that support the 
Group’s smart energy metering 
contracts by financing the 
purchase of communication hubs. 
This £30m facility matures in Jun 
2028 and £0.1m was drawn at the 
end of June 2017 (June 2016: £nil). 
There is also an associated £1.6m 
fee facility that matures by June 
2019 which was £1.1m drawn as at 
June 2017 (June 2016: £0.9m). 
These loans have floating rates of 
interest with margins ranging 
from LIBOR + 1.20% to 2.50%.  
 
All shareholder loan notes are 
unsecured, are listed on the 
Channel Islands Stock Exchange, 
are repayable between March 
2021 and March 2022, and cannot 
be called upon early. The 
shareholder loan notes carry a 
fixed rate of interest ranging 
between 13% and 14% which can 
be deferred at the option of the 
Group subject to certain 
conditions, qualification of which 
are subject to bi-annual review, 
applicable to the capital and 
unpaid interest. The Group has 
exercised this option to defer 
interest payments since 2009.  
 
Furthermore, in March 2017 the 
Group settled £874.5m of the 
accrued interest in consideration 
for payment-in-kind (‘PIK’) loan 
notes. The terms of these PIK 
notes mirror the terms of the 
accrued interest, however the 
contractual maturity of these PIK 
notes reflects that of the 
underlying shareholder loan notes 
(i.e. between March 2021 and 
March 2022) and therefore have 
been presented as part of the 
non-current liability. Accordingly a 
remaining balance of £478.5m 
(2016: £1,036.5m) is held in 
relation to accrued interest. This 
treatment is consistent with the 
accounting policy adopted for 
previous transactions of this kind. 
 
There have been no breaches of 
the terms of the loan agreements 
during the current or previous 
year.

25 Financial instruments and risk management 
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to 
ensure that entities in the Group 
will be able to continue as a going 
concern while maximising the 
return to shareholders through 
the optimisation of the debt and 
equity balance.  
 
The capital structure of the Group 
consists of net debt (as set out in 
note 27; see note 21 for cash and 
cash equivalents and note 23 for 
borrowings) and equity of the 
Group (comprising issued capital 
and share premium, reserves, 
retained earnings and non-
controlling interests).  
 
Significant accounting policies 
Details of significant accounting 
policies and methods adopted 
(including criteria for recognition, 
the basis of measurement and the 
bases for recognition of income 
and expenses) for each class of 
financial asset and financial 
liability are disclosed in full in note 
3. 
 
The Group’s derivatives (i.e. 
interest rate swaps and cross-
currency swaps) are measured on 
a fair value through profit and loss 
basis. Whilst the Group’s 
derivatives act as an effective 
hedge in economic terms, hedge 
accounting principles are not 
applied. This means that the 
Group’s derivatives are recognised 
at their risk-adjusted fair value (i.e. 
risk-adjusted Mark-to-Market 
value) at the date they are entered 
into and are revalued at each 
balance sheet date, with gains and 
losses being reported separately 
in the income statement within 
‘other gains and losses’. Net 
amounts paid in the year 
(excluding termination amounts) 
on interest rate swaps (together 
with similar amounts under the 
cross currency and index linked 
swaps) are reported as a 
component of net bank and other 
loan interest within finance costs. 
 
Financial risk management  
The Group’s treasury function 
provides services to the business, 
co-ordinates access to domestic 
and international financial 
markets, monitors and manages 
the financial risks relating to the 
operations of the Group using 
financial instruments wherever it is 
appropriate to do so. The treasury 
function reports directly into the 
Chief Financial Officer and the 
Group’s Board of Directors and 
the Audit Committee, an 
independent function with a 
scope that includes monitoring 
the risks and policies 
implemented to mitigate risk 
exposures. The main risks 
addressed by financial 
instruments are interest rate risk 
and foreign currency exchange 
risk. The Group’s policies in 
respect of these risks remain 
unchanged throughout the year.  
 
The Group enters into a variety of 
derivative financial instruments to 
manage its exposure to foreign 
currency and interest rate risk, 
including: 
- Interest rate swaps, including 
inflation-linked interest rate 
swaps, to mitigate the risk of 
movement in interest rates;  
- Cross-currency swaps to 
mitigate the risk of currency 
exposures on foreign 
denominated borrowings; 
and 
- Forward foreign exchange 
contracts to manage 
exchange risks arising from 
transactional foreign 
exchange exposures. 
The Group does not enter into or 
trade financial instruments, 
including derivative financial 
instruments, for speculative 
purposes. 
 
Foreign currency risk 
management  
The Group principally operates 
from UK sites and predominantly 
in the UK market, but has some 
overseas subsidiaries and 
transactions denominated in 
foreign currencies.  While some 
customer and supplier contracts 
are denominated in other 
currencies (mainly US dollars 
(‘USD’) and Euro), the majority of 
the Group’s revenue and costs are 
Sterling based and accordingly 
exposure to foreign exchange risk 
is limited. 
 
Foreign currency exchange risk 
can be subdivided into two 
components, transactional risk 
and translation risk: 
 
Transactional risk: The Group's 
policy is to hedge material 
transactional currency exposures 
via the use of forward foreign 
exchange contracts. The 
measurement and control of this 
risk is monitored on a Group–wide 
basis. 
 
Translation risk: The Group 
translates overseas results and net 
assets in accordance with the 
accounting policy in note 3. Given 
the Group predominantly 
operates in the UK, there is a 
relatively small exposure with 
overseas entities accounting for 
only 0.2% (2016: 0.5%) of 
operating profit and 0.1% (2016: 
0.1%) of total assets for the 
Group.

The Sterling equivalents of the carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary 
assets and liabilities (excluding hedged US dollar-denominated borrowings) at the year-end were as follows: 
 
  30 June 2017 30 June 2016 
  £m £m 
   
Monetary assets:    
- US Dollar  3.3 6.9 
- Euro  10.6 11.9 
- Other (including SGD*)  0.8 0.5 
Total  14.7  19.3 
    
Monetary liabilities:    
- US Dollar  (1.1) (2.8) 
- Euro  (5.5) (10.2) 
- Other (including SGD*)  - (0.1) 
Total  (6.6) (13.1) 
  
* refers to Singapore dollar, being the most frequently transacted currency within ‘other monetary assets and liabilities’.  
 
Foreign currency denominated 
cash balances have a weighted 
average interest rate of 0.0% 
(2016: 0.0%). 
 
During the year cross currency 
swaps (nominal value USD 
358.0m) were used to fix the 
exchange rate to $1.52/£1 in 
relation to US dollar-denominated 
senior notes (nominal value USD 
358.0m). This provides an effective 
economic hedge of the foreign 
currency impact on the Sterling 
cost of future interest and capital 
repayment obligations. 
 
After taking into account our 
hedging activities, management 
does not consider there to be a 
material residual exposure to 
exchange rates. Accordingly no 
sensitivity analysis has been 
presented. 
 
Interest rate risk management 
The Group has variable rate bank 
and US private placement debt 
and uses interest rate swaps (‘IRS’) 
and inflation-linked swaps (‘ILS’) 
to hedge its exposure to rising 
interest rates.  The Group 
maintains a hedging policy to 
manage interest rate risk and to 
ensure the certainty of future 
interest cash flows.  The Group 
has fixed rate hedging, split 
between IRS and ILS. IRS convert 
variable rate interest costs to fixed 
rate interest costs while ILS 
convert fixed or variable rate 
interest costs to RPI-linked costs, 
which fluctuate in line with the RPI 
index as do a portion of the 
Group’s revenue contracts. These 
swaps are entered into on terms 
(including maturity) that mirror 
the debt instrument they hedge, 
and therefore act as an effective 
economic hedge. 
 
As the Group uses hedging to 
maintain fixed interest rates on all 
of its material borrowings 
(excluding revolving facilities), 
there is minimal exposure on the 
interest expense to interest rate 
movements. A rise or fall in 
interest rates would therefore not 
materially impact the interest 
expense payable by the Group. 
 
Liquidity risk management 
To ensure it has sufficient 
available funds for working capital 
requirements and planned 
growth, the Group maintains cash 
reserves and access to undrawn 
committed facilities to cover 
forecast requirements. The Group 
carefully manages the 
counterparty credit risk on liquid 
funds and derivative financial 
instruments with balances 
currently spread across a range of 
major financial institutions, which 
have satisfactory credit ratings 
assigned by international credit 
rating agencies.  The levels of 
credit risk are monitored through 
the Group’s ongoing risk 
management processes, which 
include a regular review of 
counterparty credit ratings.  Risk 
in this area is limited further by 
setting a maximum level and term 
for deposits with any single 
counterparty.

When debt has been refinanced 
the Group has also restructured 
the associated swaps to reflect the 
new maturity profile. 
  
Credit risk management 
The Group is exposed to credit 
risk on customer receivables, 
which is managed through credit-
checking procedures prior to 
taking on new customers and 
higher risk customers paying in 
advance of services being 
provided.  Performance is closely 
monitored to ensure agreed 
service levels are maintained, 
reducing the level of queried 
payments and mitigating the risk 
of uncollectable debts. 
 
Financial instruments 
With the exception of derivative 
financial instruments (which are 
recognised and measured at fair 
value through profit and loss) the 
Group’s financial assets and 
financial liabilities are recognised 
and measured following the loans 
and receivables recognition 
category. 
 
The weighted average interest 
rate of fixed rate financial 
liabilities at 30 June 2017 was 
6.10% (2016: 6.10%) and the 
weighted average period of 
funding was 5.9 years (2016: 6.8 
years). 
 
Within the Group’s financial 
liabilities were borrowings of 
£5,700.3m (2016: £5,392.2m) (see  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)          113           
note 23), which includes 
£1,129.5m (2016: £1,023.5m) with 
floating rate interest and the 
remainder with fixed rate interest 
(prior to the hedging 
arrangements described 
previously).  
 
The Group’s financial assets 
comprise cash and cash 
equivalents of £46.5m (2016: 
£69.5m) and loans and receivables 
of £234.6m (2016: £218.4m) as 
presented in notes 21 and 18 
respectively. 
 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group seeks to manage the 
exposures of its debt payment 
obligations through a 
combination of indexed linked, 
interest rate and cross currency 
swaps. 
 
In conjunction with the November 
2016 refinancing (see note 23), 
the Group restructured the 
derivatives held by Arqiva Senior 
Finance Limited (‘ASFL’). £353.2m 
notional value of swap options 
were fully closed out for cash 
proceeds of £3.2m and £353.2m 
of notional value of interest rate 
swaps were terminated for a cash 
payment of £163.3m. 
Simultaneously, AF1 entered into 
new interest rate swap contracts 
with a notional amount of 
£353.5m to hedge the interest 
obligations of the newly 
established bank term loan and 
US private placement notes which 
resulted in a premium of £127.2m 
being received. These 
amendments to the derivative 
portfolio resulted in a £15.4m 
exceptional loss being recognised 
in other gains and losses (see note 
11). As part of these amendments, 
the mandatory break clauses were 
removed.  
 
The above amendments were 
completed in order to comply 
with the covenants under its WBS 
platform and the Group’s overall 
strategy to ensure that a majority 
of interest exposures are hedged.  
 
At the year end, the Group held 
interest rate swaps with notional 
amounts of £1,023.5m which 
hedge the interest obligations of 
the Group’s floating rate debt. The 
average fixed rate on these 
instruments is 7.02%. The swap 
contracts have termination dates 
that match the maturities of the 
underlying floating rate debt 
instruments (see note 23).   
 
The Group has also entered into 
index linked swaps (notional 
amounts of £1,312.5m) where the 
Group receives floating and pays 
fixed interest obligations to an 
average rate of 2.939% indexed 
with RPI. The notional amounts of 
these swaps increase with RPI and 
these accretion amounts are cash 
settled annually, most recently in 
June 2017 (£53.4m). All of these 
instruments have a maturity date 
of April 2027; however £235.0m of 
these have a mandatory break 
clause in 2023. These instruments 
were established to hedge the 
Group’s fixed rate debt (namely 
fixed rate sterling bonds and the 
fixed rate US Private Placement 
issues) and in order to ensure that 
the cash flow characteristics align 
with these instruments, the Group 
has entered into £1,312.5m of 
fixed to floating rate interest rate 
swaps to match the cash flows on 
both the fixed rate debt 
instruments and the index linked 
swaps set out above.  
 
The Group also holds USD 358.0m 
of cross-currency swaps to fix the 
Sterling cost of future interest and 
capital repayment obligations 
relating to the US dollar 
denominated private placement 
issue at an exchange rate of 1.52. 
 
The fair value of the interest rate, 
inflation and cross currency swaps 
at 30 June 2017 is a liability of 
£1,179.7m (2016: £1,157.2m). This 
fair value is calculated using a 
risk-adjusted discount rate. 
 
Following their close-out in 
November 2016, the Group no 
longer holds any swap options 
(2016: £353.2m notional).

Total change in fair value (33.4) 64.0
  
 
Where possible, the Group seeks 
to match the maturity of any 
derivative contracts with that of 
debt instruments that it has 
issued. In some of the Group’s 
derivative instruments, break 
clauses have been included to 
both match underlying facility 
maturities and to optimise the 
availability and cost of hedging 
lines with the Group’s derivative 
counterparties.  
 
Fair value hierarchy 
Financial instruments that are 
measured subsequent to initial 
recognition at fair value are 
grouped into levels 1 to 3 based 
on the degree to which the fair 
value is observable: 
- Level 1 fair value 
measurements are those 
derived from quoted prices 
(unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets 
or liabilities; 
- Level 2 fair value 
measurements are those 
derived from inputs other 
than quoted prices included 
within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. 
derived from prices); and 
- Level 3 fair value 
measurements are those 
derived from valuation 
techniques that include 
inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on 
observable market data 
(unobservable inputs). 
 
Interest rate swaps, inflation rate 
swaps, swap options and cross-
currency swaps (as disclosed 
above) are all classed as level 2 on 
the fair value hierarchy. In each 
case the items are valued based 
upon discounted cash flow. Future 
cash flows are estimated based on 
forward 
(interest/inflation/exchange) rates 
observable from rates and yield 
curves at the end of the reporting 
period, and contract rates, 
discounted at a risk-adjusted rate.

26 Provisions 
 
 
The onerous contracts provision 
relates to supplier contracts where 
the costs are expected to exceed 
the benefits, and onerous lease 
contracts where the buildings are 
empty but lease costs are being 
incurred. The provision is 
expected to be utilised over the 
next five years.  
 
Provisions are made for 
decommissioning and asset at risk 
costs where the Group has an 
obligation to restore sites and the 
cost of restoration is not 
recoverable from third parties.  
The provision is in relation to 
assets of which the remaining 
useful economic life ranges up to 
18 years. 
 
The restructuring provision relates 
to the costs of exceptional

30 Retirement benefits 
Defined contribution scheme 
Arqiva Limited has operated a 
Defined Contribution Scheme 
during the year, for those 
employees who are not members 
of the Group’s Defined Benefit 
Plan. Contributions payable in 
respect of this Scheme for the 
year were £10.7m (2016: £7.0m).  
The assets of the Scheme are held 
outside of the Group.   
 
An amount of £0.7m (2016: 
£0.6m) is included in accruals 
being the outstanding 
contributions to the Defined 
Contribution Scheme. 
 
Defined benefit plan 
In the year to 30 June 2017, the 
Group operated one Defined 
Benefit Plan, sponsored by Arqiva 
Limited. The Defined Benefit Plan 
is administered by a separate 
entity that is legally separated 
from the Group, and therefore the 
Plan assets are held separately 
from those of Arqiva Limited.  The 
trustees of the Plan are required 
by law to act in the interests of 
the Plan and of all relevant 
stakeholders in the Plan. The 
trustees are responsible for the 
investment policy with regard to 
the Plan assets.   
 
The Plan typically exposes the 
Group to risks such as: investment 
risk, interest rate risk, and 
longevity risk. 
 
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability for IAS19 purposes is 
calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate 
bond yields, which is different to how the Plan assets are invested. Currently the 
Plan has a relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt instruments and 
real estate. Due to the long-term nature of the Plan liabilities, the trustees of the 
Plan consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the Plan assets should be 
invested in equity securities to leverage the expected return generated by the Plan 
assets. 
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the valuation of the Plan’s IAS19 
liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Plan’s 
corporate bond investments. 
Longevity risk 
The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability is calculated by reference to 
a best estimate of the mortality of Plan participants both during and after their 
retirement. An increase in the life expectancy of the Plan participants will increase 
the Plan’s assessed liability. 
Salary risk 
The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability is calculated by reference to 
the future salaries of Plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the Plan 
participants will increase the Plan’s liability. 
 
The Plan closed to the future 
accrual of benefits on 31 January 
2016.  The weighted average 
duration of the expected benefit 
payments from the Plan is around 
21 years. 
 
The most recent triennial actuarial 
funding valuation of the Plan 
assets and the present value of 
the defined benefit liability was 
carried out at 30 June 2014 by an 
independent firm of consulting 
actuaries.  The present value of 
the IAS19 defined benefit liability, 
and the related current service 
cost and past service cost, have 
been measured using the 
projected unit credit method 
based on roll-forward updates to 
the triennial valuation figures.

The majority of the Plan’s equity 
and debt instruments have 
quoted prices in active markets. 
 
The Plan includes holdings of gilts 
and corporate bonds, which are 
intended to partially hedge the 
financial risk from liability 
valuation movements associated 
with changes in gilt and corporate 
bond yields.  IAS19 liability 
movements from changes in the 
discount rate will also be partially 
hedged by the Plan’s corporate 
bond holding.   
 
 
 
 
No amounts within the fair value 
of the Plan assets are in respect of 
the Group’s own financial 
instruments or any property 
occupied by, or assets used by, 
the Group. 
 
Following completion of the latest 
funding valuation as at 30 June 
2014, Arqiva Limited has agreed 
to pay deficit contributions of 
£2.5m per annum to 31 July 2018, 
and then payments of £3.3m per 
annum to July 2020.  The Group 
anticipates that cash contributions 
to the defined benefit plan for the 
year ending 30 June 2018 will be 
£5.0m. 
 
Sensitivity Analysis 
The assumptions considered to be 
the most significant are the 
discount rate adopted, inflation 
represented by RPI, and the 
longevity assumptions.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017 
 
 
124          Arqiva Group Limited (company reg 05254001)           
The sensitivity of the 2017 year end results to changes in the three key assumptions is shown below: 
Funding Position Discount rate movement 
of 0.1% 
RPI movement of 0.1% Longevity assumption 
movement of +1 year 
Increase in Plan liabilities £5.1m £5.2m £7.1m 
 
The sensitivity of the 2016 year end results to changes in the three key assumptions is shown below: 
Funding Position Discount rate movement 
of  0.1% 
RPI movement of 0.1% Longevity assumption 
movement of +1 year 
Increase in Plan liabilities £4.7m £4.8m £5.6m 
 
This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it 
is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the 
assumptions may be correlated.

1 Arqiva Group Limited accounting policies and other information 
Basis of preparation

statements and associated notes, 
the term ‘Company’ refers to Arqiva

The Financial Statements of the

accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 101, 'Reduced Disclosure 
Framework' ('FRS 101'). The 
financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. The 
Group’s financial statements (Arqiva 
Group Limited and its subsidiaries) 
are available online at 
www.arqiva.com. 
 
The requirements have been 
applied in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006. As permitted by Section 
408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, 
the Company’s income statement

and under the historical cost 
convention. Accounting policies 
have been applied consistently 
throughout. 
 
New and revised Standards and 
Interpretations have been adopted 
in the current year, a list of which 
can be found in note 2 of the Group

material impact on the Company. 
The following disclosure

transactions entered into between two or more members of a Group, provided 
that any subsidiary party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member. 
  
Accounting policies 
Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries and 
associates are shown at cost less 
provision for impairment. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash includes cash at bank and in 
hand and bank deposits repayable 
on demand.

Other information 
Employees 
The Company had no employees 
during the year (2016: none).  None 
of the Directors (2016: none) were 
remunerated by the Company. Their 
individual remuneration reflects the 
services they provide to the 
Company, its subsidiaries and a 
number of other entities outside of 
the Group. It is therefore not 
possible to make an accurate 
apportionment of each Director’s 
remuneration in respect of their 
service to the Company except 
where sums are paid to third parties 
in respect of their services. There 
were no such sums paid in the year 
(2016: none). 
 
Audit fees 
The audit fee in respect of the 
Company and fees payable to 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for 
non-audit services were not specific 
to the Company and are disclosed 
in the notes to the Group financial 
statements (see note 6). 
 
Critical accounting estimates and 
judgements 
The application of these accounting 
policies did not require any critical 
judgements or any sources of 
estimation uncertainty.  Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2017
