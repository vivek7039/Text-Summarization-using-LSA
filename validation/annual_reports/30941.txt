Financial Statements Looking towards the future 
• I am pleased to report that our research, 
understanding and ambition to find more 
effective solutions to the treatment of 
cancer have moved on substantially in 2017. 
• The progress of our core clinical products, 
VAL201 and VAL401 has been substantial 
and both have reached significant value 
inflection points. The current momentum 
and exciting trajectory of both compounds 
offer potential investors an investable 
proposition and an attractive offering  
to joint venture partners.
• A particularly noteworthy achievement by 
the Company in the reporting period was 
the successful completion of the VAL401 
Phase ll clinical study in patients with late 
stage non-small cell lung cancer, the most 
common form of lung cancer.
• During the period, we saw consistent 
progress made with our VAL201 therapeutic, 
culminating in receiving approval from 
the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency and the Research Ethics 
Committee to substantially expand and 
accelerate the trial for locally advanced 
or metastatic prostate cancer. This gives 
the trial increased flexibility and speed for 
reaching therapeutic levels and to reduce 
disease progression.
• The integration of our clinical in-house 
team with a board of oncologists and 
clinical nurse specialists has been providing 
valuable insight into how we can more 
rapidly bring safe, efficacious, therapeutic 
and palliative medicines to cancer patients 
to meet hitherto unmet needs in rapidly 
growing markets.
• The Company has also progressed the pre-
clinical pipeline. The programmes currently 
consist of VAL301, which is derived from the 
formulation of VAL201 and the compound 
VAL101, which is derived from our GeneICE 
technology platform. The Company is very 
much looking forward to taking the next 
generation of therapeutics into further 
development and through to the clinic.
• VAL401 and VAL201 have received several 
major patent grants and the IP portfolio 
now covers all major areas worldwide.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
In my report for the year ended 
31 December 2016, I informed 
our shareholders that we were 
making important strides in 
growing our internal R&D 
capabilities, such that we remain 
at the forefront of personalised 
and precision medicine. 
I am pleased to report that our research, 
understanding and ambition to find more 
effective solutions to the treatment of cancer 
have moved on further since then. The 
integration of our in-house team with an 
advisory board of oncologists and clinical  
nurse specialists has been providing valuable 
insight into how we can more rapidly bring  
safe, efficacious, therapeutic and palliative 
medicines to cancer patients to meet hitherto 
unmet needs.
In 2017, we saw consistent progress made 
with our first therapeutic. VAL201 continued 
to demonstrate high safety and tolerability, 
as well as preliminary therapeutic activity 
throughout the clinical study, culminating in 
receiving approval from the UK Medicines and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and 
the Research Ethics Committee to substantially 
raise the dosing level in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic prostate cancer in 
order to reach therapeutic levels and reduce 
disease progression. This is a testament to the 
appetite for new drugs devoid of the serious side 
effects reported with current prostate cancer 
treatments, in particular complete and general 
androgen hormone deprivation. We look forward 
to reporting on the clinical trial as it progresses 
throughout this current year.
In parallel, we continued to advance the 
reformulation of VAL201 into VAL301 for the 
treatment of Endometriosis, a painful and 
debilitating gynaecological condition with high 
unmet clinical needs. We have established from 
our pre-clinical studies that VAL201’s specific 
mode of action also has the potential to provide 
a potent therapeutic effect to manage the 
symptoms of this disorder more safely than 
current treatments, which are widely known to 
cause a large number of side effects including 
loss of bone density and/or infertility. Going 
forward, the Company’s focus is to complete 
laboratory tests before progressing VAL301  
to clinical trials.
A particularly noteworthy achievement by 
the Company in the reporting period was the 
successful completion of the VAL401 Phase ll 
clinical study in patients with late stage non-
small cell lung cancer, the most common form 
of lung cancer. The data analysed by Ariana, 
a leading digital health Company, focused on 
developing advanced therapeutic decision

Financial Statements
In conclusion, I believe the Group has seen 
substantive and encouraging developments 
across its portfolio during the period to 
December 2017. The progress of our core 
clinical products, VAL201 and VAL401 has been 
substantial and both have reached significant 
value inflection points. The current momentum 
and exciting trajectory of both compounds offer 
potential investors an investable proposition and 
an attractive offering to joint venture partners. 
I would like to take this opportunity to express 
my sincere gratitude to all shareholders, fellow 
Directors, and every member of the Group for 
the trust and support accorded to the Board  
in positioning ValiRx among the frontrunners in 
the fields of personalised and precision medicine. 
Oliver de Giorgio-Miller
Chairman

support systems, has advocated the therapeutic 
potential for VAL401 as a single therapy in 
treating this cancer. Ariana has also advocated 
the compound’s therapeutic and palliative 
potential when combined with both traditional 
chemotherapies and immune-oncology 
treatments. Palliative stage patients could  
expect to see improvements in symptoms 
with the added benefit of improved survival 
prospects. The encouraging 60% overall 
response rate provides a strong foundation for 
the next stage of clinical testing. The measure 
of immune competency of the treated patients 
was also a pleasingly unexpected addition to the 
results. In sum, we are very excited to see such 
a good response rate for a condition with huge 
unmet medical need. 
Furthermore, these results came hot on the 
heels of ValiRx receiving notification that a 
further method-of-treatment patent has been 
granted by the US Patent Office covering the 
use of VAL201 in the treatment of prostate 
cancer. VAL201 now has five patents families 
in its portfolio, four of which have been fully 
granted and with one allowed. VAL201’s patent 
protection now extends across territories that 
include US, Japan, Australia, Europe and the UK, 
providing coverage in the world’s major markets.
Another important breakthrough during the 
year was the development of an optimised, 
commercially viable second generation of the 
VAL101molecule derived from our proprietary 
GeneICE platform, which has been shown 
in earlier studies to shut down rebellious 
genes causing cancer and potentially some 
neurological disorders. We can now take 
VAL101 in to late pre-clinical studies in 
preparation of the compound’s entry 
into the clinic.
Our financial results show the total 
comprehensive loss for the year ended 31 
December 2017 was £3,019,684, a decrease of 
36.40% on the previous year (2016: £4,748,003) 
and a loss per share from continuing operations 
of 1.90p (2016: Loss 8.54p). This marked reduction 
in our loss was attributable to a decrease in 
clinical trial expenditure as the manufacturing 
costs for both of the investigational medicinal 
products, VAL201 and VAL401, that were incurred 
for their respective trials, were borne during 2016.
In December 2017, we announced the final 
conversion of the CLN Agreement with Yorkville 
– thus resulting in no further obligations existing 
with Yorkville. Simultaneously, we raised £1.0m 
of gross proceeds through the issue of 23,529,412 
new ordinary shares at a price of 4.25 pence  
per share for advancing the clinical trial of 
VAL201 and for the pre-clinical progress of  
other programmes. As at year-end, the Group 
had cash and cash equivalents of £701,41  
(2016: £560,763). 
How we manage our company
The Board
At 31 December 2017, the board consisted of three executive and 
two non-executive directors, who are well respected within their 
field. The Board sets the overall direction and strategy of the Group, 
reviews scientific, operational and financial performance, and advises 
on management appointments. All key operational and investment 
decisions are subject to Board approval, with the Company Secretary 
being responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed 
and applicable rules and regulations are complied with. The Non-
Executive Chairman is responsible for overseeing the running of the 
Board, ensuring that no individual or group dominates the Board’s 
decision-making and ensuring the Non-Executive Directors are properly 
briefed on matters. The Chief Executive Officer has the responsibility for 
implementing the strategy of the Board and managing the day to day 
business activities of the Group.
All of the Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
Annual General Meeting (’AGM’) after their appointment to the Board 
and to re-election by shareholders at least once every three years.
I believe the Group has  
seen meaningful and 
encouraging developments 
across its portfolio during 
the period to December 
2017. The progress of our 
core clinical products, 
VAL201and VAL401 has 
been substantial and both 
have reached significant 
value inflection points.  
The current momentum  
and exciting trajectory of 
both compounds offer 
potential investors an 
investable proposition  
and an attractive offering  
to joint venture partners.” ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 04
HOW WE CREA TE V ALUE
Strategic Report
Our strategy 
We focus on the treatment of cancer and associated Biomarkers, 
specialising in epigenomic and genetic analysis. We will achieve our 
goals through early detection of disease and therapeutic intervention.
1
ValiRx is a clinical stage biotechnology company 
with a focus in cancer and which has three 
classes of drugs in development with a clear 
goal to address unmet needs.
Our Business Model 
The Company’s business strategy is to license or acquire technologies 
and early stage therapeutic compounds with solid scientific proofs 
of concept. The Company develops these programmes and takes 
them through pre-clinical and then the clinical phases, at which 
stage, pharmaceutical companies historically look to acquire such 
programmes and take them through their last clinical trial phases 
and to market approval. 
The pharmaceutical industry is actively looking to fill pipelines and 
increase its market penetration with novel and innovative drugs 
and therapeutics, which increasingly originate from specialised 
biotechnology companies. The directors believe that the Company’s 
development programmes are well placed to meet some of the industry 
interest in those areas in which the Company operates. The Company’s 
programmes are developed to meet clear unmet medical need in large 
and growing markets and ValiRx’s management is actively in dialogue 
with key players within the Bio/Pharmaceutical industry.
Vision
Our vision is to make a 
structural change in science.
How we will achieve
We will achieve these goals through early detection  
of disease and therapeutic intervention.
Reduce risk in 
new product 
development 
through rigorous 
clinical and 
commercial due 
diligence.
Aim
Our aim is to engineer a 
scientific breakthrough in 
human health and wellbeing.
Select drug 
candidates and 
technologies with 
evidence-based 
potential to 
address unmet 
market needs.

Develop the potential and 
Commercialise VAL201,  
the prostate cancer drug 
This drug offers a novel and exciting approach for  
targeted cancer therapy and is currently in a Phase I/II 
Clinical Trial in subjects with hormone resistant prostate 
cancer. The compound selectively halts tumour growth by 
specifically preventing the proliferation of cancerous cells, 
hence tumour growth is suppressed and metastases are 
significantly reduced. 
Development of VAL301
The Company continues with the development of VAL301, 
which is the proposed reformulation of VAL201 for a new 
indication, Endometriosis. This is a gynaecological condition, 
characterised by endometrial-like tissue found outside of 
the uterine cavity. Endometriosis is a chronic and debilitating 
condition and it represents one of the major causes of 
female infertility. Pre-clinical data suggests that VAL301 will 
provide protection from the oestrogenic effects on uterine 
tissue, whilst maintaining bone density and fertility.
Realise the value and Commercialise 
VAL 401, the lung cancer drug
The VAL401molecule is a re-formulation of a generic drug 
in an oral form, which has shown pronounced anti-cancer 
properties in pre-clinical testing. Due to the safety profile 
of the active drug, VAL401 was able to accelerate directly 
into a Phase II efficacy trial. During the reporting period, the 
Company saw the successful completion of the clinical study 
in patients with late stage non-small cell lung cancer, the 
most common form of lung cancer.
Continue promising testing  
in VAL101
ValiRx’s proprietary GeneICE technology enables selective 
silencing of overzealous, rebellious or inappropriate activity 
by specific genes, which contribute to many disease states 
including cancers and inflammatory conditions, Alzheimer’s 
and auto-immune diseases. The specially designed molecule 
mimics natural mechanisms, with one part of the molecule 
identifying and targeting the rebellious gene and the other 
part silencing it.

Financial Statements
• The VAL201 clinical trials to date have shown 
a very good safety and tolerability profile as 
well as preliminary efficacy. Based on these 
results the Company obtained MHRA and REC 
approval to substantially expand the trial and 
to raise the dosing level in patients, in order to 
accelerate the trials’ ability to reach therapeutic 
levels and to reduce disease progression. 
• The Company is developing a pipeline of future 
clinical drugs so as to ensure the maintenance 
and continuity of future value creation.  
 
Currently, the pre-clinical portfolio consists of 
VAL301, which is targeting endometriosis and 
VAL101, which is targeted at blocking those 
genes, which contribute to cancerous growth.
• During 2017, the progress of our core clinical 
products and patent portfolios have been 
substantial and all have reached significant 
value inflection points. Given the current 
trends within the industry, the Company is in 
an optimum position for having meaningful 
discussions regarding future partnering and 
collaborative deals.
• VAL301 is currently in mid-stage pre-clinical 
development as a non-invasive, effective 
treatment for the non-cancerous, but hugely 
debilitating gynaecological condition, 
Endometriosis.
• Earlier pre-clinical work on VAL201 has 
highlighted the compound’s potential to 
protect uterine tissue from the oestrogenic 
effects that give rise to Endometriosis, with 
minimal impact on bone density or fertility,  
 
 
which are major drawbacks frequently 
encountered with the current commonly  
used drugs for this condition. 
• The Group’s focus now is to complete the  
pre-clinical package so that the Company 
obtains the necessary regulatory approvals  
to enter VAL301 in a clinical trial in 2018.
• The production of positive trial data  
showed that the VAL401 treatment had a 
measurable improvement on patient quality 
of life, in addition to a positive impact on the 
disease and an extension in the overall survival 
of patients.
• The GeneICE “rebellious gene” technology 
continues to show good progress in the  
pre-clinical phase.
• The compound has been designed against a 
gene expressing Bcl-2 protein, which has been 
implicated and associated with various cancers.
• Pre-clinical work is currently being  
conducted with our partners, DKFZ,  
Heidelberg and Pharmatest in Finland  
and the compound continues to be  
tested to decide the most promising  
cancer types for further development.

Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the most common 
type of cancer in men, generally affecting 
men over the age of 50. Around 34,000 
men in the UK are diagnosed with 
prostate cancer each year. This cancer 
begins with an uncontrolled growth of 
cells and develops slowly, sometimes 
never causing a problem. However, most 
cancers will spread, in which case, 
the patient will need a treatment. 
The global market for the prostate cancer 
therapeutics market is increasing, driven 
primarily by the growth in the hormone-
refractory prostate cancer therapeutics 
markets. Hormone therapy using a 
combination of hormone therapies  
such as LHRH agonists and androgen 
receptor antagonists is a prominent 
treatment regime.

Endometriosis
Endometriosis is a gynaecological 
medical condition in which cells from 
the lining of the uterus (endometrium) 
appear and flourish outside the uterine 
cavity, most commonly on the ovaries. The 
uterine cavity is lined by endometrial cells, 
which are under the influence of female 
hormones. These endometrial-like cells in 
areas outside the uterus (Endometriosis) 
are influenced by hormonal changes and 
respond in a way that is similar to the 
cells found inside the uterus. Symptoms 
often worsen with the menstrual cycle. 
Endometriosis is excessively debilitating, 
typically seen during the reproductive 
years and represents one of the major 
causes of female infertility. 
It has been predicted that the global 
Endometriosis market will reach $1.3 
billion by 2017 and Endometriosis 
remains a common health problem 
among women, with an estimated  
170m sufferers globally. This estimate 
is widely considered to be an under 
estimation of the true situation with 
respect to this condition.

Lung Cancer
Whereas lung cancer in men peaked 
in the late 1980’s, with a rate of over 
50/100,000 men and falling by about a 
third thereafter to about 36/100,000 men, 
the rate in EU women has been growing 
over the past two decades. Causative 
factors of lung cancer include smoking, 
responsible for more than 80% of cases.
NSCLC is defined as a cancer of the lung 
which is not of the small cell carcinoma 
type. The term “non-small cell lung 
cancer” applies to the various types 
of bronchogenic carcinomas (those 
arising from the lining of the bronchi) 
accounting for 80-85% of all lung  
cancer cases. 
The Non-small Cell Lung Cancer market is 
growing - the Global market is projected 
to increase from $5.1 billion in 2013 to 
$7.9 billion in 2020 at a CAGR of 6.6%. This 
represents about 1.1m cases estimated in 
the eight largest markets.

VAL301
Our portfolio
Prostate Cancer 
The Company’s leading anti-cancer therapeutic VAL201is 
currently in clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer 
and potentially other indications of hormone induced 
cancers. The compound is targeted specifically at the Src 
kinase SH3 domain to prevent the proliferation of cancer 
cells, whilst leaving the other functions of androgen activity 
intact, including fertility and bone development. Due to its 
low toxicity profile, the compound may also have a potential 
for preventative treatment.
The Phase I/II trial has been initiated and VAL201 has been 
shown to be safe and well tolerated with preliminary signs 
of anti-cancer efficacy at the doses tested. Following these 
good results, the VAL201 clinical trial received approval 
from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory 
Agency (“MHRA”) and the Research Ethics Committee 
(“REC”) for the Company to expand the trial and substantially 
increase the dose and dosing frequency being administered 
to patients. This will allow the trial more flexibility and will 
help the treatment to more speedily reach its full therapeutic 
potential and to deliver a potential anti-cancer impact.
In pre-clinical trials, VAL201 also reduced the prostate 
cancer model’s metastatic growth by up to 50%. This has 
very important implications for prostate cancer therapeutic 
treatment and it also offers a potential treatment for other 
types of metastatic cancers.
Endometriosis
Endometriosis is a gynaecological medical condition in which 
cells from the lining of the uterus (endometrium) appear 
and flourish outside the uterine cavity lined by endometrial 
cells, which are under the influence of female hormones. 
These endometrial-like cells in areas outside the uterus 
(Endometriosis) are influenced by hormonal changes and 
respond in a way that is similar to the cells found inside the 
uterus and symptoms often worsen with the menstrual cycle.
The treatments chosen will depend on symptoms, age, 
and lifestyle plans. VAL201 has been shown though to 
reduce abnormal endometrial growth, whilst leaving other 
hormone-induced activities working normally. ValiRx’s initial 
in-vitro results show a reduction in endometrial lesion size 
directly related to dose and two generations of offspring 
produced by treated animals. This strongly suggests that 
unlike current medications in use to treat the condition,  
the peptide does not affect fertility. 
The peptide VAL301 is a reformulation of VAL201  
and is currently in pre-clinical development for the  
non-invasive and better tolerated treatment of 
Endometriosis. The Company’s focus now is to complete 
laboratory tests before progressing VAL301 to clinical trials.

VAL101
(GeneICE, VAL101)
VAL401
Lung cancer and Adenocarcinoma 
VAL401 is the reformulation of generic drug Risperidone, into 
an orally administered gelatin capsule. The re-formulation 
allows the drug to access previously unexploited anti-cancer 
activity and pre-clinical evidence suggested anti-cancer 
activity against other adenocarcinoma types. The compound 
in its new form specifically targets the energy-providing-
enzyme within the cell compartment. Since this enzyme is 
only found in cancerous cells, the compound leaves normal 
and healthy cells intact. 
 VAL401 has successfully completed its Phase II clinical study 
in patients with late stage non-small cell lung cancer, the 
most common form of lung cancer. The trial has produced 
positive data that shows that the VAL401 treatment has 
had a measurable improvement on patient quality of Life, 
in addition to a positive impact on the disease and an 
extension in the overall survival of patients.
Based on these results, the design of the protocol for a  
Phase III study is underway.
GeneICE
The GeneICE ”rebellious gene” technology continues to show 
good progress in the pre-clinical phase – the programme 
currently benefits from a second Eurostars grant for up to  
£1.6m for the further development of this technology 
platform.
GeneICE (Gene Inactivation by Chromatin Engineering) is a 
novel proprietary gene silencing platform for the efficient 
silencing of targeted genes. This technology is based on 
natural mechanisms and has the potential to halt and reverse 
tumour growth. GeneICE mimics a natural process in cells 
to silence genes. The technology acts upstream of the gene 
expression, potentially enabling a better inhibition compared 
to existing therapeutics acting at the protein or post-
transcriptional levels.
VAL101
VAL101 is a novel therapeutic based on the Company’s 
proprietary GeneICE (Gene Inactivation by chromatin 
engineering) platform. It acts to target and switch ”OFF” 
the gene that expresses Bcl-2, a protein that is implicated 
in about half of all carcinomas. Pre-clinical studies have 
established VAL101’s efficacy in prostate, ovarian and 
pancreatic cancers, and it may also have anti-tumour 
activity against orphan oncologic indications. ValiRx’s 
GeneICE technology enables the selective silencing or 
the shutting down of particular rebellious genes, thereby 
halting and reversing tumour growth.
Work to generate a commercially viable molecular 
structure for VAL101 has been completed and pre-clinical 
studies have shown that the compound reduces the Bcl-2 
expression in cancer cells. As such, ValiRx will accelerate 
VAL101’s late pre-clinical studies in preparation for the 
compound’s entry into the clinic. ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14
This excellent and very positive breakthrough 
was boosted after the period end, when further 
collected data showed that the VAL401 treatment 
has also measurable improvement on patient’s 
quality of life. Together, the results advocate the 
potential for VAL401 in treating very late stage 
cancer patients in the palliative arena. This data 
also implies the potential for VAL401, in the as 
yet untested combinations with, both traditional 
chemotherapies and immune-oncology 
treatments. Palliative stage patients could 
expect to see an improvements in symptoms 
with VAL401 treatment, together with improved 
survival prospects. The results seen in this first 
all-comer trial, provides a strong foundation for 
VAL401’s next stage of clinical testing. 
With the lung cancer market projected to be 
valued at USD 7.9 billion in 2020 at a CAGR of 
6.6%, the Company continues to be in discussion 
with a number of large pharmaceutical 
companies who are looking to fill their pipelines 
in this important unmet medical therapeutic area.
VAL201
Excellent Safety and tolerability data together 
with early efficacy data leads to enhancement of 
the VAL201 Dose Escalation Clinical Study
During 2017, the VAL201 clinical trial has 
demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerability 
profile. In addition, the treatments of patients with 
the compound showed early signs of efficacy 
with relatively low doses. Based on these results 
and in December 2017, ValiRx received MHRA 
approval for the enhancement of its VAL201 dose 
escalation and expansion clinical trial. 
The year ending in December 
2017 has been of profound 
importance to ValiRx. Not only did 
the Company see its two clinical 
compounds make exciting strides 
forward through the year, but it 
also saw those advances culminate 
towards the end of the period 
under review.
The conclusion of VAL401’s Phase II lung cancer 
clinical trial and the production of positive trial 
data showed that the VAL401 treatment has a 
measurable improvement on patient quality 
of Life, in addition to a positive impact on the 
disease and an extension in the overall survival 
of patients. 
The period also saw ValiRx’s VAL201 compound 
showing good safety, tolerability and early 
efficacy in clinical trials. Following the good 
results, VAL201’s Phase I/II prostate cancer clinical 
trial received approval from the UK Medicines and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) 
and the Research Ethics Committee (“REC”) for 
the Company to expand and substantial increase 
the dose being administered to patients. This will 
allow treatment to more speedily reach its full 
therapeutic potential and deliver its potential 
anti-cancer impact.
The Company’s preclinical developments of 
VAL301 and VAL101 are going ahead with 
exciting and encouraging results.
During the year, the Company’s patent portfolio 
has been greatly strengthened with patent grants 
for VAL401 and VAL201 in major territories. This 
expanding patent protection further supports 
the Company’s business model and gives the 
Company the basis for meaningful discussions 
with potential future partners.
These advances are of real significance for 
the Group and to patients, as ValiRx and its 
compounds become more attractive to potential 
partners and take a step forward towards 
addressing unmet need.
VAL401
Lung cancer
VAL401 is a re-formulation of existing drug 
Risperidone, into an orally administered gelatin 
capsule, showing in pre-clinical testing, anti-cancer 
properties in several oncological models. The 
period under review has been a defining period 
for VAL401’s clinical development and in Q4 
2017, ValiSeek, the joint venture between ValiRx 
and Tangent Reprofiling Limited, completed the 
Phase II trial and released pharmacokinetic data. 
Following analysis, ValiSeek announced positive 
formal data on the VAL401 compound and of its 
disease impact. The results clearly demonstrated 
that the VAL401 treatment had a statistically 
significant improvement on the overall survival of 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer compared 
to those receiving no treatment.

GeneICE
Our GeneICE "rebellious gene" editing 
technology has shown continued good progress 
in its late pre-clinical phase. With the programme 
currently benefiting from a second Eurostars 
grant totalling up to €2.6m, this programme has 
been through scientific, medical and commercial 
evaluation. Rebellious genes are the ones that 
are working when/where they should not e.g. 
in cancers, inflammatory conditions, Alzheimer’s 
and autoimmune diseases. ValiRx’s proprietary 
GeneICE technology enables the design of 
compounds for selective binding and silencing 
of these specific genes. The lead GeneICE 
lead compound has been designed against a 
gene expressing Bcl-2 protein, which has been 
implicated and associated with various cancers. 
Pre-clinical work during the period under 
review has been conducted with our partners, 
DKFZ, Heidelberg and Pharmatest in Finland, 
to generate a commercially viable molecular 
structure for VAL101. ValiRx was pleased to report 
commercially viable efficient manufacturing 
capabilities for the compounds and preliminary 
results for the optimised second generation of 
the VAL101molecule are demonstrating gene 
silencing. As such, ValiRx intends to accelerate 
VAL101’s late pre-clinical studies in preparation 
for the compound’s entry into the clinic.
Outlook 
With the extremely encouraging results from our 
portfolio development programmes, I believe we 
are in an excellent position to deliver benefits to 
patients, as well as generate value for stakeholders. 
I very much look forward to the future further 
development of ValiRx and its therapeutic assets.

This approval allows for a substantial increase 
in the amount and frequency of VAL201 being 
administered to patients, thereby allowing 
treatment to more speedily reach its full 
therapeutic potential and potential anti-cancer 
impact. This represents a pivotal and substantial 
breakthrough for the VAL201 prostate cancer 
compound and the Company expects the 
accelerated study to speed-up the human 
development of the treatment, saving both time 
and money. 
Additional Clinical Trial Centres 
To facilitate the enhancement of the VAL201 trial, 
ValiRx will continue working with UCLH and also 
with other oncology clinical sites to participate 
in this latter part of the trial. Results from this 
stage can be taken forward by the Company 
or a partner into subsequent, larger, outcomes-
oriented clinical trials. These will establish 
VAL201’s effects as an anti-cancer agent, on 
overall survival and on the health-related quality 
of life in patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer
VAL201 is a potentially major breakthrough 
therapeutic treatment of Advanced Prostate 
Cancer due to its novel mechanism of action. 
A number of studies have demonstrated that 
Src kinase complete inhibition strongly reduces 
prostate cancer growth but may have side effects. 
VAL201 specifically targets the association of 
androgen receptor with Src,SH3 domain, a signal 
that is important in tumour cell proliferation 
without suppressing other Src-AR induced 
activities. This provides an advantage to current 
therapies, which in addition to abolishing the 
division signalling pathways, potentially also 
inhibit the other Androgen Receptor (AR) 
functions including metabolism.
The readout from the first part of the Phase l/ll 
clinical trial - showed strong safety and tolerability, 
in all trial subjects. Other measurements taken 
were completely consistent and comparable 
to the results seen in the pre-clinical studies. 
Furthermore, the trial has also shown indications 
of efficacy and disease stabilisation on imaging 
and a reduction of PSA progression, in the 
majority of patients. Importantly, the Pre-clinical 
data has also shown tumour growth suppression 
and significant reduction of metastatic growth.
The VAL201 target is also associated with  
other cancers with significant potential to be 
used as a treatment for other hormone-induced 
cancers, such as breast and ovarian, pancreatic 
and others and also for the non-cancerous, but 
very debilitating condition, Endometriosis.
VAL301
Endometriosis
VAL301 is derived from our lead compound, 
VAL201 and is currently in late-stage pre-
clinical development as a non-invasive, 
effective treatment for the non-cancerous, but 
hugely debilitating gynaecological condition, 
Endometriosis. Earlier pre-clinical work on VAL201 
has highlighted the compound’s potential to 
protect women from Endometriosis, with a 
minimal impact on bone density or fertility, which 
are major drawbacks frequently encountered 
with the current commonly used drugs and 
therapies for this condition. Our focus now is to

RISKS AND UNCER T AINTIES
Risk Status Key
Risk increased
Risk unchanged
Risk decreased
Risk  Description
The success of the Group’s programmes depends upon 
the quality of the design and the implementation of each 
programme. The Group utilises a range of external scientific, 
regulatory and clinical experts to help guide its development 
programmes. The progress of the development programmes 
therefore represents the best indicator of the Group’s 
performance. Successful commercialisation of the Group’s 
products is likely to depend on successful progress through 
clinical studies, licensing and or partnering and registration. 
Development of product candidates involves a lengthy and 
complex process and products may not meet the necessary 
requirements in terms of toxicity, efficacy or safety, or the 
relevant regulators may not agree with the conclusions of the 
Group’s research and may require further testing or withhold 
approval altogether.
ValiRx has products in clinical trials and is dependent on 
successfully advancing these lead candidates. They include 
VAL201, to treat hormone induced cancers and abnormal 
growth and VAL401, a re-purposed compound to treat 
non-small cell lung cancer, through the Phase II Clinical Trial 
pathway. The business model is to ensure future partnering  
of these compounds with larger co-development partners. 
The Group has a history of operating losses which are 
anticipated to continue until the Group is able to generate 
sufficient revenues from its development programmes. 
However, the Group may need to seek further capital  
through equity or debt financings in the future and if  
this is not successful, the financial condition of the Group  
may be adversely affected.
Industry risk
Competition risk
Financial risk:  
Cash flow
The Group manages its clinical and regulatory 
risk by working closely with its external expert 
scientific, regulatory and clinical advisors 
and, where appropriate, seeking advice from 
regulatory authorities on the design of key 
development plans for its pre-clinical and 
clinical programmes.
Successful commercialisation of ValiRx’s 
products is likely to depend on its successful 
progress through clinical studies, licensing 
and/or partnering and registration. 
Competition that may lead to third parties 
discovering or developing products earlier or 
more successfully than ValiRx, may also impair 
the Company’s ability to secure funding, to 
advance its clinical trials and have a successful 
relationship with a co-development partner.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had 
sufficient cash resources to finance its 
operational activities until at least Q2 2018.

Risk  Description
The Group’s success depends, in part, on its ability to obtain 
and maintain protection for its intellectual and proprietary 
information, so that it can stop others from making, using or 
selling its inventions or proprietary rights. The Group’s patent 
applications may not be granted and its existing patent rights 
may be successfully challenged and revoked.
The drug development process is inherently risky and is 
conducted over several years and consequently is costly. 
Many drug candidates fail in development due to the clinical 
and regulatory risks, and even in those circumstances where 
drugs are sold, licensed or partnered prior to or subsequent to 
potential or actual approval, sales levels can be disappointing 
due to competition, healthcare regulation and/or intellectual 
property challenges. As a result, the returns achieved may be 
insufficient to cover the costs incurred.
The Board is committed to minimising the Group’s impact 
on the environment and ensuring compliance with 
environmental legislation. The Board considers that its 
activities have a low environmental impact. The Group strives 
to ensure that all emissions including the disposal of gaseous, 
liquid and solid waste products are controlled in accordance 
with applicable legislation and regulations. Disposal of 
hazardous waste is handled by specialist agencies.

to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union  
and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law) including FRS 102 “the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” . ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 21

Financial Statements
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and Parent Company and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. The Directors are also required to prepare financial statements in 
accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market. In preparing each of the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject  
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards, subject  
to any material departure disclosed and explained in the Parent Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue  
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available on a website. Financial statements are published 
on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which 
may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which the group’s auditors 
are unaware, and each Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the group’s auditors are aware of that information. 
Auditors
The auditors, Adler Shine LLP , will be proposed for re-appointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 
to the members of ValiRx plc
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Valirx Plc (the ’Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ’Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 on pages 26 to 54. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (’IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) including FRS 102  
“The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” . 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters that we are required to state to them in a Report of the Auditors and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for 
the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice –  
FRS 102; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards  
are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and Parent 
Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Material uncertainty relating to going concern
We draw your attention to note 2 to the financial statements, which indicates that the company is reliant on future fund raisings to continue its activities as budgeted. 
Should future fund raisings be unsuccessful this will impact to the group and company’s plans to develop its products. As stated in note 2, this condition indicates that 
a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the group and company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect 
of this matter.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the 
overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 23
Strategic Report
Governance
Financial Statements
The key audit matters identified were:
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
Area of focus
The Group has goodwill of £1.6m and intangible assets of £1.3m. 
IAS 36 requires at least annual impairment assessments in relation to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use,  
with more regular assessment should an impairment trigger be identified.
The determination of recoverable amount, being the higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal, requires judgement on the part of management in 
identifying and then estimating the recoverable amount for the relevant CGUs. 
Recoverable amounts are based on management’s view of future cash flow forecasts and external market conditions such as future pricing and the most appropriate 
discount rate. 
Management engaged an expert to assist them in performing an annual impairment assessment which included the assumptions and estimates around the success  
of the future development and commercialisation of its products VAL 201, VAL101 and VAL 401. Changes in these assumptions might give rise to a change in the 
carrying value of intangibles and goodwill.
How our audit addressed the area of focus
We obtained the report prepared by the expert and gained an understanding of the key assumptions and judgements underlying the assessment.  We assessed  
the appropriateness of the methodology applied and tested the mathematical accuracy of the models.
We obtained an understanding of the stage of product development and management’s expected timelines for product commercialisation, including updates  
on the achievement of expected milestones.
We determined the judgement made by the Directors that no impairment was required and the disclosures made in the financial statements to be reasonable.
Going concern
Area of focus
Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements for the directors’ disclosures of related accounting policies, judgements and estimates. The directors have concluded they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have sufficient cash resources and cash inflows to continue its activities for not less than twelve months from the 
date of approval of these financial statements and have  therefore prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis.
The group has cash and cash equivalents of £701,410 at 31 December 2017 but consumed cash of £3,862,083 before receipt of research and development tax credits 
of £636,738 and financing of £267,058.
Management produces a cash flow forecast based on the board plans.
The key judgment within the cash flow forecast that we particularly focused on are:
• The continued availability of funding.
• The likely recovery of €other receivables.
• Cash flows expected from research and development tax credits.
• Flexibility of development programme.
How our audit addressed the area of focus
We assessed the reasonableness and support for the judgments underpinning management’s forecast, as well as the sensitivity of projections to these judgements. 
We reviewed managements financing plans.
We considered the reasonableness of the assumptions within management’s proposed cost reduction actions.
Our conclusion on management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting is included in the going concern section of the report above. ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24
Governance
Valuation of warrants
Area of focus
The company granted warrants during the year to shareholders on a placing of ordinary shares and for services provided resulting in a charge of £158,765,  
against share premium.
Management utilised a Black Scholes option pricing model to calculate the charge which required the use of assumptions and judgements.
How our audit addressed the area of focus.
We obtained a copy of the model used to calculate the share-based payments charge.  
We reviewed the documentation in respect of the warrants.  We gained an understanding of the key assumptions and judgements underlying the model.  We assessed 
the appropriateness of the methodology applied and tested the mathematical accuracy of the models.
We considered the charge provided in the financial statements of the group and company to be reasonable.
Our application of materiality
Materiality for the group and company was £115,000 (2016: £152,000) based on an average of 5% of adjusted loss before tax and 1% of net assets (2016: based on 5% 
of adjusted loss before tax and 1% on net assets).
Loss before tax is the key metric, we believe, as it is most commonly used by the shareholders as a body in assessing the Group’s performance. In the case of Valirx, the 
value of its goodwill and assets are also key as the group is still in the development stage. We therefore considered that materiality weighted on the loss for the year but 
which also considered the net assets of the group to be reasonable.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the Group Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors, 
but does not include the financial statements and our Auditors’ report thereon. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information  
is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the  
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report  
in this regard. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Group Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• the Group Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified 
material misstatements in the Group Strategic Report or the Report of the Directors. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited  
by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
 
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as  a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group  
or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Report of the Auditors.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 December 2017
1 Statutory information
Valirx Plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985, which is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange 
Plc. The address of its registered office is 16 Upper Woburn Place, London W1H 0BS.
The registered number of the Company is 03916791.
The presentation currency of the financial statements is the Pound Sterling (£).
2 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard as adopted by the European Union 
(’IFRSs’), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (’IFRIC’) interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS.
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention or fair value where appropriate.
Going concern
The current economic environment is challenging and the Group has reported an operating loss for the year. These losses will continue in the current 
accounting year to 31 December 2018.
The company carries out regular fund-raising exercises in order that it can provide the necessary working capital for the Group.  Further funds will be 
required to finance the Group’s work programme. 
The Board expects to continue to raise additional funding as and when required to cover the Group’s development, primarily from the issue of further shares. 
Since the year-end, the Company has raised £1m, before expenses.
Should future fund raisings be lower than anticipated the Directors will reduce expenditure on the Group’s research and development programme.
Although the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future the successful completion of future fund raisings constitutes a material uncertainty that may cast doubt about the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not contain the adjustments that would result if the Company was unable to continue as a 
going concern.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries (“the Group”). Subsidiaries include all entities over 
which the Group has the power to govern financial and operating policies. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable 
or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control 
commences until the date that control ceases. Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses on income or expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
On 3 October 2006, ValiRx Bioinnovation Limited (’Bioinnovation’) acquired 60.28% of the issued share capital of ValiPharma Limited (’ValiPharma’) in 
exchange for shares in Bioinnovation. Concurrently, the Company, (“ValiRx”), acquired the entire issued share capital of Bioinnovation in a share for share 
transaction. As a result of these transactions, the former shareholders of ValiPharma became the majority shareholders in ValiRx. Accordingly, the substance 
of the transaction was that ValiPharma acquired ValiRx in a reverse acquisition. Under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” , the acquisition of ValiPharma has been 
accounted for as a reverse acquisition.
In May 2008, the Company acquired the remaining 39.72% of the issued share capital of ValiPharma, which is now wholly owned by the Group. This 
acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
In November 2013 Valiseek Limited was formed to enable the Company to enter into a joint venture agreement. The Company has a 55.5% holding in the 
issued share capital of Valiseek.
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
and contingent liabilities acquired. Identifiable assets are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those 
rights are separable. Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually, or when trigger 
events occur, for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 34

Other intangible assets
Acquired licences, trademarks and patents are capitalised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life. Patents are amortised  
over 16 years and licences over 16-20 years.
Impairment of assets
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangibles is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds  
its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation.
Depreciation is provided at the following rates per annum to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less estimated residual value, on a  
straight-line basis from the date on which they are brought into use:
Plant and machinery 33% per annum straight line
Computer equipment 33% per annum straight line
 
Financial assets
The Company classifies its financial assets in the following categories:
• financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;
• loans and receivables;
• held-to-maturity investments; and
• available-for-sale financial assets.
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The principal financial  
assets of the Company are loans and receivables, which arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade receivables)  
but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary assets. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after 
the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets.
The Group’s loans and receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts. An allowance 
is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered possible.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The Company 
considers overdrafts (repayable on demand) to be an integral part of its cash management activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents  
for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently carried at fair value 
with the changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement.
Financial liabilities
The Group does not have any financial liabilities that would be classified as fair value through the profit or loss. Therefore, all financial liabilities are classified  
as other financial liabilities as follows.
The Group’s trade and other payables are recognised at their original amount.
Convertible debt
The convertible loan is designated as “at fair value through profit or loss” and so is presented on the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with all gains 
and losses, including the write-off of transaction costs, recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The debt component of the convertible 
loan is recognised as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position net of transaction costs. The conversion option has been recognised as an embedded 
derivative and has been valued at inception and the balance sheet date using a Black-Scholes Method. The interest charge in respect of the coupon rate on 
the loan has been recognised within the underlying component of net financing costs on an accruals basis. Refer to Note 17 for further details.

Taxation
The taxation charge represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable  
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the Group financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised of the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in equity.
Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense and is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the same way unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” . Regulatory and 
other uncertainties generally mean that such criteria are not met. Where, however, the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets are capitalised and 
amortised over their useful economic lives from product launch.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than Sterling, the presentational and functional currency of the Company, are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the 
period, except for exchange differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities, which are recognised directly in equity, where the changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange 
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income  
or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.  
The Company’s ordinary and deferred shares are classified as equity instruments.
Pension contributions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the Group’s pension scheme are charged to the Income Statement  
in the period to which they relate.
Government grants 
Grants are credited to deferred revenue. Grants towards capital expenditure are released to the Income Statement over the expected useful life of the assets. 
Grants towards revenue expenditure are released to the Income Statement as the related expenditure is incurred.
Share-based payments
IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments” requires that an expense for equity instruments granted is recognised in the financial statements based on their fair values 
at the date of the grant. This expense, which is in relation to employee share options, is recognised over the vesting period of the scheme. The fair value of 
employee services is determined by reference to the fair value of the awarded grant calculated using the Black Scholes model.
At the year-end date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revisions of original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity, over the remaining vesting period. ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 36

3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although 
these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised. The material areas in which estimates and judgements are applied as follows:
Goodwill impairment
The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an 
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Directors to 
estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Share-based payments
The estimates of share-based payments costs require that management selects an appropriate valuation model and makes decisions on various inputs into 
the model, including the volatility of its own share price, the probable life of the options before exercise, and behavioural consideration of employees.
Deferred tax assets
Deferred taxation is provided for using the liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax losses where the Directors believe that it is 
probable that future profits will be relieved by the benefit of tax losses brought forward. The Board considers the likely utilisation of such losses by reviewing 
budgets and medium-term plans for each taxable entity within the Group. If the actual profits earned by the Group’s taxable entities differ from the budgets 
and forecasts used then the value of such deferred tax assets may differ from that shown in these financial statements.
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the Statement of Financial Position cannot be measured based on quoted 
prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Black-Scholes model. The inputs to these models are taken 
from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include 
considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions relating to these factors could affect the reported fair value  
of financial instruments. See Note 21 for further disclosures.

4 Turnover and loss on ordinary activities before taxation
The Directors are of the opinion that under IAS 14 – “Segmental Information” the Group operated in two primary business segments in 2016, being drug 
development and the sale of self-test drug kits. However, in 2017, it only operated in drug development. The secondary segment is geographic. The Group’s 
geographical segments are determined by location of operations. The Group’s revenues and net assets by both primary and secondary business segments 
are shown below.

9 Loss of Parent Company
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the statement of comprehensive income of the Parent Company is not presented as part of these

Discontinued operations

Basic
Weighted average number of shares    151,071,019 57,743,223
Loss per share – continuing operations    (1.90p) (8.54p)
Earnings per share – discontinued operations    N/A 0.32p
The loss and the weighted average number of shares used for calculating the diluted loss per share are identical to those for the basic loss per share.  
The outstanding share options and share warrants (note 26) would have the effect of reducing the loss per share and would therefore not be dilutive under 
IAS 33 “Earnings per Share” .

The goodwill arising on the acquisitions of ValiRx Bioinnovation Limited, ValiPharma Limited, and Valiseek Limited is not being amortised but will be 
reviewed on an annual basis for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The impairment review comprises 
a comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill with its recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). Valirx Plc has 
used the value in use method, applying a 15% discount rate.

In September 2015, the Company issued 8,161,637 new shares of 0.1p per share at a price of 30.018p per share to YA Global Master SPV Ltd (“Yorkville”) with  
a notional value of £2.45 million. On subscription, the Company received £1.45m less costs of £167,500.
At the same time, the Company entered into an equity swap agreement with Yorkville for 6,430,872 of these shares with a notional price of 15.55p per  
share i.e. £1m. Yorkville have hedged the consideration they pay for shares in the Company against the performance of the Company’s share price over  
a 12-month period.
All 8,161,637 shares were allotted with full rights on the date of the transaction.
At each swap settlement, the Company will receive greater or lower consideration calculated on pro-rata basis depending on whether the applicable Market 
Price for the previous month was greater or less than the Benchmark Price (34.21p per share).
As the amount of the consideration receivable by the Company from Yorkville will vary subject to the change in the Company’s share price and will be 
settled in the future, the receivable has been treated as a derivative financial asset and has been designated at fair value through profit or loss.
The fair value of the derivative financial assets has been determined by reference to the Company’s share price and has been estimated as follows:

Yorkville Convertible Loan Notes
On 1 September 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with YA Global Master SPV Ltd (“Yorkville”) in which it has agreed to subscribe for 
Convertible Loan Notes (“Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of up to US$3.75 million in 3 Tranches of up to US$1.25 million each. The Notes are 
unlisted, unsecured and convertible with a twelve month maturity date from the date of drawdown. Interest is accrued at 9% per annum and payable upon 
conversion, or maturity, of the Notes in United States dollars or in Ordinary Shares in the Company at Yorkville’s discretion.
Conversion terms
On 1 September 2016 and 1 December 2016, the Company issued the first two Tranches totalling US $2.50 million of Notes, before expenses.
In the 30 day period from 1 September 2016, the outstanding Notes could be converted at a price representing 130% of the closing price as of  
1 September 2016.
Thereafter, Yorkville may elect to convert varying amounts of the Notes at the lower of (1) 130% of the closing price as of 2 September 2016 and (2) a price 
represented by 95% of the average of the 5 daily Volumes Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of Yorkville’s choosing from the 15 daily VWAPs immediately 
preceding the date of the conversion notice from Yorkville.
Repayment
During the reporting period, the Company issued 83,708,122 (2016: 6,575,254) fully paid Ordinary Shares following receipt of conversion notices for the 
exercise of conversion rights in respect of US$1,553,339 (including accrued interest) of the Notes. Repayments of US$82,135, other than by conversion to 
ordinary shares also occurred.
US$400,000 of Tranche 3 was drawn-down in August 2017, and was fully repaid by early October 2017 by bank transfers. Interest of £34,466 was charged  
to the Income Statement in respect of this Tranche. The total interest charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year for all three Tranches 
was £448,408 (note 6).
Following the repayment of Tranche 3 in October 2017, both parties agreed that Tranche 3 would close, with no further drawdown being possible.
On 27 December 2017, Yorkville elected to convert all remaining US$520,000 of its CLN (plus accrued interest of US$1,666.85) from Tranche 2 into 25,222,857 
ordinary shares at a conversion price of 1.5429p per share. These shares were to be admitted to AIM on 3 January 2018. As the shares were not issued by the 
year end, the amount of the conversion, US$521,666.85, is the balance carried on the Statement of Financial Position.
Following this conversion, all amounts in respect of the CLNs will have been repaid. ValiRx plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 48

The Notes have been recognised as a liability, net of transaction costs in accordance with IAS 32 – Financial Instruments as the instrument provides an 
obligation to the Company to either settle the liability via a cash payment or via the issue of a variable number of shares. As the liability is denominated 
in US Dollars, it has been converted at the year-end exchange rate and the profit or loss arising from the conversion is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. The conversion option represents an embedded derivative, and has been valued at inception and the year-end date using the  
Black-Scholes Method, full details of which are set out below.

29 Financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises are as follows:
• derivative financial assets;
• trade and other receivables;
• cash and cash equivalents; and
• trade and other payables.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The fair value measurement of the derivative financial assets is as follows:
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

The Directors consider that the carrying value for each class of financial asset and liability, approximates to their fair value.
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks, including market risk (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group 
manages these risks through an effective risk management programme and, through this programme, the Board seeks to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance.
The Board provides written objectives, policies and procedures with regards to managing currency and interest risk exposures, liquidity and credit risk 
including guidance on the use of certain derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.  
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its receivables and its cash deposits. It is Group policy to assess the credit risk of new customers  
before entering contracts. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies.
 
Liquidity risk and interest rate risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial 
obligations as they fall due. The Board regularly receives cash flow projections for a minimum period of twelve months, together with information 
regarding cash balances monthly.
The Group is principally funded by equity and invests in short-term deposits, having access to these funds at short notice. The Group’s policy throughout  
the period has been to minimise interest rate risk by placing funds in risk free cash deposits but also to maximise the return on funds placed on deposit.
All cash deposits attract a floating rate of interest. The benchmark rate for determining interest receivable and floating rate assets is linked to the UK base rate.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has an entity which operates in Europe and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposure to the Euro, the 
functional currency of that subsidiary. The overseas subsidiary operates a separate bank account that is used solely for that subsidiary, thus managing 
the currency in that country. The Group’s net assets arising from the overseas subsidiary are exposed to currency risk resulting in gains or losses on 
retranslation into Sterling. Given the levels of materiality, the Group does not hedge its net investments in overseas operations as the cost of doing  
so is disproportionate to the exposure.  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 ValiRx plc
