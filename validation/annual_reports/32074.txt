The true value of data 
is being recognised.
Being able to visualise data isn’t enough today. Senior executives need to be 
able to look into the future. This is why business and IT leaders are actively 
searching for new technologies that deliver more insight, and faster. 
For organisations to survive, business transformation must be prioritised. With its growing capabilities, following the acquisition of Integritie 
in May 2017, Rosslyn Data Technologies is well positioned to become the go-to company for organisations seeking to accelerate business 
outcomes by creating new opportunities from data.
Welcome to the world of intelligent event-driven analytics. Rosslyn Data Technologies has built a powerful platform that provides more than just 
business insight; the data used by customers for reporting and analysis automatically informs users of what decisions must be taken next.

Our solutions are more flexible than traditional IT systems, reducing 
deployment time, requiring less storage space and having a high 
processing capacity. Both small and large enterprises are major 
adopters of cloud analytics and the Directors expect this trend 
to continue for the next few years.
The overall cloud analytics market stands with a total revenue of 
$7.5bn in 2015, and is expected to grow to $23.1bn at a compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.1% from 2015 to 2020.
The growth in data is well documented with the majority of industry 
analysts pointing towards exponential growth in consumer, M2M, 
mobile and enterprise data while industry players are basing their 
business models on 5–10x growth in volume of data over the next 
five years.
The Directors believe that the enterprise user base is increasingly 
recognising the return on investment from analysing their data.
IDC estimates that around one third of data by 2020 will 
be ‘‘useful data if tagged and analysed’’ . This equates to 
approximately 13,000 exabytes compared with total big 
data today of approximately 5,000 exabytes.
The true value of data
Embracing the concept of “Fail fast, 
succeed faster”, our award-winning 
RAPid platform empowers customers to:
A new era for Rosslyn 
Data Technologies’ 
customers and partners 
Accelerate the time to insight from months 
to days by automating data processes
Reduce IT infrastructure costs and improve 
agility by taking data into the cloud
Integrate structured and unstructured 
data quickly, without the need for coding 
or data scientists
Empower business users to improve the 
quality and relevancy of data in real time
Accelerate the development, testing and 
deployment of data analytics applications
Generate greater returns of investment 
on your existing data assets
2017 was a year of milestones including key client wins 
and partnerships. The final months also culminated in 
Rosslyn Data Technologies’ first acquisition, Integritie, 
a British software company, which completed in May 2017.
The acquisition has bolstered our capability to deliver 
more value to our loyal customers and partners by 
incorporating new technologies into our already powerful 
RAPid Cloud Platform. We also brought into the company 
outstanding talent to support our growth in the future. 
Unlike traditional business intelligence offerings, which 
limit the type and amount of data, RAPid provides a single 
destination that incorporates structured and unstructured 
data for self-service data reporting, analysis and 
management. Furthermore, leveraging the same data 
used for analytics, customers will significantly reduce 
time-consuming, manual processes by automating 
workflows on the same platform. 
Rosslyn Data Technologies is well positioned to meet the 
growing needs of executives and their teams seeking to 
effectively monetise large swathes of under-utilised data 
residing within and external to their organisations. 
Organisations are failing to address business 
issues and opportunities as decision-makers lack 
a centralised and holistic repository of relevant, 
ready-to-use information for continuous reporting 
and analysis. The acquisition of Integritie extends 
and expands our technological capabilities to meet 
the growing information needs of operational 
teams seeking to effectively obtain a complete 
view of their customers, suppliers and employees.”

STRATEGIC REPORT
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 /  05
The RAPid platform
The Group’s management team has spent over six years developing 
and commercialising its customer-centric cloud data platform, RAPid.
This is all performed over a secure 
cloud connection, giving access 
from mobile, laptop or tablet.
RAPid extracts, integrates 
and synchronises data from 
hundreds of sources.
With our acquisition of Integritie, the Directors believe that RAPid now provides unmatched capabilities that empower 
decision-makers to discover and deliver value from their structured and unstructured data. 
RAPid then transforms and enriches 
this data, providing the user with 
tools to build charts, tables and 
apps in order to visualise the 
information and deliver insights.
1 3 2 06  / Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017
Our aim now is to establish the platform as 
a significant player in cloud-based analytics, 
delivering far more than the “Spend” 
environment we have focused on for the 
last three years.”
John O’Hara, Chairman
Results
The financial year to 30 April 2017 was our 
third full year as a public company for Rosslyn 
Data Technologies plc after the listing on AIM in 
April 2014. The platform we have built over the 
last three years has received significant accolades 
this year, culminating in receiving a Microsoft 
Data Platform of the Year finalist accreditation 
in October 2016, confirming our belief that the 
progress we have made in developing a 
cloud-based solution is significant.
This year, growing both our partnerships and our 
direct sales client base has been both challenging 
and rewarding. We deployed a significant element 
of the IPO funds into our partnership, sales and 
marketing strategies, whilst ensuring we did 
not miss any developments that would enable 
the business to transform to profitability and 
organic cash generation. As previously reported, 
the progress this year was not as rapid as we 
would have liked; Brexit, the US presidential 
election and difficult trading times for some of 
our Partners and clients has led to a 
slowdown in the delivery of some larger 
contracts. Group revenue £3.6m (2016: £3.9m). 
Despite this we have been able to manage 
our cost base and we are now able to see 
a timeline when cash flow break-even and 
profitability occur; although we are not yet 
complete, we believe there is a strong chance 
of this occurring this new financial year. 
We ended the year with net cash balances 
of £0.3m (2016: £1.9m). Following the share 
placement on 15 May 2017, the Board believes 
that we have adequate cash resources to 
take the Group through to break-even and 
cash generation.
Strategy
The Group’s strategy has developed from last 
year with the appointment of Roger Bullen as 
CEO; our aim now is to establish the platform 
as a significant player in cloud-based analytics, 
delivering far more than the “Spend” environment 
we have focused on for the last three years. 
We are committed to growing revenues and 
profitability through a dual-track strategy of 
acquisition and organic growth. The acquisition 
of Integritie, now a 100% owned subsidiary 
in May 2017, demonstrates our determination 
to add new products and revenue streams to 
our platform and introduce new customers 
to the cloud.
Whilst we look at acquisition opportunities, 
to increase our scale and offering, we will also 
focus on developing the current relationships 
with our partners. We have been able to add 
more partners to our portfolio and have 
significantly expanded our relationship 
with Dun & Bradstreet, the world’s largest 
data provider. We have confidence that these 
partnerships and relationships will continue to 
grow and flourish. We are particularly excited by 
the new opportunities we are discovering with 
our partners in North America and we are 
hopeful that we can continue to expand our 
footprint in this region in the months ahead.
Our direct sales operation has delivered some 
notable wins this year, in all the regions in which 
we operate – the UK, Continental Europe and 
the US – and have managed to grow our average 
annual contract value considerably, up by more 
than 50% (£50k – £77k) since IPO. We are 
particularly excited by the new opportunities 
we are unearthing in the “highly sensitive” data 
market around the world. We will continue to 
market to this sector in the months ahead.
Our staff
Our business would be nothing without our 
innovative and hard-working staff. From the 
development team to the client support staff, 
it is an end-to-end effort. Each role is critical 
to our continued success. On behalf of the 
Board I would like to thank all of them for their 
outstanding efforts in the last year and look 
forward to working with them and the new 
enlarged team in the current year.
Outlook
The 2017–18 financial year is going to be a 
year of change within the firm. The Integritie 
acquisition has doubled the size of our business 
and will deliver a number of new opportunities 
for us. Our partnership strategy continues to 
develop and is coming to fruition in the US; 
these partnerships have the potential to deliver 
the majority of our revenue over the coming 
years. This, alongside the strengthening traction 
within our direct sales, makes this an exciting 
year for us.
Recent announcements demonstrate 
the high regard major players within the 
data and analytics industry hold Rosslyn, the 
RAPid platform and the Knowledge Capture 
environment. Converting these relationships 
into scalable revenue streams is key for our 
growth and our future. I am optimistic that 
recent product launches and the innovation 
we continue to deliver will drive the results the 
Company and our shareholders deserve.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT STRATEGIC REPORT
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 /  07
Since the year end we have completed our 
strategic investment in Integritie (UK) Limited 
and raised additional cash to enable us to take 
the Company through to positive EBITDA.”
Roger Bullen, Chief Executive Officer
Strategy
This year we continued to focus on implementing 
our strategic plan, broadening our appeal to 
organisations hungry for data analytics, broader 
data insights and increasing the number of 
strategic partners. In addition, this year we also 
included looking into a “buy and build” strategy 
to identify new and alternative technologies that 
were available in the market for managing and 
handling complex unstructured data solutions 
to sit alongside our structured data capabilities.
During the year we made new investments 
in developing our product suite on the RAPid 
platform, adding new tools and functionality 
to the mix whilst ensuring the RAPid platform is 
scalable and user friendly and provides a satisfying 
user experience for our partners and clients. 
We also invested funds in the development of 
an HR analytics product suite utilising the core 
technologies from our other applications and 
demonstrating the versatility of the platform.
We continued to focus the funds raised at IPO 
to increase our sales capabilities. Recruitment 
of quality people with the requisite knowledge 
and experience continues to be a challenge, 
but we have maintained our sales headcount 
levels through the year, and where possible will 
continue to add to the sales and partnership 
business development teams necessary to fulfil 
the Company’s growth ambitions. As an offset, 
we have been able to reduce the development 
and administration overhead which has led to 
an overall decrease in the number of employees 
compared to previous years.
This year we struggled to deliver revenue 
growth; this was predominantly caused 
through a decrease in our partner revenues as 
our key strategic partner in the US completed 
a business transformation, reducing our 
revenues considerably over the year. In addition, 
we suffered a number of smaller partners 
in Europe closing their business or failing. 
Whilst the majority of revenues came from 
our direct sales team, we are starting to build 
considerable traction through our partnership 
strategy introduced last year, particularly in 
the US. We have developed a number of new 
partnership agreements and continue to roll 
this programme out around the globe. The 
Board has not wavered on the belief that this 
strategic diversification of the revenue stream 
is important to attaining our targets and will 
enable us to accelerate our route to market. 
In addition to these activities, prior to the year 
end, we announced our intention to purchase 
100% of the share capital of Integritie (UK) Limited 
This transaction completed on 16 May 2017 
and provides the Company with the opportunity 
to deliver a total data solution to our clients 
and partners.
Outlook
Since the year end we have completed our 
strategic investment in Integritie (UK) Limited 
and raised additional cash to enable us to take 
the Company through to positive EBITDA. 
We continue to make investments in growing 
the RAPid platform capabilities, including the 
onboarding of the Integritie suite of products 
(Knowledge Capture), enabling us to transform 
a number of on-premise solutions for those 
clients who are now wishing to move towards 
a cloud environment. 
Our new products, although beyond our 
traditional spend and procurement environment, 
sit alongside the RAPid offering and enable clients 
to achieve a more holistic view of their enterprise 
data and also to tie many document and ERP 
formats together. Whilst spend continues to be 
the backbone of our revenue streams we are 
seeing developments in the market that enable 
us to expand our offerings to include services 
covering compliance, complaints, workflow 
management, risk, corporate social responsibility 
and people. We are excited about the new 
opportunities these products and the acquisition 
offer to our current sales channel, our clients 
and our partners’ clients. 
Our deepening relationship with Microsoft 
ensures that our product remains at the cutting 
edge of technological development, enabling 
scale and efficiencies to be achieved at the best 
possible cost. Microsoft recognised the RAPid 
platform as one of the top cloud-based platform 
products in October 2016 and also recognised 
Rosslyn as a preferred partner, issuing us with 
their “Co-Sell Recommended Partner” status, 
a significant achievement for us.
In addition we have signed a number of new 
contracts. Notable amongst this new business 
are the contracts with major global businesses 
both in the US and Europe, which have brought 
a highly diversified client base and provide us 
with excellent opportunities to demonstrate 
the value of the RAPid platform to our partners 
and clients. I look forward with confidence 
to the 2017–18 financial year. 
We are seeing the benefits from the investments 
that we have made and the product suite is 
becoming extremely well known and competitive 
in the market. I would like to join John O’Hara 
in thanking our employees, without whom 
none of this would be possible.

BUSINESS MODEL
Providing tools for business 
users to control their data.
With the proliferation of business intelligence and analytics tools, trusted data 
for visualisation and analysis is paramount. These conditions allow Rosslyn Data 
Technologies to serve an unmet market by providing the necessary tools for 
business users to be in control of the data they require for making rapid and 
timely decisions without relying on traditional tools built for technical 
professionals, such as IT and expensive data scientists.

RAPid Cloud 
Analytics Program
The RAPid platform provides 
unparalleled self-service tools for 
decision-makers to effectively obtain, 
improve and manage data. 
Our RAPid Cloud Platform features a 
comprehensive suite of self-service tools 
business users need to automatically extract, 
integrate, load, transform and enrich data. 
The largest organisations in the world have 
modernised or are modernising their data 
analytic capabilities, replacing their 
traditional processes with 
Rosslyn’s capabilities. 
The data technologies we have developed 
are recognised for significantly reducing the 
time and cost of obtaining and preparing 
data for analytics and insight – on occasion 
reducing ROIs from months to hours. By 
integrating the capabilities acquired from 
Integritie into the Rosslyn product suite, 
we are now able to fully manage a client’s 
complete data ecosystem. 
The true differentiators for the RAPid platform 
are the automated workflows and business 
processes that allow Rosslyn to provide more 
than just insight; the data used for reporting 
and analysis automatically informs users of 
what decisions must be taken next.  STRATEGIC REPORT
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 /  09
Designed for the millions of non-technical users, Rosslyn’s product suite 
is used by our customers and partners to monetise their data, gain greater 
business insight, improve reporting times and drive efficiency savings. Our 
products are delivered into the market through our direct sales team and 
through our growing global ecosystem of partners, first launched in 2015. 
Our partner programme enables us to 
acquire clients quickly, and profitably 
(without increasing headcount), by giving 
the professional services firms, management 
consultancies, business process outsourcers 
and system integrators the software they 
require to support the data and analytic 
needs of their consultants and clients. 
Just like our direct sales team, which is based 
on a “land and expand” strategy, partners are 
able to up- and cross-sell new data services, 
which increases the total revenue 
per customer.  10  / Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017
Pursuing our 
growth strategy.
The Directors believe the Group is well positioned 
to pursue the growth through six strategic initiatives:
Strategy Description and achievements Next steps
New customer 
acquisitions in 
existing markets
The Group has diversified the product offering and 
begun increasing the sales force in order to acquire 
new customers and will continue to cross-sell within 
the current client base. With the development of new 
data sets becoming available from clients, partners 
and third parties this trend will continue.
Building on its reputation with 
existing customers, the Group plans 
to follow a more aggressive sales 
and marketing strategy through an 
increased sales force and enhanced 
branding within the geographies and 
industries in which it currently operates.
New product 
acquisitions in 
existing markets
With the Group reputation for innovation and our 
world-leading cloud-based platform, the Group 
plans to follow a more aggressive strategy through 
the acquisition of products and/or businesses that 
can benefit from the platform’s capabilities.
The acquisition of Integritie is a first 
step in improving the product suite 
whilst providing focus on our existing 
markets. The Group will continue to 
look for new opportunities and new 
products that meet the evolving 
market demands.
Growth within 
the existing 
client base
Typical customer engagements for the Group start in 
one division of a client organisation, thereby enabling 
the Group to leverage this reference point into other 
departments and work streams in large multinationals. 
The Group has a ‘‘land and expand’’ strategy to win 
initial projects and grow the number of contracts 
for each customer.
Following the acquisition we 
are well positioned to move into 
marketing, finance and other 
functional areas within both 
Integritie and Rosslyn customers.
Product 
development
The Directors intend to develop the Group’s existing 
technologies by focusing on scalability, repeatability, 
self-service, integration, cleansing and data enrichment.
Products will continue to evolve 
and advance. Social media and 
unstructured data sets are now often 
used for sharing business information. 
Rosslyn’s product suite will be at the 
forefront to ensure we are delivering 
the client and market needs.
Partnerships
The Directors believe that a broad-based set of 
strategic partnerships provides a diversified route to 
market. These partnership arrangements allow revenue 
to grow more quickly than through direct sales alone.
Our partnerships are structured in a 
way to provide strategic growth for 
our key products. This will continue to 
be the case as we move towards our 
partners being the major part of our 
reseller initiatives in overseas markets.
Geographic 
expansion
The Group intends to expand into further 
geographies by adding further customers 
and partners in different territories.
Partnerships are already 
being planned in mainland and 
northern Europe, whilst our US 
footprint is nearly all partner led.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Our performance indicators reflect the 
tough trading conditions some of our 
clients and partners have experienced, 
balanced by our continued tight 
financial control.
Partnering with 
Dun & Bradstreet 
to deliver faster 
speed to insight
Continuing our focus on ensuring business leaders have 
timely access to mission-critical data to make informed 
decisions, this year saw Rosslyn Data Technologies and 
Dun & Bradstreet announce a partnership to provide 
procurement professionals with self-service insights. 
The joint offering, available now, uses the RAPid 
cloud-based platform self-service model to integrate 
global business data to help procurement professionals 
better identify and manage ever-changing business risks 
and market opportunities. The solution aims to help 
organisations find greater savings faster and gain deeper 
insights into their supply base.
Dun & Bradstreet maintains the world’s largest 
commercial database – approximately 265 million 
business records. With this partnership, Rosslyn Data 
Technologies is addressing a gap in the market by giving 
companies self-service tools to access, manage and 
create unique proprietary business insights previously 
unavailable with traditional, IT-centric technologies.

Description Mitigation Change Risk
The Group is involved in the provision 
of software services. The software industry 
is in the process of continuous change and 
development, reflecting technical developments 
and changing customer requirements. 
These changes may adversely impact the 
Group’s prospects.
The Group continues to invest significant 
resources in research and development into 
the RAPid platform. The Board believes that 
constantly evolving the product offering best 
protects the Group against technological change.
Technical change
The Group’s reliance on certain key systems 
and technologies for its continuing operations 
exposes the Group to significant risk as the 
systems are vulnerable to interruption and 
damage. The interruption and damage of the 
Group’s systems may be due to events beyond 
the control of the Group; these events include, 
but are not limited to, natural disasters, 
telecommunications failures, power losses, 
computer viruses and terrorist attacks. 
Downtime arising from such events may 
have a material detrimental effect upon the 
Group’s performance and profitability.
The Group maintains disaster recovery plans. 
These are designed to allow the business to 
function properly against many foreseeable 
events. However, certain events are beyond 
the management’s ability to build cost-
effective solutions. Acts of terrorism and total 
loss of the internet fall into these categories. 
Management recognises the Group’s exposure 
to key systems and seeks to minimise its risk 
on a cost-realistic basis.
Reliance on 
key systems
The Group invests in functions and processes 
to service customers in an appropriate manner, 
with a view to achieving high customer retention 
rates. The anticipated rapid expansion of the 
Group may place strains upon these functions 
and processes. There can be no guarantee 
that the Group will be able to achieve 100% 
retention rates.
The Board recognises that customer care 
is a very important attribute to business 
in the service sector. Clients are supported 
by the customer support team. The Board 
regards customer satisfaction and low churn 
as important signals. Nevertheless some client 
turnover can be expected for reasons which do 
not necessarily reflect poor service. Change of 
control of a customer, as an example, may 
give rise to different supplier choices.
Customer risk
KEY RISKS
The Group’s future success depends on 
its senior management, senior sales and 
marketing executives and key technical 
staff. The Group has entered into contractual 
agreements with these staff members but 
their continued employment cannot be 
guaranteed. Failure to retain these staff 
members may adversely affect the performance 
and profitability of the Group. It is possible 
that key staff members may join competitors 
or establish competitor businesses in their 
own right.
The Group continues to invest in improving 
HR in order to ensure good recruitment and 
onboarding of new employees. Training is 
provided as needed within the Group to allow 
employees to develop the necessary skills 
for their changing roles. Share options are 
available to incentivise key staff.
Dependence on 
key executives and 
technical personnel STRATEGIC REPORT
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 /  13
The Group supplies sophisticated and 
complex computer software to its customers. 
These products when first introduced, or 
enhanced, may contain undetected defects 
that may fail to meet customers’ performance 
expectations or requirements. Such failures 
may damage the Group’s reputation and lead 
to an adverse effect on the Group’s business 
and financial performance.
Products and new releases are rolled out 
to the market, after extensive internal testing, 
in a progressive manner. The Group seeks to 
release fully functional products but the nature 
of software includes a risk of unidentified bugs 
existing in the system. The Group is capable 
of rolling back to previous versions of software 
if absolutely necessary.
Product risk
The sector in which the Group operates is 
competitive and there can be no certainty that 
the Group will be able to achieve the market 
penetration it seeks. There can be no guarantee 
that Group’s current competitors or new 
entrants to the market will not bring superior 
technologies, products or services to the market. 
The possibility of similar products and services 
at a lower price may also be offered to the 
market. Any of these events may have an 
adverse effect on the Group.
The Group sees a competitive market 
environment as an opportunity as much 
as a threat. Investment in people, systems 
and products represents the best defence 
in a competitive marketplace and the Board 
continues to invest in all these areas.
Competition risk
Description Mitigation Change Risk
The Group operates in the UK, Continental 
Europe and the US and is therefore exposed 
to foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange risk 
arises on sales and purchases made in foreign 
currencies and on recognised assets and 
liabilities in foreign operations.
The Group incurs costs in US dollars which offset 
US dollar revenues. This minimises the revenue 
account impact. The Group generates euro 
revenues with minimal euro costs. Euro balances 
are converted to functional currencies, as 
required, on a regular basis to avoid adverse 
currency impacts.
Currency 
and foreign 
exchange risk
The Group may be adversely impacted 
by developments in the political, economic 
and regulatory environment in which the 
Group operates. Such risks include, but are 
not limited to, expropriation, nationalisation, 
inflation, deflation, changes in interest rates, 
changes in tax rates and regimes and currency 
exchange controls.
A general deterioration in the economic 
climate in any of the markets in which the 
Group operates may impact the demand for 
the Group’s products and services. Such changes 
in demand may cause an adverse impact on the 
Group’s performance. It is not always possible 
to foresee the impact of legislative or regulatory 
change. These changes may also have an adverse 
impact on the Group’s financial performance.
The Group operates in a diverse range 
of markets, which offers some regional 
diversification but many macroeconomic 
factors and legislative events are beyond 
the control of the Board.

The reduction in revenue was a reflection on the difficult 
trading times for some of our clients and partners, who 
slowed down the progress of large projects, together 
with increasing the length of decision-making time 
before signing up to new contracts. ”
Roger Bullen, Chief Executive Officer
Revenue
Group revenues decreased by 7% to £3,588,741 
(2016: £3,869,050). First half revenues were 
£1,666,577 (2016: £1,821,517), a decrease 
of 8.5%, while second half revenues were 
£1,922,164 (2016: £2,047,533), a decrease 
of 6.1%. The reduction in revenue was a 
reflection on the difficult trading times for 
some of our clients and partners, who slowed 
down the progress of large projects, together 
with increasing the length of decision-making 
time before signing up to new contracts. 
On a regional basis the UK revenues reduced 
by 7.6% to £2,654,719 (2016: £2,871,671). 
Client wins in the year included spend 
analytics for a major logistics company and 
a data reporting solution for a financial 
services company, which was our first inroad 
into the financial services market. Our partner 
programme did not expand at the rate we had 
anticipated; however, our relationships with 
our partners deepened, which we anticipate 
will deliver growth in the coming year. The churn 
rate remains at a modest level as the majority 
of our clients continue to renew their contracts. 
The US revenues reduced by 6.4% to £934,022 
(2016: £997,379) and continued to represent 
26% of Group revenues. Client wins in the year 
included spend analytics for a global media 
company. One of our strategic partners 
completed a business transformation, which 
resulted in a significant reduction in our revenues 
over the year. We anticipate the strengthening 
of our global relationship with Dun & Bradstreet 
will deliver growth in the coming year.
Gross margin
The gross margin percentage decreased by 6.5% 
to 81.8% from 87.6% in 2016. This reduction 
reflects the increasing costs of the Azure Cloud 
to deliver the performance of the platform our 
clients expect.
EBITDA
The EBITDA loss decreased by 17% to £1,939,293 
(2016: £2,330,605). The investment of the IPO 
proceeds continued to target the sales and 
marketing effort and we were able to maintain 
the sales team headcount. Following the 
investment in the RAPid platform in the previous 
financial year, we were able to reduce headcount 
in the development team. We also continued 
to reduce our administration overheads.
Other income
The Group did not receive any R&D grant income 
in the year (2016: £48,535). This income is 
incremental to the tax credits receivable under 
corporation tax. The Board will submit future 
grant applications where it sees an appropriate 
benefit. In virtually all cases these grants are 
competitive and no guarantee can be made 
as to the likely success of such applications.
Loss before income tax
The loss before income tax for the year was 
£1,963,057 (2016: £2,374,821), which was a 
decrease of 17%. This trend was anticipated 
and delivered through tight financial and 
operational management.
The payback from investing funds into the 
business takes time and management expects 
this payback to continue into the current year, 
and beyond, as the investment into sales, 
marketing and product innovation bears fruit. 
The investment into product development will 
yield market-ready services to drive further 
revenue growth; payback here will take longer 
but should drive incremental returns.

FINANCIAL REVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT

Cash flow and funds
The Group ended the year with cash balances of 
£284,833 (2016: £1,858,841). Total cash utilisation 
in the year was £1,574,008 (2016: £2,853,889). 
Trade and other receivables decreased in the 
year, which was a reflection of the revenue 
reduction offset in part by the increased ageing 
of some trade receivables. Considerable effort 
continues to be made to reduce the ageing 
of our trade receivables.
At the year end deferred revenue was £526,430 
(2016: £469,732). This represents an increase 
of 12%. The main changes in the year relate 
to the timing of new client wins; we continue 
to see more of our clients paying quarterly 
rather than annually in advance.
Investment into fixed assets in the year 
to 30 April 2017 was £20,653 (2016: £8,622). 
No significant investment was required in 
the year, due to the investment made in the 
previous years in technology.

Rosslyn brings together 
HR leaders to advance 
the profession – and 
the adoption of 
data analytics 
We have entered a transformative time for the HR 
profession. New technologies, processes and best 
practices are being developed to aid decision-makers 
in leveraging data to better understand and support 
the advancement of employees. 
Despite the growing enthusiasm for people analytics, 
many organisations are still struggling to conduct 
like-for-like reporting because there is a lack of 
standardised metrics used by the HR profession. 
Since January 2017, Rosslyn has been facilitating a 
series of workshops to address this challenge. We’re 
helping HR professionals to develop new standards 
so organisations, across industries, can effectively 
assess, value and benchmark employee performance 
and their important contribution to business success. 
To ensure that these workshops deliver what the 
HR profession needs for the future, we have enlisted 
participation from more than 40 private and public 
sector organisations including Capgemini, Coca-Cola 
Enterprises, Deloitte, EDF, HSBC, Jaguar Land Rover, 
KPMG, Rolls-Royce, Royal Bank of Scotland, Sainsbury’s, 
Sky and the Home Office. 
Through this important ongoing work, we will 
collaboratively deliver a user-driven, user-accepted 
and user-maintained analytics asset to support 
HR leaders make the right decisions for their people.
The workshops brought together recognised 
thought leaders across a range of different 
sectors to collaborate on something which 
has been causing problems for people 
analytics leaders and HR for years – creating 
a standardised reporting taxonomy.”

by 30 April 2018, based on projections prepared.
Based on this assessment the Directors believe

Employees
It is the Group’s policy to involve employees 
in its progress, development and performance. 
During the year a series of briefings took place 
to keep employees informed of developments, 
financial performance and technical changes. 
The Group is committed to ensuring that equal 
opportunities are accorded to all its employees 
irrespective of age, gender and nationality 
in respect of training, career development 
and advancement.

shares were issued at a price of £0.045 per share. 
On 16 May the Group acquired 100% of the 
share capital of Integritie (UK) Limited, an 
on-premise data mining company registered 
in England. This is described in more detail 
in note 21 to the financial statements.
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety 
of financial risks: market risk (primarily foreign 
exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk 
and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk

unpredictability of markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’ s 
financial performance. Risk management is 
carried out by the Board and its policies are 
outlined in note 19 to the financial statements.

amount invoiced to the Group by its suppliers 
during the year ended 30 April 2017 and the 
amount owed to its trade creditors at

that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware, and each Director has 
taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.

of Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditor 
of the Company is to be proposed at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
in preparation of the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
annual report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, 
and the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group 
for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Group and parent 
company financial statements 
respectively; and
• prepare the financial statements 
on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. GOVERNANCE
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 /  21
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
As an AIM listed company, Rosslyn Data 
Technologies plc is not required to comply 
and does not comply with the full UK 
Corporate Governance Code, but the Board 
believes that compliance with the highest 
standards of corporate governance is very 
important. It has adopted many of the best 
practices set out in the Corporate Governance 
Guidelines issued by the Quoted Companies 
Alliance, an alternative governance code 
particularly aimed at smaller quoted entities.
Board of Directors and Board Committees
At the end of the financial year the Board 
of Directors consisted of three Executive 
and three Non-Executive Directors. The Board 
believes this to be an appropriate mix of skills 
and roles to act in the best interests 
of shareholders and stakeholders. 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer are separate. The Chairman leads 
Board meetings and Board discussions 
and has responsibility for the Board’s overall 
effectiveness. The Chief Executive Officer is 
responsible for the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic and commercial objectives, within 
the context of the Group’s resources and the 
risk tolerances laid down by the Board.
Barney Quinn is the senior independent 
Non-Executive Director and chairs each 
of the Board’s Committees. The Chairman, 
John O’Hara, is a member of each of the 
Board Committees. Ed Stacey, a Non-Executive 
Director, is employed by IQ Capital LLP , a 
connected company of IQ Capital Fund LLP , 
the Group’s largest shareholder.
The Board is responsible to shareholders 
and provides leadership and direction to 
the Group. 
It is the role of the Board to set the strategic 
direction and goals of the Group within the 
risk tolerances and control mechanisms the 
Board believes are appropriate. The Board has 
a list of matters reserved for its consideration 
which include, but are not limited to, matters 
of strategy, risk management, consideration 
and approval of financial budgets, major 
capital expenditure decisions, acquisitions 
and disposals, approval of the interim and 
final results and the recommendation of any 
dividends. The Board has three Committees, 
each with defined terms of reference. They are 
the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nomination Committee.
The Board meets on a regular basis. During the 
year from 1 May 2016, the Board met eleven 
times. In addition the Board Committees met a 
number of times. T able 1 shows the attendance 
of the relevant Directors at these meetings.
Formal agendas and briefings are prepared 
for Board meetings, allowing all Directors to 
participate fully in the meetings. The Directors 
all have access to independent advice, if required, 
in respect of their duties from a variety of 
professional advisers. The Company maintains 
an appropriate directors’ and officers’ insurance 
policy in respect of legal actions against the 
Directors or officers.
The performance of the Board is assessed 
by the Chairman, in conjunction with the 
Nomination Committee. This assessment 
includes, but is not limited to, the appropriate 
level of skill of Board members, the conduct 
of Board meetings, the decision-making 
process and the effectiveness of the various 
Board Committees.

Board Committees continued
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Barney 
Quinn. John O’Hara is the other permanent 
member of the Committee, which co-opts 
other Directors and senior employees as 
necessary into its deliberations. The Committee 
is expected to meet at least twice a year. 
The main responsibilities of the Audit Committee 
are monitoring the integrity of the Company’s 
financial systems and statements; reviewing 
significant reporting issues; and reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
control and risk management systems.
The Committee is also responsible for 
overseeing the relationship with the external 
auditor (including advising on its appointment, 
agreeing the scope of the audit and reviewing 
the audit findings). The Committee meets 
with the external auditor, without the 
Chief Financial Officer, at least once a year.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired 
by Barney Quinn. John O’Hara is the second 
permanent member of this Committee. 
Other Directors are co-opted on to the 
Committee on an ad hoc basis. The Committee 
is expected to meet at least twice a year.
The responsibilities of the Committee 
include determining the remuneration 
of the Chairman, the Executive Directors 
and other Senior Executives. As part of this 
role the Committee is responsible for setting 
the framework for any bonus, incentive or share

The merger reserve arises from the Group reorganisation that occurred on 23 April 2014. Rosslyn Data Technologies plc acquired Rosslyn Analytics Ltd 
in a share for share transaction. There was no change in rights or proportions of control in the Group as a result of this transaction. As common control 
exists IFRS 3 was deemed to not apply and this has been accounted for as a capital reorganisation. The difference between the share capital and share 
premium of the Company and the share capital and share premium of Rosslyn Analytics Ltd at 23 April 2014 is recognised in the merger reserve.
The translation reserve comprises translation differences arising from the translation of financial statements of the Group’s foreign entities 
(Rosslyn Analytics, Inc.) into sterling (£). 
The accumulated loss reserve includes all current and prior period retained profits and losses.
The share-based payment reserve comprises the fair value of options granted under the Group’s Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme, less

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
for the year ended 30 April 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 /  29 1. General information
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the UK. The address of the registered office is Fox Court, 14 Gray’s Inn Road, 
London WC1X 8HN. The Company is the ultimate parent company of Rosslyn Analytics Ltd, a company incorporated in the UK, and the ultimate parent 
company of Rosslyn Analytics, Inc., a company incorporated in the United States of America (collectively, the “Group”). The Group’s principal activity 
is the provision of data analytics using a proprietary form.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial information are set out below. The policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented.
2. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (as adopted by the EU) and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Going concern
Notwithstanding that the Group has made losses in the current year, these financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, 
which assumes that the Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future. Following the placement 
of 111,142,031 ordinary £0.005 shares at the price of £0.045 on 15 May 2017, the Directors believe that the Group has sufficient working capital 
to meet its present requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of this consolidated financial information. The Directors have 
prepared cash flow statements for the period to 30 April 2025 to ensure going concern criteria are met.
Basis of consolidation
On 23 April 2014 the Company acquired the Group’s previous parent company, Rosslyn Analytics Ltd, via a share for share exchange whereby every 
ordinary share and A preference share in Rosslyn Analytics Ltd was exchanged for eight ordinary shares and eight A preference shares respectively 
in Rosslyn Data Technologies Ltd (prior to the conversion to a plc on 24 April 2014). On 24 April 2014 the A preference shares were converted into 
ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis.
On 29 April 2014, Rosslyn Data Technologies plc’s shares were admitted to trading on AIM. 
Accordingly these financial statements are presented in the name of the new legal parent, Rosslyn Data Technologies plc, but are a continuation 
of the financial statements of Rosslyn Analytics Ltd.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable 
or convertible are taken into account. Control is generally accompanied by a shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights. The financial 
information of subsidiaries is included in the consolidated financial information from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances, and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated financial information. 
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires the 
use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
On an ongoing basis the following areas involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity:
• revenue recognition estimates/judgements;
• valuation of share-based payments; and
• recognition of deferred tax assets.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts for services provided to third parties in the 
normal course of business during the year, net of value-added tax, and results from the principal activities of the Group.
Each element of revenue (described below) is recognised only when:
• provision of the services has occurred;
• the consideration receivable is fixed or determinable; and
• collection of the amount due from the customer is reasonably assured.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the year ended 30 April 2017
30  / Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 2. Accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition continued
(i)  Implementation and set-up fees in connection with the deployment and customisation of the Group’s proprietary solutions are recognised 
over the implementation period of the related customer contract.
(ii)  Annual licence fees are recognised 80% on completion of set-up, provided there is no early termination clause within the contract. Only the 
first year of revenue is recognised and not the full term value, and on each subsequent anniversary or renewal of the contract the following 
period’s revenue will be recognised on a similar basis, or a straight line basis dependent on contractual changes. The remainder of the contract 
value (20%) is recognised over the course of each appropriate period. 
(iii) Any revenue arising from consultancy or professional services work is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as such services 
are delivered.
Services that have been delivered at the end of a financial period but which have not been invoiced at that time are recognised as revenue in the 
statement of comprehensive income and shown within accrued revenue in the statement of financial position.
Advance payments from customers are included within deferred income in the statement of financial position. Such amounts are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income as the services are provided to the customer in accordance with points (i) to (iii) as set out above.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes utilised data storage costs proportionate to the amount utilised to service customers. Cost of sales does not include salaries 
and wages.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes the original purchase 
price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. When parts of an item of property, 
plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statements.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life. 
Computer equipment – 18 to 36 months straight line. 
Taxation
Current taxes are based on the results shown in the financial statements and are calculated according to local tax rules, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Deferred tax is provided using the statement of financial position liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Temporary differences are not provided for the initial recognition of other assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or 
different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred income tax liability where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.

2. Accounting policies continued
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Any internally generated development costs are 
recognised as an asset only if all of the following are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified;
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which 
it is incurred. 
Grants receivable
Grant income is recognised when there is: 1) entitlement to the grant; 2) virtual certainty that it will be received; and 3) sufficient measurability 
of the amount.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of the Company is pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Company operates. The Company’s presentation currency is pounds sterling.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange differences are 
taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflation economy) that have a functional 
currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
• assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement 
of financial position;
• income and expenses for each income statement presented are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at 
the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The following exchange rates were applied for £1 at each year end:
2017 2016
US dollars 1.29 1.47
Euros 1.19 1.28
Retirement benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. Contributions payable to the Group’s pension scheme are charged to the income statement 
in the period to which they relate.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual agreement, as either financial assets, 
financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash in hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their original invoiced value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the 
expected credit period is not considered to be material. Trade receivables are reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are stated at their original invoiced value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash payments over the 
expected payment period is not considered to be material.

Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets as loans and receivables. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that arise principally through the provision of services 
to customers. They are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are 
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the end of the reporting period. Loans and receivables comprise 
mainly cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
Impairment of financial assets
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty 
or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount 
of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with 
the impaired receivable.
For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within 
other operating costs in the income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset 
is written off against the associated provision.
Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares and A preference shares are classified as equity. A preference shares have been deemed equity as they are non-redeemable 
and do not pay a fixed dividend.
Share premium is the amount subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value less any costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium as a deduction from the proceeds.
Share-based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan, the Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) Scheme. The fair value of the 
employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting 
period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each statement of financial position date, the entity 
revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. Options issued under the scheme to Non-Executive Directors and other 
individuals who are not employees of the UK Company follow the EMI rules but are considered non-qualifying EMI options for tax purposes.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings using the effective interest method.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are 
discounted at a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised in finance costs.
Net finance costs
Finance costs
Finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings and direct issue costs.
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested. Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues using the 
effective interest method.

2. Accounting policies continued
Convertible loan stock
The convertible loan stock, a compound financial instrument, can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder, and the number 
of shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value.
The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity 
conversion option. The equity component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a 
whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components 
in proportion to their initial carrying amounts. Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured 
subsequent to initial recognition except on conversion or expiry. The Directors have not split out the equity component as it is not material.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the end of the reporting period.
Standards, amendments and interpretations
No new standards or amendments have been applied this year in the preparation of the financial statements of the Group.
At the date of authorisation of the financial statements the following standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial 
statements, were in issue but not yet effective.
• IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers: This standard introduces a five-step framework that is applied to all contracts with customers.
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which replaces IAS 39: This standard expands on the presentation of relevant and useful information for the 
assessment of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of any entity’s future cash flows.
• IFRS 16 Leases: This standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties 
to a contract.
The Directors expect these standards, amendments and interpretations to have an impact on the Group’s financial statements, which will be 
assessed during the next financial period.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management reporting of the business to the Executive Directors, who have 
been identified as the Chief Operating Decision-Maker. 
3. Segmental reporting
Management has determined the operating segments based on the operating reports reviewed by the Executive Directors that are used to assess 
both performance and strategic decisions. Management has identified that the Executive Directors are the Chief Operating Decision-Maker in accordance 
with the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating segments.
All segment revenue, loss before taxation, assets and liabilities are attributable to the principal activity of the Group, being the provision of data 
analytics using a proprietary form.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017. Accordingly, the Group’s profits for the 
accounting period to 30 April 2017 were taxed at an effective rate of 19.92%. The standard rate of corporation tax remained unchanged at 20% 
for the accounting period to 30 April 2016; accordingly, the Group’s profits were taxed at 20% for that year. 
Following the summer 2015 Finance Bill, there will be a reduction to the main rate of corporation tax by a further 1% to 18% from 1 April 2020. 
This rate reduction has been substantively executed at the balance sheet date and therefore the relevant deferred tax balances have been remeasured.
8. Loss per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all 
dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

At the balance sheet date the Group had available tax losses of £8,570,000 (2016: £8,228,000) available for offset against future profits. A deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in respect of £9,067 (2016: £6,690) of such losses as these losses would offset any taxable profits arising as a result of 
the unwinding of the deferred tax liability. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses of £8,560,933 (2016: £8,190,835) 
due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. Substantially all of the losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Analysis of net funds
Net funds is the total of cash and cash equivalents less interest-bearing loans and borrowings and finance lease liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents

Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (primarily foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by the Board and its policies are outlined below.
a) Market risk
Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk as it operates within the USA and other countries around the world 
and therefore transactions are denominated in sterling, Euros, US dollars and other currencies. The Group policy is to try to match the timing 
of the settlement of sales and purchase invoices so as to eliminate, as far as possible, currency exposure.
The Group does not hedge any transactions and foreign exchange differences on retranslation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities 
are taken to the income statement.
The carrying value of the Group’s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are set out below:
2017 2016

US dollars 741 345 766 337
Euros 8 12 68 49
749 357 834 386
The majority of the Group’s financial assets are held in sterling but movements in the exchange rate of the US dollar and the euro against sterling 
have an impact on both the result for the year and equity. The Group considers its most significant exposure is to movements in the US dollar.
Sensitivity to reasonably possible movements in the US dollar exchange rate can be measured on the basis that all other variables remain constant. 
The effect on profit and equity of strengthening or weakening of the US dollar in relation to sterling by 10% would result in a movement of 
±£100,000 (2016: ±£40,000).

As the Group carries no borrowings the Directors consider that there is no significant interest rate risk.
b) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. In order to minimise 
this risk the Group endeavours only to deal with companies which are demonstrably creditworthy and this, together with the aggregate financial 
exposure, is continuously monitored. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the value of the outstanding amount of £1,879,635 (2016: £1,907,521).
Provision of services by members of the Group results in trade receivables which the management considers to be of low risk; other receivables are 
likewise considered to be low risk. The management does not consider that there is any concentration of risk within either trade or other receivables. 
No trade or other receivables have been impaired.
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is considered to be small as the counterparties are all substantial banks with high credit ratings. The maximum 
exposure is the amount of the deposit.
c) Liquidity risk
The Group currently holds cash balances in sterling, US dollars and euros to provide funding for normal trading activity. The Group also has access 
to additional equity funding and, for short-term flexibility, overdraft facilities would be arranged with the Group’s bankers. Trade and other payables 
are monitored as part of normal management routine. Liabilities are disclosed as follows:

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in a volatile and tight credit economy.
The Group will also seek to minimise the cost of capital and attempt to optimise the capital structure, which currently means maintaining equity 
funding and keeping debt levels to insignificant amounts of lease funding. Share capital and premium together amount to £8,896k (see page 28).
Whilst the Group does not currently pay dividends it is part of the capital strategy to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other members 
in the future. However, the Group is planning growth and it will continue to be important to maintain the Group’s credit rating and ability to 
borrow should acquisition targets become available. 
Capital for further development of the Group’s activities will, where possible, be achieved by share issues and not by carrying significant debt. 
20. Share-based payment transactions

21. Post balance sheet events
On 15 May 2017 111,142,031 ordinary £0.005 shares were issued at a price of £0.045 per share.
On 16 May 2017 Rosslyn Data Technologies acquired 100% of the share capital of Integritie (UK) Limited, an on-premise data mining company 
registered in England. The Directors believe the acquisition will enhance Rosslyn Data Technologies’ product and customer base, increase its 
recurring revenue streams and provide cross-selling opportunities.
Due to the proximity of the transaction to the reporting date, the Directors are still completing their detailed review of all the intangible assets as 
part of the fair value review. The fair value review is also incomplete as the final workings for the net working capital adjustment and contingent 
liabilities have not yet been agreed by the sellers. Any changes to the net working capital or contingent liabilities will impact the fair value of the 
net assets acquired. The following are the Directors’ provisional estimates of the fair value of the consideration transferred and the identifiable 
assets and liabilities:

Amount settled in cash to the sellers —
Amount settled in cash to repay loans from the sellers 229
Amount settled in cash to repay 3rd party loans 764

The software development will be written off to be consistent with Rosslyn Data Technologies’ accounting policies; the value of the software products 
forms part of the intangible asset fair value adjustment. The remaining fair value adjustment relates to the forward order book identified as an 
intangible asset on acquisition.
The acquisition was funded through the placement of ordinary shares on 15 May 2017.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 /  43 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
for the year ended 30 April 2017
21. Post balance sheet events continued
The acquisition was settled by issuing 1,222,222 shares of Rosslyn Data Technologies. The fair value of the equity shares was based on the placing 
price of Rosslyn Data Technologies’ shares.
The purchase agreement includes an additional earn-out consideration in the range of £nil to a maximum of £750,000, contingent on recognised 
revenue for the Integritie (UK) Limited subsidiary in the first twelve months following acquisition. No earn-out consideration is payable if recognised 
revenue is below £5m; for recognised revenue between £5m and £6m the earn-out is calculated at 25% of the revenue in excess of £5m; and for 
recognised revenue between £6m and £7m it is calculated at 50% of the revenue in excess of £6m. No further earn-out consideration is payable 
on recognised revenue over £7m. Due to the proximity of the transaction date, the Directors estimate the fair value of this consideration to be the 
maximum amount due under the purchase agreement. By the time of the reporting of the results for the year ending 30 April 2018, the exact 
amount of the additional consideration will be known. The contingent consideration is payable in shares.
The acquisition-related costs are £138k, of which £13k has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year ended 30 April 2017 
and the balance of £125k will be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year ending 30 April 2018.
Barney Quinn was a non-executive director of Integritie (UK) Limited and had a 1% beneficial shareholding in the company.

COMPANY STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
for the year ended 30 April 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 /  47 A. General information
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales. The address of the registered office is Fox Court, 14 Gray’s Inn Road, 
London WC1X 8HN. The Group’s principal activity is the provision of management services. 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Company’s financial information are set out below. The policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented.
B. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards, including Financial 
Reporting Standard 102 The financial reporting standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102), and with 
the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. 
The individual accounts of Rosslyn Data Technologies Plc have also adopted the following disclosure exemptions:
financial instrument disclosures, including:
• categories of financial instruments; 
• items of income, expenses, gains or losses relating to financial instruments; and 
• exposure to and management of financial risks.
The financial statements are presented in sterling (£). 
Going concern
The Company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the basis of preparing the Group financial 
statements on a going concern basis.
Significant judgements and estimates
Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates. The items in the financial statements 
where these judgements and estimates have been made include:
• valuation of share-based payments; and
• valuation of the fixed asset investment.
Taxation
Taxation comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable (or recoverable) for the current period, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Except as otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all deferred taxation timing differences which 
have arisen but not reversed at the statement of financial position date. Timing differences arise when items of income and expenditure are included 
in tax computations in periods which are different from their inclusion in the financial statements. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be used.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, 
based on the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash in hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial assets
Impairment of financial assets
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or 
default or significant delay in payment) that the Company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount 
of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with 
the impaired receivable.
For debtors, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being recognised within other 
operating costs in the profit and loss account. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the 
asset is written off against the associated provision.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for diminution in value. The carrying amounts of the Company’s investments are reviewed for impairment 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If such an indication exists, 
the investment’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income whenever the carrying 
amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount.
NOTES TO THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 30 April 2017
48  / Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 B. Accounting policies continued
Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Share premium is the amount subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value less any costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium as a deduction from the proceeds.
Debtors
Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Creditors
Short-term trade creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured initially at fair value, 
net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are 
discounted at a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised in finance costs.
Share-based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan, the Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) Scheme. The fair value of the 
employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting 
period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each statement of financial position date, the entity 
revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. Options issued under the scheme to Non-Executive Directors and other 
individuals who are not employees of the UK Company follow the EMI rules but are considered non-qualifying EMI options for tax purposes.
C. Result of parent company
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Company is not presented as part of these financial statements. 
The Company’s result for the financial period is £10,137 (2016: £22,629).

 6.1  up to a maximum nominal amount of £18,603 (in pursuance of the exercise of outstanding options and warrants granted by the Company 
prior to the date hereof but for no other purpose);
 6.2  up to an aggregate nominal amount of £47,033 (in addition to the authority conferred in subparagraph 6.1 above) for the grant or award 
of further share options or warrants but for no other purpose; and
 6.3  up to an aggregate nominal value of £94,065 (in addition to the authorities conferred in subparagraphs 6.1 and 6.2 above) representing 
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital, provided that these authorities, unless duly renewed, varied or revoked by the 
Company, will expire on the date which is 15 months from the date of the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held after the passing of this resolution, save that the Company may, before such expiry, 
make offers or agreements which would or might require shares in the Company to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors may 
allot shares in the Company in pursuance of such an offer or agreement notwithstanding that the authority conferred by this resolution 
has expired.
  The authority granted pursuant to this resolution is subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the Directors may deem necessary 
or expedient in relation to fractional entitlements, record dates, legal or practical problems in or under the laws of any territory or the requirements 
of any applicable regulatory body or stock exchange.
  This resolution revokes and replaces all unexercised powers previously granted to the Directors to allot relevant securities but without 
prejudice to any allotment of shares or grant of rights already made, offered or agreed to be made, pursuant to such authorities.
Special resolution
7.  That subject to and conditional on the passing of Resolution 6, the Directors of the Company be and are hereby authorised pursuant to 
Section 570 of the 2006 Act to allot equity securities (within the meaning of Section 560 of the 2006 Act) for cash as if Section 561(1) of the 2006 Act 
did not apply to any such allotment provided that this authority shall be limited to the allotment of shares pursuant to the authorities contained 
in Resolution 6. This authority, unless duly renewed, varied or revoked by the Company, will expire on the date which is 15 months from the date 
of the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held after the passing of 
this resolution, save that the Company may before such expiry make any offer or enter into any agreement which would or might require equity 
securities to be allotted, or treasury shares sold, after such expiry and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of any such offer or 
agreement as if the authority conferred by this resolution had not expired.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
52  / Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 The following notes have been prepared to provide members with information to assess the merits of the resolutions contained within the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting (the “Notice of Annual General Meeting”) convening the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held at 
Waterhouse Square, 138 Holborn, London EC1N 2SW on 19 October 2017 at 10.30am. Capitalised terms used in these notes shall bear the meanings 
given to them in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 1 – To receive the annual financial statements (ordinary resolution)
The Directors will present their report, the Auditor’s Report and the audited financial statements for the financial year ended 30 April 2017 to the 
meeting. This gives shareholders an opportunity to ask questions on the contents and on the performance of the Company generally. 
Resolutions 2 and 3 – Re-appointment of the auditor and setting the auditor’s remuneration (ordinary resolutions)
The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts of the Company are laid before the members of the 
Company. Grant Thornton UK LLP has indicated its willingness to be re-appointed as auditor of the Company and accordingly Resolution 2 proposes 
that Grant Thornton UK LLP be re-appointed as auditor of the Company. Resolution 3 gives the Directors the authority, in accordance with standard 
practice, to negotiate and agree the remuneration of the auditor. In practice the Audit Committee will consider and approve the audit fees on 
behalf of the Board.
Resolutions 4 to 5 – Election of Directors (ordinary resolutions)
The Company’s Articles of Association require that any Director appointed by the other Directors of the Company shall retire at the next Annual 
General Meeting of the Company and also provide that each Director so retiring shall be eligible for re-appointment. The Company’s Articles of 
Association also require one-third of Directors to retire by rotation. Accordingly Charles Clark and Ed Stacey are retiring and, being eligible, offer 
themselves for re-election. Biographical details of each Director can be found within the annual report for the year ended 30 April 2017. The Directors 
believe that the Board continues to maintain an appropriate balance of knowledge and skills and that the Non-Executive Directors are independent 
in character and judgement. Accordingly all the Directors recommend that all other Directors be re-elected; however, no Director makes any 
recommendation in respect of himself.
Resolution 6 – Authorisation to allot relevant securities (ordinary resolution)
Under Section 551 of the 2006 Act, the Directors of the Company require the authority of the shareholders of the Company to be able to issue 
shares in the capital of the Company. This resolution gives authority to the Directors of the Company to allot ordinary shares of £0.005 each in the 
capital of the Company. Resolution 6.1 allows the Directors to allot ordinary shares in respect of share options and warrants already in existence. 
Resolution 6.2 permits the Directors to further allot shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £47,033, approximately 5% of the Company’s issued 
share capital. Resolution 6.3 permits Directors to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £94,065, representing approximately 10% of the 
Company’s issued share capital. Any further issues of share capital over and above these amounts would require the Directors to seek a fresh 
approval from shareholders.
Unless revoked, varied or extended, the Directors’ authorities granted pursuant to this resolution will expire on the earlier of the date which is 
15 months after the resolution is passed and the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Resolution 7 – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights (special resolution)
This resolution gives the Directors of the Company the authority to allot equity securities on a non-pre-emptive basis solely for the purposes 
of an allotment of shares in the Company pursuant to an authority given by Resolution 6. It will disapply the statutory pre-emption rights for 
such allotments until the earlier of the date which is 15 months after the resolution is passed and the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company.
Further notes
Annual financial statements
The Company’s annual financial statements, together with the Reports of the Directors and of the auditor, are available to download from the Investors 
page of the Company’s website (www.rosslynanalytics.com). Shareholders for whom a current address is held will also receive a copy by post.
Right to ask questions at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)
Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any such question being related to 
the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if:
1) to do so would interfere unduly with the meeting or cause confidential information to be disclosed;
2) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or
3) it is not in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting to be answered.
EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING NOTICE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 /  53 Further notes continued
Shareholders entitled to vote
Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only holders of ordinary shares of £0.005 
registered in the Company’s register of members at close of business on 17 October 2017 (or, if the Annual General Meeting is adjourned, close 
of business two days prior to the time fixed for the adjourned Annual General Meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General 
Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that time. Any changes to the Company’s register of members after such 
time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the Annual General Meeting.
Appointment of proxies 
1.  You are entitled to appoint one or more proxies of your own choice to exercise all or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting. 
A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting in order to represent you. If you appoint more than one proxy, each 
proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by you. You can only appoint proxies using the 
procedures set out in these notes.
2.  If you wish to appoint a proxy other than the Chairman of the meeting, please insert their full name in the space provided and delete the words 
“the Chairman of the meeting or” . Please initial any such alteration. If you hold more than one share you may appoint more than one proxy 
provided each proxy holder is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. A separate form of proxy must be deposited for each 
proxy appointed. If the proxy is being appointed in relation to less than your full voting entitlement, please enter in the box next to the name 
of the proxy the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy; if you sign and return the form and leave this 
box blank your proxy will be deemed to be authorised in respect of your full voting entitlement.
3.  To appoint more than one proxy, you may photocopy the form. Please state clearly on each form of proxy the number of shares in relation to 
which the proxy is appointed. Please therefore indicate in the box next to the name of the proxy the number of shares in relation to which they 
are authorised to act as your proxy. Please also indicate by ticking the box provided if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being 
given. All forms must be signed and should be returned together in the same envelope. A failure to specify the number of shares each proxy 
appointment relates to or specifying a number in excess of those held by the member may result in the proxy appointment being invalid. 
4.  Completion and return of the form of proxy will not preclude you from attending and voting at the meeting in person if you wish. If you do 
attend the meeting in person, your proxy appointments will automatically be terminated.
5.  If you want your proxy to vote in a certain way on the resolutions specified please indicate with an “X” in the appropriate boxes. If you fail to 
select any of the given options your proxy can vote as he or she chooses or can decide not to vote at all. Your proxy can also do this on any 
other business which may come before the meeting, including amendments to resolutions and any procedural business.
6.  The “withheld” option on this form of proxy is provided to enable you to instruct your proxy not to vote on any particular resolution. However, 
a vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the votes “for” or “against” a resolution.
7.  In the case of a corporation, this form of proxy must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by its duly authorised officer, 
attorney or other person authorised to sign.
8.  In the case of joint holders, the signature of any one holder will be sufficient but the names of all the joint holders should be stated. The vote 
of the senior joint holder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of other joint holders, 
and, for this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members in respect of the joint holding.
9.  To be valid the form of proxy must be completed and signed and received, together with any power of attorney or other authority under which 
it is signed, by post or (during normal business hours only) by hand to Capita Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham BR3 4TU 
no later than 10.30am on 17 October 2017 (or, in the event that the meeting is adjourned, no later than 48 hours prior to the time of any 
adjourned meeting).
10.  If you wish to change your proxy instruction you should submit a new form of proxy. If you submit more than one valid form of proxy in respect 
of the same shares held by you, the form of proxy received last will take precedence, provided that any changes to proxy instructions received 
after the time and date specified in note 9 shall be disregarded.
11.  If you wish to revoke your proxy appointment you must send a notice to that effect to the Company’s registrars at the address set out in note 9 
by the time and date set out in note 9. Any revocation notice received after that time and date will be disregarded.
12.  You may not use any electronic address provided in your form of proxy to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those 
expressly stated.
13.  Total voting rights as at 25 August 2017 in the issued share capital of the Company consist of 188,130,067 ordinary shares of £0.005 each, 
carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total number of voting rights of the Company as at 25 August 2017 is 188,130,067.
EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING NOTICE CONTINUED
54  / Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 Further notes continued
Appointment of proxies continued
14.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company to be held on 19 October 2017 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the 
CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider, should refer to their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. 
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) 
must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required 
for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent, Capita 
Asset Services (CREST participant ID: RA10), no later than 48 hours before the time appointed for the meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt 
will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the Company’s 
agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST . 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsor or voting service provider should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the 
input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal 
member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider takes) such 
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST 
members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsor or voting service provider are referred in particular to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001.
Corporate bodies
A corporate body may appoint an individual as its representative to exercise any of the powers the body may exercise at meetings of the Company’s 
shareholders. The representative should bring to the meeting evidence of his or her appointment, unless it has previously been given to the Company.
Action to be taken
Shareholders will find enclosed with these notes and the Notice of Annual General Meeting a form of proxy for the Annual General Meeting. Whether or 
not you intend to attend the Annual General Meeting, you are requested to complete, sign and return the form of proxy in accordance with the instructions 
printed on it. The completed form of proxy should be returned by post or by hand to Capita Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham 
BR3 4TU so as to arrive no later than 10.30am on 17 October 2017. The completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude you from attending the 
meeting and voting in person should you wish to do so.
Recommendation
The Directors consider that each of the proposed Resolutions set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting is in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the Resolutions, as they and those 
connected with them intend to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings.
