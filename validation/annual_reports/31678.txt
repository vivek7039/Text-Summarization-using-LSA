• Revenue and gross profit growth 
were strong and in line with our 
expectations, driven by student

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 Watkin Jones has significant strengths, which 
combine to make us a compelling business.
INVESTMENT CASE
ESTABLISHED BRAND AND REPUTATION 
We are one of the leading developers of PBSA in the UK, having delivered more 
than 34,500 beds since 1999. We have a 100% record of delivering PBSA 
developments ahead of the academic year, giving us a strong reputation and 
contributing to our excellent relationships with leading institutions. These include 
AIG, Arlington, Brookfield, CBRE Global (Curlew Student Trust), Europa Capital, 
GSA, Lasalle, Legal & General, M&G, UBS and UPP .
BUSINESS MODEL REDUCES RISK 
Watkin Jones plc is one of the few companies in PBSA and build to rent offering 
a complete solution to investors, from identifying the site through to managing 
the finished building. We believe that we are the only full-service provider to sell 
all our developments, meaning we do not compete with our own investment 
clients. The forward sale model minimises our development risk.
HIGH VISIBILITY AND STRONG FINANCIAL PROFILE 
We have significant visibility of our earnings and cash flow from forward-sold 
schemes and our development pipeline. As developers and constructors, we 
capture both development and construction margin. Where Fresh Property 
Group is appointed as property manager, we earn ongoing revenue and margin 
post completion of a development. Forward selling developments gives us 
favourable working capital dynamics, as we invoice on a monthly basis, rather 
than selling completed developments at the end of the construction phase.
ATTRACTIVE MARKETS 
We operate in large and growing markets. There are over 1.7 million full-time 
students in the UK and demand for university places remains well ahead of 
supply. A higher number of students than ever are studying away from home, 
adding to the demand for private PBSA. Significant funds are available for 
investment in build to rent, with the market expected to grow by £45 billion 
over the next five years.
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH PROSPECTS 
We see the potential to deliver significant growth in the coming years. Attractive 
markets will allow us to be selective in acquiring new development sites in 
PBSA and build to rent, as we focus on the quality and sustainability of our 
earnings. We also have an opportunity to grow the portfolio of properties 
managed by Fresh Property Group, in both the student accommodation 
and build to rent markets.
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 07 Performance and dividend
The Group produced a strong trading 
performance in FY17, which was in line 
with our expectations. Good revenue 
growth and rising gross margins 
contributed to a double-digit increase in 
earnings. The business is also highly cash 
generative and we further increased 
the net cash on the balance sheet.
This performance underpins our ability 
to reward shareholders through our 
progressive dividend policy. At the time 
of the IPO, we promised to pay a healthy 
dividend, recognising that this was 
important to investors in an environment 
where many companies were having to 
reduce or scrap their dividend payouts.
Last year’s total dividend was 4.0 pence 
per share which, taking into account the 
timing of the IPO, was equivalent to a 
dividend for the full year of 6.0 pence. 
After paying an interim dividend of 
2.2 pence per share this year, the 
Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 4.4 pence per share, 
to give a total dividend of 6.6 pence. 
This represents growth in the total 
dividend of 10.0% against the FY16 
full-year equivalent. The final dividend 
will be paid on 28 February 2018 to 
shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 26 January 2018. The shares 
will go ex-dividend on 25 January 2018.
The Board has also decided to adopt a 
policy of aiming to pay dividends at a level 
which will be two times covered by annual 
earnings and will implement this policy 
fully by FY19.
This was Watkin Jones’ first full financial year since 
its IPO. Having spent much of the previous year 
organising as a public company, FY17 was a year 
of confident delivery.

Strategic report I believe that the Group’s financial and operational  
performance and its strategic progress all demonstrate  
that Watkin Jones is a business that delivers on its promises.
Board, management and people
There were no changes to Board 
membership during the year. The Directors 
continue to work well together, and towards 
the end of 2017 we began our first formal 
appraisal of the Board’s performance to 
identify areas for further development.
The Group’s success this year reflects 
the strong leadership of the Executive 
Directors, Mark Watkin Jones and Phil 
Byrom, and their colleagues. 
Mark, Phil and the team have continued to 
successfully manage the pipeline, control 
costs, ensure delivery and implement our 
strategy for growth. I want to thank them 
and everyone in Watkin Jones for their 
significant contribution.
The Group has an experienced and stable 
senior team and we spent time this year 
assessing their capabilities, investing in 
development and considering succession 
planning. We are also proposing to introduce 
a long-term incentive plan during FY18, 
to help us retain our senior people and 
reward performance. More information on 
the plan can be found in the Remuneration 
Committee report on pages 47 and 48.
It is with regret that Mark Watkin Jones 
has notified the Board of his intention to 
stand down as the Group’s Chief 
Executive Officer once a suitable 
successor has been appointed, following 
an orderly handover period. For personal 
reasons, Mark is not able to undertake a 
full-time executive role over the longer 
term and he and the Board believe that it 
is in the Group’s best interests to recruit 
a successor. 
The Board will initiate a formal search 
process to identify a new Chief Executive 
Officer. The Board is keen to retain the 
benefit of Mark’s valuable knowledge 
and experience and the intention is that, 
following the transition, the Board will 
look at how this might be achieved, 
including the option of him becoming 
a Non-Executive Director of Watkin Jones.
After 15 years at the helm, the Board 
understands Mark’s desire to relinquish 
the Chief Executive Officer position and 
the associated demands of this role. 
Mark has played a pivotal part in shaping 
the Watkin Jones strategy and success. 
Under Mark’s leadership, Watkin Jones 
has gone through a transformational 
period, a key part of which has been the 
establishment and development of a 
strong senior management team who 
have increasingly taken on the day-to-day 
responsibility for the running of 
the business and who are capable 
of supporting the Group’s long-term 
growth aspirations. 
The Board will be seeking a successor to 
Mark who can build on this platform and 
maintain the Group’s track record of 
profitable, cash generative growth.
The Board would like to thank Mark for 
his enormous contribution and is also 
delighted that he has indicated his 
willingness to continue to support his 
successor and the business 
going forward.
Looking forward
The Board is confident about the outlook 
for the Group. The development pipeline 
gives us excellent visibility of our revenues 
and earnings, protecting our performance 
and giving us the time to adjust our plans 
if necessary. While Brexit is a source of 
uncertainty for many businesses, it is 
unlikely to be a significant issue for the 
Group. EU students are only 7% of the 
market and the demand for UK higher 
education is such that universities will 
continue to fill their places, no matter 
what happens to EU student numbers.
While we see growth opportunities across 
all parts of the Group, over the medium 
term we see the greatest upside potential 
in build to rent. The Board is encouraged 
by our progress to date in that market and 
the Group now has the foundations to 
develop a second major business over 
the coming years.
Grenville Turner
Independent Non-Executive Chairman
12 January 2018
09 Chief Executive Officer Mark Watkin Jones gives his view 
on the Group’s performance and markets, and how he 
expects the business to develop in the coming years.
Q&A:
MARK WATKIN JONES
Q:
You are now more than a year on 
from the IPO. Has it provided the 
benefits you hoped for?
A:
Yes, without a doubt. It has raised our 
profile with clients, with the supply 
chain and in recruitment. Our people 
can see the value of their contribution 
and it has given them a sense of 
ownership, which means there is more 
challenge in the business. People are 
also more forthcoming with their views 
about where we should take the 
business. That is great. What has not 
changed is that we are still very much 
results focused.
Q:
You sold a portfolio of 
developments this year.  
Is this a trend in the market?
A:
There is increased demand for buying 
portfolios, as that allows institutions to 
deploy more capital and gives them an 
immediate platform in the market. They 
may be prepared to pay a little more to 
achieve that. However, we also want to 
maintain our relationships with our 
existing institutional clients, and 
bringing individual developments to 
market allows us to work with more 
institutions each year. So we have to 
have the right balance.
Q:
The Group delivered a strong 
performance this year but 
where do you think you could 
have done better?
A:
We did everything that we set out to do 
in 2017. The EU referendum seemed to 
temporarily dent investor confidence, 
which meant build to rent did not take 
off as quickly as we expected in the 
year. But there is a significant amount 
of cash waiting to come into the sector 
and we have put in place the 
foundations we need, so we can 
really push that forward.

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 Q:
Is there a danger of the student 
accommodation market 
becoming saturated?  
How much further can it go?
A:
I think there will always be 
opportunities in the student market. 
Students will continue to migrate from 
houses of multiple occupation to 
purpose built, and they will want newer 
and better products, in better locations. 
So long as we can find the right sites, 
we can continue to provide that for 
them, even in towns and cities that 
might be perceived as saturated. 
We do not own the completed assets, 
so we are not competing against 
ourselves when we add developments 
in those locations.
Our business model is also important 
here. We only commit small sums of 
working capital to schemes and we 
have a three-year pipeline, which gives 
us flexibility to change direction quickly.
Finally, a lot of university-owned PBSA 
was built pre-1999 and will continue to 
deteriorate. The universities are looking 
to the private sector to enhance their 
offer, which will create more 
opportunities for us.
Q:
There is growing political 
pressure to build more homes 
in the UK, both for private and 
social housing. How would this 
affect demand for build to rent?
A:
Each and every unit of accommodation 
has to ease the pressure on demand for 
homes, so build to rent has an important 
part to play. Attitudes are also changing. 
It is far more socially acceptable to 
rent than it was ten or 15 years ago. 
The UK is becoming more like Europe, 
where the majority of people rent. The 
Government’s thinking has also shifted 
– they are more focused on increasing 
the overall supply of housing, across a 
range of different tenures.
Q:
How are you managing cost 
inflation in the supply chain?
A:
I think we are managing cost inflation 
exceptionally well. Our supply chain 
follows us from project to project and 
because we have a standard product, 
they become quicker and more efficient 
at delivering over time. We give them 
visibility of our pipeline, so they can 
build their businesses around ours and 
we can balance their workload by 
scheduling build to rent schemes 
around the student accommodation 
programme. Being able to offer our 
supply chain twelve months of very 
similar work is a real competitive 
advantage for us.
Q:
Is the residential business  
still core to Watkin Jones?
A:
Yes. It is a good contributor to the 
Group and our central services can 
support it with very little additional 
cost. It also offers us more than just 
revenue and profit. Working in private 
residential gives our people a really 
good grounding in how we operate as a 
business. Many of the people who have 
worked in it have progressed onto 
bigger and more complex projects, 
which is great for us because we know 
what they can do when we transfer 
them into different divisions.
Q:
What do you think the balance 
of the Group will look like in the 
medium term?
A:
The aspiration is to grow build to  
rent to a similar size to student 
accommodation, so we have two 
earnings and cash flow streams that 
are comparable to each other. That 
also applies to accommodation 
management, where we can replicate 
in build to rent what we have achieved 
with Fresh Student Living.
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 11 The Group had another strong year in FY17 , as we  
successfully implemented our strategy and delivered  
financial performance in line with our expectations.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S REVIEW
Mark Watkin Jones
Chief Executive Officer
Strategy
The Group is following a consistent 
strategy, as set out on page 16, which 
is delivering sustainable growth and 
positioning us to take advantage of 
the exciting opportunities ahead.
The visibility provided by developing 
student accommodation is central to this 
strategy. It gives us a secure and growing 
base of revenue, earnings and cash flow, 
which allows us to develop new 
businesses to enhance that growth. 
The strength of our student 
accommodation pipeline makes this an 
excellent time to pursue our strategy in 
build to rent. We can use the knowledge, 
experience and relationships we have 
developed in student accommodation over 
nearly two decades, which are all directly 
applicable in the build to rent market.
Our development pipeline will also 
provide a stream of new contracts in 
accommodation management, in both 
student and build to rent. 
Winning contracts to manage buildings 
developed by third parties is another 
exciting source of growth for this business, 
as the market is far greater than the 
buildings we develop ourselves.
People and culture
Any business is only as good as the 
people it employs, which is why we invest 
so much time and money in developing 
our people and helping them to achieve 
their potential.
Our primary focus in FY17 was on 
ensuring the Group has the leadership 
it needs to achieve its growth plans. 
We have established an Executive 
Committee to provide the executive 
leadership to the Group below Board level 
and to further the management of our 
governance responsibilities. The members 
of the Executive Committee are myself, 
Philip Byrom (CFO), Alex Pease 
(Investment Director), Jim Davies 
(MD Newmark Developments) and 
Rebecca Hopewell (CEO Fresh 
Property Group).
Performance
Revenue from continuing operations 
rose by 13.1% to £301.9 million 
(FY16: £267.0 million), contributing to 
an 18.0% increase in gross profit to 
£63.5 million (FY16: £53.8 million). 
Operating profit was 12.7% higher at 
£42.7 million (FY16: £37.9 million before 
exceptional IPO costs), representing an 
operating margin of 14.1% (FY16: 14.2%). 
Our business is strongly cash generative 
and we achieved an operating cash inflow 
of £19.2 million (FY16: £15.1 million after 
exceptional IPO costs), with a further 
£22.8 million of cash received after the 
year end, relating to forward sales we 
agreed during FY17.
Developing student accommodation 
generates our core revenue and earnings 
and the business had another excellent 
year. We completed all ten schemes on 
time (3,314 beds), maintaining our 100% 
record of delivering ahead of the start of 
the academic year. We also continued to 
refill the pipeline of development sites, 
ensuring we maintain the visibility of 
earnings that is fundamental to our 
business model.
Our accommodation management 
business, Fresh Property Group, is 
continuing to perform well. It currently has 
16,082 student beds under management 
for the 2017/18 academic year, a 30% 
increase on the number under management 
for 2016/17. The business is also expanding 
in the build to rent market and now has 
535 units under management, including 
the 322-unit scheme we completed in 
Leeds during the year.
We are successfully building a pipeline of 
development opportunities in build to rent. 
The Group has five development sites, 
which it owns or has exchanged contracts 
to acquire, and is in separate negotiations 
on several other opportunities.
The residential business also had 
a good year, completing 94 sales and 
increasing its gross margin to 16.7%, 
from 11.5% in FY16.

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 The operational Board was unchanged 
during the year, and we have looked to 
invest in and empower them, as well as 
the management teams below them and 
throughout the Group. This included 
helping our people to understand how 
they contribute to the business and to 
show them the opportunities available 
within the Group, which we believe make 
us an employer of choice. As part of this, 
we have begun succession planning for 
management at Board level and below. 
Our other activities in the year 
encompassed enhancing performance 
management and improving 
communication, to drive engagement 
and collaboration across our divisions.
Sustainability
With a history dating back more than two 
centuries, it is natural for us to think for the 
long term. We therefore aim to ensure we 
are economically, socially and 
environmentally sustainable. The way 
we work is governed by a set of robust 
policies and we look to understand and 
manage the needs of our stakeholders, 
which include our people, clients, supply 
chain and shareholders, as well as wider 
society in the form of our communities 
and both the local and global environment.
More information about our approach 
to sustainability can be found on 
pages 28 to 31.
Curlew Student Trust  
portfolio sale
We have been advised by Curlew Capital 
that the Curlew Student Trust (“CST”) is in 
legal negotiations to sell a portfolio of its 
assets. CST was launched in 2013 as a 
seven-year Fund, with a strategy to 
forward fund and hold good quality 
student accommodation assets in strong 
university towns and cities across the UK. 
CST is backed by clients of CBRE Global 
Investment Partners. The sale is expected 
to exchange and complete in the next 
few weeks.
The sale transaction includes 14 schemes 
(5,124 beds) which are managed by the 
Fresh Property Group. It is expected that 
Fresh will continue to provide management 
services to the new owner for FY18, but that 
ultimately the new owner may decide to take 
the management in house. Fresh will be fully 
compensated for any unexpired contract 
periods on all of the assets should they be 
terminated early by the new owner. Should 
Fresh not be retained as property manager 
for these assets, this will not have a material 
effect on the Group’s financial performance.
Curlew Capital have advised us that, 
following the success of CST, they have 
received approval to launch a second Fund, 
Curlew Student Trust 2 (“CST 2”), backed 
again by clients of CBRE Global Investment 
Partners. CST 2 will have a similar strategy to 
CST to forward fund and hold good quality 
student accommodation assets in strong 
university towns and cities across the UK. 
CST 2 will have a 25-year life and is expected 
to be launched in January 2018. CST 2 has 
already secured two seed assets (917 beds) 
for delivery in 2020 and has ambitious growth 
plans. Fresh will be the preferred property 
manager for CST 2, which creates the potential 
for longer-term business growth for Fresh.
Outlook
I believe that Watkin Jones is 
in an excellent position. Student 
accommodation continues to provide 
strong visibility and we have growing 
momentum in build to rent. At the same 
time, our investment in our people gives us 
the leadership we need to take advantage 
of the opportunities ahead.
As noted in the Chairman’s statement on 
page 09, after careful consideration I have 
decided that it is necessary for me to step 
back from my position as Chief Executive 
Officer. The Group has reported strong 
results for FY17 and with excellent 
earnings visibility, Watkin Jones is in a 
strong position to achieve continued 
success in both student accommodation 
and build to rent. Solid foundations are in 
place for my successor to work with, 
including an excellent management team 
that has supported me over the years in 
successfully growing the business and 
who will continue to drive Watkin Jones 
forward for the long-term benefit of our 
shareholders.

Business highlights
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 13 BUSINESS
MODEL
Since we completed our first PBSA scheme in 1999, we have 
developed substantial expertise and competitive advantages 
in development and property management, which are now 
directly applicable to the emerging build to rent market.
The inputs to our business model
The following assets and resources help 
us to create value for our stakeholders:
People
We employ excellent people, with 
significant experience of delivering 
on time and to the highest standards.
Knowledge
We have a deep understanding of 
our markets and how to develop 
and manage schemes successfully.
Relationships
Our strong relationships with our 
institutional investors, supply chain, 
agents, consultants, planning 
authorities and universities all 
underpin our success.
Scale, reputation  
and financial strength
As a well-capitalised tier 1 developer, 
with a strong reputation for delivery, we 
are a partner of choice for key investors.
Natural resources
Our building processes use natural 
resources including land, materials 
and energy.
INPUTS
Our four-stage development model
Site procurement and planning Transaction and funding
We use our market knowledge and 
understanding of investor demand to 
target key towns and cities for both 
PBSA and build to rent developments. 
We then identify sites through our own 
staff, our network of agents and other 
consultants, enabling us to buy most 
sites off-market. Our track record helps 
us to buy at attractive prices, since we 
can offer vendors more certainty 
of completion.
We typically reduce risk by acquiring 
sites subject to planning. Our expert 
team then liaises with the planning 
authority. This in-house resource is 
unusual in our sector and gives us a 
significant advantage, allowing us to 
obtain planning permission more quickly 
and at a lower cost. This helps us to 
start on site sooner and deliver on time.
Our forward sale model reduces our 
risk, as we generally aim to sell each 
scheme to an investor before we start 
construction. Institutions’ desire to 
work with tier 1 developers, such as us, 
is an important barrier to entry. 
Forward sales give us excellent visibility 
of our earnings and cash flow, as we 
bill the purchaser for the land and each 
month during construction, rather than 
only receiving a lump sum on 
completion. We may decide not to 
immediately forward sell some 
developments, when we conclude we 
can earn a higher sale price by waiting. 
Ultimately we do sell all of our 
developments. This means we do not 
compete with our institutional clients, 
encouraging them to share their plans 
with us. We also look for ways to add 
value for clients, such as negotiating 
direct arrangements with universities 
for student accommodation.

For shareholders
Shareholders benefit from rising 
earnings, cash flows and dividends.
OUTPUTS
3‑7 years (renewable)
Construction and delivery Asset management
Unlike many developers, we are 
experienced constructors, employing 
expert construction directors and 
project managers to deliver our 
schemes. This means that for most 
developments we do not rely on 
third-party contractors, increasing 
our margin and our ability to deliver 
on time. We will on occasion use a 
third-party contractor, where the 
geographic location of the development 
warrants it, while providing project 
management oversight ourselves.
We have long-term relationships 
and agreed national rates with key 
suppliers. Our supply chain regularly 
follows us from scheme to scheme, 
making them experts in our 
developments. This helps us to 
deliver to a high standard and 
reduces our costs of managing them. 
By staggering our PBSA and build to 
rent developments, we can use the 
same supply chain for both.
Fresh Property Group enables us to 
offer an end-to-end solution to 
investors and gives us an income 
stream beyond completion. Fresh 
combines national scale with local 
knowledge, differentiating it from its 
largely regional competitors. It also has 
the ability to manage both PBSA and 
build to rent schemes for the same 
investor. The insights Fresh develops 
by engaging with students and tenants 
keep us up-to-date with the latest 
trends, so we can adapt our future 
schemes accordingly. 
Fresh has a scalable platform, having 
invested significantly in systems and 
processes which are tailored to both 
student accommodation and build to 
rent. The required investment means 
barriers to entry are high. We believe 
that a minimum of 5,000 beds under 
management is required to break even.

Our core strategic objective 
is to leverage our position 
as the UK’s leading 
developer of student 
accommodation and take 
advantage of the attractive 
market to sustainably 
increase earnings. 
This means:
• developing 3,000 to 
4,000 PBSA beds per 
year, focusing on quality 
of earnings;
• using our forward sale 
model to minimise risk; 
and
• continuing to build 
strategic partnerships 
with institutional 
investors, so they 
become repeat clients.
We intend to progressively 
enter the build to rent 
market by:
• leveraging our expertise 
in PBSA to capitalise on 
the similarities with build 
to rent, and using the 
expertise of our 
residential development 
teams; and
• engaging with our 
existing institutional 
investors to obtain 
forward funding for these 
projects, where 
appropriate.
We will continue to grow 
Fresh Property Group by:
• offering end-to-end 
solutions, so institutional 
investors engage us to 
manage the PBSA and 
build to rent assets the 
Group develops; and
• winning the management 
of new and existing 
assets developed by 
third parties.
Our objectives in  
residential are to:
• continue to develop sites 
from our current 
residential land bank; 
and
• strategically acquire new 
sites for residential 
development, if and 
when they become 
available.
Underpinning the objectives set out above is a set of consistent 
strategic themes. In order to meet our objectives, we need to:
• focus on delivery and operational excellence, to maintain our 
reputation as an attractive and reliable partner for institutions;
• ensure we grow in a sustainable way, to help maintain that 
reputation for delivery;
• deepen our relationships with our existing institutional 
clients and develop relationships with new institutions;
• retain our talented people and invest in training and 
development; and
• invest in the systems and processes that support our 
businesses.

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 The UK PBSA market 
remains attractive and 
offers good opportunities 
for further growth.
Alex Pease
Investment Director  
at Watkin Jones Group
The market opportunity 
The number of full-time students in the  
UK is a key determinant of demand for  
PBSA, since these students are more  
likely to live away from home than 
part-time students. The full-time student 
population has steadily grown, increasing 
by an average of 2% per year since 2004, 
to reach 1.74 million. Despite the increase 
in tuition fees in 2012, demand for 
university places remains substantially 
greater than supply. In 2016/17, there were 
699,850 applications to UK universities, 
of which 533,890 were accepted. UCAS 
applicants in 2016/17 were 7% higher 
than in 2011/12.
UK demographics are positive, with an 
upturn in the number of 17 to 21-year-olds 
coming through from 2021. Trends in 
international students are also positive. 
Over 397,000 students are now from 
outside the UK, representing 23% of the 
student population and an increase of 
70% over the period 2005/06 to 2015/16. 
Non-EU international student numbers 
increased by 24% from 2008/09 to 
2015/16, making up circa 17.8% of the 
full-time student population. While EU 
international student acceptances have 
fallen in 2017 by 2.1%, this is offset by an 
increase in non-EU international students 
of 1.8%. EU international students make 
up a relatively small proportion of the 
market at circa 7.3% and we do not 
believe that the changes in EU student 
numbers will have a noticeable impact 
on demand for PBSA.
At the start of the 2017/18 academic year 
Cushman and Wakefield reported that 
602,000 PBSA bed spaces were available. 
Significant scope remains for increased 
penetration of private PBSA, particularly 
as universities turn to the private sector for 
provision and more students than ever are 
studying away from home (1.04 million). 
Since 2013, growth has predominantly 
come from the private sector, where bed 
numbers up to 2016 have increased by 
43% compared to an increase of 5% in 
university accommodation across the 
same period.
PBSA investment
Institutional investors increasingly see 
UK PBSA, which has maintained good 
headline rental growth, as a core 
real-estate holding. Headline rental growth 
in 2016/17 was 2.9%. The increasing 
maturity of the market is seeing investors 
demand greater scale, driving investment 
activity. The UK student accommodation 
market has also attracted capital from all 
over the globe. The largest share of 
transactions from non-UK domiciled 
investors in 2016 was from Asia, whilst 
2017 has seen significant investment 
activity from North America. It is estimated 
that £3.6 billion of stock has been traded 
in 2017. £1.05 billion of stock is believed to 
be under offer and a further £1.5 billion of 
stock is believed to be in the market.
Competition
We operate across the entire PBSA 
development lifecycle, and whilst there 
are other specialist PBSA developers in 
the UK, most do not construct their own 
developments, few provide asset 
management services, and their scale 
and geographical focus vary considerably. 
Some are owner/operators, who invest 
in assets and manage developments 
themselves. 
Some non-specialist developers have 
exposure to PBSA, offering procurement, 
planning and construction services. 
Typically, these firms are either 
housebuilders or commercial property 
developers with student 
accommodation divisions. 
We believe our focus, market knowledge, 
geographical coverage and ability to work 
across the entire development cycle give 
us a competitive advantage. We also 
believe that we are the only developer that 
forward sells all its schemes to investors, 
making us an attractive conduit for 
institutions looking to increase exposure to 
PBSA. These factors make us well placed 
to compete effectively.
Performance
Revenues from student accommodation 
development were £256.1 million, up 8.0% 
on the £237.2 million achieved in FY16. 
This reflected the quality of the sites, 
which had correspondingly higher values, 
and in turn fed through to a higher gross 
margin, which rose to 22.1% (FY16: 20.5%).
We look to maintain a pipeline of student 
accommodation of around 10,000 beds, 
for delivery over the following three years. 
Our pipeline remains robust. All ten of the 
developments for completion in FY18, 
ahead of the 2018/19 academic year, 
have been forward sold. For FY19, we are 
targeting delivery of seven developments, 
of which five had been forward sold at the 
year end. All the sites for FY19 have been 
secured and all have planning consent. 
We have secured five sites for FY20 and a 
number of other sites are in negotiation. 
Of the secured sites, three have planning 
consent, with the remainder progressing 
through the planning process.
In total, at the year end, we had a 
development pipeline of 23 sites, 
representing 9,120 beds, with an 
appraised development value of 
£762 million. Of these beds:
• 3,415 are for delivery in FY18;
• 3,153 are for delivery in FY19; and
• 2,552 are for delivery in FY20 
and beyond.
In total, we sold 17 developments with 
6,578 beds during the year, including one 
operational asset of 590 beds, with a total 
development value of £506 million.
The planning environment remains 
challenging but our expertise and in-house 
resource has enabled us to continue to 
make good progress. During FY17, 
we achieved planning consent for six 
developments (1,610 beds), with consent 
for a further three developments 
(959 beds) received since the year end.

The market opportunity 
Build to rent has significant momentum 
as an asset class, with a number of factors 
creating demand for properties and 
supporting rental levels. This makes 
build to rent an exciting opportunity 
for institutional investors. 
There is well-known structural supply and 
demand imbalance in the UK property 
market and for many years, the supply of 
new homes has fallen well short of the 
number required. In 2016/17, the number 
of new homes built reached 217,350. This 
was the highest for nine years but still well 
below the 300,000 that the government is 
targeting by 2022. The shortage of new 
builds contributes to high house prices in 
parts of the country with the strongest 
local economies, pricing many people out 
of the market. As a result, many people are 
renting for the long term instead. 
In addition, the population has become 
more transitory, moving from a “job for life” 
attitude to the expectation that young 
people will now have several jobs during 
their lifetime. Young adults between the 
ages of 20 to 30, accustomed to the 
benefits of all-inclusive PBSA, make up a 
significant share of the build to rent market 
and often enjoy the flexibility of renting.
Since 1991, the private rented sector 
has more than doubled in size and now 
accommodates 19% of all UK households 
(circa five million households). This figure 
is forecast to increase to 25% by 2021, 
as the sector continues to grow. Private 
renters are also getting older, with 46% 
of those in their late twenties and early 
thirties being tenants, up from 24% in 2006.
The rental market is fragmented and 
dominated by small buy-to-let landlords, 
with little over 3% being owned by 
institutions. This is expected to change, 
as build to rent offers institutions an 
attractive income stream that correlates 
strongly with inflation and is considered 
highly sustainable through the economic 
cycle. Current investment in the build to 
rent sector is estimated to total £25 billion 
and is forecast to reach £70 billion by 
2022. According to recent research by 
the Investment Property Forum, 80% 
of residential investors surveyed intend 
to increase their exposure over the next 
twelve months, with £8 billion earmarked 
for investment in 2018.
Performance
During the year, we completed our 
first build to rent development, the 
322-apartment scheme in Leeds. 
In October 2017, it won Best Large 
Development at the Yorkshire Residential 
Property Awards.
Another key initiative for us was 
the preparation of our build to rent 
development specification. This enables 
institutional clients to specify our product 
offering and allows us to appropriately 
cost potential schemes.
We made good progress with securing 
a pipeline of further development 
opportunities. We acquired a site in 
Sutton, London, on which we have now 
obtained planning for 165 units, and 
secured planning for a site in Leicester to 
build a total of 322 units. Subsequent to 
the year end, we also secured planning on 
a site in Bournemouth, to build a total of 
147 units and on a site in Sheffield for 
62 units. In addition we have exchanged 
contracts to acquire a site in Uxbridge, 
which subject to planning consent, will 
deliver approximately 270 units, and we 
are in separate negotiations on several 
other opportunities. We are targeting the 
development of around 1,500 units on 
these sites during the period FY18 to 
FY22, subject to obtaining the remaining 
necessary planning consents.
We are encouraged by our progress to 
date and by the prospects we see in build 
to rent. As noted above, there is growing 
institutional demand for build to rent 
assets, and through Fresh Property Group 
(see pages 22 to 23) we will increasingly 
be able to demonstrate the revenue 
enhancement and cost savings achievable 
with specialist management, which in turn 
will increase the value of completed 
assets. We are therefore currently taking 
a prudent approach to forward sales, 
in anticipation of rising values in the build 
to rent market.

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 2017 has been another great 
year for Fresh Student Living. 
By creating the Fresh Property 
Group, we can replicate this 
success across the build to 
rent sector.
Rebecca Hopewell
CEO 
Fresh Property Group
We created Fresh Property Group during 
FY17, to bring our two accommodation 
management businesses under a single 
leadership team. It operates under the 
Fresh Student Living brand in student 
accommodation and Five Nine Living in 
build to rent. Creating Fresh Property 
Group allows us to present institutional 
clients with a single accommodation 
management offering that covers both the 
PBSA and build to rent markets, and helps 
us to make maximum use of our resources 
and expertise, while avoiding duplication. 
Fresh Property Group is a key part of 
the Group’s complete end-to-end 
solution for clients, which spans sourcing 
of sites to managing the completed 
developments. It can take on all aspects 
of accommodation management for 
clients, including mobilising, marketing 
and letting, managing the building and 
tenants, and collecting rent. The 
business has invested significant amounts 
in best-in-class systems and processes, 
which make it highly scalable and provide 
efficient processing of back-office 
functions, freeing our people to focus 
on providing excellent service. 
The business grew strongly in FY17, 
generating revenue of £6.1 million and 
gross profit of £3.8 million, representing a 
margin of 61.9%. For FY16, this reporting 
segment comprised the Fresh Student 
Living business, which we acquired in 
February 2016. For the period 
post-acquisition, Fresh Student Living 
contributed £2.8 million to FY16 revenue 
and £1.7 million to gross profit. On a 
like-for-like basis, Fresh Student Living’s 
revenues for the year to 30 September 2016 
amounted to £5.1 million, at a gross 
margin of approximately 60%.
In addition to managing student schemes 
we developed, Fresh Property Group 
continued to win contracts to manage 
third-party developments during the year. 
In total, Fresh Property Group is currently 
contracted to manage 16,082 student 
beds across 52 schemes for the 2017/18 
academic year (2016/17 academic year: 
12,337 beds across 44 schemes). 
By FY20, Fresh Property Group is 
currently contracted to manage 20,628 
beds across 68 schemes, which is an 
increase of 1,992 beds since the date 
of Watkin Jones plc’s last annual report.
As explained on page 13, this number 
may initially be reduced by 5,124 beds as 
a consequence of the sale of a portfolio 
of assets by the Curlew Student Trust 
(“CST”). However, the launch of CST 2, 
which will have a life of 25 years, and for 
which Fresh will be the preferred property 
manager, presents a significant 
replacement growth opportunity.
We also continue to develop our letting 
and operational management services for 
the build to rent sector, where we are 
looking to leverage our capabilities and 
institutional relationships developed in 
PBSA. At the end year, there were five 
schemes managed under the Five Nine 
Living brand, with 535 units between 
them, including the development the 
Group completed in Leeds during the year.
Key initiatives to support the growth of 
Fresh Property Group in FY17 included 
launching a new website for Fresh Student 
Living. This offers a better service to 
students and, in turn, helps us to improve 
returns for our institutional clients. 
In addition, we launched the Five Nine 
Living website, which includes a full 
online booking system. We believe this 
functionality is currently unique in the 
build to rent market.
The quality of Fresh Property Group’s 
service was recognised by the industry 
during the year, when it won Operator 
of the Year at Property Week’s Student 
Accommodation Awards. A number of our 
front-line staff and teams were also 
winners at the inaugural Student Housing 
Leadership Awards.

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 Our residential business  
made good progress in the 
year, with improving profit  
and margins.
Mark Watkin Jones
Chief Executive Officer
The residential business performed 
in line with our expectations in the year. 
It completed 94 sales in FY17 (2016: 127), 
resulting in revenue of £18.1 million, 
down from £26.3 million in FY16. Revenue 
in the prior year included £11.0 million 
of sales at nil-margin from the Group’s 
legacy development sites in Droylsden, 
Manchester and the Cestria, Chester 
development. Sales in FY17 included 
£6.0 million of nil-margin sales from these 
two sites. Sales at Droylsden, Manchester 
are ongoing and will continue to release 
cash from inventory.
With fewer nil-margin sales from legacy 
sites and more profitable schemes coming 
into development during FY17, the gross 
margin was increased to 16.7% 
(FY16: 11.5%).
Our objective is to continue to grow 
the residential business, acquiring 
suitable sites to enable us to maintain 
a land bank sufficient for around three 
years of development. At the year end, 
the land bank was 589 plots 
(30 September 2016: 573 plots).
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 25 We bring forward accommodation in many of the UK’s cities and towns 
and have extensive experience of working within sensitive planning 
environments, where careful consultation is necessary to ensure 
schemes respond to specific local policies.

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 Our stakeholders include our people, 
clients, supply chain and communities, all 
of which are fundamental to our business 
model and may be positively or negatively 
affected by our activities. In addition, we 
look to minimise our impact on both the 
local and global environment.
People
Watkin Jones’ success relies on having 
a highly skilled and motivated workforce. 
As outlined in the Chairman’s and Chief 
Executive Officer’s statements, investing 
in our leadership was a key feature of the 
year. In a growing business, we need 
leaders with the capabilities and capacity 
to take on bigger roles and ensure we 
maintain our excellent record of delivery. 
We will seek to bring through talented 
people who are already in the organisation, 
while identifying any gaps we need to fill.
Our people benefit from tailored 
personal and professional development 
programmes. These include 
award-winning initiatives such as our 
graduate placements, apprenticeships, 
management development programmes 
and construction skills certification 
schemes. To attract the next generation 
of talent into the industry, we spend 
considerable time engaging with schools 
and careers advisers, to explain the broad 
range of careers and trades available to 
young people, and run a scholarship for 
students studying construction.
We regularly monitor our people’s training 
needs and have a continuous learning 
process, from on-boarding and induction 
to a culture of managing performance. 
Performance reviews take place regularly 
with line managers and our Training & 
Development Manager. To continually 
improve and promote our learning culture, 
we have a competency framework linked 
to our values. Learning and development 
is a fundamental factor. We encourage 
learning, with the courses available to our 
people ranging from Construction 
Apprenticeships, HNCs and BScs in 
Construction to professional qualifications 
and health and safety training.
Training methods are varied and include 
e-learning, seminars and external training. 
Focus groups share professional 
knowledge and we continue to inspire a 
culture of shared successes. We monitor 
and review learning outcomes and 
successes to produce an annual human 
resources strategy, thus ensuring we meet 
the Group’s future needs for skilled and 
talented people.
We pride ourselves on providing good 
terms of employment, promoting health 
and wellbeing and ensuring a vibrant, 
happy and safe working environment. 
Our human resources department seeks 
to ensure we treat staff fairly and with 
respect, in accordance with our equality 
and diversity policy. We maintain open 
lines of communication, including 
employee communication forums and 
focus groups, to ensure our employees 
have a voice, and we actively listen to 
their ideas.
General Data Protection 
Regulation (“GDPR”)
In preparation for the introduction of the 
GDPR legislation in May 2018 we are 
creating an Audit Checklist using the 
GDPR legislation, its recitals, Supervisory 
Authority guidance and the Article 29 
Working Party (to become European Data 
Protection Board under GDPR) opinions, 
letters and recommendations. It will cover 
every aspect of the data protection 
standards and requirements and will be 
used to review, assess and improve the 
measures and controls that will be put in 
place to protect data subjects, their rights 
and their personal information. 
We will include an action plan template 
with the GDPR checklist to be used to 
audit existing measures and record 
progress towards becoming GDPR 
compliant. This will necessitate the 
completion of an action plan after each 
audit to identify gaps and propose 
solutions, actions and mitigations to 
ensure compliance. Action plans and 
completed audits will be retained for 
six years and be made available to the 
Supervisory Authority upon request. 
As the Group continues to grow, we seek to ensure 
that our actions and policies reflect our commitment 
to economic, social and environmental sustainability.

Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 29 Clients
Our clients are leading institutional 
investors, who acquire the PBSA and build 
to rent developments we produce, and 
employ us to manage them on their behalf.
We maintain close relationships with 
our clients, so we can understand the 
types of development and locations that 
are attractive to them. We foster these 
relationships both formally and informally, 
and at a variety of levels. While we work 
on a repeat basis with existing clients, 
we also aim to add new clients each year. 
In FY17, we worked with three institutions 
for the first time.
When we look for an investor for a 
particular site, we typically approach a 
select group of institutions whose 
investment needs are met by that site. 
From time to time, however, we will make a 
development available on the open market, 
allowing us to assess investor appetite and 
ensure we are achieving robust prices.
Supply chain
Our supply chain is crucial to successfully 
delivering our schemes. We look for 
opportunities to work closely with our supply 
chain partners, for mutual benefit. This 
includes negotiating national rates with key 
subcontractors, while they benefit from a 
highly visible and growing workload with us.
By carefully managing our supply chain, 
we simplify our construction process, 
reduce risk, and generate cost, 
maintenance and environmental benefits. 
Health and safety
Protecting the health and safety of our 
people and subcontractors is vital. 
Compliance is our absolute minimum 
standard and we strive to continuously 
improve our procedures. We operate a 
behavioural safety programme to promote 
a strong health and safety culture within 
our business and this has led to a 
progressive reduction in the number of 
accidents and incidents. Our approach 
involves training programmes for all 
employees, enforcing rigorous and 
mandatory procedures, comprehensive 
risk assessments, regular systems audits 
and ongoing review of procedures.
We have a robust health and safety 
management system and we are full 
members of the British Safety Council. 
We support the construction industry’s 
Working Well Together campaign. We are 
also fully accredited by the Construction 
Health and Safety Assessment Scheme 
and, together with key developers, we work 
to improve safety standards across the UK.
Diversity and inclusion

diversity as at the year end.

Senior 
management 90 14 92 12
Other 
employees 231 339 241 251
Total 325 353 337 263
The construction industry has traditionally 
been male dominated and this is reflected 
in the proportion of men in senior roles. 
We take diversity, including gender, into 
account during recruitment and recognise 
the benefits that diversity brings. 
The growth of the accommodation 
management business is bringing more 
women into the Group, including in more 
senior roles.
Gender pay reporting is now a legislative 
requirement and we will be reporting our 
findings on the government website before 
April 2018, together with our statement on 
how we will act on the data collected. 
We see this as a positive opportunity to 
demonstrate the Group’s commitment to 
building a diverse and inclusive workplace 
that provides equal opportunities to all 
employees, irrespective of gender.

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 These procedures are designed to ensure 
that we comply with relevant legislation. 
We will continue to adopt best practice 
wherever possible, to promote the 
principles of sustainable construction.
Carbon footprint
We are always looking to reduce 
our carbon footprint and keep carbon 
emissions as low as possible. 
We achieve this through selection of 
materials; choosing low emission, fuel 
efficient vehicles; sourcing from local 
suppliers where possible; and using 
energy efficient heating and lighting 
systems within our buildings. 
Even though our activity levels have 
increased, we have managed to reduce our 
carbon emissions proportionally. Reducing 
our carbon footprint is a high priority for us 
and we continue to look to improve and 
make use of new technologies. 
Waste diverted from landfill
We continue to perform well with regard 
to diverting waste from landfill and our 
performance in this area is comparable 
with the best in our industry. We achieve 
this by ensuring wherever possible that 
waste is segregated on site and that we 
select waste management companies who 
have the ability to divert the majority of 
waste from landfill sites. This is again an 
area we continue to monitor and look for 
ways to improve our performance.
Build to rent developments are a high-quality 
source of new homes, which help to relieve 
pressure on local housing stock. Councils 
also often see PBSA developments as a 
way of addressing housing shortages. 
A large PBSA development can free up 
more than 100 homes that were previously 
occupied by students, making them 
available to local families.
The Watkin Jones Community Fund 
supports projects that make a real 
difference to the communities in which 
we work. During FY17, the fund made 
donations to a wide range of charities, 
sport clubs and other community groups. 
We also support and actively encourage 
our employees to help local community 
organisations and activities.
Environment
Many of our activities affect the 
environment and we are committed to 
minimising our impact. As an ISO 14001 
accredited company, our environmental 
policy and waste monitoring procedures 
are well established throughout the Group. 
They include:
• establishing detailed waste 
management plans before work begins 
on our sites;
• reclaiming and recycling materials in 
an environmentally friendly manner 
wherever possible;
• maintaining site boundaries to minimise 
windblown contamination;
• using water spray during dry conditions 
to minimise dust pollution; and
• regularly monitoring noise levels to keep 
unavoidable disturbances to a minimum.
Our process for working with our supply 
chain includes:
• a detailed evaluation of potential 
suppliers, looking at their quality, safety, 
environmental and financial 
performance;
• defining and tracking the key 
procurement activities and dates for 
each project;
• selecting suppliers and subcontractors 
for each project, taking into account 
location, current workload, type and 
size of project, and cost;
• on-site quality control, including 
records of progress and performance;
• performance review on completion, 
to ensure our supply chain partners are 
delivering to the required standard; and
• continuous improvement, by identifying 
issues and acting on them.
Our vision is for our entire supply chain to 
embrace and share our commitment to 
sustainable development and ethical 
business practices.
Communities
The biggest benefit we deliver to our 
communities is through our day-to-day 
business activities. As a condition of 
obtaining planning consent for our 
developments, we often undertake 
improvement work in the local area, 
which can range from providing affordable 
homes to contributions towards new 
schools, landscaping and enhancing 
roads and public realm areas.

FINANCIAL
REVIEW
The Group delivered another strong financial 
performance in FY17 , with growth in revenue, 
gross margin and earnings.
Philip Byrom
Chief Financial Officer
The Group delivered another strong 
financial performance in FY17, with 
growth in revenue, gross margin and 
earnings. No exceptional costs were 
incurred in FY17. The solid increase in 
revenues to £301.9 million, coupled with 
a gross margin achieved of 21.0%, led to 
a profit for the year of £35.8 million and 
an increase in basic earnings per share to 
14.0 pence. Cash flow from operations 
was also strong, with cash balances 
increased by £18.1 million to £65.3 million.
Revenue
Revenue from continuing operations rose 
by 13.1% to £301.9 million, primarily as 
a result of growth in our student 
accommodation development activities, 
which showed a £19.0 million (8.0%) 
increase in revenue, and a full-year 
contribution from the Fresh Student Living 
accommodation management business 
we acquired in FY16. Fresh contributed 
revenues of £6.1 million in FY17, compared 
to £2.8 million for the seven-month 
post-acquisition period last year. This 
growth was partially offset by an expected 
reduction in revenue from residential sales, 
which benefited in FY16 from a higher 
level of sales from legacy sites. More 
information about the performance of 
each business can be found in the 
operating review on pages 18 to 25.
As well as the revenue generated by 
our primary businesses, we earned 
£20.4 million (FY16: £0.7 million) of 
additional revenue from the development 
of commercial property associated with 
mixed-use planning consents. This 
revenue is reported within our corporate 
segment and for FY17 related to the 
forward sales of a hotel and offices at 
our Christchurch Road, Bournemouth 
development site. We also completed the 
delivery of 454 student beds at this site 
in the year.

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 Gross profit increased to £63.5 million (FY16: £53.8 million), 
with an increase in the gross margin to 21.0% (FY16: 20.1%).
Gross profit
Gross profit increased to £63.5 million 
(FY16: £53.8 million), resulting in a gross 
margin of 21.0% (FY16: 20.1%). The higher 
gross margin reflects the quality of 
location of our student accommodation 
developments and the effective acquisition 
of land sites for development at 
competitive prices. The gross margin for 
the student accommodation development 
business increased to 22.1% from 20.5% 
in FY16. In addition, the margin benefited 
from the full-year contribution from Fresh, 
which contributed a margin of 61.9%, and 
from an improved margin on residential 
sales. Residential sales in FY16 included 
£11.0 million of sales from legacy 
development sites at nil margin, compared 
to £6.0 million in FY17, which led to an 
improvement in the residential gross 
margin from 11.5% to 16.7%. Excluding 
the sales from legacy sites at nil margin, 
the margin from the underlying residential 
business improved to 25.0% from 
19.8% in FY16.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses include the 
costs of Group support services, as well 
as head office costs, and were in line 
with our expectations at £20.8 million 
(FY16: £15.9 million). This reflects a full 
year of additional costs as a public 
company, an increase in support services 
personnel to support the growth in the 
Group’s operations, a full year of 
overheads for Fresh and some investment 
in this business to create the platform for 
its expansion into the build to rent sector.
Operating profit  
before exceptional items
There were no exceptional items in FY17 
and the operating profit achieved was 
£42.7 million, representing a margin of 
14.1%. As described below, the Group 
incurred exceptional costs associated with 
the IPO in FY16. Adjusting for these 
resulted in an operating profit before 
exceptional items of £37.9 million in FY16, 
representing a margin of 14.2%.
Exceptional items
In FY16, the Group incurred a number of 
exceptional costs in relation to its IPO. 
These totalled £26.6 million and comprised 
£6.5 million of transaction-related fees and 
commissions, and £20.1 million for settling 
share-based management incentive 
arrangements that triggered on completion 
of the IPO.
Profit on disposal  
of interest in joint venture
The Group disposed of its joint venture 
interest in Athena Hall (Jersey) Limited 
during the year, realising a profit on 
disposal of £0.9 million. This company 
owned a student accommodation property 
in Ipswich that had previously been 
developed by the Group. The proceeds 
received from the disposal, including the 
repayment of a loan to Athena Hall (Jersey) 
Limited, amounted to £6.2 million, of which 
£0.7 million remains owed by way of a loan 
to the purchaser and is repayable within 
three years from the date of the transaction.

REVIEW continued
Share of profit in joint ventures
Our share of profit in joint ventures totalled 
£0.5 million, compared to £3.0 million in 
FY16. We have several joint ventures with 
Lacuna Developments Limited, based in 
Northern Ireland, which enable us to 
benefit from development opportunities 
in Belfast. One student accommodation 
scheme was completed in FY17, with a 
second in build for delivery in FY18. 
Finance costs
Our net finance costs totalled £0.8 million, 
down from £1.0 million in FY16. This was 
largely a consequence of our increased 
cash balances. We continue to incur 
finance costs on the loans which we have 
with Svenska Handelsbanken AB, as well 
as for having available our revolving credit 
facility with HSBC (page 35).
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was 
£7.5 million, representing an effective tax 
rate of 17.3%. This reflects the underlying 
tax rate for the year of 19.5%, following the 
reduction in the headline rate from 20% to 
19% in April 2017, coupled with the benefit 
of a prior year adjustment of £0.8 million, 
as a result of finalising the tax 
computations for FY16. This adjustment 
arose from various items and deductible 
expenses, partly relating to the IPO, which 
were not taken into account when the tax 
numbers for the FY16 financial statements 
were prepared.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing 
operations were 14.0 pence. In FY16, the 
calculation of earnings per share was 
affected by the change in the number of 
shares in issue as a result of the IPO. 
On a proforma basis, after adjusting for 
the impact of the exceptional IPO costs 
and using the number of shares in issue 
at 30 September 2016, basic earnings 
per share for FY16 were 12.4 pence.

Dividends
As discussed in the Chairman’s statement 
on page 08, the Board has recommended 
a final dividend of 4.4 pence per share, 
giving a total dividend for the year of 
6.6 pence per share. The cash cost of 
the final dividend will be £11.2 million. 
At 30 September 2017, the Company had 
distributable reserves of £152.8 million 
available to pay the final dividend.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure 
of underlying performance for the Group. 
It is calculated as operating profit plus 
profit from joint ventures, before interest, 
tax, depreciation, amortisation and 
exceptional items.
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 8.6% 
to £45.2 million (FY16: £41.6 million), 
representing an adjusted EBITDA margin 
of 15.0% (FY16: 15.6%).
Cash flows
The Group’s cash flow was strong. 
A net cash inflow from operating 
activities of £19.2 million was achieved 
after absorbing £18.4 million into working 
capital, mainly in respect of amounts 
recoverable on developments. Shortly 
after the year end we received 
£22.8 million of cash relating to forward 
sales we agreed during FY17, but which 
were not contractually completed in time 
to receive the cash by the year end. 
This was in respect of our development 
sites at Pittodrie Street, Aberdeen and 
Midland Road, Bath.
We spent £12.4 million in paying dividends, 
the impact of which was reduced by 
£5.6 million of cash received from our joint 
venture interests, principally the proceeds 
from the disposal of Athena Hall (Jersey) 
Limited, and by £6.0 million net cash inflow 
from borrowings.
Our strong cash generation  
results from our forward sale model.

Strategic report
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 The resultant net increase in cash of 
£18.1 million gave closing cash balances 
of £65.3 million. Net cash at the year end, 
after deducting borrowings of £24.3 million, 
amounted to £41.0 million. In comparison, 
net cash at 30 September 2016 stood at 
£32.2 million, made up of £47.2 million of 
cash less borrowings of £15.0 million.
Statement of  
financial position
During the year we invested £3.6 million 
in new plant, principally tower cranes 
required to support our development 
programme. These assets were acquired 
under hire purchase agreements. 
The Group’s investment in joint ventures 
was reduced by £4.1 million as a result of 
the disposal of Athena Hall (Jersey) 
Limited. As noted above, working capital 
increased by £18.4 million over the period, 
with trade and other receivables 
increasing by £21.5 million to £36.3 million. 
Inventory and work in progress stood at 
£125.2 million at 30 September 2017, 
compared to £128.2 million at the end of 
the previous year. The inventory balance 
includes £11.5 million invested in the 
acquisition of the Sutton build to rent site. 
Despite this, after adjusting for the timing 
of the forward sales receipts referred to 
above, our working capital position would 
have been relatively unchanged.
Bank facilities
At 30 September 2017, the Group had 
undrawn borrowing facilities of £36.7 million 
with HSBC Bank plc, comprising a 
£40 million five-year revolving credit facility 
(“RCF”), which matures on 15 March 2021, 
and a £10 million on demand and undrawn 
working capital facility. The RCF is available 
to support our land procurement and 
development opportunities and can be 
used for strategic land acquisitions or to 
fund discrete development activities, 
primarily the residential or commercial 
elements of certain larger mixed-use 
developments, alongside the forward sale 
model. We utilised the RCF to assist with 
several site acquisitions during the year and 
to fund the build of the hotel and offices at 
Christchurch Road, Bournemouth.
The Group’s loan facilities with Svenska 
Handelsbanken AB, used to fund the 
operating build to rent stock which the 
Group holds in Sheffield and Droylsden, 
were renewed for a further five-year term 
in March 2017. The outstanding balance 
on these loans at 30 September 2017 
amounted to £8.4 million.

Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 35 PRINCIPAL RISKS 
AND UNCERTAINTIES
This section sets out some of the risks our business faces. If any 
of the following risks were borne out in reality, there could be an 
impact on our business, its financial condition or results. 
Risk Impact Link to business model Mitigation Net risk assessment
Market and economic conditions
A change in the student market or in economic 
conditions could lead to reduced demand for 
PBSA or investors seeking increased yields.
Reduced demand could restrict the 
number of schemes we can forward sell 
each year. An increase in client yield 
expectations would result in compression 
of development values.
•  Transaction and funding • The forward sale model provides the Group with a degree of resilience. A two to three-year pipeline 
of committed contracts provides the Group with time to respond to market changes. 
• The student market remains attractive, with student numbers continuing to grow and university 
places consistently oversubscribed. UK demographics are positive, with an upturn in the number 
of 17 to 21-year-olds coming through from 2021.
• 75% of university PBSA was built pre-1999 and needs replacing. 
• Legislative changes relating to student housing/multiple occupancy properties are helping to 
stimulate the requirement for PBSA.
• There is a continuing “flight to quality” as students prefer PBSA over traditional, and typically 
inferior, landlord-run properties.
• Careful selection of sites in the right locations maintains demand for new PBSA developments 
from both students and investors.
Impact: Moderate
Likelihood: Remote
The PBSA and build to rent markets are attractive, 
which could encourage new entrants and result in 
increased competition.
Increased competition could increase 
land prices or make it harder to secure 
attractive sites. More developments 
would be brought to market, with a 
potential reduction in demand for 
Watkin Jones’ schemes.
• Site procurement and planning
• Transaction and funding
• The Group has a competitive advantage in that it provides the full end-to-end service for clients, 
which provides a barrier to entry.
• Watkin Jones holds “tier 1” developer status, which is a requirement for institutional funds to 
engage on a forward sale basis.
• The Group benefits from economies of scale, has established subcontractor supply chains and 
delivery expertise, which makes it harder for new entrants to compete.
Impact: Minor
Likelihood: Possible
Development costs
Under the forward sale model, the development 
price is agreed at the outset, which means the 
Group then carries the cost risk.
Incorrect cost estimates or increases in 
material or labour costs could result in the 
Group not achieving its expected 
development returns.
• Construction and delivery • The Group’s specialism and experience in building PBSA helps the accurate estimation of 
development costs. 
• Subcontractor orders are placed as early as possible in the construction phase, ensuring prices 
are locked in and taking the risk out of cost inflation as the build progresses.
• The Group has economies of scale and buying power, which has enabled it to secure national 
supply agreements. 
• Designs have been standardised to enable conformity of material supply and build processes.
Impact: Minor
Likelihood: Possible
Delivery risk
We could fail to complete student accommodation 
developments on time, ahead of the start of the 
academic year.
If a development is not completed on time, 
this would result in financial penalties and 
would damage the Group’s reputation for 
on-time delivery, which could make it more 
difficult to sell future developments.
• Transaction and funding
• Construction and delivery
• The Group’s specialism and experience in building PBSA means that construction programming 
and techniques are well established to ensure on-time delivery. The Group has an outstanding 
record of on-time delivery, achieved across 107 schemes. 
• The senior construction management team has many years of experience with the Group in 
building PBSA.
• As a complete developer of PBSA, the Group is in control of the overall timescale for delivery of a 
scheme and can therefore ensure that projects are started on site sufficiently early. The Group can 
take the decision to defer a project for a year if there are planning delays.
Impact: Moderate
Likelihood: Unlikely
Business continuity and disaster recovery
There is a risk that business continuity is not 
maintained in response to a disaster or other 
business continuity event.
A failure to maintain business continuity 
could lead to financial loss, a delay to the 
delivery of schemes or loss of personnel.
• Site procurement and planning
• Transaction and funding
• Construction and delivery
• Asset management
• The Group’s activities are geographically dispersed and there is no dependence on one location.
• A business disaster recovery plan is in place for the Group’s key information systems.
• System data backup routines are in place.

Cash flow risk
Cash flow constraints could result in the inability 
to meet financial commitments or source new 
land opportunities.
Cash flow constraints could lead to an 
over-dependence on banking facilities, 
leading to an increase in borrowing costs, 
and could limit the Group’s ability to 
source new sites, with a resultant impact 
on future profitability.
• Site procurement and planning
• Transaction and funding
• The forward sale model significantly helps to reduce the Group’s cash requirements, 
as developments should be cash positive once they have been forward sold.
• The cost of site acquisitions is generally known several months in advance, as the purchase 
commitment is usually subject to receipt of a satisfactory planning permission. This provides good 
visibility of future commitments and enables the Group’s cash flow requirements to be managed. 
• Regular cash flow forecasts are prepared and are subject to review by the Executive Directors.
• The Group had cash of £65.3 million at 30 September 2017 and has a £40 million five-year revolving 
credit facility available, which had headroom of £26.6 million at 30 September 2017.
Impact: Moderate
Likelihood: Unlikely
Human resources
There is a risk of over-reliance on senior 
management to drive the Group’s performance 
and success.
The loss of a number of senior 
management personnel would result in 
a significant knowledge loss and would 
affect the Group’s ability to deliver its 
targets and meet its strategic objectives 
in the short to medium term.
• Site procurement and planning
• Transaction and funding
• Construction and delivery
• Asset management
• Senior Directors are significant shareholders in the Company and have a vested interest in ensuring 
its continued success.
• Senior management are incentivised through an annual bonus scheme. A rolling three-year LTIP is 
proposed to help drive performance and encourage longer-term commitment.
• Succession planning is starting to be put in place for senior positions.
• Being a public company and with a successful track record makes it easier to attract the right 
quality of applicants for senior positions.
Impact: Moderate
Likelihood: Possible
We may find it difficult to recruit and retain

A failure to attract, recruit and retain the 
right personnel for the business could 
restrict its ability to grow and could result 
in development margins being eroded,

Health and safety
By their nature, construction sites are inherently 
high-risk environments. There is a risk that a failure 
to follow established health and safety procedures 
could result in serious incident or fatality.

Historic PBSA lease commitments
Historically the Group has entered into operating 
leaseback arrangements in respect of several of 
its PBSA developments, in order to enhance their 
sales price by providing a secure level of income 
return to the purchaser of the asset. There is the 
risk that future net rental returns from the 
operation of the property may be less than 
the lease rental commitments.
If future net rental returns from the 
operation of the property are less than the 
lease rental commitments, there would be 
a financial cost to the Group, which could 
impact its earnings and cash position.
• None • The properties concerned are managed by Fresh Student Living, which means the Group is in a 
position to maximise future net rental returns.
• Provision has historically been made in the financial statements to cover the discounted cost to the 
Group of lease commitments, where the expected future net rental returns are less than the lease 
rental commitments.
• Several of the leases are expected to generate significant positive net returns for the Group, so that 
on a blended basis the Group’s risk is mitigated.

the principles that are appropriate for a 
company of our size and nature.
The Group has suitable governance 
structures in place and we have continued 
to develop and embed the processes and 
procedures that support our governance 
framework. This ensures that the Board 
and the business can operate effectively, 
while protecting the Group’s 
entrepreneurial culture. Examples include 
reviewing delegated authorities and 
formalising our whistleblowing policy, 
including implementing an external 
helpline. These enhancements to our 
governance and controls will continue 
in the coming year.
During the year, the Board reviewed and 
debated the Group’s strategy, which 
included presentations from each part 
of the business. The strategy has proved 
highly successful and the Board is 
convinced that it remains appropriate 
going forward. Having reaffirmed our 
commitment to it, the strategy has 
informed our budgeting and financial 
planning process. This helps to ensure 
that the Group will have the financial 
resources it needs to fulfil its strategy, 
while rewarding shareholders with 
progressive dividends.
In last year’s report, I noted that we 
intended to recruit a third Non-Executive 
Director. This would give the Board a 
majority of independent directors and 
allow the new member to become 
chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
This remains our intention. At the same 
time, we recognised that as a relatively 
new Board, we needed to spend some 
time working together so we could 
understand what skills and qualities 
– including diversity – would be most 
beneficial in a new director. Completing 
a formal appraisal of the Board and its 
effectiveness, which we began at the end 
of 2017, will also be important for informing 
this debate. We will take the findings into 
account when we begin the search for 
candidates in 2018.

Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 41 The Board
The Board comprises two Executive 
Directors and two independent 
Non-Executive Directors, including the 
Chairman. Biographies of the Directors 
can be found on page 41.
Mark Watkin Jones and Philip Byrom 
were appointed Directors under service 
agreements dated 16 March 2016. These 
contracts may be terminated by twelve 
months’ notice by either party. 
Grenville Turner and Simon Laffin were 
appointed to the Board by letters of 
appointment dated 26 February 2016. 
These appointments run for three years 
from the date of admission (23 March 2016) 
and are terminable on three months’ 
notice by either side.
The Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer have separate, clearly defined 
roles. The Chairman is responsible for 
overseeing the Board and the Chief 
Executive Officer is responsible for 
implementing the Group’s strategy 
and for its operational performance.
The Board meets regularly to consider 
strategy, performance and the framework 
of internal controls. To enable the Board to 
discharge its duties, all Directors receive 
appropriate and timely information, 
including briefing papers distributed 
in advance of Board meetings. 
Matters reserved for the Board for its 
decision include:
• approving the Group’s strategic aims 
and objectives;
• reviewing performance against the 
Group’s strategic aims, objectives and 
business plans;
• overseeing the Group’s operations;
• approving changes to the Group’s 
capital, corporate, management or 
control structures;
• approving results announcements 
and the annual report and financial 
statements;
• approving the dividend policy;
• declaring the interim dividend and 
recommending the final dividend and 
any special dividend;
• approving any significant changes in 
accounting policies; 
• approving the treasury policy;
• approving the Group’s risk appetite and 
principal risk statements;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk and control processes;
• approving major capital projects and 
material contracts or arrangements;
• approving all circulars, prospectuses 
and admission documents;
• ensuring a satisfactory dialogue 
with shareholders;
• establishing Board Committees and 
approving their terms of reference;
• approving delegated levels of authority;
• approving changes to the Board and its 
Committees;
• determining the remuneration policy 
for the Directors and other senior 
executives;
• providing a robust review of the Group’s 
corporate governance arrangements; 
and 
• approving all Board mandated policies.
All Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Chief Financial Officer, 
who ensures that the Board’s procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules and 
regulations are complied with, and to the 
professional company secretarial services 
of Prism Cosec. In addition, the Company 
has procedures to enable the Directors to 
obtain independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense, if necessary to 
further the Directors’ duties.
All of the Directors will stand for election 
at the forthcoming AGM.
Board Committees
The Board has Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees, which operate 
under written terms of reference. The 
reports of these Committees can be 
found on pages 44 to 48. 
The Board’s primary focus during the year has been 
to continue to develop the procedures that ensure 
effective corporate governance of the Group.

Governance
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 As Executive Directors, Mark Watkin 
Jones and Philip Byrom are not members 
of the Committees but were invited to 
attend meetings as appropriate to assist 
with the matters discussed.
Board effectiveness
In December 2017, the Board instigated 
procedures to conduct its first formal 
review of its performance. This will be an 
internal review, based on questionnaires 
issued to each Board member. The 
questionnaires will cover:
• Board processes and supporting 
materials;
• the role of the Board;
• Board composition;
• Board culture and dynamics;
• the organisation and effectiveness 
of the Board’s Committees;
• potential Board development 
needs; and
• Non-Executive Director individual 
effectiveness.
The findings of the review and any 
subsequent actions will be reported 
in the 2018 annual report.
Internal controls
The Board is ultimately responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. Any system of 
internal control can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The Board considers that the internal 
controls in place are appropriate for the 
Group’s size, complexity and risk profile. 
The key features of the Group’s internal 
control system include:
• the preparation of monthly management 
accounts and comparison to budget;
• clearly defined roles and 
responsibilities, with appropriate 
segregation of duties;
• clear authorisation and approval 
processes;
• regular preparation and review of 
cash forecasts;
• senior management review of material 
contracts and agreements; and
• approval by senior management of all 
land purchases and development sales 
agreements.
In November 2017, the Board approved the 
recommendation of the Audit Committee 
to appoint KPMG to provide internal audit 
services to the Group. KPMG will 
commence its internal audit services 
in January 2018.
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance 
of maintaining an open dialogue with 
shareholders, keeping them informed 
of the Group’s strategy, progress and 
prospects. As part of this, the Board is 
committed to a high standard of corporate 
reporting.
During the year, the Executive Directors 
continued their ongoing programme of 
meetings with existing and potential 
shareholders. Meetings took place after 
the release of the FY16 results in 
January 2017 and the FY17 interim 
results in June 2017.
The Board was kept informed about 
shareholders’ views after these meetings 
by follow up from the Company’s 
corporate brokers. 
In April 2017, the Executive Directors 
hosted a site visit for shareholders and 
analysts at The Court, Clarendon Quarter, 
Leeds, which is the Group’s first 
completed build to rent development, 
on the day of its official opening.
In September 2017, the Executive 
Directors hosted a further day of site visits 
to Mannequin House in London, which 
was completed in 2017, and to Duncan 
House, Stratford, East London, which 
is a mixed-use development under 
construction for delivery in FY19 
and comprising 511 student beds, 
44 residential apartments and nearly 
28,000 sq ft of academic teaching 
and affordable commercial space.
The Board intends to introduce a 
long-term incentive plan for the Executive 
Directors and a number of the Group’s 
other senior managers, which is discussed 
in more detail in the Remuneration 
Committee report on pages 47 and 48. 
In January 2018, the Chairman wrote to the 
top ten institutional shareholders to 
summarise the proposals and to request 
any feedback.
A key event during the year was the 
successful placing of 50.25 million existing 
shares in Watkin Jones plc of which 
49.25 million were held by the G&J Watkin 
Jones 1992 Settlement Trust and one 
million by Philip Byrom. These shares 
represented 19.7% of the Company’s 
share capital. The placing has broadened 
the share register, allowing some key 
institutions to acquire shares for the first 
time, and has also increased the liquidity 
of the shares.
Our advisers play an important part in 
helping us to communicate effectively with 
shareholders. In May 2017, we announced 
the appointment of Peel Hunt LLP as the 
Company’s nominated adviser and 
corporate broker. We appointed Jefferies 
Hoare Govett as joint corporate broker 
in June 2017.
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
The Company’s AGM will be held at 
10.30am on Tuesday 13 February 2018 
at the offices of Buchanan, 107 Cheapside, 
London EC2V 6DN. The Notice of Meeting, 
setting out the resolutions proposed, is 
contained in a separate document and is 
available on the Group’s website,

Relations with shareholders
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 43 Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for 
the year ended 30 September 2017. The Board is satisfied that I have the necessary recent 
and relevant financial experience to chair the Audit Committee.
The work of the Committee
In the year following the Company’s public listing, the Audit Committee continued to 
review and establish the procedures and systems necessary to ensure robust standards 
of financial control. Aside from the significant accounting judgements which are set out 
separately below, the Committee considered the following items during the year:
Policies and  
procedures
The Committee reviewed and approved both a new full Policies  
and Procedures Manual and a Board Procedures Manual.
Whistleblowing The Committee oversaw the setting up of a confidential, third-party 
hotline and ensured that this was widely publicised within the business.
Non-audit  
services
The Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s policy for  
non-audit services.
Treasury  
Policy
The Committee reviewed and recommended a Group Treasury Policy 
which the Board subsequently adopted.
Interim  
results
The Committee reviewed and approved the interim results taking into 
account a limited-scope interim review provided by EY.
Full-year  
results
The Committee reviewed EY’s plan for the full-year audit. The auditor 
informed the Committee that it would report unadjusted audit differences 
and significant judgemental items in excess of £0.1 million. The audit 
materiality level was £2.2 million.
Going  
concern
The Committee undertook a review of the Company’s going concern 
status at the reporting period end. 
Internal  
audit
The Committee reviewed the need for internal audit and agreed that the 
Company was of sufficient size to merit the appointment of a third party to 
provide this service. Following a full selection process, involving proposals 
submitted from three firms, the Committee recommended to the Board 
that KPMG be selected to provide this service. The Board approved this 
proposal and KPMG were subsequently appointed to provide internal 
audit services commencing January 2018. The scope of services to be 
provided will be to assist management in further developing its risk 
register and to carry out specific reviews designed to ensure that the 
controls in place to help mitigate against risks are operating effectively.
Delegated  
authorities
The Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s delegated  
authority matrix.
Executive  
Committee 
terms of 
reference
The Committee reviewed proposed terms of reference for the Executive 
Committee and made recommendations to the Board.
Dividend The Committee reviewed the Company’s distributable reserves on behalf 
of the Board before making recommendations on the interim and 
final dividends.
Revenue  
recognition 
and lease  
accounting 
The Committee discussed the potential implications of IFRS 15 and 
IFRS 16 on the Company with the auditor. The Company has begun its 
initial assessment of the likely impacts, but the Committee considers it too 
early to quantify the financial effects.
The Audit Committee continued to review and 
establish the procedures and systems necessary  
to establish robust standards of financial control.

Governance
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 Effectiveness of  
the external auditor
In the first meeting following the conclusion 
of last year’s audit, the Committee and the 
Chief Financial Officer reviewed the 
performance of the auditor, looking at 
the audit scope, the cost effectiveness 
and the general performance and 
concluded that Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) 
continued to provide an effective service. 
The Committee and the Board remain 
satisfied with the performance of EY and 
have concluded that the firm is 
independent and has the necessary level 
of objectivity. The Board will, therefore, 
recommend that a resolution for the 
re-appointment of EY as external auditor 
for the Company should be proposed at 
the AGM in February 2018.
The management of risk
The Company has established a Risk 
Committee, which is a committee of the 
Executive Committee and is chaired by the 
Chief Executive Officer. The Company’s 
risk register is reviewed by the Risk 
Committee and any evolving trends or 
matters of concern are subject to review. 
In the coming year, the Risk Committee 
will work closely with internal audit to 
further develop the risk register and to 
review the effectiveness of mitigating 
controls. The minutes of the Risk 
Committee and reports of the internal 
auditor will be tabled at the Audit 
Committee meetings. The Chief Executive 
Officer and internal auditor will attend the 
Audit Committee meetings, or parts of 
those meetings, to report on risk and 
other salient matters. 
The Audit Committee’s  
risk assessment:
Revenue recognition: this is a presumed 
significant risk in all audit work, but the 
specific issue for us is recognition of 
long-term contract revenue.
Management override: this is also a 
presumed risk. The issue for the Audit 
Committee is ensuring that there are 
sufficient management controls to offset 
this risk.
Land and work-in-progress valuation: 
this is an important part of long term 
contract accounting. The Company has 
clear accounting policies for these 
valuations, with the forward sale model 
reducing the risk around the selling price.
Final year-end audit report
The Committee met with EY and reviewed 
their report on the year-end results. 
Careful consideration was given to:
• revenue recognition of projects under 
development and the valuation of 
work-in-progress. This was agreed as 
properly accounted for;
• the risks of management override of 
controls. The risk was noted and would 
be included in the brief to the new 
internal auditors;
• the control and documentation of 
related party transactions. It was agreed 
that the process would be more formally 
documented at all stages;
• quality of earnings. It was noted that 
there were no significant out of period 
movements in this year’s numbers;
• a number of immaterial corrected and 
uncorrected audit differences. These 
were accepted;
• the independence of the external 
auditor. EY has been the auditor for 
14 years, but the Committee was firm 
in its view that the auditor has retained 
its independence from management. 
EY did no chargeable work for the 
Company other than the audit and half 
year review; and
• new accounting and reporting 
standards. The Committee noted that all 
requirements for an AIM-listed business 
are being complied with.
Significant accounting  
estimates and judgements
The Committee reviewed a schedule 
of significant accounting estimates and 
judgements presented by management, 
with both internal and external auditors 
present. This highlighted:
• provisions for onerous lease 
commitments. These increased by 
£0.7 million this year as a result of 
historic lease commitments, effectively 
rent guarantees, on PBSA properties 
sold in prior years, reflecting some 
lower occupation levels. It is no longer 
the policy of the Company to enter into 
arrangements of this nature;
• bonus accrual. The accrual is made 
before the Remuneration Committee 
signs off the final bonus, which itself is 
based on the final published accounts; 
and
• carrying value of intangible assets. 
This relates to the carrying value of 
Fresh Student Living. A 20-year cash 
flow forecast was prepared that 
showed that the value booked was 
comfortably justified.

Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 45 NOMINATION 
COMMITTEE REPORT
We have established an Executive Committee to provide 
broadened responsibilities and exposure to executive 
management below the Executive Directors and to enable  
the effective delegation of operational responsibilities.
Priorities for FY18
In the coming year, the Committee has 
a number of priorities. These include:
• recruiting a new Chief Executive Officer;
• recruiting an additional Non-Executive 
Director, who will take over as chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee; and
• recruiting a deputy to the Chief Financial 
Officer who has the potential to be a 
successor in this role.
In considering candidates for the above 
roles, the Committee would like to take 
the opportunity to increase diversity. 
However, our overriding objective will 
be to appoint the people we believe 
are best for the roles.
Grenville Turner
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
12 January 2018
Dear Shareholder
In last year’s report, I set out three 
priorities for the Nomination Committee 
in FY17. The first of these was the 
recruitment of an additional Non-Executive 
Director. As I explain in my introduction to 
corporate governance on page 40, this 
remains our intention and will be a priority 
for FY18.
Our second priority for this year was to 
complete succession planning for the 
Executive Directors and oversee 
succession planning for the executives 
below Board level. This process is 
ongoing. We have structured the Executive 
Committee to provide broadened 
responsibilities and exposure to executive 
management below the Executive Directors 
and to enable the effective delegation of 
operational responsibilities. This will 
enable existing talented members of the 
Executive Committee to be developed. 
We are also in the process of recruiting 
a deputy CFO and we hope to be able 
to make this appointment in early 2018.
The third priority for FY17 was to 
introduce a formal recruitment process 
for senior positions. This process is 
now in place.
Diversity
We recognise the business benefits of 
diversity. Our aim is to go beyond the legal 
requirement to treat everyone fairly, so we 
ensure that Watkin Jones is an attractive 
employer to the widest possible workforce. 
As discussed in the diversity and inclusion 
section on page 30 of the strategic report, 
women remain under-represented at 
senior levels of the Group. In part, this 
is due to the nature of the industry in 
which we operate as well as to the relative 
stability of the senior team, which means 
we have had fewer opportunities to 
increase diversity. Going forward we will 
continue to look for ways to enhance all 
aspects of diversity across the Group.

Governance
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 Dear Shareholder
This report sets out the Group’s 
remuneration policy for the Directors 
and explains how this policy was applied 
during the year. It also outlines the 
proposed long-term incentive plan, which 
will be put to shareholders for approval at 
the AGM on 13 February 2018.
Remuneration policy
The Company continued to operate 
a simple remuneration policy for FY17. 
Executive Directors were eligible 
to receive:
• basic salary;
• annual bonus; 
• pension contributions; and
• other benefits, including a car allowance 
and health insurance.
Basic salaries
The current annual salaries of the 
Executive Directors are as follows:
• Mark Watkin Jones: £350,000; and
• Philip Byrom: £215,000.
The Committee reviews the Executive 
Directors’ salaries annually but is not 
obliged to increase them. In FY17 the 
Committee undertook a benchmarking 
review of executive remuneration to ensure 
that terms remain competitive with market 
practices and against other comparably 
sized AIM-listed and sector peers.
The Committee also considers:
• the performance, role and responsibility 
of each Director;
• the economic climate, market 
conditions and the Company’s 
performance; and
• the level of pay across the Group 
as a whole.
In FY17, following the benchmarking review 
exercise, Mark Watkin Jones received 
a 16.7% increase in basic salary and 
Philip Byrom received a 19.4% increase. 
This compared with an average 6.5% 
increase for salaries across the Group.
Annual bonus
The Executive Directors’ annual bonuses 
for FY17 were based on carefully chosen 
corporate performance and personal 
performance measures. These measures 
incentivise delivery of the plan for the year, 
as well as ensuring future performance 
through measures related, for example, 
to the development pipeline. 
The maximum bonus opportunity is 100% 
of basic salary for both Mark Watkin Jones 
and Philip Byrom. Three quarters of the 
annual bonus relates to corporate 
performance and one quarter to achieving 
personal targets. Of the annual bonus 
relating to corporate performance 75% is 
payable for achieving EBITDA in line with 
the market consensus.
For FY17, Mark Watkin Jones and 
Philip Byrom both received a bonus 
of 84.5% of salary.
Pensions
The Company contributes to pension 
plans for the Executive Directors at a 
rate of 10% of basic salary, which was 
increased from the previous rate of 7% 
in April 2017. The Directors may elect to 
receive all or part of the pension 
contribution in cash, provided that there 
is no difference in cost to the Company.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The current fees for the Non-Executive 
Directors are as follows:
• Grenville Turner: £125,000; and
• Simon Laffin: £52,000.
These fees are subject to annual review. 
The fees were not adjusted in FY17.
In 2017 the Committee undertook a benchmarking 
review of executive remuneration to ensure that terms 
remain competitive with market practices and against 
other comparably sized AIM-listed and sector peers.

Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 49 DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
in relation to the annual report and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent company 
financial statements for each financial year. 
As required by the AIM Rules of the London 
Stock Exchange they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law.
Under company law, the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and parent company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state 
whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by 
the EU;
• for the parent company financial 
statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Financial statements INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
to the members of Watkin Jones plc
Opinion
In our opinion:
• Watkin Jones plc’s Group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of Watkin Jones plc which comprise:
Group Parent company
Consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2017 Statement of financial position as at 30 September 2017
Consolidated income statement for the year  
then ended
Statement of changes in equity for the year  
then ended
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income  
for the year then ended
Related notes 39 to 44 to the financial statements including 
a summary of significant accounting policies
Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year  
then ended
Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended
Related notes 1 to 38 to the financial statements, including a  
summary of significant accounting policies
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards to the parent company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report 
below. We are independent of the Group and parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about 
the Group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Overview of our audit approach
Key audit matters • Revenue recognition
• Carrying value of land and work in progress
Audit scope • The Group solely operates in the United Kingdom. We performed an audit of the 
complete financial information of all the Group companies and we performed direct 
procedures on joint venture balances included within the Group financial statements.
Materiality •  Overall Group materiality of £2.2 million which represents 5% of pre-tax income.
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 51 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT continued
to the members of Watkin Jones plc
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition  
(Revenue – 2017: c.£302 million,  
2016: c.£267 million)
Refer to the Audit Committee report 
(pages 44 and 45); accounting policies 
(pages 59 to 64); and notes 6 and 7 to 
the consolidated financial statements 
(pages 65 and 66).
The Group’s main revenue stream comes 
from long-term contracts (2017: c.£278 million, 
2016: c.£238 million). In line with IAS 11 
‘Construction Contracts’, revenue and margin 
is recognised on a percentage of 
completion basis. 
There are various assumptions within the 
development appraisals regarding the 
estimated costs to complete which impact 
whether revenue and margin are recognised 
in the appropriate period. 
There is therefore a risk that the incorrect 
amount of revenue and cost has been taken 
to the income statement if the estimated 
costs to complete are incorrect, either due 
to error or management bias.
Revenue from residential sales of 
c.£18 million (2016: c.£26 million) was 
recognised on legal completion. There is 
a risk that revenue is not recorded in the 
appropriate period due to cut off errors 
or management bias. 
Accommodation management revenue of 
c.£6 million (2016: c.£3 million) and rental 
income of £21 million (2016: £14 million) 
were recognised in line with management 
services provided or rental agreements in 
place. There is a risk that revenue is not 
recorded in the appropriate period due to 
cut off errors or management bias. 
Our audit procedures included:
• evaluating the design and implementation 
of controls over revenue recognition; and 
• we performed audit procedures designed 
to address the risk of management override 
of controls including journal entry testing to 
confirm the processing and timing of 
journals to record revenue are consistent 
with our expectations.
In relation to long-term contract revenue: 
• we considered the revenue recognised with 
reference to the stage of completion, 
focusing on those developments not fully 
constructed pre year end;
• for all developments where revenue in 
excess of £162,000 was recognised in the 
year, we agreed revenue to signed 
development agreements and critically 
challenged the forecast cost to complete; 
and
• for a sample of costs incurred during the 
year, we verified that they had been 
allocated to the appropriate development.
In relation to residential sales: 
• we selected a sample of residential sales 
made in September 2017 and October 2017 
and corroborated the sale to the legal 
completion documentation and cash 
receipt.
In relation to accommodation management 
revenue/rental income:
• we selected a sample of sales invoices 
raised in September 2017 and October 
2017 and recalculated the revenue 
recognised and deferred at year end by 
reference to the service contract; and
• we performed substantive analytical review 
procedures. 
Scope of our procedures:
The whole Group was subject to full scope 
audit procedures over revenue.
We have audited the timing of revenue 
recognition and assessed the risk of 
management override. 
Based upon the audit procedures 
performed, we conclude that revenue 
(and the associated gross profit on the 
long-term contracts) has been recognised 
on an appropriate basis in the year.

Financial statements
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations communicated  
to the Audit Committee
Carrying value of land and work  
in progress 2017: c.£125 million 
(2016: c.£128 million) of inventories 
held split between land of 
c.£70 million (2016: c.£75 million) 
and work in progress of c.£55 million 
(2016: c.£53 million)
Refer to the Audit Committee report 
(pages 44 and 45); accounting policies 
(pages 59 to 64); and note 21 to the 
consolidated financial statements 
(page 78).
The valuation of inventories at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value requires 
significant judgements by management 
over the anticipated revenues and forecast 
development costs. 
There is therefore a risk that the carrying 
value of the land and work in progress 
balances reported within inventories are 
overstated. 
Our audit procedures included:
• we evaluated the design and 
implementation of controls over carrying 
value of land and work in progress;
• for land and work in progress developments 
held at 30 September 2017 with a carrying 
value in excess of £162,000, we: 
•  evaluated the assumptions made 
regarding selling price to market data 
and verified to post year end signed 
development agreements where relevant;
•  compared the actual and estimated 
costs and margin over the development 
lifecycle and validated key drivers for 
change in margin to assess 
management’s forecasting accuracy;
•  verified a sample of costs incurred in the 
year to purchase invoice; and
•  critically assessed the appropriateness 
of key assumptions and the 
development’s commercial viability; and
• for those sites determined to be most at 
risk of overstatement, we involved our 
internal valuation specialists to validate the 
value of land and work in progress held.
Scope of our procedures:
The whole Group was subject to full 
scope audit procedures over land and 
work in progress.
We have audited the inputs and 
assumptions used by management to 
assess the carrying value of land and work 
in progress.
We conclude that the inputs and 
assumptions applied are reasonable and 
that the carrying value of land and work in 
progress at 30 September 2017 is 
appropriate.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We performed 
an audit of the complete financial information of all the Group companies and we performed direct procedures on joint venture balances 
included within the Group financial statements.
Changes from the prior year 
There has been no change in our scope compared to the prior year.
Involvement with component teams 
All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the Group audit team.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.2 million (2016: £1.97 million), which is 5% (2016: 5%) of pre-tax income (2016: pre-tax 
income adjusted for exceptional costs). We believe that pre-tax income provides us with a key performance measure of management and 
is what the users of the financial statements are most interested in.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 75% (2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £1.67 million (2016: £1.48 million). We have set performance 
materiality at this level due to our past experience on the audit indicates a lower risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected. 
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 53 Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified 
misstatements are considered as being 
clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to them all uncorrected 
audit differences in excess of £0.1 million 
(2016: £0.1 million), which is set at 5% of 
planning materiality, as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected 
misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality 
discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in 
forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the 
information included in the annual report, 
including the strategic report and 
governance, set out on pages 02 to 49, 
other than the financial statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors 
are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read 
the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify such 
material inconsistencies or apparent 
material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements 
or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of the other 
information, we are required to report 
that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic 
report and the Directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and 
• the strategic report and Directors’ report 
have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are 
required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and the parent 
company and its environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we have not 
identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report or the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters in relation to which the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
• the parent company financial 
statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on 
page 50, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view, and for such internal control 
as the Directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group and parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the 
parent company or to cease operations, or 
have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
(UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements. 
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
A further description of our responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements is 
located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/ 
auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report.

Financial statements
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 30 September 2017
3.3 Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for 
using the acquisition method. The cost of 
any acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, 
measured at acquisition date fair value. 
There have been no non-controlling 
interests (“NCI”) recognised in the 
business combinations to date. 
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed 
and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, 
it assesses the assets and liabilities 
assumed for appropriate classification 
and designation in accordance with 
the contractual terms, economic 
circumstances and pertinent conditions 
as at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost 
being the excess of the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred over the net 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. If the fair value of the net assets 
acquired is in excess of the aggregate 
consideration transferred, the Group 
re-assesses whether it has correctly 
identified all of the assets acquired and all 
of the liabilities assumed and reviews the 
procedures used to measure the amounts 
to be recognised at the acquisition date. 
If the reassessment still results in an 
excess of the fair value of net assets 
acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised 
immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
After initial recognition, goodwill is 
measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is carried in 
the statement of financial position at 
deemed cost as at 1 October 2012, the 
date of transition to IFRS for the Group, less 
accumulated impairment losses. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is, from 
the acquisition date, allocated to each of 
the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to 
those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a 
cash-generating unit (“CGU”) and part of 
the operation within that unit is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the 
disposed operation is included in the 
carrying amount of the operation when 
determining the gain or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill disposed in these circumstances 
is measured based on the relative values 
of the disposed operation and the portion 
of the CGU retained (note 17).
3. Accounting policies
3.1 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from 
the date of acquisition, being the date on 
which the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be consolidated until the date 
when such control ceases. Control is 
achieved when the Group is exposed, 
or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. The financial 
statements of the subsidiaries are 
prepared for the same reporting period 
as the parent company, using consistent 
accounting policies. All intra-group 
balances, transactions, unrealised gains 
and losses resulting from intra-group 
transactions and dividends are eliminated 
in full.
The consolidated financial statements 
of the Group for the year ended 
30 September 2017 and the comparatives 
for the year ended 30 September 2016 
have been prepared on the basis that 
Watkin Jones plc was in existence 
throughout these periods. The terms 
of the acquisition of the shares in 
Watkin Jones Group Limited, in the year 
ending 30 September 2016, were such 
that the Group reconstruction should be 
accounted for as a continuation of the 
existing Group rather than as an 
acquisition, and as such merger accounting 
was applied. The cash consideration paid 
as part of the Group reconstruction has 
been reflected against retained earnings 
as a distribution. Accordingly, the financial 
statements and the comparatives have 
been prepared on this basis.
3.2 Going concern
The financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. 
The Directors consider that it is appropriate 
for the financial statements to be prepared 
on this basis having considered all relevant 
information, including the Group’s trading 
and cash flow forecasts, the trading 
opportunities available to the Group and 
the ongoing support of its banks.
1. General information
Watkin Jones plc (the “Company”) is a 
public limited company incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies 
Act 2006 (registration number 9791105). 
The Company is domiciled in the United 
Kingdom and its registered address is 
21-22 Llandygai Industrial Estate, 
Llandygai, Bangor, Gwynedd LL57 4YH.
The principal activities of the Company 
and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) 
are those of property development and 
the management of properties for multiple 
residential occupation.
The consolidated financial statements 
for the Group for the year ended 
30 September 2017 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries. The basis 
of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements is set out in note 2 below.
2. Basis of preparation 
The financial statements of the Group 
have been prepared and approved by the 
Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union. 
The preparation of financial information 
in conformity with IFRS requires 
management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. 
Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the 
amount, event or actions, actual events 
may ultimately differ from those estimates.
The accounting policies set out below 
have, unless otherwise stated, been 
applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these financial statements. 
The financial statements are prepared on 
the historical cost basis except as 
disclosed in these accounting policies.
The financial statements are presented in 
pounds sterling and all values are rounded 
to the nearest thousand (£’000), except 
when otherwise indicated. 
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 59 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
for the year ended 30 September 2017
Contract costs
Contract costs include costs that relate 
directly to the specific contract and costs 
that are attributable to contract activity 
in general and can be allocated to the 
contract. Costs that relate directly to 
a specific contract comprise: site labour 
costs (including site supervision); costs 
of materials used in construction; 
depreciation of equipment used on 
the contract; costs of design, and 
technical assistance that is directly 
related to the contract.
The Group’s contracts are typically 
negotiated for the construction of a single 
asset or a group of assets which are closely 
interrelated or interdependent in terms 
of their design, technology and function. 
In certain circumstances, the percentage 
of completion method is applied to the 
separately identifiable components of a 
single contract or to a group of contracts 
together in order to reflect the substance 
of a contract or a group of contracts. 
Assets covered by a single contract are 
treated separately when:
• the separate proposals have been 
submitted for each asset;
• each asset has been subject to separate 
negotiation and the contractor and 
customer have been able to accept or 
reject that part of the contract relating 
to each asset; and
• the costs and revenues of each asset 
can be identified.
A group of contracts are treated as a 
single construction contract when:
• the group of contracts is negotiated as 
a single package; the contracts are so 
closely interrelated that they are, in 
effect, part of a single project with an 
overall profit margin; and
• the contracts are performed 
concurrently or in a continuous 
sequence.
Sale of completed property
Where a contract is judged to be for the 
sale of a completed property, revenue is 
recognised when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership of the real estate 
have been transferred to the buyer, which 
is normally on unconditional exchange of 
contracts. For conditional exchanges, 
sales are recognised only when all the 
significant conditions are satisfied.
Upon loss of joint control over a joint 
venture, the Group measures and 
recognises any retained investment at its 
fair value. Any difference between the 
carrying amount of the joint venture upon 
loss of joint control and the fair value of the 
retained investment and proceeds from 
disposal is recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income.
3.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent 
that the Group obtains the right to 
consideration in exchange for its 
performance. Revenue is measured at 
the fair value of the consideration received 
excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and 
other sales taxes or duty. The following 
criteria must also be met before revenue 
is recognised:
Construction contracts
The Group principally operates fixed 
price contracts. If the outcome of such 
a contract can be reliably measured, 
revenue associated with the construction 
contract is recognised by reference to 
the stage of completion of the contract 
activity at year end (the percentage of 
completion method).
The outcome of a construction contract 
can be estimated reliably when: (i) the total 
contract revenue can be measured 
reliably; (ii) it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the contract will 
flow to the entity; (iii) the costs to complete 
the contract and the stage of completion 
can be measured reliably; and (iv) the 
contract costs attributable to the contract 
can be clearly identified and measured 
reliably so that actual contract costs 
incurred can be compared with prior 
estimates. When the outcome of a 
construction cannot be estimated 
reliably (principally during early stages of 
a contract), contract revenue is recognised 
only to the extent of costs incurred that are 
expected to be recoverable.
In applying the percentage of completion 
method, revenue recognised corresponds 
to the total contract revenue (as defined 
below) multiplied by the actual completion 
rate based on the proportion of total 
contract costs (as defined below) 
incurred to date and the estimated 
costs to complete.
Contract revenue
Contract revenue corresponds to the initial 
amount of revenue agreed in the contract 
and any variations in contract work, claims 
and incentive payments to the extent that 
it is probable that they will result in 
revenue, and they are capable of being 
reliably measured.
3. Accounting policies continued
3.4 Investments in joint ventures
A joint venture is a type of joint 
arrangement whereby the parties that 
have joint control of the arrangement 
have rights to the net assets of the 
arrangement. 
Joint control is the contractually agreed 
sharing of control of an arrangement, which 
exists only when decisions about the 
relevant activities require the unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group’s investments in joint ventures 
are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in 
a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. 
The carrying amount of the investment is 
adjusted to recognise changes in the 
Group’s share of net assets of the joint 
venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill 
relating to the joint venture is included in 
the carrying amount of the investment and 
is not tested for impairment separately.
The statement of comprehensive income 
reflects the Group’s share of the results of 
operations of the joint venture. Any change 
in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) of 
those investees is presented as part of the 
Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has 
been a change recognised directly in the 
equity of the joint venture, the Group 
recognises its share of any changes, 
when applicable, in the statement of 
changes in equity. Unrealised gains and 
losses resulting from transactions 
between the Group and the joint venture 
are eliminated to the extent of the interest 
in the joint venture.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of 
profit or loss of a joint venture is shown 
on the face of the statement of 
comprehensive income outside operating 
profit and represents profit or loss after tax 
and OCI of the joint venture.
When necessary, adjustments are made 
to bring the accounting policies of joint 
ventures in line with those of the Group. 
After application of the equity method, the 
Group determines whether it is necessary 
to recognise an impairment loss on its 
investment in joint ventures. At each 
reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that 
the investment in joint ventures is 
impaired. If there is such evidence, the 
Group undertakes an impairment test and 
calculates the amount of any impairment 
as the difference between the recoverable 
amount of the joint venture and its carrying 
value, and then recognises the loss as 
‘share of profit of joint ventures’ in the 
statement of comprehensive income.

Financial statements
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 3.10 Impairment of property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets 
including goodwill
At each reporting period, the Group 
reviews the carrying amounts of its 
tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss (if any). 
Where it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset, 
the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit 
(“CGU”) to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset.
When the carrying amount of an asset or 
CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, 
the asset is considered impaired and is 
written down to its recoverable amount, 
with any impairment recognised 
immediately through the statement 
of comprehensive income. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful 
lives are not amortised, but are tested 
for impairment annually, either individually 
or at the CGU level. The assessment of 
indefinite life is reviewed annually to 
determine whether the indefinite life 
continues to be supportable. If not, the 
change in useful life from indefinite to finite 
is made on a prospective basis.
If indication exists that previously 
recognised impairment losses no longer 
exist or have decreased, the Group 
estimates the asset’s or CGU’s 
recoverable amount. A previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed 
only if there has been a change in the 
assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the 
last impairment loss was recognised. 
The reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed its 
recoverable amount, nor exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset in prior years. Such reversal is 
recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income unless the asset 
is carried at a revalued amount, in which 
case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation 
reserve. No impairment loss in respect of 
goodwill is permitted to be reversed. 
3.7 Segment reporting
Operating segments are identified in 
a manner consistent with the internal 
reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The Group determines its 
reportable segments having regard to 
permitted aggregation criteria with the 
principal condition being that the operating 
segments should have similar economic 
characteristics. For the purposes of 
determining its operating segments, the 
chief operating decision-maker has been 
identified as the Executive Committee. This 
Committee approves investment decisions, 
allocates the Group’s resources and 
reviews the internal reporting in order 
to assess performance. 
3.8 Other intangible assets
The cost of intangibles acquired as part 
of a business combination is the fair value 
at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets other than goodwill 
are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful 
lives of the intangible assets as follows:
Customer relationships: – eleven years 
Brand: – ten years
3.9 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated 
at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses. Cost represents 
expenditure that is directly attributable to 
the purchase of the asset.
Depreciation is charged so as to write 
off the costs of assets less their residual 
values over their estimated useful lives, 
on the following basis:
Aeroplane: – 4% straight line
Plant and machinery:  
 cranes – 5% reducing balance 
 other – 20% reducing balance
Motor vehicles: – 25% reducing balance
The assets’ estimated useful lives, 
depreciation rates and residual values 
are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, 
at the end of each reporting period. 
The gain or loss arising on disposal of an 
asset is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is 
recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Sales of property under development
Where a contract is judged to be for the 
construction of a property and the legal 
terms of the contract are such that the 
construction represents the continuous 
transfer of work in progress to the 
purchaser, the percentage of completion 
method of revenue recognition is applied 
and revenue is recognised as work 
progresses. Continuous transfer of 
work in progress is applied when:
• the buyer controls the work in progress, 
typically when the land on which the 
development is taking place is owned 
by the final customer; and
• all significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the work in progress in 
its present state are transferred to the 
buyer as construction progresses, 
typically when the buyer cannot put 
the incomplete property back. 
In such situations, the percentage of work 
completed is measured based on the 
costs incurred up until the end of the 
reporting period as a proportion of total 
costs expected to be incurred.
Rental income
Rents receivable are credited to the 
statement of comprehensive income 
on a straight-line basis. 
Accommodation management
Management fees relate to contracted 
charges for the provision of management 
services as an agent to landlords of student 
accommodation and build to rent 
properties. Management fees are 
recognised in line with the management 
contracts in the period to which they relate.
Dividends
Revenue is recognised when the Group’s 
right to receive payment is established.
3.6 Foreign currency
The Group’s presentational currency, 
which is pounds sterling, is also 
the functional currency of the parent 
and its subsidiaries. 
Foreign currency transactions are 
translated into the functional currency 
using the exchange rates prevailing at the 
dates of those transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the 
balance sheet date are retranslated at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at the date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income.
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 61 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
for the year ended 30 September 2017
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the 
Group’s profit for the year on an EIR basis 
except for interest costs that are directly 
attributable to the construction of 
qualifying assets, being the Group’s 
inventory. These are capitalised and 
included within the cost of the asset. 
Capitalisation commences when both 
expenditure on the asset and borrowing 
costs are being incurred, and necessary 
activities to prepare the asset for use are in 
progress. In the case of new developments, 
this is generally once planning permission 
has been obtained. Capitalisation ceases 
when the asset is ready for use or sale. 
Interest capitalised relates to borrowings 
specific to a development.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are carried 
at cost.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised 
when the obligation under the liability 
is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is 
replaced by another from the same lender 
on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, 
and the difference in the respective 
carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
3.14 Derivative financial instruments 
Initial recognition and subsequent 
measurement
The Group uses interest rate swaps to 
hedge interest rate risks. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on 
which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently remeasured at fair 
value. Derivatives are carried as financial 
assets when the fair value is positive and 
as financial liabilities when the fair value is 
negative and are included within other 
financial assets or liabilities on the Group’s 
balance sheet, as appropriate.
Any gains or losses arising from changes 
in the fair value of other derivatives are 
taken directly to the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting 
date whether there is any objective 
evidence that a financial asset or a group 
of financial assets is impaired. A financial 
asset or a group of financial assets is 
deemed to be impaired if, and only if, 
there is objective evidence of impairment 
as a result of one or more events that has 
occurred after the initial recognition of the 
asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that 
loss event has an impact on the estimated 
future cash flows of the financial asset or 
the group of financial assets that can be 
reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment 
may include indications that the debtors or 
a group of debtors is experiencing 
significant financial difficulty, default or 
delinquency in interest or principal 
payments, the probability that they will 
enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganisation and where observable 
data indicate that there is a measurable 
decrease in the estimated future cash 
flows, such as changes in arrears or 
economic conditions that correlate 
with defaults.
3.13 Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the case of 
loans and borrowings, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs. The 
subsequent measurement of financial 
liabilities depends on their classification 
as follows:
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (“EIR”) method. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income when 
the liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the EIR amortisation process. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included in finance costs in 
the statement of comprehensive income.
3. Accounting policies continued
3.11 Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost comprises all 
costs directly attributable to the purchasing 
and development of the property, including 
the acquisition of land and buildings, legal 
costs, attributable overheads, attributable 
finance costs and the cost of bringing 
developments to their present condition at 
the balance sheet date. Net realisable value 
is based on estimated selling price less the 
estimated cost of disposal. Provision is 
made for any obsolete or slow moving 
inventory where appropriate. 
3.12 Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised initially at 
fair value. The subsequent measurement 
of financial assets depends on their 
classification as follows:
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale (“AFS”) financial 
assets include equity and debt 
securities. Equity investments classified 
as AFS are those which are neither 
classified as held for trading nor 
designated at fair value through the 
statement of comprehensive income.
The Group’s investments in unit trust 
and equity interests held under shared 
ownership schemes are classified as 
AFS equity assets, and are included 
within other financial assets on the 
Group’s statement of financial position.
After initial measurement, AFS financial 
assets are subsequently measured at fair 
value with unrealised gains or losses 
recognised through OCI in the AFS reserve. 
When the investment is derecognised, the 
cumulative gain or loss is recognised in 
finance income. If the investment is 
determined to be impaired, the cumulative 
loss is reclassified to the statement of 
comprehensive income in finance costs. 
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. Loans and receivables are stated 
at cost less impairment. The losses arising 
from impairment are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income in 
cost of sales or other operating expenses.
The Group’s financial assets within trade 
and other receivables are classified as 
loans and receivables.

Financial statements
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 3.19 Employee benefits –  
long-term incentive plans
The cost of the incentive schemes is 
measured at the grant date, taking into 
account the terms attaching to the awards, 
and at each balance date thereafter until 
the awards are settled. During the vesting 
period a liability is recognised representing 
the product of the cost of the reward and 
the portion of the vesting period expired at 
the balance sheet date. Changes in the 
carrying amount for the liability are 
recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income for the period.
3.20 Leases
The determination of whether an 
arrangement is (or contains) a lease is 
based on the substance of the 
arrangement at the inception of the lease. 
The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if 
fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent 
on the use of a specific asset or assets 
and the arrangement conveys a right to 
use the asset or assets, even if that right is 
not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
Group as a lessee
A lease is classified at the inception date 
as a finance lease or an operating lease. 
A lease that transfers substantially all the 
risks and rewards incidental to ownership 
to the Group is classified as a finance 
lease. Finance leases are capitalised at the 
commencement of the lease at the 
inception date fair value of the leased 
property or, if lower, at the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. Lease 
payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and reduction of the lease 
liability so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability. Finance charges are recognised in 
finance costs in the statement of 
comprehensive income. A leased asset is 
depreciated over the useful life of the 
asset. However, if there is no reasonable 
certainty that the Group will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term, 
the asset is depreciated over the shorter 
of the estimated useful life of the asset 
and the lease term.
An operating lease is a lease other than a 
finance lease. Operating lease payments 
are recognised as an operating expense in 
the statement of comprehensive income 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
3.16 Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer 
a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement 
date. The fair value measurement is based 
on the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liability takes 
place either:
• in the principal market for the asset or 
liability; or
• in the absence of a principal market, in 
the most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous 
market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is 
measured using the assumptions that 
market participants would use when 
pricing the asset or liability, assuming that 
market participants act in their economic 
best interest.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value 
is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair 
value hierarchy, described as follows, 
based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole:
• Level 1 – quoted (unadjusted) market 
prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 – valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable; and
• Level 3 – valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is significant 
to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable.
3.17 Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the 
statement of financial position comprises 
cash at bank and in hand.
3.18 Employee benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution 
plan, for which it pays contributions to 
privately administered pension plans on a 
contractual basis. The contributions are 
recognised as an employee benefit 
expense as they fall due.
Interest rate swaps  
on specific borrowings
As described in these accounting policies, 
the Group capitalises interest on specific 
borrowings that fund the construction of 
qualifying inventory.
Where the Directors consider that the 
gains and losses of the interest rate swap 
are directly attributable to the construction 
of qualifying inventory, the net cash cost of 
interest on an accruals basis is capitalised. 
Otherwise, interest capitalised is limited to 
that incurred on the underlying specific 
borrowings on an EIR basis.
Current versus  
non-current classification
Where the Group will hold a derivative as 
an economic hedge (and does not apply 
hedge accounting) for a period beyond 
twelve months after the reporting date, 
the derivative is classified as non-current 
(or separated into current and non-current 
portions) consistent with the classification 
of the underlying item.
3.15 Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component 
of the Group’s business, the operation and 
cash flows of which can be clearly 
distinguished from the rest of the 
Group and which:
• represents a separate major line 
of business or geographical area of 
operations;
• is part of a single co-ordinated plan 
to dispose of a separate major line of 
business or geographical area of 
operations; or
• is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with 
a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation 
occurs at the earlier of disposal or when 
the operation meets the criteria to be 
classified as held for sale.
When an operation is classified as a 
discontinued operation, the comparative 
statement of financial position and OCI is 
re-presented as if the operation had been 
discontinued from the start of the 
comparative year.

for the year ended 30 September 2017
Estimates and assumptions
Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions 
to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised 
if the revision affects only that period or in 
the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
Revenue recognition
When a contract for the sale of a property 
upon completion of construction is judged 
to be a construction contract, revenue is 
recognised using the percentage of 
completion method as construction 
progresses. The Group considers the 
terms and conditions of the contract, 
including how the contract was negotiated 
and the structural elements that the 
customer specifies when identifying 
individual projects as construction 
contracts. The percentage of completion 
is estimated by reference to the stage of 
the projects and contracts determined 
based on the proportion of contract costs 
incurred to date and the estimated costs 
to complete.
3.23 Provisions 
A provision is recognised when the Group 
has a legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation. 
The Group makes provision for future 
operating lease rental commitments 
relating to properties where it is probable 
that those commitments cannot be fully 
met from the economic benefits derived 
from the operation of the properties 
concerned. If the effect of the time value 
of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability.
4. Critical accounting  
judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s 
accounting policies, which are described 
in note 3, management is required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions 
about the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources.
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies, management has 
made the following judgement, which has 
the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements: 
Sale and operating  
leaseback of properties
The accounting treatment of the sale and 
leaseback depends upon the substance of 
the transaction (applying the lease 
classification principles described in note 
3.20). For sale and operating leasebacks, 
the assets are sold at fair value, and 
accordingly the profit or loss from the sale 
is recognised immediately in the statement 
of comprehensive income. Several 
property operating leases have been 
entered into in the period between 
1 October 2009 and 30 September 2017. 
When forming the conclusion of operating 
lease classification, consideration has 
been given to the key lease classification 
indicators of IAS 17. The leases are 
typically for a three to 35-year period. 
The Directors have reviewed the remaining 
useful lives for these particular properties 
and concluded they are significantly longer 
than the period of the lease. Other key 
indicators considered in reaching an 
operating lease classification were the 
present value of the minimum lease 
payments and the ownership clauses in 
the contracts upon expiry of the lease.
3. Accounting policies continued
3.20 Leases continued
Group as a lessor
Leases in which the Group does not 
transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of an asset are 
classified as operating leases. Initial direct 
costs incurred in negotiating and arranging 
an operating lease are added to the 
carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognised over the lease term on the 
same basis as rental income. Contingent 
rents are recognised as revenue in the 
period in which they are earned. 
3.21 Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year 
comprises current and deferred tax. 
Tax is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in 
OCI or those recognised directly in equity, 
in which case it is recognised in 
accordance with the underlying item.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or 
receivable on the taxable income or loss 
for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the year end 
and are expected to apply when the 
related deferred tax asset is realised 
or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only 
to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary difference can 
be utilised.
3.22 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately 
in the financial statements where it is 
necessary to do so to provide further 
understanding of the financial 
performance of the Group. They are 
material items of income or expense that 
have been shown separately due to the 
significance of their nature or amount.

7. Segmental reporting
The Group has identified four segments for which it reports under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The following represents the segments 
that the Group operates in:
a.  Student accommodation – the development of purpose built student accommodation;
b.  Build to rent – the development of build to rent accommodation;
c.  Residential – the development of traditional residential property; and
d.  Accommodation management – the management of student accommodation and build to rent property. 
Corporate – revenue from the development of commercial property forming part of mixed use schemes and other revenue and costs not 
solely attributable to any one division.
The build to rent segment has been introduced for the first time in FY17. This is a new segment in which the Group is to commence 
development activities. During FY17 several build to rent opportunities were secured, leading to a holding of inventory and work in 
progress for this segment at 30 September 2017. 
All revenues arise in the UK.
Performance is measured by the Board based on gross profit as reported in the management accounts.

Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution Group personal pension plan scheme for the benefit of the employees and certain Directors. 
The assets of the scheme are administered in a fund independent from those of the Group. Contributions during the year amounted to 
£549,000 (2016: £490,000). There are £Nil unpaid contributions at the end of the year (2016: £Nil). 
The Group also operates a small defined contribution scheme for the benefit of certain former employees. This scheme is closed to new 
entrants. The assets of the scheme are administered by trustees in a fund independent from those of the Group. Contributions during the 
year amounted to £Nil (2016: £Nil). 
In addition, the Group operates a small self-administered pension scheme for the benefit of certain current and former Directors. The 
assets of the scheme are administered by trustees who include Mark Watkin Jones, who is a Director of the Group. The scheme is subject 
to actuarial review on a triennial basis. The benefits provided by the scheme are limited to its available assets. Contributions to the scheme 
during the year amounted to £Nil (2016: £50,000).

Financial statements
Watkin Jones plc  //  Annual report and financial statements 2017 15. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity 
holders of the parent by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
There is no difference between basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share as there are no dilutive share option arrangements 
in place at 30 September 2017.
The following table reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:

Using the number of shares in issue at 30 September 2016, the adjusted proforma basic earnings per share from continuing operations for 
the year ended 30 September 2016 would have been 12.397 pence.

The Directors have reviewed the carrying value of the investment in Fresh Student Living, which is a single CGU, at 30 September 2017, 
compared to its recoverable amount and are satisfied that no impairment is required. The recoverable amount has been based on value in 
use, by reference to the budgets and projected cash flows for the CGU over a 20-year period, with future cash flows discounted at a rate 
of 10% to reflect the time value of money. A 20-year cash flow period for the CGU has been used as this appropriately reflects the 
longer-term nature of its business, given the duration and renewable nature of student accommodation property management agreements 
in place.
The following are the key assumptions used in projecting the cash flows:
• contracted management agreements in place are renewed in line with past experience;
• new management agreements are secured to deliver the budgeted beds under management for the CGU for the five-year period ending 
30 September 2022. Thereafter management agreements are secured to manage an additional 1,000 student beds per annum. This 
reflects the CGU’s past success in securing new management agreements;
• management fees charged will increase at 2.5% per annum, in line with assumed RPI inflation;
• the achieved gross margin is maintained in line with past experience; and
• indirect costs are incurred in line with the budgets for the CGU for the five-year period ending 30 September 2022 and thereafter 
increase at 4% per annum. This reflects underlying assumed RPI inflation of 2.5% plus an allowance for additional indirect costs as a 
result of the increase in beds under management.
Acquisition of Fresh Student Living Limited in the prior year
On 25 February 2016 Founded Living Limited, a subsidiary of Watkin Jones Group Limited, acquired the 750 ordinary shares in Fresh 
Student Living Limited (“Fresh”) held by Mark and Glyn Watkin Jones, who were both Directors of and shareholders in Watkin Jones 
Group Limited, for a cash consideration of £11,835,512. The shares acquired represented 77.48% of the issued shares of the company.
On 23 March 2016, on satisfaction of the condition of admission to AIM of Watkin Jones plc, Founded Living Limited acquired the 218 A 
ordinary shares held by various directors and senior managers of Fresh, for a cash consideration of £3,164,488. The shares acquired 
represented the remaining issued shares of the company. As a condition of the acquisition of these shares, the vendor shareholders were 
required to invest £1,397,609, being 50% of the net of tax proceeds received, in shares in Watkin Jones plc as part of the IPO.
The total consideration paid for the shares in Fresh was therefore £15,000,000, plus stamp duty of £75,010.
Fresh is engaged in the management of purpose built student accommodation. Its services include the letting and operational 
management of properties, for which the company is engaged under a management agreement and receives a management fee, 
as well as consultancy and mobilisation services provided during the development phase of a student property.
The resulting goodwill of £9,744,000 arising on the acquisition has been capitalised and is subject to an annual impairment review by 
management. Goodwill is attributed to Fresh’s knowledge and expertise in the letting and management of purpose built student 
accommodation and in the synergy with the Group’s student accommodation development business.

A provision has been made for property operating lease commitments (note 35), where it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation. The amount of the provision has been calculated by comparing the expected future rent liabilities 
for the remaining term of the leases with the expected net income from the operations of the properties concerned, excluding future 
maintenance costs. The resultant expected net liabilities have been discounted at a risk-free rate of 10% to reflect the time value of money.

30. Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed to a variety of risk such as market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s principal financial instruments are: 
• loans and borrowings; and
• trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and cash arising directly from operations. 
This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on the specific risks.
The Group recognises that movements in certain risk variables might affect the value of its loans and also the amounts recorded in its 
equity and its profit and loss for the period. Therefore the Group has assessed the following risks:
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. 
Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk; currency risk; and other prices risk, such as equity price risk. 
The Group’s exposure is primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates in relation to loans and borrowings. 
Foreign currency risk
Capital items that are non-sterling priced are monitored to review the requirement for appropriate hedging.

30. Financial risk management continued
Liquidity risk
Cash flow is regularly monitored and the relevant subsidiaries are aware of their working capital commitments. The Group reviews its 
long-term funding requirements in parallel with its long-term strategy, with an objective of aligning both in a timely manner.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s gross, undiscounted financial liabilities at 30 September 2017 and 
30 September 2016:

   — 98,400 43 — 98,443
Interest rate risk
Due to the levels of interest-bearing loans and borrowings, the Group has no material exposure to interest rate movements. 
A 0.5% movement in the interest rate applied to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings would have an impact on the Group’s profit 
before taxation as below:

Impact on profit before tax       123 76
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument leading to a financial loss. The Group is 
exposed to credit risk from its cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. 
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by depositing with reputable financial institutions, from which 
management believes the risk of loss to be remote. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the statement of 
financial position is the carrying amounts of cash at bank and in hand.
Credit evaluations are performed for all customers. Management has a policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an 
ongoing basis. At the year end there were no significant concentrations of risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position.
Capital management policy
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it has the capital required to operate and grow the business at 
a reasonable cost of capital without incurring undue financial risks. The Board periodically reviews its capital structure to ensure it meets 
changing business needs. The Group defines its capital as equity plus loans and borrowings. The Directors consider the management of 
debt to be an important element in controlling the capital structure of the Group. The Group may carry moderate levels of long-term 
borrowings to fund operations and working capital requirements. The net cash of the Group is analysed in note 34.
