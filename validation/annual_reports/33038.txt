BT Group plc is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London and New York stock exchanges. It was incorporated in England and Wales on 30 March 2001 as
Newgate Telecommunications Limited with the registered number 4190816. Its registered ofﬁce address is 81 Newgate Street, London EC1A 7AJ. The company changed its name to BT Group plc
on 11 September 2001. Following the demerger of O2 in November 2001, the continuing activities of BT were transferred to BT Group plc.
British Telecommunications plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BT Group plc and encompasses virtually all the businesses and assets of the BT group. The successor to the statutory corporation
British Telecommunications, it was incorporated in England and Wales as a public limited company, wholly owned by the UK Government, as a result of the Telecommunications Act 1984.
Between November 1984 and July 1993, the UK Government sold all of its shareholding in British Telecommunications plc in three public offerings.

FINANCIAL HEADLINES
BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 Financial headlines 2 Filename: 824560_01.3d Time: 14:32:39 Date: 20/05/06
Checksum: 1531562998
The news on dividends is again positive. Your Board is
recommending a full-year dividend of 11.9 pence per share –
a pay out ratio of 61% of earnings before speciﬁc items,
compared with 57% last year. We continue our progressive
dividend policy and expect our pay out ratio to rise to around
two-thirds of earnings in the 2008 ﬁnancial year.
We operated our share buy back programme again in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. This is being funded from cash generated
over and above that required for servicing our debt, which
remains below £8 billion.
BUSINESS PROGRESS
We continued to implement our strategy of growth through
business transformation. Your Board has given its backing to
targeted acquisitions that will help us conﬁrm our status as a
leading player in the global networked IT services market. In the
2006 ﬁnancial year, we acquired Atlanet in Italy (as part of a
major deal with Fiat), Cara Group in Ireland and Total Network
Solutions in the UK. And in the UK, we now have almost eight
million broadband lines over which we are able to offer
customers exciting, next-generation voice and entertainment
services. New wave revenue grew by 38% to £6.3 billion, and
accounted for around one-third of our total business.
REGULATION
We believe that a fair and ﬂexible regulatory regime is vital for
our industry, for ensuring that we can meet customers’ growing
needs and for encouraging investment. We were pleased that,
following its strategic review of telecommunications, Ofcom
accepted the set of legally-binding Undertakings that BT
proposed in order to transform the regulatory landscape in the
UK. We believe that the impact of these Undertakings will be to
focus regulation where it remains necessary at the same time as
stimulating de-regulation wherever possible.
PENSIONS
BT stands fully behind its pension promise to pensioners and
members of the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS). The scheme is
well-managed and its assets have grown very signiﬁcantly in
recent years, from £23 billion at the end of 2002 to more than
£35 billion currently. The accounting deﬁcit has almost halved
in the last year alone. With the Trustees of the BTPS, we are
continuing discussions on the triennial funding valuation of the
scheme. In particular, we aim to review recent pensions
legislation and guidelines, and examine the implications and
extent of the Crown Guarantee given on privatisation in 1984.
The Crown Guarantee, which applies to liabilities assumed by
BT in 1984 and only in the event of insolvency, is an extra layer
of security for BT pensioners.
THE BOARD
There were a number of changes to your Board during the year.
I would like to welcome Matti Alahuhta and Phil Hodkinson as
non-executive directors. Matti has been President of Kone
Corporation since January 2005 and was previously at Nokia;
Phil is Group Finance Director of HBOS. Both bring a wide
range of commercial and senior management experience to
your company. I would also like to thank Lou Hughes who
stepped down as a non-executive director on 31 March 2006 for
his excellent contribution over more than six years. I’m pleased
that his experience is not lost to us: he has joined our Americas
Advisory Board.
OUR WIDER RESPONSIBILITIES
Our aim as a communications company is to operate in a
socially responsible and sustainable way and to ensure that we
help everyone beneﬁt from improved communications and
enhanced connectivity. I’m very proud of the fact that, for the
ﬁfth year in a row, BT was the highest placed
telecommunications company in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index.
Climate change has been moving inexorably up the social
and corporate agendas for a number of years now. Although
telecommunications technology is environmentally friendly, BT
is one of the largest companies in the UK and one of the largest
consumers of electricity. Our operations inevitably have an
impact on the environment and we take the job of managing
that impact seriously. We are now, for example, meeting almost
all our UK electricity needs from environmentally friendly
sources, including wind generation, solar, wave and
hydroelectric schemes.
LOOKING FORWARD
I am very grateful to our shareholders and our customers for
their continued loyalty and the conﬁdence that they have shown
in BT’s programme of transformation. I’d like to thank our
employees for making that programme happen.
Your company is well set for continued success in the years
ahead. Our performance underpins our conﬁdence that we can
continue to grow revenue, EBITDA, earnings per share and
dividends over the coming year, and accelerate the strategic
transformation of the business.
Sir Christopher Bland
Chairman
17 May 2006
Our results for the 2006 ﬁnancial year were excellent.
Earnings per share before speciﬁc items grew by 8% to
19.5 pence. We continued to invest signiﬁcantly in
technologies and systems designed to transform our
customers’ experience, at the same time as generating free
cash ﬂow of £1.6 billion.

HELPING CUSTOMERS THRIVE IN A CHANGING WORLD
We enjoy the fantastic privilege of serving around 20 million
customers in 170 countries around the world. Their needs and
expectations are constantly changing, so too is the market in
which we operate and the technology at our disposal. That’s
why an ability to embrace, and thrive on, change – developing
new products and services, new ways of working and new ways
of interacting with our customers – is essential to what we do
at BT.
When so much is changing, companies have to be crystal
clear about what they stand for. BT has a strong and trusted
brand, widely recognised around the world by shareholders,
customers, suppliers and employees. The brand captures the
essence of BT and tells existing and new customers what they
can expect from us. We have summed this up in a new vision
and mission.
Our vision is to be dedicated to helping customers thrive
in a changing world. And there’s not a wasted word in there.
Dedication to our customers is what will differentiate us in an
intensely competitive environment. Helping these customers to
thrive means enabling them to do the things they want to do,
when they want to do them and at the right price. It means
helping them to recognise that a changing world is a world of
opportunity and new experiences. And it means helping them to
seize those opportunities.
Our mission is to be the leader in delivering converged
networked services. That’s the yardstick by which we’ll
measure our success. Convergence is at the heart of everything
we do for customers.
We believe that this combination of absolute commitment to
understanding our customers and to exploring the possibilities
of convergence (blurring the distinctions between networks and
services, IT and communications, ﬁxed and mobile,
telecommunications and visual services) is extremely powerful.
Of course, customers are not interested in vision and mission
statements. What they are interested in, however, are services
that get the job done and that are hassle-free.
THE RIGHT REGULATORY CLIMATE
We operate in a regulated industry and the right regulatory
climate is also essential if our customers are to thrive. The
regulatory climate is not, however, just something that happens
to us; we are helping to shape regulatory thinking.
In response to Ofcom’s strategic review of
telecommunications in the UK, we proposed a series of
Undertakings which we believe will result in a fair and ﬂexible
regulatory regime, deregulation where possible and the growth
of competition through equivalence. Above all, they bring
greater regulatory certainty. These Undertakings, which Ofcom
accepted, are in our view fundamental to meeting customers’
needs and to enabling us and other service providers to invest
in the future with conﬁdence.
A big part of meeting these Undertakings was the creation of
Openreach. This line of business manages our access and
backhaul networks and the associated portfolio of products and
services. We have established an Equality of Access Board with
a majority of independent members to oversee compliance.
Service providers are beneﬁting from lower prices for both
connection and rental thanks to the success of products such as
wholesale line rental and local loop unbundling.
BT is committed to meeting its obligations, and we have
made good progress so far – though much remains to be done.
OUR STRATEGY
Like our brand, our strategy for proﬁtable growth and
transformation is subject to continuous review. There are four
parts to our strategy:
s to pursue proﬁtable growth in new wave markets
s to maximise the return from our traditional business
s to transform our networks, systems and services for the
twenty-ﬁrst century
s to create long-term partnerships with our customers.
NEW WAVE GROWTH
Around one third of BT’s revenue in the 2006 ﬁnancial year was
from new wave activities – that’s up from effectively nothing a
few years ago.
By new wave activities we mean networked IT services,
broadband and mobility.
In short order, BT has established itself as a key player in the
global networked IT services market with a strong track record
of winning and delivering big, complex contracts for large
corporations and other organisations. Major wins such as the
contract with Fiat in Italy and the revised agreement with the
Department for Work and Pensions in the UK conﬁrmed our
credentials. The total value of our networked IT services order
intake in the year was £5.4 billion.
Having hit our target of ﬁve million broadband lines in April
2005 (a year ahead of schedule), we’ve boosted that number by
more than 50% in the past ﬁnancial year. For the majority of
customers, access to broadband is now a given.
But broadband is more than just another technology, it
enables broader, richer, more compelling experiences. Our
focus is increasingly on what customers can do with it. We are
delivering speeds of up to 8Mbit/s and launching innovative
consumer broadband products and services. One of these, BT
Vision, scheduled for launch in the autumn, is broadband TV
and will bring a new dimension to home entertainment as
customers choose from a huge range of on-demand ﬁlm, music
and TV programming as well as interactive services.
BT is a mobile virtual network operator in both the business
and consumer markets, with more than 340,000 connections.
In a convergent world, we aim to offer customers the best of
ﬁxed and the best of mobile. We launched BT Fusion, the
world’s ﬁrst service enabling customers to switch seamlessly
Your company is ambitious. We are much more than a lines
and calls business. Our aim is to make life easier, simpler,
cheaper and more fulﬁlling for all our customers. We will
continue to do this by providing our business customers, large
and small, with productivity improvements and competitive
edge in their markets. We will ensure consumers enjoy a
joined-up communications experience, enabling them to
communicate anywhere, anytime, using whatever device
they choose.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT

between ﬁxed and mobile lines depending on where they are.
And in the wholesale market, we are one of the ﬁrst companies
in Europe to offer a broadcast digital TV and radio service via
mobile handsets, BT Movio.
MAXIMISE THE RETURN FROM OUR TRADITIONAL BUSINESS
The number of ﬁxed-voice calls is no longer the best guide to
the success of a telecommunications company as we encourage
our customers to take up non-voice and subscription-based
packages. At 31 March 2006, 67% of call revenue in the
consumer market was under contract. We continue to develop
and enhance our traditional services to make them more
attractive to customers, as the success of BT Together and BT
Privacy has demonstrated.
In our traditional markets, as in the rest of our business, we
are committed to working smarter – avoiding the costs of failure
and duplication – and ever more cost effectively through using
the internet. For example, over two million customers now
receive e-bills.
TRANSFORM OUR NETWORKS, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES FOR THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
Our twenty-ﬁrst century network (21CN) programme is further
evidence of our ambitions. It is a massive investment in the
UK’s infrastructure and in the UK’s continued competitiveness
in world markets. Based on IP technology, it is designed to
ensure that the delivery of the next generation of converged
services is rapid and cost efﬁcient.
CREATE LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS
We never take our customers for granted. Nothing is more
important than building successful, innovative, mutually-
rewarding relationships with them. In recent years, we have
focused in particular on driving down levels of customer
dissatisfaction. The emphasis now is increasingly on improving
customer satisfaction. In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we achieved a
3% increase in the number of customers reporting that they are
‘very satisﬁed’ or ‘extremely satisﬁed’ with the services they
receive from BT.
Because the quality of service we offer customers is key to
their satisfaction levels, much of our investment in training and
development is directed towards developing a truly customer-
centric culture in BT.
OUR PEOPLE
BT is a people business, not a technology business.
Recruiting, developing, rewarding and retaining the right
people is critical. Another ‘must do’ is celebrating the power of
diversity, ensuring that our people reﬂect the customers we
serve.
A people business only really ﬁres on all cylinders when its
top team is on top of its game, which is why we have rigorously
deﬁned the capabilities we expect of leaders in this business
and developed programmes to help them become even more
customer focused.
Achieving our ambitions depends as much on the quality and
commitment of our people as on world-class products and
services, on technology and on a clear strategy. People
understand how technology can add value to their customers’
lives and people deliver strategies. People not only know what a
business stands for, but they also embody its values. I’d like to
thank BT people for their commitment, imagination and
dedication to our customers. In my view, they are truly
inspirational.

INTRODUCTION TO THE BUSINESS REVIEW
BT Group plc is one of the world’s leading providers of
communications solutions and services operating in 170
countries.
Our vision is for BT to be dedicated to helping customers
thrive in a changing world. Our mission is to be the leader in
delivering converged networked services. We are committed to
increasing shareholder value by transforming the customer
experience through service excellence, by the effective
management of our powerful brand, and by leveraging our large
scale networks and our existing customer base. We aim to ﬁnd
new and mutually-rewarding ways of engaging with around 20
million customers, to capitalise on the possibilities of
convergence, to offer global reach combined with the service
values associated with local delivery, and to continue to provide
innovative services and solutions.
Our principal activities include networked IT services; local,
national and international telecommunications services; and
broadband and internet products and services. We have ISO
9001 certiﬁcation (the international quality management system
standard) for most of our operations in the UK and worldwide.
We are committed to enhancing our positive impact on
society through leadership in CSR (corporate social
responsibility), and our policy is to achieve best practice in our
standards of business integrity in all our operations, in line with
our published statement of business practice – The Way We
Work.
How BT operates
BT consists principally of four lines of business: BT Global
Services, Openreach, BT Retail and BT Wholesale.
Openreach was established on 21 January 2006 in response
to Ofcom’s strategic review of telecommunications. It operates
the physical (as opposed to the electronic) assets of the local
access and backhaul networks and provides the services which
use these networks to communications providers, both
internally and externally. (See Regulation, competition and
prices) For ﬁnancial reporting purposes Openreach remained
part of BT Wholesale until the end of the 2006 ﬁnancial year. It
will be reported as a separate line of business in the 2007
ﬁnancial year.
Openreach, BT Retail and BT Wholesale operate almost
entirely within the UK, where BT is the UK’s largest
communications service provider, by market share, to the
residential and business markets, supplying a wide range of
communications products and services, including voice, data,
internet and multimedia services, and offering a comprehensive
range of managed and packaged communications solutions.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, 87% of our revenue was derived
from operations within the UK.
BT Global Services addresses the networked IT services needs
of multi-site organisations both in the UK and internationally.

Major corporate customers
Our core target market is 10,000 multi-site organisations
including major companies with signiﬁcant global requirements,
together with large organisations in target local markets. We
aim to provide them with networked IT services and a complete
range of managed solutions.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, major corporate revenue
increased by 16% to £6,880 million, with new wave revenue
increasing by 35% and traditional revenue declining by 4%. The
increase in new wave revenue for major corporate customers
globally was driven by networked IT services, broadband and
mobility. New wave revenue accounted for 59% of our total
revenue in the major corporate market, compared with 51% in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
The continued migration of our customers from traditional
voice and data services to networked IT services enables us to
build closer, high-value relationships with these customers,
enabling them to manage their businesses more effectively and
gain competitive advantage in their markets. Such relationships
will, we believe, deliver long-term, proﬁtable revenue, more
than offsetting the decline in our traditional business revenue.
As well as local, national and international communications
services and higher-value broadband and internet products and
services, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of networked IT
services focused on messaging and conferencing, CRM
(customer relationship management), convergence, outsourcing
and security. We also offer consultancy services to help
organisations understand network performance, operate their
networks and applications efﬁciently and transform their
businesses to gain advantage in the digital networked economy.
Our extensive global communications network and strong
partnerships enable us to serve customers in the key
commercial centres around the world using a combination of
direct sales and services capabilities and strategic partners.
Business customers
At 31 March 2006, in the UK we had around 1.5 million
business customers, with more than eight million exchange
lines.
In the SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) market
(typically companies with up to 500 employees), our strategy is
to provide customers with tailored IT and communications
products and services that enable them to manage their
businesses more simply and efﬁciently.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, 23% of revenue was from new
wave activities, compared with 19% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
However, we face challenging market conditions and, overall in
the SME market during the 2006 ﬁnancial year, revenue
reduced by 5% to £2,324 million, primarily reﬂecting the
impact of CPS (carrier pre-selection) and WLR (wholesale line
rental).
In April 2006, we announced that we had acquired dabs.com
plc, one of the UK’s leading internet retailers of IT and
technology products. dabs.com has around one million
customers throughout the UK, and this move strengthens our
online IT and digital products sales and service presence for
SME and consumer customers.
Consumer customers
At 31 March 2006, we had over 18 million UK consumer
customers with around 20 million residential customer lines
(exchange line connections). In the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
consumer revenue declined by 5% to £5,296 million, primarily
reﬂecting the impact of CPS, WLR and regulatory price
reductions in mobile termination rates.

In the consumer market we aim to provide customers with a
range of services that help them communicate more effectively,
be entertained and manage their lives. By increasing revenue
from broadband, mobility and internet services, we intend to
reduce further our dependence on revenue and proﬁt from
traditional, ﬁxed-line voice services. We also aim to maximise
the returns from our traditional business and defend market
share vigorously, through service offerings backed by innovative
marketing and excellent quality of service.
Consumer new wave revenue grew by 55% from £412 million
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year to £638 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year, driven principally by broadband. Residential broadband
customers increased by 52% to more than two million.
Wholesale customers
In the UK wholesale market, we provide network services and
solutions to over 700 communications companies, including
ﬁxed and mobile network operators, ISPs (internet service
providers) and other service providers. We interconnect with
more than 150 other operators, as well as carrying transit trafﬁc
between telecommunications operators.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, external revenue from our
wholesale activities increased by 13% to £4,996 million.
In the UK, external revenue from our wholesale activities was
£4,226 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, compared with
£3,820 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
New wave revenue was £1,033 million, up 56% on the 2005
ﬁnancial year. This increase was driven by the success of
broadband as well as a strong emphasis on building innovative
network solutions that help our wholesale customers grow their
businesses and reduce their costs.
We have a long and successful tradition of delivering
network-based connectivity to the carrier and intermediate
telecommunications markets throughout the UK, and have
developed value-enhancing services and solutions. We have a
number of agreements with service providers and mobile
operators to upgrade their IP capability. In addition, we have
used our expertise and geographic reach to provide bespoke
data housing solutions.
In our global carrier business, revenue was £691 million in
the 2006 ﬁnancial year, compared with £565 million in the
2005 ﬁnancial year. This strong growth was mainly driven by
revenue from Albacom which we acquired in February 2005.
Our global carrier business customers include other ﬁxed-line
telecommunications operators, mobile operators and selected
ISPs outside the UK.
OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy is to:
s pursue proﬁtable growth in new wave markets
s maximise the return from our traditional business
s transform our networks, systems and services for the twenty-
ﬁrst century
s create long-term partnerships with our customers.
The successful delivery of this strategy depends on the
commitment of all BT people and our continued ability to
manage their development and reward them.
The key performance indicators against which we measure
the success of our strategy are earnings per share before
speciﬁc items (see Earnings per share in the Financial review
on page 35), free cash ﬂow (see Financing in the Financial
review on page 36) and customer satisfaction (see Create long-
term partnerships with our customers).

OUTLOOK
Our performance underpins our conﬁdence that we can
continue to grow revenue, EBITDA, earnings per share and
dividends over the coming year. Revenue growth will continue
to be fuelled by new wave services; the EBITDA improvement
will be driven by the continued growth in BT Retail’s
proﬁtability and an acceleration through the year of the EBITDA
growth in BT Global Services.
We are conﬁdent in our ability to improve shareholder
returns and accelerate the strategic transformation of the
business. (See Group risk factors on page 20 and 21)
PURSUE PROFITABLE GROWTH IN NEW WAVE MARKETS
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, 32% of our revenue was from new
wave activities – networked IT services, broadband and
mobility.
Build on our networked IT services capability
Our strategy in the networked IT services market is to reinforce
BT’s position as a global player capable of competing with the
world’s best in selected markets. Our portfolio of services
includes IP infrastructure, CRM, security, applications, managed
mobility, hosting and outsourcing.
In recent years, we have developed a track record of winning
and delivering complex, large-scale networked IT services
contracts for large business customers and other organisations
(including the public and government sectors) around the world.
We have shown that we have the experience and expertise to
help our customers succeed in a world in which business
applications are increasingly being networked and networks are
seen as increasingly vital to productivity and competitive
advantage.
We are, for example, playing a prominent role in the NHS
National Programme for IT, delivering:
s the national broadband network (N3) – we successfully
installed more than 14,000 connections on the N3 ahead of
schedule
s the spine transactional and messaging database – which now
has about 200,000 registered users
s the London local service provider IT systems – we deployed
the ﬁrst patient administration system speciﬁcally designed
for the NHS National Programme.
In March 2005, we announced that BT had won a contract
worth up to £1.5 billion over eight and half years to provide and
manage secure data networks for Reuters’ products and
services worldwide. In accordance with the contract, the parties
have tested a number of Reuters’ products over the BT
IP-enabled MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) network and
have started its migration process in a number of countries.

In May 2006, we were awarded a three-year extension – worth
around an additional £270 million – to the existing contract to
deliver Unilever’s voice, data and mobile services around the
world until 2012. The original contract, announced in
November 2002 and with an estimated value of £670 million
over seven years, was the ﬁrst comprehensive global
telecommunications outsourcing contract won by BT and is one
of our largest and most signiﬁcant global deals.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we secured networked IT services
orders in the UK and internationally worth £5.4 billion,
including a number of major contracts:
s in June 2005, we signed a contract worth approximately
E175 million over a seven-year period with leading global
brewer InBev, for the outsourcing of its communications
infrastructure – data and voice – around the world
s in July 2005, we signed a two-year contract to manage
Microsoft’s OneCall call centre routing initiative. Under the
agreement, we will design, build, deploy and manage a
solution to unify the majority of Microsoft’s contact centres
around the world into a single, networked contact centre
environment
s in December 2005, we reached agreement with the
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on the
simpliﬁcation of the contracts that the Department inherited
when it was created from the former Department of Social
Security and the Department for Education and
Employment. Under the agreement, we will supply services
based on modern, reliable IP communications that take
advantage of our 21CN programme to deliver consistent and
ﬂexible services which will, we believe, lead to substantial
efﬁciencies and new capabilities for the DWP and its clients
s in February 2006, we completed an agreement to become
Fiat’s supplier of global telecommunications services in 40
countries, in a deal worth approximately E450 million over
almost ﬁve years. (See also Acquisitions and disposals in
the 2006 ﬁnancial year)
BT is listed in the leader quadrant in the Gartner Magic
Quadrants for Global and pan-European NSPs (network service
providers), and in 2005 was listed for the ﬁrst time in the leader
quadrant for Asia Paciﬁc NSPs. Gartner’s reports evaluate the
NSPs operating in the various regions for their completeness of
vision and ability to execute, and BT was consistently ranked in
the top ﬁve. The NSPs that score well are those that go the
extra mile to deliver superior service quality through their pan-
regional networks, local service and support and service level
commitments.
Networked IT services revenue for the 2006 ﬁnancial year
was £4,065 million, a rise of 33% on the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Deliver on broadband
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we continued our drive to enhance
the awareness, availability and attractiveness of broadband. As
at 31 March 2006, in the highly competitive retail market, our
market share of consumer and business DSL (digital subscriber
line) and LLU (local loop unbundling) broadband connections in
the UK was 33% (2.6 million connections).
Broadband for wholesale customers
In early April 2005, we reached our target of ﬁve million
broadband lines one year ahead of schedule. At 31 March
2006, we had 7.9 million lines, including those provided via BT
Retail and LLU. In total, 5,501 exchanges had been upgraded
by 31 March 2006, making broadband available to 99.7% of
the UK’s homes and businesses.
We continue to look for commercially viable ways of bringing
broadband to those customers for whom availability remains an
issue. We are, for example, exploring the feasibility of installing
broadband equipment at locations closer to the customer than
the BT exchange, as well as the possibility of delivering
broadband over existing ﬁbre cables. Both trials will run until
summer 2006.
As a demonstration of our commitment to delivering higher
speed broadband to UK consumers, 59% of wholesale
broadband lines were 2Mbit/s at 31 March 2006, compared
with 17% a year earlier.
Having conducted trials of broadband speeds of up to
8Mbit/s in association with a number of service providers, we
launched BT ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) Max and
BT ADSL Max Premium broadband services nationally with
effect from 31 March 2006. By upgrading more than 5,300
exchanges across the UK to support this service, we are
providing the UK market with a stable, high-speed broadband
service across the widest national footprint in the world.
Although the broadband speed that can be supported on an
individual line is governed by a wide range of physical factors,
our trials suggest that 78% of BT phone lines should support
rates of at least 4Mbit/s. In addition, we have enhanced
broadband line stability to ensure that customers can run more
bandwidth-hungry applications, including video, gaming and
music downloads, at the same time as sending/receiving e-mails
and surﬁng the internet.
Broadband for consumers
We offer a family of broadband packages designed to meet the
diverse needs of our customers, simply and cost effectively in a
highly competitive market. In October 2005, in partnership with
Yahoo!, we simpliﬁed our broadband packages into four options,
each of which offers new and existing customers a premium
Yahoo! broadband experience, enhanced security features and
the option of cheap internet telephony.
We are helping to deﬁne next-generation television – which
is being made possible by the convergence of digital broadcast
TV and broadband technology. During the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
we put in place a number of the key building blocks designed to
enable us to launch the BT Vision broadband TV service in
autumn 2006. Microsoft will help to provide the software
platform over which BT Vision will run and the set top boxes will
be provided by Philips, Europe’s largest electronics company.
The service aims to combine access to digital terrestrial
channels, an extensive video-on-demand library, catch-up TV
and a range of interactive services, offering customers choice,
convenience and control over their home entertainment. Other
services which should be available at launch or shortly
afterwards will include: personal video recording; more than 30
digital terrestrial TV channels; communications services –
instant messaging, chat and video telephony on the TV, and
interactive services – online gaming, retail opportunities and
community services – all without the need to pay an up-front
subscription.
We have signed content deals with BBC Worldwide,
Paramount, Warner Music Group, Endemol, i-concerts, Eagle
Rock, Cartoon Network, National Geographic Channel, HIT
Entertainment and Nelvana.
We are also playing a lead role in the development of
internet telephony or VolP (voice over IP). International calls
made with BT Communicator – which enables customers to
make voice calls over the internet using a PC or laptop – are
proving cheaper than those offered by many other suppliers. BT
Communicator comes with Yahoo! Messenger which provides

access to a range of features including instant messaging,
e-mails and texts. BT Broadband Talk enables customers to
make and receive broadband calls using an ordinary phone. We
aim to introduce an enhanced VoIP offering, featuring high-
deﬁnition sound quality, in June 2006.
Broadband for business customers
Broadband is increasingly critical to the success of small and
medium businesses and BT Business Broadband remained the
leading internet service provider for SMEs in the UK. At the end
of the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we had 453,000 BT Business
Broadband customers.
We recognise that businesses need solutions that combine
fast and reliable access with superior support and a range of
business applications and services. Many of these customers opt
for such value-added services as the Internet Security Pack and
the Internet Business Pack.
In October 2005, as part of our drive to encourage
broadband take-up in the SME market, we launched our most
comprehensive broadband package for business to date,
offering reduced prices, increased value and higher levels of
support than were previously available, including support for
LAN (local area network) and IT equipment that customers
connect to their broadband line. At 31 March 2006, we were
providing remote support for 24,000 PCs for SME customers.
Customer feedback has been extremely positive, with an
average 99% satisfaction level.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we invested in platforms that will
enable us to offer a wider range of services using Microsoft’s
Connected Services Framework. BT Business E-mail was the
ﬁrst service to be launched on this platform and provides
‘anywhere access’ to critical business information, supported by
advanced security and collaboration features, and there were
12,000 users of this service at 31 March 2006. In January
2006, we launched BT Business Broadband Voice, our ﬁrst ‘ﬂat
top’ internet telephone or VoIP call package for broadband
customers.
Create convergent mobility solutions
In a convergent world, individuals and businesses increasingly
need to connect and communicate whenever and wherever they
happen to be, using whatever devices they choose.
Our aim is to offer all our customers the right combination of
the quality, reliability, cost advantages and bandwidth
associated with ﬁxed-line communications, and the
convenience, personalisation and ﬂexibility associated with
mobile communications.
BT is both an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) and a
service provider in the business and consumer mobility markets.
At 31 March 2006, BT Mobile had over 340,000 GSM and BT
Fusion business and consumer connections.
BT Openzone is one of the leading providers of Wi-Fi
services in the UK and Ireland. We operate our own network of
high-quality sites and offer more wholesale and roaming
connections than any other UK Wi-Fi network operator.
Recently awarded the Brainheart European Wi-Fi award in
recognition of its contribution to the growth of the European
Wi-Fi industry, BT Openzone offers customers a high-speed,
wireless broadband connection over which they can access the
internet to work, talk or play.
We have already built BT Openzone networks in
Westminster and Cardiff and we have announced our intention
to Wi-Fi enable a further ten cities by the end of the 2007
ﬁnancial year.
At 31 March 2006, our BT Openzone customers had access to
around 8,400 hotspots throughout the UK and Ireland and
more than 30,000 globally.
Revenue in the mobility market in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
was £292 million, an increase of 42% on the 2005 ﬁnancial
year.
Mobility for consumers
In the consumer mobility market our strategy is to build a
foundation for the delivery of ﬁxed/mobile convergent solutions.
BT Fusion (launched in June 2005) is the world’s ﬁrst
intelligent mobile service that switches calls to a BT broadband
line when the user is at home, offering customers the
convenience of mobile in combination with the cost and quality
advantages of a ﬁxed-line phone. BT Fusion brings with it a
range of mobile services including text and picture messaging.
Users can connect PCs, laptops, games consoles, printers and
broadband wirelessly via the BT Hub that comes with BT
Fusion. At 31 March 2006, there were 24,000 consumer BT
Fusion connections.
In July 2005, the 3G network we built and operate for 3 in
the Republic of Ireland was launched. The contract with 3
requires the development of 700 new radio sites to achieve its
coverage targets. At 31 March 2006, the network for advanced
3G services covered more than 70% of the population of the
Republic of Ireland. BT Ireland is building on its success in this
market to offer wholesale services to other mobile operators in
Ireland.
In November 2005, we joined forces with Nintendo to
provide Wi-Fi access to users of Nintendo’s DS wireless games
console, a move which will enable users to play games around
the world for free and will, we believe, bring Wi-Fi to a mass
market.
Mobility for business and major corporate customers
Our strategy is to integrate traditional ﬁxed, mobile and IP
services to offer a single communications solution to our
customers – both through commercial packaging and through
the exploitation of technological convergence.
In addition, we provide a range of managed mobile services
to UK and global customers who either outsource their mobile
communications entirely or rely on BT to provide speciﬁc
managed services.
During the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we launched a number of
new services designed to integrate customers’ﬁxed and mobile
communications services, including:
s BT Business Plan with Mobile, launched in March 2006,
offers small and medium businesses one bill, an annual 5%
discount on combined ﬁxed and mobile calls, capped rates
on ﬁxed-line calls and preferential rates on mobile-to-mobile
and mobile-to-the-ofﬁce calls. The package also includes BT
Billing Analyst, which helps businesses to monitor and
control their call spend
s in February 2006, we launched a version of BT Fusion for
SMEs, enabling them to beneﬁt from the convenience of a
mobile phone while enjoying rates similar to those for ﬁxed
lines.
Mobility for wholesale customers
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we saw continued growth in the UK
wholesale mobile arena – increasing the volume and value of
wireless-originated trafﬁc over our network.
In February 2006, we announced that Virgin Mobile will be
the ﬁrst operator to sign up to the BT Movio broadcast digital
TV and radio service, making it the ﬁrst mobile operator in

Europe to offer its customers digital TV and radio content on a
mobile device using broadcast technology.
We have also developed a strategic relationship with
Microsoft to enable a secure and efﬁcient environment for
delivering broadcast services on a mobile handset. Microsoft’s
Windows Media technologies will enable BT Movio to deliver
high-quality audio and video content over a DAB (digital audio
broadcast) network using minimal bandwidth. The BT Movio
service also incorporates Windows Media DRM (digital rights
management) technology to ensure secure delivery of premium
video and music content.
BT Movio is the ﬁrst wholesale mobile broadcast TV offering
of its kind in Europe and we plan to make it available to all
mobile operators in the UK.
In June 2005, selected mobile phone users in Cardiff became
the ﬁrst in the UK to beneﬁt from our innovative new mobile
delivery system, Microconnect Distributed Antenna – part of our
growing portfolio of low-power, mobile coverage solutions for
mobile operators, designed to minimise the visual impact of
masts and cabinets in city centres and heritage sites. 3 became
the ﬁrst mobile operator in the UK to take advantage of the
system that enables operators to share small antennas, and
in December 2005, Selfridges’ London store became the ﬁrst in
the UK to use the Microconnect In-Building service.
MAXIMISE THE RETURN FROM OUR TRADITIONAL BUSINESS
We face continued challenges in our traditional markets as a
result of regulatory intervention, competition and a shift in our
customers’ buying patterns, as we provide them with higher-
speciﬁcation, high-value, new wave products.
Total ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed voice call minutes in the UK market as a
whole declined by 3% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. This was
driven by customers making use of alternatives such as mobile
calls, e-mail, instant messaging, corporate IPVPNs (internet
protocol virtual private networks) and VoIP, continuing the
trends of recent years.
However, the call minutes measure is becoming less
important to BT as customers increasingly opt to sign up for
pricing packages and take other non-PSTN (public switched
telephone network) services.
Traditional services for consumers
We continued to develop the services we have traditionally
offered in order to make them more attractive to consumers.
Examples included:
s at 31 March 2006, more than two million customers had
signed up for BT Together Options 2 and 3 and 67% of
consumer call revenue was under contract
s at 31 March 2006, 3.7 million customers had signed up for
BT Privacy, a caller display service which enables customers
to preview incoming call numbers and ﬁlter out unwanted
calls. All BT Privacy customers are automatically added to
the Telephone Preference Service register which ﬁlters out
most unsolicited marketing calls
s between January and April 2006, actor Tom Baker was the
voice of BT Text, the text-to-speech service that enables
users to send and receive texts on their home landline
phones. BT Text volumes increased by 94% in the 2006
ﬁnancial year. At 31 March 2006, 268,000 BT customers
were registered on the service and around 1.2 million text
messages were being sent to landlines every week
s since autumn 2005, over one million customers have
registered to have their Friends & Family calling circle
automatically updated to ensure that the numbers they dial
most frequently attract maximum discounts
s we manage around 64,000 public payphones, including
more than 800 multimedia kiosks and more than 1,000
textphones throughout the UK. We remain committed to
ensuring that public payphones are available in communities
throughout the UK. Future growth opportunities will focus
on maximising returns from existing sites and capabilities,
including hosting Wi-Fi services and mobile antennas.
Traditional services for business and major corporate
customers
We continued to enhance BT Business Plan. From June 2005,
for example, we cut the cost of calls for business customers by
reducing the cap on landline-to-mobile calls lasting less than
one hour from 30 pence to 25 pence. At 31 March 2006, BT
Business Plan had over 513,000 locations, up 15% on the 2005
ﬁnancial year.
Our BT Local Business initiative helped to secure BT’s
position as a key player in the SME market. At the end of the
2006 ﬁnancial year, BT Local Business was active in 83
locations around the country, managing £1.2 billion of annual
billed revenue.
Traditional services for wholesale customers
We continued to sell a wide range of capacity and call-based
products and services including regulated interconnect services;
access products such as WLR and LLU; and new, non-regulated
products and services.
During the year, the sale of WLR services continued to grow,
reaching a total of 2.9 million lines by 31 March 2006. Rental
charges for consumer lines were reduced by 50 pence a month
from 1 August 2005 and a further 35 pence from 1 March 2006.
The monthly charge for business lines was reduced by 78.3
pence from 1 March 2006.
WLR and LLU products will be reported within Openreach for
the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
Transforming our costs
We remain focused on ﬁnancial discipline and on delivering
efﬁciency programmes that will generate sustainable cost
savings.
We continue to benchmark ourselves against the best in the
industry and aim to achieve savings of at least £400 million in
each of the next three years. In the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
efﬁciency programmes delivered savings of over £400 million,
enabling us to invest in growing our new wave activities.
A key area of focus has been enhancing the ways in which
customers can deal with BT, simultaneously saving costs and
improving customer service. Programmes have targeted the
cost of failure by, for example, minimising the number of times
a customer call is transferred before resolution and reducing the
amount of call waiting time through better call routing.
The number of transactions via bt.com grew by 28% in the
2006 ﬁnancial year, and we now have approximately 2.3 million
customers receiving e-bills – half a million of whom do not
receive a paper bill.
We have also been reducing the complexity of our systems
and processes and intend, for example, to transform our billing
function – rationalising more than 90 systems and at the same
time improving the end-to-end customer experience.
Other programmes relate to innovative procurement and
sourcing. Our IT team, for example, has moved to global
sourcing and 90-day delivery cycles, and implemented ‘hot
housing’ principles – bringing customers and suppliers together
in an intense design session at the beginning of a project,
reducing risks and driving up beneﬁts.

We continue to look at ways of streamlining our organisation
and eliminating duplication. The integration during the 2006
ﬁnancial year of the BT team serving major corporate customers
in BT Global Services (previously part of BT Retail) should
enable more effective account management for our global
customers.
We also continued to reduce overheads such as
accommodation, using buildings more efﬁciently and
introducing ﬂexible working practices. In the 2006 ﬁnancial
year, we vacated around 135 buildings and installed an
additional 250 ﬂexible workstations which can be shared by
multiple users.
A number of other programmes are underway, including
structural changes in our network management and planning
divisions. Some of these are related to our 21CN initiative and
will, we believe, help achieve the signiﬁcant reduction in
operational and capital expenditure that we expect from this
programme in the next few years.
TRANSFORM OUR NETWORKS, SYSTEMS AND SERVICES FOR THE
TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
Our UK network today
BT has the most comprehensive communications network in the
UK, with around 5,600 exchanges, 680 local and 103 trunk
processor units, more than 121 million kilometres of copper
wire and more than eight million kilometres of optical ﬁbre, and
the most extensive IP backbone network in the UK. The network
services we provide include frame relay, ATM (asynchronous
transfer mode) and IPVPN.
Our global reach today
We have one of the broadest IP-enabled networks in Europe and
our network-based services extend to and across North and
South America and the Asia Paciﬁc region.
As at 31 March 2006, our ﬂagship MPLS network service
provided coverage and support to over 90 countries from more
than 1,200 points of presence. Our MPLS revenue grew by 34%
during the 2006 ﬁnancial year, exceeding £400 million.
Global customer service is provided via service and network
management centres around the world, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
Twenty-ﬁrst century network
We believe that our 21CN programme is the most ambitious
business transformation programme in the global
telecommunications industry today and one of the largest ever
investments by a private company in the UK’s infrastructure.
An end-to-end, next-generation IP network, 21CN is
designed to consolidate BT’s complex network and systems
infrastructure to ensure that the delivery of the next generation
of converged services is fast, efﬁcient and highly cost effective.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, for example, we developed the ﬁrst
new 21CN services based on re-usable capabilities. Rather than
being product-speciﬁc, re-usable capabilities form the basis for
a range of products and applications, enhancing the customer
experience by reducing product development and launch times
and proving more cost effective for BT.
In April 2005 we announced the preferred suppliers that will
help us build the 21CN. Following one of the largest
procurement programmes ever undertaken in the
communications industry, formal contractual agreements were
reached with all eight – Alcatel, Ciena, Cisco, Ericsson, Fujitsu,
Huawei, Lucent and Siemens. The ﬁrst equipment orders have
been placed under these contracts.
Following extensive technical trials in the 2006 ﬁnancial year –
including successfully carrying more than six million voice calls
over a trial IP network – we developed a comprehensive national
migration and roll-out plan, which is currently subject to
industry consultation.
As the ﬁrst stage of the mass migration of customers to
21CN, we will be rolling out the new network to business and
residential customers in Cardiff and the surrounding area,
including many served by other telephone and internet service
providers and mobile operators. We anticipate that the full,
national roll out of 21CN will be substantially complete by
2010.
We are committed to building open, transparent and
inclusive relationships with the rest of the industry and launched
Consult21 in the 2005 ﬁnancial year in order to promote a
shared understanding of the 21CN vision and the progress we
are making towards it. Since then, many of our wholesale
customers have contributed to what is now the largest voluntary
industry consultation programme of its kind anywhere in the
communications world today.
What 21CN will mean for customers
21CN will mean the ability to customise, personalise and
change in real time services based on the convergence of voice,
mobility, video, data and content. Ultimately, it is expected to
support the introduction of many more new services than are
currently available, offering greater customer choice.
Corporate and public sector customers will be able to work
more efﬁciently with suppliers, structure their internal
processes, enhance customer service and drive down costs by
deploying integrated networked IT solutions across their entire
supply chains.
CREATE LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS
We believe that our relationships with our customers are key in
a market going through major transformation. Understanding
customers’ needs and responding to them ﬂexibly,
comprehensively and with insight is critical in helping to
differentiate us from our competitors. That is why we aim to
put the customer at the heart of everything we do –
strengthening that relationship and building trust and delivering
what we promise. This will encourage customers to move from
short-term contracts based on individual transactions, to longer-
term arrangements under which they sign up for packages of
services.
Keeping a relentless focus on improving customer
satisfaction is also key to these long-term partnerships.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, our aim was to increase the
number of customers who are ‘very satisﬁed’ and ‘extremely
satisﬁed’ with the service they receive from BT by 5%, while
ensuring that we maintained the reductions achieved in
previous years in levels of customer dissatisfaction.
For the 2006 ﬁnancial year, the average score for customers
‘very satisﬁed’ and ‘extremely satisﬁed’ was 3% higher than in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year, although the customer dissatisfaction
score was slightly worse than in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
The 2006 ﬁnancial year was particularly challenging for the
delivery of customer satisfaction because many of our new wave
products and services require complex customer interactions.
During the year, we recruited a further 900 engineers to ensure
that we could meet customer demand.
We recognise that the quality of service we offer customers
is key to driving up customer satisfaction levels and much of our
training and development activity remains focused on removing
any barriers to the delivery of excellent customer service and a

high-quality customer experience. Our core people engagement
initiative, the ‘my customer’ programme, aims to enable all BT
people to deliver great customer service through teamwork. In
the 2006 ﬁnancial year, ‘my customer’ included:
s a ‘back to the ﬂoor’ event for 1,100 senior managers
s more than 4,500 BT people participating in customer
satisfaction improvement programmes
s the introduction of a ‘customer connected’ programme for
BT people who do not interact with customers directly but
who, nevertheless, play a critical role in delivering customer
satisfaction.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
Acquisitions and disposals prior to the 2006 ﬁnancial year
The BT of today was largely created by a radical restructuring of
the company in the 2002 ﬁnancial year. This restructuring
involved the UK’s largest-ever rights issue (raising £5.9 billion),
the demerger of O2 (comprising BT’s wholly-owned mobile
assets in Europe), the disposal of signiﬁcant non-core
businesses and assets, the unwind of Concert (our joint venture
with AT&T) and the creation of customer-focused lines of
business.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, we acquired Infonet, one of the
world’s leading providers of international managed voice and
data network services, for £520 million, including acquisition
costs. Excluding Infonet’s net cash balance, the net value of the
deal was £315 million. We also acquired the 74% of Albacom
that we did not already own for a total acquisition cost of
£131 million. Albacom provides data transmission, voice and
internet services to the Italian business communications
market. In October 2004, there was an IPO (initial public
offering) of the Singapore telecommunications and media
company, StarHub, in which BT held an 11.9% stake. We
disposed of our entire holding through the IPO for net proceeds
of £77 million. In December 2004, we completed the sale of
our 15.8% stake in Eutelsat to GS Capital Partners – an
investment partnership afﬁliated with Goldman Sachs – for net
proceeds of £356 million.
Acquisitions and disposals in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
A number of acquisitions and disposals were completed in the
year, including:
s in April 2005, we completed the acquisition of Radianz, the
leading ﬁnancial services extranet provider, from Reuters for
a total consideration of £143 million. The purchase of
Radianz is another vital step in our transformation into a
global provider of networked IT services
s between July and September 2005, the conditions enabling
BT to redeem the exchangeable bond over our shares in LG
Telecom were fulﬁlled. As a result, virtually all the
bondholders exercised their right to convert their bonds into
LG Telecom shares, enabling us to dispose of all our shares.
The transaction gave rise to a bond redemption gain of
£27 million
s in February 2006, we acquired Atlanet, a Fiat subsidiary
providing domestic telecommunications services to Fiat and
other non-Fiat business customers throughout Italy, for
approximately E80 million, further reinforcing our position in
the Italian market.
We also completed a number of smaller acquisitions in the
2006 ﬁnancial year, including CW Business Solutions (Cable
and Wireless’s retail operation in Spain), SkyNet Systems (an
independent LAN solutions provider focused on the education,
health, local government and media markets), Total Network
Solutions, (a provider of business solutions to UK corporate,
public sector and service provider customers) and Cara Group (a
provider of communications solutions to business and public
sector clients in the island of Ireland).
REGULATION, COMPETITION AND PRICES
BT operates in an increasingly competitive and dynamic
commercial environment, both in the UK and around the world.
The 2006 ﬁnancial year saw the most signiﬁcant change to the
UK regulatory regime since BT was privatised when, in response
to Ofcom’s strategic review of telecommunications, we
proposed a number of legally-binding Undertakings under the
Enterprise Act 2002 (the Enterprise Act). These Undertakings
were accepted by Ofcom and came into force in September
2005. (See BT’s Undertakings under the Enterprise Act)
The Undertakings are intended to deliver clarity and
certainty to the UK telecommunications industry, leading to
regulation being focused on the deepest point in the network at
which competition is feasible, and rolled back elsewhere.
This is mainly being achieved through the creation of a new
Openreach line of business to manage our access and backhaul
networks and their associated portfolio of Openreach products
and services. Apart from any exceptions agreed with Ofcom,
these products and services are to be made available in exactly
the same way to all communications providers who wish to use
them – including BT itself – under the same timescales, terms
and conditions – including price – and using the same
processes, with the same information available to all.
By offering services equivalently, BT anticipates deregulation
and the beneﬁts this will bring to consumers and others in the
marketplace as part of enhancing the competitive process.
Regulation in the UK
Our policy is to comply fully with the regulatory framework in
which we operate. For example, we are committed to meeting
the obligations imposed under the Communications Act 2003
(the Communications Act) and BT’s Undertakings to Ofcom
under the Enterprise Act, and complying with generally
applicable legislation such as the Competition Act 1998 (the
Competition Act), while competing fairly and vigorously within
the rules.
We continue to work closely with compliance professionals in
the telecommunications and other regulated industries in the
UK and the EU (European Union) to establish best practice. We
publish an annual compliance report (which does not form part
of this report) at
http://www.btplc.com/Societyandenvironment/index.htm
Ofcom
The Ofﬁce of Communications (Ofcom) was set up under the
Ofﬁce of Communications Act 2002 to provide a single,
seamless approach to regulating the entire communications
market. Its functions were deﬁned by the Communications Act.
In carrying out its functions, its principal duty is to further the
interests of citizens in relation to communications matters, and
secondly to further the interests of consumers in relevant
markets, where appropriate by promoting competition. In
performing its duties, it must have regard to a number of
matters, including the desirability of promoting competition and
the use of effective self-regulation, encouraging investment and
innovation, and encouraging the availability and use of high-
speed data services (including broadband).
Regulation takes the form of sets of conditions, mostly laid
down by Ofcom, and directions made by it under these
conditions. Some conditions apply to all providers of electronic
communications networks and services; others apply to
Operating and ﬁnancial review BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 13 Filename: 824560_02.3d Time: 14:33:20 Date: 20/05/06

individual providers which are designated to have the USO
(universal service obligation) or, following a review of the
relevant markets, are found to have SMP (signiﬁcant market
power). Other general obligations are set out in the
Communications Act.
Conditions applying to all providers of electronic
communications networks or services
General Conditions
The ‘General Conditions’ made by Ofcom under the
Communications Act generally apply to all providers of
electronic communications networks or services. Although these
conditions are concerned primarily with consumer protection,
they also address issues such as general access and
interconnection obligations, standards, emergency planning and
numbering. A separate condition regulates the provision of
premium rate services.
Electronic Communications Code conditions
The Electronic Communications Code applies to
communications providers authorised to carry out streetworks
and similar activities for network provision. Its application is
subject to conditions made by the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry.
Other general obligations
Other obligations contained in the Communications Act
include:
s the payment of administrative charges (broadly the
equivalent of licence fees under the old framework)
s the provision of information to Ofcom when required.
Conditions applying to BT speciﬁcally
Universal service obligation conditions
BT is the designated supplier of universal service for the UK,
excluding the Hull area where Kingston Communications is the
designated provider.
The services covered by the USO are deﬁned in an order
issued by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Our
primary obligation is to provide a single narrowband connection
to the ﬁxed telephone network which, in addition to voice
services, must support functional internet access, to anyone
who reasonably requests it. Additional conditions relate to
issues such as schemes for consumers with special social needs,
and the provision of public payphone services.
Ofcom intends to review the cost and beneﬁt of the USO in
2007 and if it considers the net cost of the USO to be an undue
burden, it could look at alternative ways of funding it.
Signiﬁcant market power conditions
Ofcom is required by the European Commission (EC) to deﬁne,
analyse and regularly review markets, and to determine whether
any communications provider has SMP, which is aligned with
the competition law concept of dominance. Economic
regulation can only be imposed following a market review and a
ﬁnding of SMP.
Where Ofcom ﬁnds that a provider has SMP in a market, it
must impose such additional SMP conditions as it considers
appropriate, as speciﬁed in the Communications Act. These
may include obligations to meet reasonable requests to supply
certain services to other communications providers, not to
discriminate unduly and to notify price changes and obligations
relating to regulatory accounting. In some cases, extra
obligations such as price controls have also been imposed.
Following a number of market reviews by Ofcom, BT has been
deemed to have SMP in certain ﬁxed telecommunications
markets, including the markets for ﬁxed narrowband retail
services, ﬁxed narrowband wholesale exchange lines, call
origination and conveyance, wholesale broadband access and
wholesale local access.
Enforcement under the Communications Act
Where a breach of a condition is not remedied following
preliminary notiﬁcation by Ofcom, Ofcom may take legally
enforceable action under the Communications Act and/or
impose a penalty of up to 10% of relevant revenue. In addition,
a person who suffers loss or damage as a result of a breach
may, with Ofcom’s consent, sue for damages. In the case of
serious and repeated contraventions, Ofcom may restrict or
suspend the provider’s entitlement to provide networks or
services. The Communications Act provides for appeals against
regulatory decisions, including appeals on the merits, to the
Competition Appeals Tribunal.
BT’s Undertakings under the Enterprise Act
The key Undertakings given by BT are to:
s establish a new access services division to operate BT’s local
access and backhaul networks, and to provide services over
those networks to the UK communications industry on the
basis of equivalence – we established Openreach for this
purpose on 21 January 2006
s deliver equivalence of input for key wholesale products, and
increased transparency for others
s introduce new rules on access to, and sharing of, certain
restricted information – in particular the commercial
information of Openreach and BT Wholesale
s restrict the exercise of inﬂuence by other parts of BT on the
commercial policy of both Openreach and parts of BT
Wholesale
s ensure fair access and migration to BT’s next-generation
network – 21CN – for other communications providers
s publish and make available to all BT people a code of
practice explaining what they must do to comply with the
Undertakings
s create an Equality of Access Board (EAB) to monitor, report
and advise on BT’s compliance with the Undertakings and
the code of practice. The EAB was established on
1 November 2005. (The EAB Annual Report 2006 (which does
not form part of this report) is available online at
www.bt.com/eabreport).
The Undertakings include a number of things to be achieved
by speciﬁed dates. As at 31 March 2006, we had achieved all
the milestones required by that date, and we are working hard
to ensure future milestones are achieved.
Enforcement under the Enterprise Act
In the case of a breach of the Undertakings, Ofcom has the
right to seek an injunction through the courts. However, the
Undertakings set out a process for Ofcom to issue a direction,
which we would normally expect it to do rather than instigate
court proceedings. A third party who suffers loss from the
breach may take action in the courts against BT for damages.
Whether or not it took enforcement action, Ofcom would be
able to refer BT to the Competition Commission. (See
Enterprise Act)BT’s recourse against an Ofcom decision in
relation to the Undertakings would be an application for judicial
review.

Competition
Competition and the UK economy
The growth of mobile telephony over the past decade has been
a major factor in shaping the UK’s telecommunications
landscape. Mobile now accounts for around 30% of total UK
voice minutes. BT’s share of the UK voice market, including
mobile, is estimated to have fallen by about 3% in the 2006
ﬁnancial year to approximately 37%. The mobile and ﬁxed-line
markets are currently treated as separate and regulated
differently.
We anticipate that competition in the UK ﬁxed
telecommunications market will intensify as a result of the
Undertakings as services are provided equivalently and the
take-up of Openreach products increases.
BT’s share of the residential ﬁxed-voice calls market declined
to an estimated 58% for the 2006 ﬁnancial year, compared
with estimates of 64% and 70% for the 2005 and 2004
ﬁnancial years respectively. CPS (carrier pre-selection) has been
one of the contributors to the loss of share in the ﬁxed-voice
market.
We estimate that BT had 41% of the market for business
ﬁxed-voice calls in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, compared with
estimates of 42% and 44% in the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial
years respectively.
We also estimate that BT supplied around 74% of exchange
lines in the UK at the end of the 2006 ﬁnancial year, compared
with 79% and 82% in the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years
respectively, with cable operators being the primary alternative
providers.
Current and future wholesale line rental arrangements will
enable BT’s ﬁxed-line customers to move PSTN lines to other
operators which are expected to be the source of more
competition in the future.
Since 2000, we have been required to provide LLU (local
loop unbundling) which enables other operators to use the lines
connecting BT’s local exchanges to our customers, and to install
equipment in our exchanges.
There are two types of unbundled line:
s a fully unbundled line gives other operators the exclusive use
of the copper line
s a shared access line only gives other operators the use of the
high-frequency channel used for broadband. The line will
also be used by the customer’s ﬁxed-line voice provider.
Take-up of LLU (a key Openreach product) continued during
the 2006 ﬁnancial year, with the total number of unbundled
lines exceeding 350,000 at 31 March 2006. (We anticipate a
substantial increase in the number of unbundled lines in the
2007 ﬁnancial year.) Communications providers beneﬁted from
lower prices for both connection and rental resulting from cost
studies carried out by Ofcom during the period.
Competition law
In addition to communications industry-speciﬁc regulation, BT
is subject to the competition law provisions of the Competition
Act in the UK and of the European Community Treaty. Breach
of UK or EU rules could lead to ﬁnes of up to 10% of a
company’s worldwide revenue in its previous ﬁnancial year
and/or claims for damages in national courts. A company may
also be ordered to cease an infringing activity.
In 2004, Ofcom launched an investigation into allegations
that BT had abused a dominant position in relation to its pricing
of consumer broadband products. Ofcom sent BT two
statements of objection to which we responded, arguing that
our pricing does not amount to an abuse of dominance. Ofcom
is expected to issue a decision in the ﬁrst half of 2006.
Enterprise Act
The Enterprise Act aims to give more independence to the
competition authorities, reform insolvency and bankruptcy laws,
and tackle trading practices that harm consumers.
Under the Act it is a criminal offence, punishable by
imprisonment and/or a ﬁne, to engage in cartel activity. In
addition, where companies infringe UK or EU competition law,
their directors can be disqualiﬁed from being involved in
managing a company for a maximum period of 15 years.
The Enterprise Act also gives the Ofﬁce of Fair Trading
power to refer issues relating to the possible restriction of
competition in particular markets for investigation by the UK’s
Competition Commission. In relation to communications
markets, this power is exercisable by Ofcom.
Pricing regulation
Fixed network
Our ﬁxed network services in the UK are subject to price
controls – formulated by Ofcom – at the retail and network
levels. Lower network charges beneﬁt both BT’s retail
businesses and other communications providers.
Retail price controls
We are subject to retail price controls covering public-switched
telephony call charges and exchange line rentals. The price
control is based on a formula calculated by reference to the UK
RPI (Retail Prices Index) and a factor, known as X. For services
covered by the controls, average prices cannot increase in each
year beginning 1 August by more than the annual change in RPI
minus X.
The retail price control applies to services used by the 80%
of our residential customers with the lowest bills. The value of X
changed in December 2005 from RPI to zero giving BT a small
increase in pricing freedom up to the end of the current control
period on 31 July 2006. Ofcom is consulting on whether a new
retail price control will be required after July 2006.
In addition, BT has given an assurance that we will adhere to
a RPI + 0% price cap until 30 June 2006 for retail analogue
private circuits and 8 Mbit/s digital private circuits.
Network charge control
We operate under interconnection agreements with most other
operators. Our charges for a range of interconnect services are
controlled by Ofcom, under the NCC (network charge control)
regime. These controls are designed to ensure that our charges
are reasonably derived from costs, plus an appropriate return on
capital employed. Depending on the degree of competition,
charges are cap-controlled each year by RPI minus X for services
Ofcom considers unlikely to become competitive in the near
future, and safeguard cap-controlled (ie no increases above RPI)
for services likely to become competitive. The current NCC
period began on 1 October 2005 and will last until 30
September 2009. For the current charge control, Ofcom has
determined different levels of X for services covered by the
control. These range from RPI–11.5% to RPI+0.75%. At the
same time, Ofcom determined that BT no longer had SMP in
the markets for inter-tandem transit and conveyance.
BT must notify Ofcom and other operators if it intends to
amend existing charges or offer new services.
Number portability
Number portability charges are covered by an RPI minus X
formula with X set at 5%, until 31 July 2006 when the price
control lapses.

Wholesale access charge reductions
As part of the strategic review and to encourage competition,
BT agreed that our wholesale access residential price would be
reduced in two stages. The ﬁrst was a reduction of 50 pence a
month (£1.50 per quarter) implemented on 1 August 2005. The
second reduction followed the publication of Ofcom’s statement
on setting and reviewing charge ceilings for WLR (wholesale line
rental) on 24 January 2006. From 1 March 2006, our rates have
been as follows:
s residential analogue lines: new line installation – £88,
transfer – £2 a line, and annual line rental – £100.68
s business analogue lines: new line installation – £88,
transfer – £2 a line, and annual line rental – £110.
Partial private circuit charge control
PPCs (partial private circuits) are leased lines that BT sells to
other network operators. On 1 October 2004, Ofcom
introduced a PPC charge control to replace the annual
determinations previously carried out by Oftel.
The control is a four-year, three-part RPI-X formula:
s low bandwidth (RPI-4%)
s high bandwidth (RPI-6.5%)
s equipment (RPI-8.9%).
Additionally, as part of our Undertakings, we have agreed to
make a new form of wholesale private circuit services available
via Openreach, subject to demand from other communications
providers. These are TILLAP (traditional interface leased lines
access product) and TILLBP (traditional interface leased lines
backhaul product).
Non-UK regulation
BT must comply with the regulatory regimes in the countries in
which we operate and this can have a material impact on our
business.
European Union
The degree to which European Commission directives relating
to electronic communications have been implemented varies
from country to country. Although the general move towards
the new regime continues, in some countries this is happening
more slowly than, for example, in the UK.
BT does not have universal service obligations outside the
UK, although in certain member states we may be required to
contribute towards an industry fund to pay for the cost of
meeting universal service obligations in those countries.
The European Commission is formally investigating the way
the UK Government has set BT’s property rates and those paid
by Kingston Communications. The Commission is examining
whether the Government has complied with European
Community Treaty rules on state aid in assessing BT’s rates.
BT’s rates were set by the Valuation Ofﬁce after lengthy
discussions based on well established principles in a transparent
process. In our view, any allegation of state aid is groundless
and we are conﬁdent that the Government will demonstrate the
fairness of the UK ratings system. A ﬁnding against the UK
Government could result in BT having to repay any state aid we
may be determined to have received.
Rest of the world
The vast majority of the markets in which we operate around
the world are regulated, and in most of these we have to meet
certain conditions and obtain licences or other authorisations.
The degree to which these markets are liberalised varies widely.
Our ability to compete fully in some countries is therefore
constrained.
We continue to press incumbent operators and their national
regulatory authorities around the world (including the EU) for
cost-related access to their networks where appropriate.
Other signiﬁcant changes and issues
Regulatory valuation of copper-based local access network
In August 2005, Ofcom reduced the current cost regulatory
asset value of the copper-based local access network. This
valuation is used only for regulatory purposes. Ofcom estimated
that the net current cost carrying value of these assets for
regulatory purposes at the end of the 2006 ﬁnancial year will be
reduced by about £879 million. It also extended the periods
over which certain access network assets will be written off from
the 2007 ﬁnancial year onwards.
Ofcom estimated that the combined effect of reducing net
current cost regulatory asset value and extending asset lives
would reduce costs (used for regulatory price setting) relating to
BT’s copper access lines by about £300 million in a full year,
excluding the impact of any change to the allowed return on
capital employed. These changes were reﬂected in revised
prices for wholesale line rental and unbundled local loops
announced in late 2005.
Cost of capital
In August 2005, Ofcom determined what it believed were
appropriate rates for BT’s cost of capital for regulated products
and services. This rate is used only as a reference against the
regulatory current cost values of BT’s regulated products. The
overall rate for BT’s cost of capital was assessed as 10.9% on a
pre-tax nominal basis, compared with a rate of 13.5% set in
2001. The reduction was a result of lower interest rates, a
change in Ofcom’s assessment of the premium associated with
investment in shares, and a revised view of BT’s overall risk
proﬁle compared with the market as a whole.
This overall rate was split by Ofcom into a lower rate of 10%
for local access services (ie those now managed by Openreach),
and a higher rate of 11.4% for the rest of BT. The local access
rate was reﬂected in the revised wholesale prices proposed in
2005 by BT for both unbundled local loop and wholesale line
rental products.
IPStream and Datastream
In June 2005, we reached agreement with Ofcom that rental
prices for IPStream and Datastream – the most popular
wholesale ADSL broadband access products currently used by
service providers – will not reduce until there are 1.5 million
unbundled lines in the UK, with certain exceptions.
Funds for liabilities
Under the terms of the Electronic Communications Code, an
electronic communications provider with apparatus on or in the
public highway is required to make ﬁnancial provision to cover
any damage caused by work it carries out, and for the removal
of its network in the event of liquidation or bankruptcy.
The conditions require the company to provide Ofcom
annually with a certiﬁcate that, in the opinion of its board of
directors, it has fulﬁlled its obligations to ensure the availability
of the required funds. This has been done by BT.
RELATIONSHIP WITH HM GOVERNMENT
The UK Government, collectively, is our largest customer, but
the provision of services to any one of its departments or
agencies does not comprise a material proportion of our
revenue. Except as described below, the commercial
BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 Operating and ﬁnancial review 16 Filename: 824560_02.3d Time: 14:33:21 Date: 20/05/06

relationship between BT as a supplier and the UK Government
as customer has been on a normal customer and supplier basis.
We can, however, be required by law to do certain things
and provide certain services for the UK Government. General
conditions made under the Communications Act require all
providers of public telephone networks and/or publicly available
telephone services, including BT, at the request of and in
consultation with the authorities, to make, and if necessary
implement, plans for the provision or restoration of services in
connection with disasters. The Civil Contingencies Act 2004
contains provisions enabling obligations to be imposed on
providers of public electronic communications networks,
including BT, in connection with civil contingency planning. In
addition, the Secretary of State has statutory powers to require
us to take certain actions in the interest of national security and
international relations.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
BT does not believe that there are any pending legal
proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the
ﬁnancial position or operations of the group.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21
defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with
the Italian UMTS (universal mobile telecommunications system)
auction. Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated
in that auction process. On 20 July 2005, the former BT
employee was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought
by the Rome Public Prosecutor. All the other defendants were
also acquitted. The Public Prosecutor is in the process of
appealing the court’s decision. If the appeal is successful, BT
could be held liable, with others, for any damages. The
company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to
make a provision in respect of any such claim.
RESOURCES
Corporate reputation and brand strength
BT has a strong, integrated brand that is widely recognised
both in the UK and around the world.
Our brand helps to shape our relationships with all our
stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, suppliers and
employees. It is vital that they all have a clear understanding of
what BT stands for, and that all their interactions with us
contribute to a consistently positive image of BT.
As a vital asset, the BT brand needs to be developed,
protected and managed with the same rigour that we bring to
other assets, both tangible and intangible. And as the world and
the markets in which we operate change, so our brand needs to
reﬂect this, becoming more conﬁdent, dynamic and forward
looking.
Towards the end of the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we completed a
thorough review of our brand, as a result of which we developed
a new vision and mission.
Our vision for BT is to be dedicated to helping customers
thrive in a changing world.
Our mission is to be the leader in delivering converged
networked services. By ensuring that the services we offer
customers are consistently focused on meeting their needs,
straightforward and easy to use, we will help those customers
succeed in their business and personal lives.
The review concluded that the BT brand values remained ﬁt
for purpose. Consequently, they are unchanged:
s trustworthy – we do what we say we will
s helpful – we work as one team
s inspiring – we create new possibilities
s straightforward – we make things clear
s heart – we believe in what we do.
During the 2007 ﬁnancial year, we will be delivering a
comprehensive communications plan to ensure that all
stakeholders understand the implications of our new vision,
mission and brand positioning.
Motivating our people and living the BT values
Our commitment to meeting our customers’ needs presents the
104,400 people employed by BT at 31 March 2006 with
opportunities to develop innovative solutions, generate new
business, drive efﬁciencies and experience personal growth.
Our aim is to create a team of high-performing, engaged
and motivated people who can make a difference for customers,
shareholders, the company and themselves. Only by living our
values will we deliver our strategy, keep our promises to our
customers, seize new opportunities in new markets and
maximise the return from our traditional business.
Motivating leaders
The quality of leadership in BT is key to the successful delivery
of our strategy for transformation and growth. We are focused
on ensuring that leaders at all levels understand what is
expected of them, have access to appropriate development
opportunities and are able to benchmark their performance
against that of their peers. We have, for example, rigorously
deﬁned the capabilities we expect our leaders to exhibit and
have introduced a 360 degree feedback tool to help them
measure their performance.
Engaging and motivating our people
Our annual employee attitude survey was conducted most
recently in February 2006 and attracted a more than 75%
response rate (80,000 responses). The survey generates around
5,000 feedback reports for managers and their teams across
the business, helping to promote effective team working.
Employees are kept informed about our business through a
wide range of communications channels, including our online
news service, bi-monthly newspaper, regular e-mail bulletins
and senior management webchats and webcast brieﬁngs.
We have a record of stable industrial relations and enjoy
generally constructive relationships with recognised unions in
the UK and works councils elsewhere in Europe. In the UK, we
recognise two main trade unions – the Communication Workers
Union and Connect. We hold regular meetings between
management, employee trade union representatives and other
groups of employees in order to ensure that their views are
taken into account in any decisions affecting employees’
interests. We also operate a pan-European works council (the
BTECC). Our Chief Executive and other senior executives have
regular meetings with the BTECC and other employee
representatives.
Rewarding and recognising achievement
We continued to provide our employees with opportunities to
acquire a stake in the company. Under the BT Employee Share
Investment Plan (ESIP), BT can provide free shares to
employees and employees can buy shares in BT from their
pre-tax salaries.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, £22 million was allocated to
provide free shares to employees under the ESIP. Employees
outside the UK receive a cash payment equivalent to the value
of the shares. This allocation of proﬁts was linked to the
achievement of corporate performance measures determined by
the Board. In addition, employees can buy shares at a discount
under our savings-related share option plan.

More than 98% of eligible employees participate in one or more
of these plans.
Pensions
Most of our employees are members of the BT Pension Scheme
(a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme) or the BT Retirement Plan (a money
purchase scheme), both of which are controlled by independent
trustees. The BT Pension Scheme was closed to new members
on 31 March 2001. The majority of new employees are eligible
to join the BT Retirement Plan. (See Pensions in the Financial
review)
Health and safety
The health and safety of our people is of paramount importance
and we are implementing a group-wide initiative to reduce
levels of accidents and ill health amongst our workforce. We
have reduced the number of accidents leading to absence from
work from 8.6 cases in every million working hours in 2001 to
2.8 cases in every million working hours at 31 March 2006.
Speciﬁc initiatives addressed lifting and working at heights and
we continued to enhance our occupational road risk
programme.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we ran major initiatives on
lifestyle change focusing on exercise, diet and giving up
smoking.
Learning now and for the future
We believe that people, particularly at the start of their careers,
will increasingly want to work for companies that commit to the
long-term development of their employees.
Our successful company-wide re-accreditation to Investors in
People in February 2005, ﬁrst achieved in 1998, demonstrates
our continuing commitment to the effective alignment of our
communications, training and development with our business
strategy.
We have created a learning governance model to ensure our
learning and development objectives and practice align with the
key strategic objectives of the business. Senior representatives
from all parts of BT sit on the Learning Executive Council and
senior learning and development representatives form the
Learning Council. Both bodies provide strategic and operational
guidance for the whole of BT to ensure that all learning and
development activity is co-ordinated across all lines of business.
In March 2006, we upgraded BT Academy, our web-based
corporate learning portal, to a new platform and renamed it
Route2Learn (R2L). R2L – a group-wide system – is evidence of
our continuing investment in lifelong learning and education for
all BT people. Providing all BT employees with an extensive
range of learning programmes and facilities, it is one of the
largest corporate learning management systems in Europe.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, the BT Academy Learning System
delivered over 250,000 online and nearly 38,000 instructor-led
course completions.
Embedding ﬂexibility and diversity
The changing nature of the markets in which we operate, our
focus on cost leadership and our investment in new services
have impacted the shape of our permanent workforce.
During the 2006 ﬁnancial year, in the UK more than 6,600
(2005 – 3,903) people joined BT, natural attrition was running
at 3% (2005 – 2.6%) and 2,169 (2005 – 2,685) people left BT
under our voluntary paid leaver package.
We are committed to helping our people optimise their
work/life balance. At the end of March 2006, for example,
around 11,000 people were working from home.
We continue to create a working environment that actively
supports all our employees – regardless of gender, race, sexual
orientation, religion/beliefs, disability or age.
Research and development
The GCTO (Group Chief Technology Ofﬁce) sets and drives the
open innovation and technology strategy for BT. GCTO includes
a global technology intelligence scouting unit, teams focused on
innovative new wave service opportunities, an innovation
strategy and media team, strategic technology analysis units, a
network and systems architecture team and world-class
research and venturing facilities in Adastral Park (England),
Malaysia and the USA.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we invested £727 million in
research and development (R&D) to support our drive for
innovation. This investment comprised capitalised software
development costs of £401 million and R&D operating costs of
£326 million. This compares with £522 million in the 2005
ﬁnancial year, which comprised £265 million of capitalised
software development costs and £257 million of R&D operating
costs.
In addition, the 2006 ﬁnancial year includes an amortisation
charge of £160 million (2005 – £95 million) in respect of
capitalised software development costs.
This increase in R&D underpins our increased focus on
developing innovative products and services for a converged,
networked world.
We continue to focus our innovation work on key areas
which support our business and technology strategies, ﬁling
patent applications for 141 new inventions in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year and maintaining a total worldwide portfolio of 7,700
patents and applications.
We have successfully launched eight innovative, independent
start-up companies through the corporate venturing partnership
unit New Venture Partners, in which we are a limited partner.
These start-ups generate value by launching innovative
solutions as high-technology businesses in the global
marketplace.
IT support
Our dedicated IT professionals have a strong track record in the
development and delivery of systems and solutions and in
managing a secure and resilient infrastructure.
Over the past year, we continued to enhance our approach
to systems development through our One IT programme, which
aims to deliver year-on-year reductions in base costs. Our
objective is to transform the various IT units throughout BT into
a single team, rigorously focused on customer requirements.
Our IT strategy is about speed of response and the focusing
of resources in selected areas – at the end of the 2006 ﬁnancial
year, there were fewer IT systems running in BT than at the
beginning of the year. At its heart is the radical rationalisation
of our systems portfolio, strict adherence to 90-day delivery
cycles and an intense focus on improving the customer
experience.
Property
At 31 March 2006, we occupied approximately 6,500
properties in the UK and approximately 1,500 properties
around the world.
The majority of these UK properties are owned by – and
leased back from – the Telereal Group, which is part of the
William Pears Group.
These properties mainly house exchange equipment and are
needed as part of our continuing activities. Other, general

purpose, properties consist chieﬂyofofﬁces, depots and

We anticipate that our changing working patterns will
continue to reduce property costs.
OUR COMMITMENT TO SOCIETY
Corporate social responsibility
Managing social, ethical and environmental issues in a way that
grows shareholder value and helps BT and our customers be
more sustainable is very important to us.
The Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes rank companies for
their success in managing social, ethical and environmental
factors for competitive advantage. During the 2006 ﬁnancial
year, BT was ranked as the top telecommunications company in
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the ﬁfth year in a row.
We also hold the Queen’s Award for Enterprise in
recognition of our contribution to sustainable development and
we were ranked equal 4th in Business in the Community’s 2005
Corporate Responsibility Index.
This section of the report, together with the broad statement
on social, environmental and ethical matters included in the
Report of the directors, provides information in response to
the Association of British Insurers’ disclosure guidelines on
social responsibility.
More detailed disclosures on BT’s implementation of social,
ethical and environmental policies and procedures are available
online in our independently-veriﬁed Social and Environmental
Report 2006 which has been prepared in accordance with the
2002 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting
guidelines and assured against the AA1000 Assurance
Standard.
CSR governance
The Board reviews our CSR strategy, performance and risks
annually and is kept informed of new developments that may
impact on its duties.
A Board committee – the Community Support Committee –
oversees community, charitable and arts expenditure and the
strategy for maximising our contribution to society. The
committee, chaired by Sir Christopher Bland, consists of
representatives from BT businesses, three non-executive
directors and two independent members who have a reputation
for excellence in this ﬁeld.
An executive committee, the Corporate Social Responsibility
Steering Group, oversees the implementation of our CSR
strategy and programme. This includes risk assessment, target
and objective setting and public accountability. BT also takes
advice from an independent panel of CSR experts.
During the 2006 ﬁnancial year, our CSR strategy was
substantially revised and updated to focus on three principal
issues – climate change, sustainable economic growth and an
inclusive society. Embedding CSR into our commercial
operations remains an important part of our strategy. As part of
this process, we have carried out a number of ‘health checks’ in
our commercial operations to identify speciﬁc social,
environmental and ethical risks and opportunities.
We have important relationships with a wide range of
stakeholders around the globe, including employees, customers
and suppliers and engage with them in a number of different
ways.
As part of our CSR performance measurement, we have 12
CSR KPIs (key performance indicators) which cover our
relationships with our stakeholders, as well as our
environmental performance and our contribution to digital
inclusion and business integrity. Details of our performance
against these are published in our annual social and
environmental report.
Our CSR team co-ordinates and monitors CSR performance,
identiﬁes potential issues and opportunities that could affect
the business and supports BT’s commercial activities.
Social, environmental and ethical risks
During the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we further developed our
knowledge and understanding of our CSR risks. In the context
of CSR, our most signiﬁcant risks continue to be:
s breach of the code of business ethics
s climate change
s diversity
s health and safety
s outsourcing
s privacy
s supply chain working conditions.
Each of these risks has an owner and mitigation strategy in
place (more detail on these risks can be found in our online
social and environmental report). These risks are not regarded
as material in relation to the BT group and, consequently, are
not included in Group risk factors.
CSR business opportunities
We have measured the link between customer satisfaction and
CSR performance for a number of years and our current
customer satisfaction models indicate a positive correlation.
Customers who believe that BT takes its responsibility to society
and the community seriously are more than twice as likely as
other customers to be ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ satisﬁed with BT.
Long-term sustainability trends are creating market
opportunities for us – the use, for example, of teleconferencing
and ﬂexible working to reduce the need to travel and provide
more ﬂexible lifestyles.
Increasingly, BT has to address social and environmental
matters when bidding for business. In the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
bids to the value of £1.3 billion required us to demonstrate
expertise in managing these issues.
Procurement
Through our supply chain initiative, Sourcing with Human
Dignity, we seek to ensure that the working conditions in our
supply chain meet internationally recognised human rights
standards, and to investigate potential social and environmental
shortcomings. We monitor and set published targets for our
relationships with suppliers; in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, for
example, 89% of suppliers were satisﬁed with their working
relationship with us.
Environment
During the 2006 ﬁnancial year, we achieved re-certiﬁcation
under the revised ISO 14001 standard – the international
standard for environmental management systems – for our
operations in the UK and Spain. We requested withdrawal of
our certiﬁcation in Ireland, pending reorganisation and will seek
re-accreditation during the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
Although BT is one of the largest consumers of industrial and
commercial electricity in the UK, and the growth of broadband
continues to increase our electricity use, our electricity
consumption increased by less than 1% in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year. The green energy contract we signed in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year means that almost all our UK electricity needs are met
from environmentally friendly sources, including wind
generation, solar, wave and hydroelectric schemes.

Digital inclusion
Following research that showed that, if not addressed, the
digital divide would, by 2025, become even wider, particularly
among older and disabled people, we are working with Age
Concern to support their digital inclusion strategy. This includes
providing support to develop further their network of Silver
Surfer clubs and providing training for volunteers and staff.
The EverybodyOnline initiative continues in a number of the
most deprived communities around the UK, successfully
demonstrating that digital inclusion makes a positive difference.
Internationally, our Lifelines India initiative helps developing
world farmers access essential advice and information over a
digital network.
Community investment
We commit a minimum of 1% of our UK pre-tax proﬁts to
activities which support society. We provided a total of
£21.3 million designed to beneﬁt society in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year, of which £2.5 million was charitable donations.
Our community investment strategy aims to help individuals
and communities make a better world through communications
skills and technology. Examples include an education
programme which provides free resources for teachers, pupils
and parents, and in-school activities with drama groups and BT
volunteers, both in the UK and internationally. To date, we have
involved over two million pupils at more than 12,000 schools.
We also helped Comic Relief, Children in Need and the
Disasters Emergency Committee run successful telethons which
raised millions for good causes around the globe.
ChildLine, a UK charity, answers 2,500 calls every day but
many hundreds more go unanswered. We are working with
ChildLine on a campaign to ensure that every child’s call for
help is answered.
Our response to major world disasters included sending a
specialist team to the Pakistan earthquake disaster zone to
install emergency satellite telephone equipment.
Disability services
Our age and disability action team promotes equal access to a
wide range of products and services. We work directly with
older and disabled people and their representatives to raise
awareness of BT’s inclusive approach and are continuing to
develop our processes to ensure that new products and services
are accessible by as many disabled people as possible.
Our age and disability action website, for example, now
includes information about broadband in British Sign Language.
BT is the ﬁrst commercial organisation to provide online
information in this format, opening up access for deaf people.
GROUP RISK FACTORS
In common with all businesses, BT is affected by a number of
risk factors, not all of which are wholly within our control.
Although many of the risk factors inﬂuencing our performance
are macroeconomic and likely to affect the performance of
businesses generally, others are particular to our operations.
This section highlights some of those particular risks but it is
not intended to be an extensive analysis of all risks affecting the
business. Some risks may be unknown to us and other risks,
currently regarded as immaterial, could turn out to be material.
All of them have the potential to impact our business, revenue,
proﬁts, assets, liquidity and capital resources adversely.
They should also be considered in connection with the
statement on internal control and risk management in the
Report of the directors – Internal control and risk
management on page 45, the forward-looking statements in
this document and the Cautionary statement regarding
forward-looking statements on page 133.
Regulatory controls
If our activities are subject to signiﬁcant price and other
regulatory controls, our market share, competitive position and
future proﬁtability may be affected.
Most of BT’s ﬁxed network activities in the UK are subject to
signiﬁcant regulatory controls. The controls regulate, among
other things, the prices we may charge for many of our services
and the extent to which we have to provide services to our
competitors. In recent years, the effect of these controls has
been to cause us to reduce our prices. We cannot assure our
shareholders that the regulatory authorities will not increase the
severity of the price controls, nor extend the services to which
controls apply (including any new services that we may offer in
the future), nor extend the services which we have to provide to
our competitors. These controls may adversely affect our
market share, the severity of competition and our future
proﬁtability. In response to Ofcom’s strategic review of
telecommunications, we proposed a number of legally binding
Undertakings under the Enterprise Act 2002. These
Undertakings were accepted by Ofcom and came into force in
September 2005. In the case of a breach of the Undertakings,
Ofcom has the right to seek an injunction through the courts or
issue a direction. Third parties who suffer losses as a result of
the breach may also take action against BT in the courts for
damages. The timescales for achievement of a number of the
milestones in the Undertakings are very challenging. Further
details on the regulatory framework in which BT operates can
be found in Regulation, competition and prices.
BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 Operating and ﬁnancial review 20 Filename: 824560_02.3d Time: 14:33:22 Date: 20/05/06
Checksum: 258552837
Competition in UK ﬁxed-network services
We face strong competition in UK ﬁxed-network services.
Ofcom considers that we have signiﬁcant market power in
various parts of the UK ﬁxed telecommunications market. In
these areas Ofcom can enforce obligations to meet reasonable
requests to supply services to other communications providers,
not to discriminate unduly, to notify price changes and in some
cases it can also impose extra obligations such as price controls.
Ofcom has promoted competition in the ﬁxed-network area
by measures including local loop unbundling, carrier
pre-selection (making it easier for BT customers to route some
or all of their calls over our competitors’ networks) and the
introduction of wholesale access products.
Reduction in our share of the ﬁxed-network market may lead
to a fall in our revenue and an adverse effect on proﬁtability.
Unlike our competitors, we continue to be obliged by the
current regulatory regime to serve customers in the UK,
whether or not such provision of service is economic.
There is also competition for voice and data trafﬁc volumes
between ﬁxed-network operators and those operators offering
VoIP and mobile services.
The impact of all these factors may be to accelerate the
diversion of our more proﬁtable customers without being able
to reduce our costs commensurately, which may cause adverse
effects on our business, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition
and prospects.
Technological advances
Our continued success depends on our ability to exploit new
technology rapidly.
We operate in an industry with a recent history of rapid
technological changes and we expect this to continue –
new technologies and products will emerge, and existing
technologies and products will develop further.
We need continually to exploit next-generation technologies
in order to develop our existing and future services and
products.
However, we cannot predict the actual impact of these
future technological changes on our business or our ability to
provide competitive services.
For example, there is evidence of substitution by customers
using mobile phones for day-to-day voice calls in place of
making such calls over the ﬁxed network and of calls being
routed over the internet in place of the traditional switched
network.
If these trends accelerate, our ﬁxed-network assets may be
used uneconomically and our investment in these assets may
not be recovered through proﬁts on ﬁxed-network calls and line
rentals.
The complexity of the 21CN programme may also result in
delays to the delivery of expected beneﬁts. Impairment
write-downs may be incurred and margins may decline if ﬁxed
costs cannot be reduced in line with falling revenue.
Transformation strategy
Our strategy for transformation includes the targeting of
signiﬁcant growth in new wave business areas. This may result
in changes to our products, services, markets and culture. If this
transformation strategy is unsuccessful there is a risk that
future revenue and proﬁtability will decline.
In particular, we have targeted signiﬁcant growth in new
business areas, such as networked IT services, broadband and
mobility. In view of the likely level of competition and
uncertainties regarding the level of economic activity, there can
be no certainty that we will meet our growth targets in these
areas, with a consequential impact on future revenue and
proﬁtability.
Major contracts
Our business may be adversely affected if we fail to perform on
major contracts.
We have entered into a number of complex and high-value
networked IT services contracts with customers. Our pricing,
cost and proﬁtability estimates for major contracts generally
include anticipated long-term cost savings that we expect to
achieve over the life of the contract.
These estimates are based on our best judgement of the
efﬁciencies we plan to deploy. Any increased costs, delays or
failures to achieve the anticipated savings could make these
contracts less proﬁtable or loss making, adversely impacting our
proﬁt margins.
In some cases, our products and services incorporate
software or system requirements from other suppliers or service
providers. Our ability to meet our commitments in a timely
manner may depend on the ability of these suppliers and service
providers to meet their obligations. Failure to manage and meet
our commitments under these contracts may lead to a
reduction in our future revenue, proﬁtability and cash
generation.
Networks and systems failures
Our business depends on our ability to transfer substantial
volumes of data speedily and without interruption. Any
signiﬁcant failure or interruption of such data transfer as a
result of factors outside our control could have a material
adverse effect on the business and our results from operations.
We have a business continuity strategy in place, designed to
deal with such catastrophic events including, for example, major
terrorist action, industrial action, extreme computer virus
attack, hurricane or ﬂooding. A failure to deliver that strategy
may result in a material loss and there can be no assurance that
material adverse events will not occur.
Pensions
Declining investment returns and longer life expectancy may
result in the cost of funding BT’sdeﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme becoming a signiﬁcant burden on our ﬁnancial
resources.
As a result of the triennial actuarial valuation of the BTPS at
31 December 2002, BT agreed to make annual deﬁciency
payments of £232 million. The triennial actuarial valuation at
31 December 2005 is currently being reviewed in the context of
recent regulatory developments and the impact of the Crown
Guarantee granted on privatisation in 1984.
The results of future scheme valuations will be impacted by
the future performance of investment markets, interest and
inﬂation rates and the general trend towards longer life
expectancy, as well as regulatory changes, all of which are
outside our control.

For the year ended 31 March 2006, the group is required to prepare its audited annual consolidated ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) Interpretations, as adopted by the European Union (EU) and those parts of the UK Companies Act 1985 applicable to
companies reporting under IFRS.
Previously the group prepared its audited annual ﬁnancial statements under UK generally accepted accounting principles (UK
GAAP). The 2005 comparative ﬁnancial statements have therefore been restated as part of the ﬁrst-time adoption requirements of
IFRS. As allowed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules in relation to ﬁrst-time adoption of IFRS, only one year
of comparative ﬁnancial statements are presented in this Annual report. The policies set out on pages 65 to 72 of this report have
been applied consistently to the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years, with the exception of those policies relating to ﬁnancial
instruments under IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ (IAS 32) and IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’ (IAS 39), which have been applied with effect from 1 April 2005.
The selected ﬁnancial data on pages 22 to 25 is shown in accordance with IFRS for 2006 and 2005 and UK GAAP for 2005 to
2002. The UK GAAP data should be read in conjunction with the IFRS transition adjustments in note 34 to gain an understanding
of the nature of the adjustments made to UK GAAP ﬁnancial information to comply with IFRS. IFRS differs in certain respects from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The material differences between IFRS and US GAAP relevant to the
group are explained on pages 114 to 121.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

INTRODUCTION TO THE FINANCIAL REVIEW
The ﬁnancial results for the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years
reﬂect the continued strong growth in new wave services as we
drive value from transforming the business. Our results reﬂect
the continuing transformation of our business operations and
markets in an environment where the pace of change is
accelerating. We are driving the change by providing our
customers with new technology and services with greater
capabilities and lower cost. The focus on delivering the strategy
continued and the group’s performance beneﬁted from the
growth in new wave activities, such as networked IT services,
broadband and mobility, and our continued cost efﬁciency
programmes. Our global networked IT services business has
grown and our global capabilities have been strengthened by
the successful acquisitions of Infonet and Albacom in 2005 and
Radianz and Atlanet in 2006.
In this Financial review the commentary is focused principally
on the trading results of BT Group before speciﬁc items.
Speciﬁc items, by virtue of their size or nature, are excluded
because they predominantly relate to corporate transactions
rather than the trading activities of the group. This is also
consistent with the way that ﬁnancial performance is measured
by management and we believe allows a meaningful comparison
to be made of the trading results of the group during the period
under review.
Speciﬁc items are therefore analysed and discussed
separately from the line of business results in this Financial
review because they are considered to be a reﬂection of the
corporate activity rather than the trading activity of the lines of
business.
The commentary in this Financial review also discusses
trading results including and excluding the impact of
acquisitions. In discussing underlying performance (excluding
the impact of acquisitions) we exclude the results of the
Albacom and Infonet acquisitions made in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year. The Radianz and Atlanet acquisitions made in the 2006
ﬁnancial year do not have a signiﬁcant impact on the group
results for the year and hence are not excluded when discussing
underlying performance in 2006.
The following table shows the summarised income statement
which includes a reconciliation of the key performance
measures before and after speciﬁc items and is discussed
further in this Financial review. The operating results by line of
business are discussed in addition to the overall group results as
we believe the activities and markets they serve are distinct and
this analysis provides a greater degree of insight to investors.

ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
The group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations in issue as
adopted by the EU effective as at 31 March 2006. Following the announcement by the SEC to allow an exemption from the
provision of a second year of comparative ﬁnancial statements, BT decided to take advantage of the exemption and hence the
transition date for the adoption of IFRS is 1 April 2004. All comparative data in these statements has been restated accordingly
with the exception that the group has taken the exemption allowed by IFRS 1‘First-time Adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards’ not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39. Further details can be found in note 34 to the group’s
consolidated ﬁnancial statements on page 111. The parent company ﬁnancial statements of BT Group plc have been prepared in
accordance with UK GAAP.

GROUP RESULTS
Whilst driving the transformation of the business, the group has
continued to make progress in growing earnings per share
before speciﬁc items which at 19.5 pence were 8% ahead of the
2005 ﬁnancial year.
The pace of our transformation was demonstrated by the
38% growth in new wave revenue to £6,282 million. New wave
revenue represented 32% of revenue in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
compared to 25% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year and is mainly
generated from networked IT services, broadband and mobility.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year the growth in new wave revenue of
38% more than offset the 5% decline in traditional revenue to
£13,232 million. The continued decline in traditional revenue
reﬂects regulatory intervention, competition, price reductions
and also technological changes that we are using to drive
customers from traditional services to new wave services, such
as broadband and IPVPN.
In the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years mobile operators were
required to reduce their fees for terminating calls and these
regulatory reductions were passed on to BT customers resulting
in lower revenues. The net effect, however, was proﬁt neutral as
payments to mobile operators were reduced by the same
amount. In the 2006 ﬁnancial year total revenue of £19,514
million was up 7% after excluding the £227 million (2005 –
£397 million) impact of these regulatory reductions to mobile
termination rates. Total revenue increased by 6% including the
effect of these reductions.
The table below analyses revenue by customer segment.
Major corporate includes the external revenue of BT Global
Services’ major corporate customers, excluding the global
carrier business. Business includes the external revenue of BT
Retail from SME (smaller and medium sized enterprise)
customers. Consumer includes the external revenue of BT Retail
from consumer customers. Wholesale includes the external
revenue of BT Wholesale and BT Global Services’ global carrier
business.

Major corporate (UK and international) revenue increased by
16% to £6,880 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year driven by the
growth in new wave revenue. This reﬂects the continued
migration from traditional voice only services to networked IT
services contracts and an increase in mobility and broadband
revenue. New wave revenue increased by 35% to £4,067 million
and represented 59% of all major corporate revenue compared
to 51% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. Networked IT services
contract wins in the 2006 ﬁnancial year were £5.4 billion. We
believe these wins in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, combined with
the £7.7 billion of contracts won in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, are
building the foundation for future revenue growth as we
increase the level of networked IT services provided to major
corporate customers.
Revenue from business (smaller and medium sized
enterprise) customers in the 2006 ﬁnancial year reduced by 5%
to £2,324 million. This decline reﬂects the continued
penetration of Carrier pre-selection (CPS) and the impact of
customers switching from traditional telephony services to new
wave services, including broadband. New wave revenue in this
segment increased by 16% to £544 million driven mainly by the
31% growth in the number of BT Business Broadband
customers to 453,000 at 31 March 2006. The expansion of the
BT Business Plan portfolio continued during the year with the
number of locations increasing by 15% to 513,000. This,
together with our 83 BT Local Businesses, offset some of the
decline in traditional revenue.
Consumer revenue in the 2006 ﬁnancial year was 5% lower
at £5,296 million. New wave consumer revenue increased by
55% to £638 million, driven by growth of broadband and
mobility. Residential broadband connections increased 52% to
2,028,000 at 31 March 2006. Traditional consumer revenue
declined by 10% reﬂecting the shift towards new wave
products.
The proportion of contracted revenues has been increasing.
By 31 March 2006, more than 2 million customers had signed
up for BT Together Options 2 and 3, and 67% (2005 – 64%) of
consumer call revenue was under contract. There are now
16.2 million BT Together customers on Option 1, 2 and 3
packages. The underlying 12 months rolling average revenue
per customer household (net of mobile termination charges) of
£251 in the 2006 ﬁnancial year was 1% lower than the 2005
ﬁnancial year.
Wholesale (UK and global carrier) revenue in the 2006
ﬁnancial year increased by 13% to £4,996 million. New wave
revenue in the UK wholesale business increased by 56% driven
by the continuing growth in broadband. Global carrier revenue
increased by 22% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and reﬂects the
increase in call termination revenues outside the UK.
In the UK BT had 7.9 million wholesale broadband DSL
connections, including LLU lines, at 31 March 2006
representing an increase of 2.9 million connections in the year.
Group operating costs before speciﬁc items increased by 7%
to £17,108 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. Excluding
acquisitions, group operating costs before speciﬁc items

increased by 3%. Our cost efﬁciency programmes achieved
savings of over £400 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year which
enabled us to invest in growing our new wave activities. Total
operating costs of £17,246 million, including speciﬁc items,
increased by 8%.
Staff costs in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, excluding leaver costs
of £133 million, increased by £445 million to £4,833 million
due to the full year impact of the acquisitions, the additional
staff required to grow the networked IT services business and to
service increased levels of activity in the network. Payments to
other telecommunications operators in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
were £4,045 million, an increase of 9% mainly reﬂecting the
impact of higher volumes and the full year impact of Albacom
and Infonet. Other operating costs before speciﬁc items in the
2006 ﬁnancial year increased by 11% to £6,113 million. This
reﬂects the cost of investing in new wave activities and
supporting new networked IT services contracts.
BT’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ post tax proﬁt
before speciﬁc items was £16 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
compared with losses of £14 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year Albacom contributed post tax
losses of £22 million prior to becoming a subsidiary.
Net ﬁnance expense was £472 million for the 2006 ﬁnancial
year, an improvement of £127 million against the 2005
ﬁnancial year. This improvement was due to a number of
factors including the net ﬁnance income associated with the
group’sdeﬁned beneﬁt pension obligation of £254 million
which was £56 million higher than last year, the reduction in
the level of net debt and a gain on redemption of the group’s
US dollar convertible bond.
The above factors resulted in the group achieving a proﬁt
before speciﬁc items and taxation of £2,177 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year, an increase of 5%. The improvement in the year
reﬂects the improved performance of BT Retail and BT
Wholesale, lower net ﬁnance expense and an increase in the
share of proﬁts from associates and joint ventures.
The taxation expense on the proﬁt before speciﬁc items for
the 2006 ﬁnancial year was £533 million, an effective rate of
24.5% compared to 26.0% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The
improvement in the effective tax rate reﬂects the tax efﬁcient
investment of surplus cash and continued improvement in the
tax efﬁciency within the group.
Basic earnings per share before speciﬁc items were 19.5
pence for the 2006 ﬁnancial year, an increase of 8% from 18.1
pence.

LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS
In the following commentary, we discuss the operating results
of the group for the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years in relation to
the lines of business.
There is extensive trading between the lines of business and
their proﬁtability is dependent on the transfer price levels. For
regulated products and services those transfer prices are based
on market prices, whilst for other products and services the
transfer prices are agreed between the relevant lines of
business.
The table below analyses the trading relationships between
each of the lines of business for the 2006 ﬁnancial year. The
majority of the internal trading is BT Wholesale selling calls,
access lines, broadband connections and other network
products to BT Retail. This trading relationship also reﬂects the
pass through of termination charges on other telecom operator
networks and the sale of wholesale broadband ISP products. BT
Retail also trades with BT Wholesale, selling apparatus,
operator assistance and directory enquiries services and
conferencing for onward sale to other telecom operators. BT
Global Services’ revenue with BT Retail mainly reﬂects the sales
of BT Global Services’ products in the UK. BT Global Services
trades with BT Wholesale mainly for use of the IP/ATM network,
International Direct Dial trafﬁc settlements and certain dial IP
revenue share arrangements. BT Wholesale’s revenue with BT
Global Services reﬂects the use of the network infrastructure for
BT Global Services’ products.

The line of business results are presented and discussed before
speciﬁc items, for the reasons set out above, to provide a
meaningful comparison of the trading results between the
ﬁnancial years under review. Speciﬁc items are discussed
separately in a group context in this Financial review.
In addition to measuring ﬁnancial performance of the lines of
business based on the operating proﬁt before speciﬁc items,
management also measure the operating ﬁnancial performance
of the lines of business based upon the EBITDA before speciﬁc
items. EBITDA is deﬁned as the group proﬁt (loss) before
depreciation, amortisation, interest and taxation. This is a
non-GAAP measure and therefore may not be directly
comparable to the EBITDA of other companies as they may
deﬁne it differently. EBITDA excludes interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation, the latter two being non cash
items, from group operating proﬁt and is a common measure,
particularly in the telecommunications sector, used by investors
and analysts in evaluating the operating ﬁnancial performance
of companies.
EBITDA before speciﬁc items is considered to be a good
measure of the group’s operating performance because it
reﬂects the underlying operating cash costs, by eliminating
depreciation and amortisation, and excludes material one off or
unusual items that are predominantly related to corporate
transactions. EBITDA is not a direct measure of the group’s
liquidity, which is shown by the group’s cash ﬂow statement
and needs to be considered in the context of the group’s
ﬁnancial commitments. A reconciliation of EBITDA before
speciﬁc items to group operating proﬁt (loss) by line of business
and for the group is provided in the table across the page
above. Trends in EBITDA before speciﬁc items are discussed for
each line of business in the following commentary.

BT Retail’s results demonstrated a continued strategic shift
towards new wave products with growth in broadband,
networked IT services and mobility revenues. Despite the
substitution by new wave products, traditional revenue was
defended by changes in pricing structure and packages to
beneﬁt frequent users and marketing campaigns focusing on
key customer service promises. BT Privacy, a service to address
the problem of unwanted calls by giving customers greater
control over the calls they receive, was launched on 1 July
2005, with 3.7 million customers registered by 31 March 2006.
As at 31 March 2006, 16.2 million customers were on BT
Together packages. In the small and medium size (SME) UK
business market the focus remains on placing customers on
commitment packages whereby lower call prices are received
for annual committed spend. By 31 March 2006 there were
513,000 Business Plan sites, up 15% in the year. Cost
transformation programmes continued to successfully reduce
the cost base of the traditional business, allowing investment in
new wave products and services.
BT Retail’s revenue decreased by 3% in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year to £8,452 million. The growth in new wave revenue of
38% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year continued to reduce our
dependence on traditional revenue, the decline in which was
driven by the impact of regulation and competition. After

adjusting for the regulatory impact of the reduction in mobile
termination rates, revenue declined by 2% in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year. Revenue for the two years is summarised as follows:
2006 2005
£m £m
BT Retail revenue
Traditional 7,088 7,712
Networked IT services 363 304
Broadband 730 502
Mobility 154 103

New wave 1,364 986
Total 8,452 8,698
Traditional revenue comprises calls made by customers on the
BT ﬁxed line network in the UK, analogue lines, equipment
sales, rentals and other business voice products. Overall
revenue was 8% lower in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. The reduction
includes the effect of continued high levels of migration to
broadband which is reﬂected in a 46% fall in dial up minutes
over the year, a reduction of 10% in ISDN lines and general
competitive pressure. It also reﬂects the decline in private
circuits and ISDN as customers migrate to new wave products
and services, including broadband and IPVPN.
New wave revenue grew by 38% to £1,364 million in the
2006 ﬁnancial year driven primarily by broadband, mobility and
networked IT services. New wave revenue comprised 16% of BT
Retail’s revenue in the 2006 ﬁnancial year compared to 11% in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Broadband revenue grew by 45% to £730 million in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. The growth of broadband continues to
accelerate with 2,584,000 BT Retail connections at 31 March
2006, an increase of 47% over last year.
BT Retail had net additions of 832,000 broadband
customers in the year, a 31% share of the broadband DSL net
additions.
Broadband is increasingly critical to the success of SMEs and
BT Business Broadband revenue continues to grow.
Revenue from mobility services increased by 50% to
£154 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. During the year we
launched BT Fusion, the world’s ﬁrst seamless combined ﬁxed
and mobile communications services on a single handset. The
consumer launch was in June 2005 and the business market
launch was in February 2006. BT Fusion has attracted over
25,000 connections in the period since launch.
Networked IT services revenue increased by 19% to
£363 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. SME’s have become
increasingly interested in the beneﬁts they can achieve by
converging their voice and data into one network and BT
Business Networked IT services are integrating and simplifying
the way customers are unifying their organisation’s voice and
data services. The portfolio includes IP infrastructure – WAN/
LAN and IP telephony and also Data Centre Services, Security,
Applications and outsourcing.
The total number of BT Retail lines, which includes voice,
digital and broadband, were 5% lower at 28 million at 31 March
2006, reﬂecting the continued growth in broadband offset by
the declining PSTN lines.
BT Retail’s gross margin percentage increased by 0.8
percentage points in the 2006 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting
improved margin management and greater efﬁciency in
managing the service provider network.
Gross margin is revenue less costs directly attributable to the
provision of the products and services reﬂected in revenue in
the period. Selling, general and administration costs are those
costs that are ancillary to the business processes of providing
products and services and are the general business operating
costs. BT Retail analyses its costs in this manner for
management purposes in common with other retail
organisations and it has set target savings for selling, general
and administration expenses.
Cost transformation programmes in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
generated selling, general and administration cost savings of
£206 million (£37 million net of new wave investment). These
savings were driven by cost reduction programmes focused on
elimination of failure, channel effectiveness, overheads and
removal of inefﬁciencies and duplication. The majority of these
initiatives were targeted at people related costs, with signiﬁcant
savings in billing, IT operations and other support functions.
BT Retail’s EBITDA increased by 5% to £791 million in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. This is a signiﬁcant improvement compared
to last year, which experienced EBITDA decline. The beneﬁts
from the investment in new products and value added services
have contributed to an improved EBITDA performance in the
current year. This was also reﬂected in the 6% improvement in
operating proﬁt to £644 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
Capital expenditure for the 2006 ﬁnancial year was
£153 million, a decrease of 10% resulting from tight controls
over expenditure.
On 28 April 2006, BT Retail announced the acquisition of
dabs.com, one of the UK’s leading internet retailers of IT and
technology products. The acquisition is part of BT Retail’s
strategy to strengthen its online sales and service capabilities,
particularly for business and consumer products.

BT Wholesale is the line of business within BT that provides
network services and solutions within the UK. Its customers
include communications companies, ﬁxed and mobile network
operators, internet and other service providers interconnecting
with BT’sUK ﬁxed network. The customer base also includes
BT’s lines of business, BT Retail and BT Global Services. The
majority of BT Wholesale’s revenue is internal (2006 – 54%,
2005 – 58%) and mainly represents trading with BT Retail.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, revenue totalled £9,232 million,
an increase of 2%. External revenue increased by 11% to
£4,226 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year (an increase of 15%
excluding the impact of regulatory reductions to mobile
termination rates). The increase reﬂects particularly strong
growth in new wave revenues, mainly broadband. The
regulatory price reductions on mobile termination rates have no
impact on proﬁtability.
External revenue from traditional products increased by 1%
in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. Excluding the impact of regulatory
reductions to mobile termination rates external traditional
revenue was up 6% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. The increase in
traditional revenue was mainly driven by growth in Partial
Private Circuits (PPCs) and Wholesale Access. Customers
continued to migrate from lower bandwidth products to less
expensive alternatives such as PPCs and broadband and this is
reﬂected in revenue from PPCs which increased by 18% to
£225 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. Substitution to
broadband has resulted in the continued declining trend in Flat

Rate Internet Access Call Origination revenues which have more
than halved to £26 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. Wholesale
access revenues have increased by £142 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year as a result of increased volumes from other
service providers.
New wave revenue, including broadband and managed
services grew by 56% to £1,033 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year. Broadband revenues grew by 74% year on year.
Wholesale broadband connections, including LLU lines,
increased to 7.9 million at 31 March 2006, an increase of
2.9 million compared to prior year, with all connections
available at up to 2 Mbit/s.
Internal revenue decreased by 5% to £5,006 million in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. The reduction reﬂects both the impact of
lower volumes of calls, lines and private circuits, and lower
regulatory prices being reﬂected in internal charges.
Gross variable proﬁt increased by 1% to £7,031 million for
the 2006 ﬁnancial year reﬂecting volume changes and changes
in the mix towards more proﬁtable products.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, network and selling, general and
administration costs, excluding leaver costs, were 3% higher at
£3,103 million. Leaver costs were £34 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year and £62 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Activity levels in the network, driven by broadband and LLU
volumes, have increased in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. The
ﬁnancial impact of this increased activity has been mitigated by
a series of cost reduction programmes focusing on efﬁciency,
discretionary cost management and process improvements.
EBITDA at £3,894 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year was 1%
higher. EBITDA margins were maintained at 42% across both
ﬁnancial years.
Depreciation and amortisation were ﬂat in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year at £1,902 million.
Operating proﬁt at £1,992 million increased by 2% in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. The operating proﬁt margin increased to
22% compared to 21% in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and
computer software at £2,013 million increased by 2% in the
2006 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects increased capital expenditure
to prepare for the 21
st
Century Network and to invest in new
systems to ensure compliance with the Undertakings agreed
with Ofcom. Investment in legacy network technologies
continues to be lower than last year.
Following Ofcom’s Strategic Review of Telecommunications,
Openreach, a new line of business responsible for managing the
UK access network on behalf of the telecommunications
industry was launched on 21 January 2006. For the 2006
ﬁnancial year Openreach’s results are included within BT
Wholesale’s results. For the 2007 ﬁnancial year Openreach will
be reported as a separate business segment.

BT Global Services supplies managed services and solutions to
multi-site organisations worldwide – our core target market is
10,000 multi-site organisations including major companies with
signiﬁcant global requirements, together with large
organisations in target local markets. We aim to provide them
with networked IT services and a complete range of managed
solutions.
Our extensive global communications network and strong
partnerships enable us to serve customers in the key
commercial centres around the world using a combination of
direct sales and services capabilities and strategic partners.
As well as local, national and international communications
services and higher-value broadband and internet products and
services, a comprehensive portfolio of networked IT services
focused around messaging and conferencing, CRM (customer
relationship management), convergence, outsourcing and
security is offered to customers. Consultancy services are also
provided to help organisations understand network
performance, operate their networks and applications efﬁciently
and transform their business to gain advantage in the digital
networked economy.
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, BT Global Services revenue was
£8,632 million, 15% higher than the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This
includes revenue of £795 million from the acquisitions of
AIbacom and Infonet which have strengthened our global
networked IT services business. Revenue arising from services
provided outside the UK increased during the 2006 ﬁnancial
year, demonstrating BT’s transformation into a global
networked IT services company serving multi-site organisations.
Excluding the impact of the Albacom and Infonet acquisitions,
BT Global Services’ revenue was 5% higher than the 2005
ﬁnancial year.
New wave external revenue grew in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
fuelled by networked IT services contracts which generated
revenue of £3,732 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, an
increase of 34%. Networked IT services contract wins were £5.4
billion in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. We believe these wins,
coupled with the £7.7 billion contracts won in the 2005
ﬁnancial year are building the foundation for future revenue
growth. Included in the contract wins for the 2006 ﬁnancial year
was a E450 million ﬁve year contract with Fiat, as well as a
realigned and extended contract with the Department for Work
and Pensions.
Traditional external revenue, which includes the global
carrier business as well as voice and data revenue from major
corporates, declined by £44 million compared to the 2005
ﬁnancial year to £3,184 million. This reﬂects the migration to
IVPNs sold to major corporate customers in the UK and further
reductions in dial IP due to broadband substitution in the UK.
However the decline in traditional revenue was partly offset by a
34% increase in Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) revenue
which exceeded £400 million.
The increase in new wave revenue together with lower
network and sales, general and administrative costs, coupled
with the positive impact of the acquisitions has resulted in an
increase in EBITDA in the 2006 ﬁnancial year of 4% to
£1,001 million. The 2006 ﬁnancial year includes leaver costs of
£49 million compared to £59 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Depreciation and amortisation costs were £88 million higher
compared to the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This reﬂects the
acquisitions and increased investment in our global
infrastructure. These factors have contributed to a decrease in
operating proﬁt of 12% to £363 million.
Capital expenditure for the 2006 ﬁnancial year was £702
million, an increase of 16% from the 2005 ﬁnancial year mainly
due to the investment in acquisitions and our global
infrastructure.
OTHER OPERATING INCOME

impact of the £358 million proﬁt on disposal of non current
asset investments in 2005.
OPERATING COSTS
Total operating costs before speciﬁc items increased by 7% in
the 2006 ﬁnancial year to £17,108 million; excluding the
impact of acquisitions the increase was 3%. Our cost efﬁciency
programmes achieved savings of over £400 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year which enabled us to continue investing in growing
our new wave activities.
As a percentage of revenue, operating costs, excluding
speciﬁc items, were 88% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year (2005 –
86%). In both ﬁnancial years, net speciﬁc items were incurred,
amounting to £138 million and £59 million in the 2006 and
2005 ﬁnancial years, respectively. These speciﬁc costs are
considered separately in the discussion which follows.

In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, the number of staff employed
increased by 2,300 to 104,400, mainly due to the additional
staff required to service networked IT contracts and the
increased levels of network activity.
Early leaver costs of £133 million were incurred in the 2006
ﬁnancial year, compared with £166 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year. This reﬂects BT’s continued focus on improving
operational efﬁciencies. The group’s pension expense for 2006
was £603 million, an increase of £63 million from the 2005
ﬁnancial year.
The increase in headcount, pay rates and pension costs,
partially offset by lower leaver costs have contributed to a 9%
increase in staff costs which were £4,966 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year. The increase in pension costs includes a switch
between wages and salaries and pension costs as a result of the
introduction of Smart Pensions, a salary sacriﬁce scheme, as
well as the increased headcount and pay rates.
The depreciation charge decreased by 2% in the 2006
ﬁnancial year to £2,635 million. The amortisation charge
increased by £99 million to £249 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year due to higher capitalised software development costs and
the intangible assets associated with the acquisitions in 2005.
Payments to other telecommunications operators increased
by 9% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year to £4,045 million. The
increase mainly reﬂects the full year impact of the Albacom and
Infonet acquisitions and higher volumes.
Other operating costs before speciﬁc items increased by
11% in the 2006 ﬁnancial year to £6,113 million. This reﬂects
not only the cost of supporting new networked IT services
contracts, but also increased levels of activity in the network.
Other operating costs include the maintenance and support of
our networks, accommodation, sales and marketing costs,
research and development and general overheads.

In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, speciﬁc operating costs included
£68 million of property rationalisation charges in relation to the
group’s provincial ofﬁce portfolio (2005: £59 million). This
rationalisation programme is expected to continue through next
year giving rise to further rationalisation costs. In addition a
provision of £70 million was recognised relating to the
incremental and directly attributable costs to create the new
line of business, Openreach, arising from the Undertakings
agreed with Ofcom.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year, the proﬁt from disposal of non
current asset investments, included within other operating
income, totalled £358 million. This mainly comprised the sale of
BT’s 4% interest in Intelsat for net proceeds of £64 million
which resulted in a proﬁt on disposal of £46 million, the sale of
BT’s 15.8% interest in Eutelsat SA for net proceeds of
£356 million resulting in a proﬁt on disposal of £236 million
and the sale of BT’s 11.9% shareholding in StarHub Pte Ltd for
net proceeds of £77 million which resulted in a proﬁton
disposal of £38 million.
In the 2005 ﬁnancial year BT incurred an impairment charge
of £25 million, being BT’s share of a write down of Albacom’s
assets prior to Albacom becoming a subsidiary.
OPERATING PROFIT
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, operating proﬁt before speciﬁc items
described above was 2% lower than the 2005 ﬁnancial year at
£2,633 million. This reﬂects the increased operating costs,
described above, in the 2006 ﬁnancial year more than
offsetting the revenue growth.
Total operating proﬁt for the 2006 ﬁnancial year was
£2,495 million compared to a proﬁt of £2,992 million in the
2005 ﬁnancial year.

2005 ﬁnancial year. The interest on pension scheme liabilities
and expected return on pension scheme assets reﬂects the
IAS 19 assumptions and valuation as at 31 March 2005.
The reduction in the interest on borrowings reﬂects the
decrease in the group’s debt. The reduction in other interest
and similar income reﬂects the lower level of investment
holdings following their utilisation on funding the maturity of
bonds, offset by a gain of £27 million on the group’s US dollar
convertible 2008 bond which was redeemed during the year.
Interest cover in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, excluding the net
ﬁnance income associated with the group’sdeﬁned beneﬁt
pension obligation, represented 3.6 times total operating proﬁt
before speciﬁc items, and compares with interest cover of 3.4 in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The improvement in cover was due to
the reduction in the interest expense mainly arising from the
reduction in net debt.

£16 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. This compares to a loss
of £14 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
The principal contributors to proﬁt before taxation in the
2006 ﬁnancial year were LG Telecom in Korea of £7 million
(2005: £6 million) and Tech Mahindra Limited of £13 million
(2005: £6 million). In the 2005 ﬁnancial year Albacom in Italy
also contributed a loss of £22 million prior to becoming a
subsidiary.
PROFIT BEFORE TAXATION
The group’s proﬁt before taxation for the 2006 ﬁnancial year
was £2,040 million, compared with a proﬁt of £2,354 million in
the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
The group’s proﬁt before taxation before speciﬁc items for
the 2006 ﬁnancial year was £2,177 million, compared with
£2,080 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The improvement in
proﬁt was mainly due to cost efﬁciency savings, lower leaver
costs, lower net ﬁnance charges and increased proﬁts from joint
ventures and associates.
TAXATION
The tax charge for the 2006 ﬁnancial year was £492 million and
comprised a charge of £533 million on the proﬁt before
taxation and speciﬁc items, offset by tax relief of £41 million on
certain speciﬁc items. The tax charge for the 2005 ﬁnancial
year was £525 million and comprised a £541 million charge on
the proﬁt before tax and speciﬁc items, offset by tax relief of
£16 million on certain speciﬁc items. The tax charge on the
proﬁt before taxation and speciﬁc items is at an effective rate of
24.5%. This reduction in the effective rate from 26.0% in the
2005 ﬁnancial year reﬂects the continued improvements in the
tax efﬁciency of the group.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The basic earnings per share of 18.4 pence per share for the
2006 ﬁnancial year compare with 21.5 pence for the 2005
ﬁnancial year. The following table illustrates the impact of
speciﬁc items on the basic earnings per share.

Basic earnings per share before speciﬁc items of 19.5 pence for
the 2006 ﬁnancial year compare with an equivalent of
18.1 pence for the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Diluted earnings per share were not materially different in
either year.
DIVIDENDS
The Board recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 7.6 pence per share
(2005: 6.5 pence per share) to shareholders, amounting to
£632 million (2005: £551 million). This will be paid, subject to
shareholder approval, on 11 September 2006 to shareholders
on the register on 18 August 2006. When combined with the
2006 interim dividend of 4.3 pence per share, the total
dividend proposed for the 2006 ﬁnancial year is 11.9 pence per
share, totalling £993 million (2005: £883 million). This
compares to 10.4 pence in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, an increase
of 14%.
Dividends paid in the 2006 ﬁnancial year were £912 million
(2005: £786 million) and have been presented as a deduction in
shareholders’ equity.
We continue with our progressive dividend policy. We expect
our pay out ratio to rise to around two-thirds of underlying
earnings by the 2008 ﬁnancial year.

The cash inﬂow from operations of £5,777 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year compares with £5,906 million, primarily as a
result of lower working capital inﬂows of £120 million compared
to £253 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. Tax paid in the 2006
ﬁnancial year totalled £390 million compared with £332 million
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This increase in tax payments was
primarily as a result of normalisation of tax payments following
low tax payments in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Net cash inﬂow from investing activities of £365 million in
the 2006 ﬁnancial year compares with a net cash outﬂow of
£1,740 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. This includes a net
cash inﬂow of £3,221 million on investments, which were used
to partly fund the repayment of maturing debt. Net cash
outﬂow for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and
computer software was £2,874 million, compared to
£2,945 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year. The net cash outﬂow
for acquisitions in the 2006 ﬁnancial year totalled £167 million
and mainly related to the acquisitions of Radianz and Atlanet. In
the 2005 ﬁnancial year the net cash outﬂow of £418 million
mainly related to the acquisitions of Infonet and Albacom.
Interest received was £185 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year
compared to £374 million in 2005 which included receipts on
restructuring the group’s swap portfolio.
Net cash outﬂow from ﬁnancing activities of £5,278 million
in the 2006 ﬁnancial year compares with £3,529 million in the
2005 ﬁnancial year. Included in the 2006 net cash outﬂow is a
repayment of £4,432 million for maturing debt. In addition, the
group raised a new sterling ﬂoating rate borrowing for £1,000
million and issued new commercial paper raising net proceeds
of £464 million. Equity dividends paid in 2006 were
£907 million whilst those paid in the 2005 ﬁnancial year
totalled £784 million. Interest paid was £1,086 million
compared to £1,260 million in the prior year which included
payments on restructuring the group’s swap portfolio.
During the 2006 ﬁnancial year the share buyback
programme continued with the group repurchasing 166 million
shares for consideration of £360 million. During the 2005
ﬁnancial year the group repurchased 101 million shares for
consideration of £195 million.
As 31 March 2006, net debt was £7,534 million, a reduction
of £359 million from 31 March 2005. The group’sdeﬁnition of
net debt, which is a non-GAAP measure, is provided on page 83.

Free cash ﬂow is deﬁned as the net increase in cash and cash
equivalents less ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities (excluding
interest paid) less the ﬂows from the acquisition or disposal of
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. It is a non-GAAP
measure since it is not deﬁned under IFRS, but it is a key
indicator used by management in order to assess operational
performance. Free cash ﬂow was £1,612 million in the 2006
ﬁnancial year, compared to £2,282 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year. The reduction in free cash ﬂow compared to the 2005
ﬁnancial year is mainly due to the impact of proceeds of
£537 million from the disposal of non-current asset investments
in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, mainly in respect of the disposal of
Eutelsat, Starhub and Intelsat. Other factors contributing to the
decrease were lower working capital inﬂows and higher
normalised tax payments following low tax payments in the
2005 ﬁnancial year. This has been partly offset by lower cash
payments on purchase of property, plant and equipment and
software in the 2006 ﬁnancial year, although capital additions
and accruals are higher at the end of the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
TREASURY POLICY
The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary
role is to manage liquidity, funding, investment and the group’s
ﬁnancial risk, including risk from volatility in currency and
interest rates and counterparty credit risk. The treasury
operation is not a proﬁt centre and the objective is to manage
risk at optimum cost.
The Board sets the policy for the centralised treasury
operations and its activities are subject to a set of controls
commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowings and
investments under its management. Counterparty credit risk is
closely monitored and managed within controls set by the
Board. The group does not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial
instruments for trading purposes. All transactions in ﬁnancial
instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from
underlying business activities.
We have set out further details on this topic in note 33 to
the ﬁnancial statements.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements there are no off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future material effect on the group’s ﬁnancial
condition, changes in ﬁnancial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital
resources, with the exception of the following:
Operating leases (note 28)
Capital commitments and guarantees (note 28)
CAPITAL RESOURCES
During the period under review the group has reduced its level
of borrowings so that its net debt was £7.5 billion at 31 March
2006 compared with £7.9 billion at 31 March 2005 (based on
BT’sdeﬁnition of net debt as set out in note 10).
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future and therefore they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
There has been no signiﬁcant change in the ﬁnancial or
trading position of the group since 31 March 2006.
The following table sets out the group’s contractual
obligations and commitments as they fall due for payment, as
at 31 March 2006.

At 31 March 2006, the group had cash, cash equivalents and
current asset investments of £2,330 million. At that date,
£1,750 million of debt fell due for repayment in the 2007
ﬁnancial year. The group had unused short-term bank facilities,
amounting to approximately £1,535 million at 31 March 2006.
These resources will allow the group to settle its obligations as
they fall due.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Most of the group’s current revenue is invoiced in pounds
sterling, and most of its operations and costs arise within the
UK. The group’s foreign currency borrowings, which totalled
£5.4 billion at 31 March 2006, are used to ﬁnance its
operations. These borrowings have been predominantly
swapped into sterling. Cross currency swaps and forward
currency contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign
currency exposure on the group’s operations and the group’s
net assets. The group also enters into forward currency
contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest
expense, capital purchases and purchase and sale commitments
on a selective basis. The commitments hedged are principally
US dollar and euro denominated. As a result of these policies,
the group’s exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on the
residual currency exposure on its non-UK investments in its
subsidiaries and on any imbalances between the value of
outgoing and incoming international calls.
A 10% strengthening in sterling against major currencies
would cause the group’s net assets at 31 March 2006 to fall by
less than £150 million, with an insigniﬁcant effect on the
group’s proﬁts. This is consistent with the position at year
ended 31 March 2005.
The majority of the group’s long-term borrowings have been,
and are, subject to sterling ﬁxed interest rates after applying
the impact of hedging instruments. The group has entered into
interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other
institutions to vary the amounts and period for which interest
rates are ﬁxed. At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding
interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts
totalling £5.1 billion compared to £5.3 billion at 31 March
2005.
The long-term debt instruments which BT issued in
December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants
providing that if the BT group credit rating were downgraded
below A3 in the case of Moody’s or below A minus in the case
of Standard & Poor’s (S&P), additional interest would accrue
from the next interest coupon period at the rate of 0.25
percentage points for each ratings category adjustment by each
ratings agency. In May 2001, Moody’s downgraded BT’s credit
rating to Baa1, which increased BT’s annual ﬁnance expense by
approximately £32 million. BT’s credit rating from S&P is
A minus. Based upon the total amount of debt of £5 billion
outstanding on these instruments at 31 March 2006, BT’s
annual ﬁnance expense would increase by approximately
£24 million if BT’s credit rating were to be downgraded by one
credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt
rating of Baa1/A minus. If BT’s credit rating with Moody’s was
to be upgraded by one credit rating category the annual ﬁnance
expense would be reduced by approximately £12 million.
Based upon the composition of net debt at 31 March 2006,
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase
the group’s annual net ﬁnance expense by around £10 million.
This is consistent with the position at 31 March 2005.
The group considers that it is not exposed to major
concentrations of credit risk. The group, however, is exposed to
credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by
counterparties to ﬁnancial instruments, but does not expect any
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The group limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. Where
multiple transactions are undertaken with a single counterparty,
or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into a
netting arrangement to reduce the group’s exposure to credit
risk. Currently the group makes use of standard International
Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) documentation. In
addition, where management have a legal right of set off and
the ability and intention to settle net, the relevant asset and
liabilities are netted within the balance sheet. The group seeks
collateral or other security where it is considered necessary.
The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into
long and short term ﬁnancial instruments to support operational
and other funding requirements. The group’s liquidity and
funding management process includes projecting cash ﬂows
and considering the level of liquid assets in relation thereto,
monitoring balance sheet liquidity and maintaining a diverse
range of funding sources and back-up facilities. Liquid assets
surplus to immediate operating requirements of the group are
generally invested and managed by the centralised treasury
function. Requirements of group companies for operating
ﬁnance are met whenever possible from central resources. The
group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate
committed borrowing facilities. Reﬁnancing risk is managed by
limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any
speciﬁc period.
The group has limited exposure to equity securities price risk
on investments held by the group.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and
computer software (excluding the movement on capital
accruals) totalled £3,142 million in the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
compared with £3,011 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial year.
Capital expenditure is expected to be just over £3 billion in the
2007 ﬁnancial year as the group invests in its 21st century
network (21CN) programme.
Of the capital expenditure in the 2006 ﬁnancial year,
£270 million was in Europe, outside of the UK, the Americas
and Asia Paciﬁc compared to £152 million in the 2005 ﬁnancial
year.
Contracts placed for ongoing capital expenditure totalled
£754 million at 31 March 2006. 21CN is being developed using
stringent capital return criteria and a rigorous approach to any
investment in the narrowband network. 21CN aims to deliver
long term, structural cost reduction, as we progressively
migrate onto a simpler, lower cost network architecture. BT
expects that future capital expenditure will be funded from net
cash inﬂows from operating activities, and, if required, by
external ﬁnancing.
ACQUISITIONS
The total amount invested in acquisitions in the 2006 ﬁnancial
year was £167 million, being mainly due to the acquisitions of
Radianz and Atlanet. In April 2005 the group completed the
acquisition of Radianz for total consideration of £143 million,
including cash on the balance sheet and debt assumed on
acquisition. Net of cash and debt acquired, the cash
consideration was £71 million. This gave rise to goodwill of £39
million. In February 2006 the group completed the acquisition
of Atlanet for £65 million, including £7 million of deferred
consideration, being £53 million net of cash. This gave rise to
goodwill of £30 million. The total amount invested in the 2005
ﬁnancial year was £453 million, being mainly the acquisitions of
Infonet and Albacom.
BALANCE SHEET
Net assets at 31 March 2006 amounted to £1,607 million
compared to £95 million at 31 March 2005, with the increase
of £1,512 million mainly due to the retained proﬁts for the year
of £1,548 million and actuarial gains of £1,485 million (net of
deferred tax) offset by dividends of £912 million, losses on cash
ﬂow hedges of £155 million (net of deferred tax) and the net
purchase of treasury shares of £344 million.
BT’s non current assets totalled £17,978 million at 31 March
2006 of which £15,489 million were property, plant and
equipment, principally forming the UK ﬁxed network. At 31
March 2005 non current assets were £18,212 million and
property, plant and equipment were £15,391 million.
BT Group plc, the parent company, whose ﬁnancial
statements are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, had
proﬁt and loss reserves of £9,499 million at 31 March 2006 and
£9,647 million at 31 March 2005.
RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED
The return before speciﬁc items on the average capital
employed was 16.8% for the 2006 ﬁnancial year. In the 2005
ﬁnancial year the group made a return before speciﬁc items of
16.5%.
PENSIONS
The group’s total pension operating charges for the 2006 and
2005 ﬁnancial years were £603 million and £540 million,
respectively. This includes £552 million and £507 million,
respectively, in relation to the BTPS. The increase in the
pension charge in the 2006 ﬁnancial year partly reﬂects the
introduction of Smart Pensions (a salary sacriﬁce scheme) part
way through the 2005 ﬁnancial year, as a result of which there
is a switch between wages and salaries and pension charges, as
well as increases in pensionable pay.
The detailed IAS 19 disclosures are provided in the notes to
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. At 31 March 2006 the
IAS 19 deﬁcit was £1.8 billion, net of tax, being a £1.6 billion
reduction from £3.4 billion at 31 March 2005.
The number of retired members and other current
beneﬁciaries in the BTPS pension fund has been increasing in
recent years. Consequently, BT’s future pension costs and
contributions will depend on the investment returns of the
pension fund and life expectancy of members and could
ﬂuctuate in the medium term.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and
we launched a new deﬁned contribution pension scheme for
people joining BT after that date which is to provide beneﬁts
based on the employees’ and the employing company’s
contributions. This change is in line with the practice
increasingly adopted by major UK groups and is designed to be
more ﬂexible for employees and enable the group to determine
its pension costs more precisely than is the case for deﬁned
beneﬁt schemes.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of
the BTPS, performed by the BTPS independent actuary for the
trustees of the scheme, was carried out as at 31 December
2002. This valuation showed the fund to be in deﬁcit to an
amount of £2.1 billion. Assets of the fund of £22.8 billion at
that date covered 91.6% of the fund’s liabilities.
Under the 2002 funding plan the contribution rate was
12.2% of pensionable pay (18.2% under Smart Pensions) and
the company agreed to make annual deﬁciency contributions to
the BTPS of £232 million. In the 2006 ﬁnancial year deﬁciency
payments were £54 million and no payments were made in the
2005 ﬁnancial year. This was because in the 2004 ﬁnancial year
total deﬁciency contributions of £612 million were made,
including early payment of £380 million scheduled for payment
in the 2005 and 2006 ﬁnancial years. The triennial actuarial
valuation at 31 December 2005 is currently being performed by
the scheme’s independent actuaries and reviewed in the
context of recent regulatory developments and the impact of
the Crown Guarantee granted on privatisation in 1984. Until
that is completed, the contributions will continue to be paid in
accordance with the 2002 funding plan.
GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION
In the 2006 ﬁnancial year, approximately 87% of the group’s
revenue was generated by operations in the UK, compared with
91% in the 2005. BT’s operating proﬁts have been derived
from its UK operations with losses being incurred outside the
UK in the 2006 and 2005 ﬁnancial years.
REGULATORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Ofcom requires regulatory ﬁnancial information in order to
monitor and enforce various obligations that are placed on
dominant providers in markets where they are found to have
signiﬁcant market power (‘SMP’). The current regulatory
ﬁnancial reporting regime for BT has evolved over time in
response to the ongoing changes in the regulatory environment.
The last signiﬁcant consultation on the regime was in 2004 in
response to the regulatory framework for electronic
communications network services that came into effect on
25 July 2003. The SMP activities presented separately in the

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The group’s principal accounting policies are set out on pages
65 to 72 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and conform
with IFRS. These policies, and applicable estimation techniques,
have been reviewed by the directors who have conﬁrmed them
to be the most appropriate for the preparation of the 2006
ﬁnancial statements.
We, in common with virtually all other companies, need to
use estimates in the preparation of our ﬁnancial statements.
The most sensitive estimates affecting our ﬁnancial statements
are in the areas of assessing the level of interconnect income
with and payments to other telecommunications operators,
providing for doubtful debts, establishing asset lives of
property, plant and equipment for depreciation purposes,
assessing the stage of completion and likely outcome under
long term contracts, making appropriate long-term assumptions
in calculating pension liabilities and costs, making appropriate
medium-term assumptions on asset impairment reviews and
calculating current and deferred tax liabilities. Details of critical
accounting estimates and key judgements are provided in the
accounting policies on page 70 to 71.
US GAAP
The group’s net income and earnings per share for the two
years ended 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005 and
shareholders’ equity at 31 March 2006 and 2005 under US
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) are shown
in the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
in note 35. Differences between IFRS and US GAAP include the
treatment of leasing transactions, pension costs, redundancy
costs, deferred taxation, capitalisation of interest and ﬁnancial
instruments.
US GAAP DEVELOPMENTS
In November 2005, the FASB issued Financial Staff Position
(‘FSP’) FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, ‘The Meaning of Other-Than-
Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments’, which nulliﬁes certain requirements of Emerging
Issues Task Force (‘EITF’) Issue No. 03-1, ‘The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to
Certain Investments’ and supersedes EITF Abstracts Topic No.
D-44, ‘Recognition of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Upon
the Planned Sale of a Security whose Cost Exceeds Fair Value’.
The guidance in this FSP is applied to reporting periods
beginning after 15 December 2005. BT does not expect that
the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its
ﬁnancial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 ‘Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections – a replacement of APB Opinion
No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3’. SFAS No. 154 requires
retrospective application of prior periods’ﬁnancial statements
for changes in accounting principles. SFAS No. 154 applies to
accounting periods beginning after 15 December 2005. The
adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have a material
effect on the results or net assets of the Group.
In February 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.
FAS 123(R)-4, ‘Classiﬁcation of Options and Similar Instruments
Issued as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash
Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event’ (‘FSP
FAS 123(R)-4’). FSP FAS 123(R)-4 addresses the classiﬁcation of
options and similar instruments issued as employee
compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the
occurrence of a contingent event. An option or similar
instrument that is classiﬁed as equity, but subsequently
becomes a liability because the contingent cash settlement
event is probable of occurring, shall be accounted for similar to
a modiﬁcation from an equity to liability award. The application
of this FSP did not have a material impact on the results or net
assets of the group.
In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
‘Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments – an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140’, that
amends SFAS No. 133, ‘Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities’, and No. 140, ‘Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities’. This Statement resolves issues addressed in SFAS
No. 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, ‘Application of
Statement 133 to Beneﬁcial Interests in Securitised Financial
Assets’. The Statement permits fair value remeasurement for
any hybrid ﬁnancial instrument that contains an embedded
derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. Additionally
it clariﬁes which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are
not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No.
155 also establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in
securitised ﬁnancial assets to identify interests that are
freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid ﬁnancial instruments
that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. It
clariﬁes that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
subordination are not embedded derivatives. Also SFAS No.
155 amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a
qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative
ﬁnancial instrument that pertains to a beneﬁcial interest other
than another derivative ﬁnancial instrument. SFAS No. 155 is
effective for BT for all ﬁnancial instruments acquired or issued
after 31 March 2007. BT is currently evaluating the impact of
this statement.
In March 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, ‘Accounting
for Servicing of Financial Assets: an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 140’ that amends SFAS No. 140, ‘Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities’, with respect to the accounting
for separately recognised servicing assets and servicing
liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective for BT on 1 April 2007. BT
does not anticipate that the adoption of this new statement at
the required effective date will have a signiﬁcant effect on its
results of operations, ﬁnancial position or cash ﬂows.

Checksum: 832241334
The directors submit their report and the audited ﬁnancial
statements of the company, BT Group plc, and the group,
which includes its subsidiary undertakings, for the 2006
ﬁnancial year.
It is BT’s policy to achieve for all our operations best practice
in our standards of business integrity. This includes a
commitment to maintaining the highest standards of corporate
governance and ethics throughout the group.
The directors consider that BT has, throughout the year,
complied with the provisions set out in section 1 of the 2003
Combined Code on Corporate Governance and that the
Operating and ﬁnancial review has been prepared in
accordance with the principles in the Reporting Statement on the
Operating and Financial Review issued by the Accounting
Standards Board.
INTRODUCTION
BT Group plc is the listed holding company for the BT group of
companies.
The Operating and ﬁnancial review on pages 6 to 39 and
the Report of the Audit Committee, the Report of the
Nominating Committee and the Report on directors’
remuneration on pages 48 to 61 form part of this report. The
audited ﬁnancial statements are presented on pages 65 to 122.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
The group’s principal activity is the supply of communications
solutions and services and includes: networked IT services;
local, national and international telecommunications services;
and broadband and internet products and services. In the 2006
ﬁnancial year, approximately 87% of revenues were derived
from operations in the UK. The group’s key performance
indicators can be found in the Operating and ﬁnancial review.
THE BOARD
Directors
The names and biographical details of the directors of the
company are given on pages 40 to 41 in the Board of directors
and Operating Committee. All served throughout the ﬁnancial
year, with the exception of Matti Alahuhta and Phil Hodkinson,
who were appointed on 1 February 2006. Lou Hughes served as
a director until 31 March 2006.
Election and re-election
All directors are required by the company’s articles of
association to be elected by shareholders at the ﬁrst AGM after
their appointment, if appointed by the Board. A director must
subsequently retire by rotation at an AGM at intervals of not
more than three years. The director may seek re-election.
In accordance with the articles of association, Matti Alahuhta
and Phil Hodkinson, having been appointed as directors by the
Board, retire at the forthcoming annual general meeting (AGM)
and will be proposed for election. Sir Anthony Greener, Maarten
van den Bergh and Clayton Brendish retire by rotation and will
be proposed for re-election. Details of these directors’ contracts
of appointment are included in the Report on directors’
remuneration.
Composition and role
The Board, which operates as a single team, is currently made
up of the part-time Chairman, the Chief Executive, four other
executive directors and eight non-executive directors. All of the
non-executive directors during the 2006 ﬁnancial year met, and
continue to meet, the criteria for independence set out in the
Combined Code and are therefore considered by the Board to
be independent. In line with BT’s policy, the Board comprised a
majority of independent non-executive directors throughout the
2006 ﬁnancial year.
The Board’s principal focus is the overall strategic direction,
development and control of the group. In support of this the
Board approves the group’s values, business practice policies,
strategic plans, annual budget, capital expenditure and
investments budgets, larger capital expenditure proposals and
the group’s overall system of internal controls, governance and
compliance authorities. It also has oversight and control of the
group’s operating and ﬁnancial performance and reviews the
risk register. These responsibilities are set out in a formal
statement of the Board’s role. The Board has agreed the
group’s corporate governance framework, including
empowering the company’s key management committee, the
Operating Committee, to make decisions on operational and
other matters. The roles and powers of this committee are set
out on page 43. Their powers and the authorities delegated to
individual members of the Operating Committee are available to
everyone in the group on the group’s intranet site.
Historically the Board met every month, except in August.
The standard Board cycle changed in the 2006 ﬁnancial year to
nine meetings each year. The Board met 11 times during the
2006 ﬁnancial year including two ad hoc meetings to consider
time-critical matters.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are
separate. They are set out in written job descriptions, approved
by the Nominating Committee. In addition to chairing the Board,
the Chairman is responsible for consulting the non-executive
directors, particularly the Deputy Chairman, on corporate
governance issues, matters considered by the Nominating
Committee, which the Chairman chairs, and the individual
performances of the non-executive directors. The Chairman and
the non-executive directors hold regular dinners at which they
discuss matters without the executive directors being present.
With the Chief Executive and the Secretary, the Chairman
ensures the Board is kept properly informed, is consulted on all
issues reserved to it and that its decisions are made in a timely
and considered way that enables the directors to fulﬁl their
ﬁduciary duties. The Chairman ensures that the views of the
shareholders are known to the Board and considered
appropriately. He represents the company in speciﬁed strategic
and Government relationships, as agreed with the Chief
Executive, and generally acts as the bridge between the Board
and the company’s executive team, particularly on the group’s
broad strategic direction. The Chief Executive has ﬁnal
executive responsibility, reporting to the Board, for the success
of the group. The Chairman’s other current signiﬁcant
commitments are shown in the Board of directors and
Operating Committee.
The Secretary manages the provision of timely, accurate and
considered information to the Board for its meetings and, in
consultation with the Chairman and Chief Executive, at other
appropriate times. He recommends to the Chairman and the
Chief Executive, for Board consideration where appropriate, the
company’s corporate governance policies and practices and is
responsible for their communication and implementation. The
appointment and removal of the Secretary is a matter for the
whole Board. He advises the Board on appropriate procedures
for the management of its meetings and duties (and the
meetings of the company’s principal committees), as well as the
implementation of corporate governance and compliance within
the group.
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

BT’s non-executive directors
The Nominating Committee has agreed and periodically reviews
the combination of experience, skills and other attributes which
the non-executive directors as a whole are to bring to the
Board. This proﬁle is used by the Committee when the
appointment of a non-executive director is being considered to
assess the suitability of candidates, who are put forward by the
directors and outside consultants. Short-listed candidates meet
the Committee, which then recommends to the Board a
candidate(s) for appointment.
The non-executive directors provide a strong, independent
element on the Board. Between them, they bring experience
and independent judgement, gained at the most senior levels,
of international business operations and strategy, ﬁnance,
marketing, technology, communications and political and
international affairs.
Sir Anthony Greener, the Deputy Chairman, is the senior
independent director. He chairs the Audit and Remuneration
Committees. In his capacity as the chairman of the Remuneration
Committee, he meets with BT’s major institutional shareholders.
The Deputy Chairman also continues to be available to discuss
matters with institutional shareholders where it would be
inappropriate for those discussions to take place with either the
Chairman or the Chief Executive.
Non-executive directors are appointed initially for three
years, subject to three months’ termination notice from either
BT or the director. At the end of the ﬁrst three years the
appointment may be continued by mutual agreement. Each
non-executive director is provided, upon appointment, with a
letter setting out the terms of his or her appointment, including
membership of Board committees, the fees to be paid and the
time commitment expected from the director. The letter also
covers such matters as the conﬁdentiality of information and
the company’s share dealing code.
Principal Board committees
The Operating Committee, the company’s key management
committee, meets weekly and is chaired by the Chief Executive,
Ben Verwaayen. The other members are the Group Finance
Director and the Chief Executives of BT Retail, BT Wholesale
and BT Global Services. The Secretary attends all meetings. The
Group Strategy and the Group HR Directors normally attend
each meeting. The Committee has collective responsibility for
running the group’s business end-to-end. To do that, it
develops the group’s strategy and budget for Board approval,
recommends to the Board the group’s capital expenditure and
investments budgets, monitors the ﬁnancial, operational and
customer quality of service performance of the whole group,
reviews the group’s risks register, allocates resources across the
group within plans agreed by the Board, plans and delivers
major cross-business programmes and reviews the senior talent
base and succession plans of the group. Within the group’s
corporate governance framework, approved by the Board, the
Operating Committee is empowered to approve, up to limits
after which Board approval is required, capital expenditure,
disposals of ﬁxed assets, the making of investments by the
group and divestments. It is authorised to delegate these
approvals, up to its own limits, to senior executives.
To meet best corporate governance practice, the Audit
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nominating
Committee have long been an established part of BT’s system of
governance. Each committee has written terms of reference,
which are available on the company’s website. The Report of
the Audit Committee, the Report of the Nominating
Committee and the Report on directors’ remuneration are on
pages 48 to 61.
The Equality of Access Board (EAB) was established on
1 November 2005, as part of the Undertakings given by BT to
Ofcom following Ofcom’s Strategic Review of
Telecommunications, to monitor, report and advise BT on BT’s
compliance with these Undertakings. The EAB is a committee of
the BT Group plc Board, which formally approved its formation
and its terms of reference. As required by the Undertakings, the
EAB comprises ﬁve members: Carl Symon, a BT Group plc non-
executive director and chairman of the EAB; a BT senior
executive, Sally Davis, Chief Portfolio Ofﬁcer; and three
independent members: Sir Bryan Carsberg, Stephen Pettit and
Dr Peter Radley. The EAB reports regularly to the Board.

Service agreements
The Chairman and executive directors have service agreements,
which are approved by the Remuneration Committee. Information
about the periods of these contracts is in the Report on
directors’ remuneration.
Independent advice
The Board has a procedure for directors, in furtherance of their
duties, to take independent professional advice if necessary, at
the company’s expense. In addition, all directors have access to
the advice and services of the Secretary.
Training and information
On appointment, the directors take part in an induction
programme when they receive information about BT, the role of
the Board and the matters reserved for its decision, the terms
of reference and membership of the principal Board
committees, and the powers delegated to those committees,
the company’s corporate governance policies and procedures,
including the powers reserved to the group’s most senior
executives, and the latest ﬁnancial information about the
group. This is supplemented by visits to key BT locations and
meetings with members of the Operating Committee and other

key senior executives. Each year, Directors participate in BT’s
‘Back to the ﬂoor’ programme, an activity that demonstrates
commitment to our customers and the people who serve them.
Throughout their period in ofﬁce the directors are continually
updated on BT’s business, the competitive and regulatory
environments in which it operates, technology and corporate
social responsibility matters and other changes affecting BT and
the communications industry as a whole, by written brieﬁngs
and meetings with senior BT executives. Directors are also
advised on appointment of their legal and other duties and
obligations as a director of a listed company, both in writing
and in face-to-face meetings with the Secretary. They are
reminded of these duties each year and they are also updated
on changes to the legal, accounting and governance
requirements on the company and themselves as directors.
During the 2006 ﬁnancial year, for example, they have
attended presentations on BT’s 21CN Investment Programme,
on the effects of the introduction of International Financial
Reporting Standards on the group’s results and on the US
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which affects BT because its
securities are registered with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC); and received brieﬁngs on changes to UK
company law and various corporate governance proposals from
the European Commission. The Chairman also sends a weekly
e-mail to non-executive directors with topical sector highlights.
Guidelines are in place concerning the content, presentation
and delivery of papers for each Board meeting, so that the
directors have enough information to be properly briefed
sufﬁciently far ahead of each Board meeting and at other
appropriate times.
Directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance and indemnity
For some years the company has purchased insurance to cover
its directors and ofﬁcers against their costs in defending
themselves in civil legal proceedings taken against them in that
capacity and in respect of damages resulting from the
unsuccessful defence of any proceedings. At the date upon
which this report was approved, and throughout the 2006
ﬁnancial year, the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, British
Telecommunications plc, has provided an indemnity in respect
of all the company’s directors. Neither the insurance nor the
indemnity provides cover where the director has acted
fraudulently or dishonestly.
Interest of management in certain transactions
During and at the end of the 2006 ﬁnancial year, none of the
company’s directors was materially interested in any material
transaction in relation to the group’s business and none is
materially interested in any presently proposed material
transactions.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDINGS
At 17 May 2006, the company had received notiﬁcations from
Legal & General Investment Management Limited, Barclays
PLC and Brandes Investment Partners LLC, under Part VI of the
Companies Act 1985, in respect of holdings of 318,525,417
shares, 369,832,178 shares and 413,832,977 shares
respectively, representing holdings of 3.8%, 4.3% and 4.9% of
the company’s issued ordinary share capital.
POLICY ON THE PAYMENT OF SUPPLIERS
BT subscribes to the Better Payment Practice Code for all
suppliers, the four principles of which are: to agree payment
terms at the outset and stick to them; to explain payment
procedures to suppliers; to pay bills in accordance with any
contract agreed with the supplier or as required by law; and to
tell suppliers without delay when an invoice is contested and
settle disputes quickly. The normal payment terms are 42
calendar days from date of receipt of a due and valid invoice.
BT will make payment to the supplier on the next payment run
following expiry of this term.The ratio, expressed in days,
between the amounts invoiced to the company by its suppliers
in the 2006 ﬁnancial year and the amounts owed to its trade
creditors at the end of the year was 39 calendar days.
CHARITABLE DONATIONS
Details of charitable donations made by the group can be found
in Business review – Community investment.
POLITICAL DONATIONS
The company’s continuing policy is that no company in the
group shall make contributions in cash or kind to any political
party, whether by gift or loan. Arrangements are in place to
implement this policy. However, the deﬁnition of political
donations used in the Companies Act 1985 is very much
broader than the sense in which these words are ordinarily
used. It covers activities such as making MPs and others in the
political world aware of key industry issues and matters
affecting the company, which make an important contribution
to their understanding of BT. These activities are carried out on
an even-handed basis related broadly to the major UK political
parties’ electoral strength. The authority we are requesting at
the AGM is not designed to change the above policy. It will,
however, ensure that BT acts within the provisions of the
Companies Act 1985 requiring companies to obtain shareholder
authority before they can make donations to EU political
organisations (which includes UK political parties) as deﬁned in
the Act. During the 2006 ﬁnancial year the company’s wholly-
owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, made the
following payments to cover the cost of hosting brieﬁng

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Details of the ﬁnancial risk management objectives and policies
of the group and exposure of the group to interest risk, foreign
exchange risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and price risk is given on
page 37 and note 33 on pages 105 to 110.
AUDITORS
Resolutions to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
auditors of the company and to authorise the directors to settle
their remuneration will be proposed at the AGM.
AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE SHARES
The authority given at last year’s AGM of the company held on
13 July 2005 for the company to purchase in the market
850 million of its shares, representing 10% of the issued share
capital, expires on 12 October 2006. Shareholders will be asked
to give a similar authority at the AGM.
During the 2006 ﬁnancial year, 166 million shares of 5
pence each were purchased under this authority (1.9% of the
share capital) for a total consideration of £360 million, at an
average price of £2.17 per share. The shares were purchased in
an on-market programme of buying back the company’s shares,
initiated in November 2003, as part of the company’s
shareholder distribution strategy. 290 million shares have been

retained as treasury shares. At 17 May 2006, 22 million
treasury shares had been transferred to meet the company’s
obligations under its employee share plans.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Senior executives, led by the Chief Executive and the Group
Finance Director and including, as appropriate, the other
executive directors, hold meetings with the company’s principal
institutional shareholders to discuss the company’s strategy,
ﬁnancial performance and speciﬁc major investment activities.
The Deputy Chairman also attends, at his discretion and in
consultation with the Chairman and the Chief Executive,
meetings with shareholders during the year. All non-executive
directors have an invitation to attend investors’ meetings if they
wish. The company also maintains contact with investors, when
appropriate, through the chairman of the Remuneration
Committee and other senior executives to discuss overall
remuneration policies and plans. Contact with institutional
shareholders (and with ﬁnancial analysts, brokers and the
media) is controlled by written guidelines to ensure the
protection of share price sensitive information that has not
already been made generally available to the company’s
shareholders. The directors are provided with either full or
summarised reports and other written brieﬁngs from the
company’s major shareholders and analysts and are regularly
informed by the Secretary about the holdings of its principal
shareholders. The Secretary also surveys the company’s retail
shareholders about the quality of the company’s shareholder
communications and share registration services.
We are continuing our policy that shareholders vote on the
annual report at the AGM. Shareholders will also again be asked
to vote separately on the Report on directors’ remuneration.
It is part of our policy to involve shareholders fully in the
affairs of the company and to give them the opportunity at the
AGM to ask questions about the company’s activities and
prospects. We also give the shareholders the opportunity to
vote on every substantially different issue by proposing a
separate resolution for each issue.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as
abstentions, will be counted before the AGM and the results will
be made available at the meeting after the shareholders have
voted on each resolution on a show of hands and at the end of
the meeting. It is our policy for all directors to attend the AGM
if at all possible. Whilst, because of ill health or other pressing
reasons, this may not always be possible, in normal
circumstances this means that the chairmen of the Audit,
Nominating and Remuneration committees are at the AGM and
are available to answer relevant questions. All the directors
attended the 2005 AGM.
The Annual Review and Notice of Meeting 2006 and, if
requested, the Annual Report and Form 20-F, are sent to
shareholders in the most cost-effective fashion, given the large
number of shareholders. We aim to give as much notice as
possible and at least 21 clear days, as required by the
company’s articles of association. In practice, these documents
are being sent to shareholders more than 20 working days
before the AGM.
Established procedures ensure the timely release of share
price sensitive information and the publication of the company’s
ﬁnancial results and regulatory ﬁnancial statements. All external
announcements are also reviewed for accuracy and compliance
requirements by a committee of senior executives, the
Disclosure Committee, which is chaired by the Secretary.
STATEMENT OF BUSINESS PRACTICE
To reinforce our commitment to achieve best practice in our
standards of business integrity and ethics, BT has had in place a
written statement of business practice (The Way We Work) for
nearly seven years. The statement covers all our operations. A
copy of the statement has been sent to every employee and is
available in eight languages. Copies are also sent to the
employees of newly acquired subsidiaries.
These high-level principles are supported by a continuing
and comprehensive communications programme and online
training. A conﬁdential helpline and dedicated e-mail facility are
also available to employees who have questions about the
application of these principles. The helpline number is published
externally as part of the statement of business practice. We also
continue to require our agents and contractors to apply these
principles when representing BT. BT’s new Undertakings code
of practice (It Matters) forms part of BT’s statement of business
practice and is consistent with it.
PENSION FUNDS
BT’s two main pension funds – the BT Pension Scheme and the
BT Retirement Plan – are not controlled by the Board but by
separate trustees who are company and union nominees, under
independent chairmen. The trustees look after the assets of the
funds, which are held separately from those of the company.
The pension funds’ assets can only be used in accordance with
their respective rules and for no other purpose.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board is responsible for the group’s systems of internal
control and risk management and for reviewing the
effectiveness of those systems, which it does annually. Such
systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk
of failure to achieve business objectives; any system can provide
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The Board also takes account of signiﬁcant social,
environmental and ethical matters that relate to BT’s
businesses and reviews annually BT’s corporate social
responsibility. The company’s workplace practices, speciﬁc
environmental, social and ethical risks and opportunities and
details of underlying governance processes are dealt with in the
Business review – Motivating our people and living the BT
values and Our commitment to society.
BT has processes for identifying, evaluating and managing
the signiﬁcant risks faced by the group. These processes have
been in place for the whole of the 2006 ﬁnancial year and have
continued up to the date on which this document was
approved. The processes are in accordance with the Internal
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code ﬁrst
published in the UK in September 1999.
Risk assessment and evaluation takes place as an integral
part of the group’s annual strategic planning cycle. The group
has a detailed risk management process, culminating in a Board
review, which identiﬁes the key risks facing the group and each
business unit. This information is reviewed by senior
management as part of the strategic review. The group’s
current key risks are summarised in Business Review – Group
risk factors.
The key features of the risk management process comprise
the following procedures:
s senior executives, led by the Secretary, review the group’s
key risks and have created a group risk register describing
the risks, owners and mitigation strategies. This is reviewed
Report of the directors BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 45 Filename: 824560_03.3d Time: 14:33:50 Date: 20/05/06

by the Operating Committee before being reviewed and
approved by the Board.
s the lines of business carry out risk assessments of their
operations, have created registers relating to those risks,
and ensure that the key risks are addressed.
s senior management reports regularly to the Group Finance
Director on the operation of internal controls in its area of
responsibility.
s the Chief Executive receives annual reports from senior
executives with responsibilities for major group operations
with their opinion on the effectiveness of the operation of
internal controls during the ﬁnancial year.
s the group’s internal auditors carry out continuing
assessments of the quality of risk management and control.
Internal Audit reports to the management and the Audit
Committee on the status of speciﬁc areas identiﬁed for
improvement. Internal Audit also promotes effective risk
management in the lines of business operations.
s the Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, considers the
effectiveness of the operation of internal control procedures
in the group during the ﬁnancial year. It reviews reports from
the internal auditors and from the external auditors and
reports its conclusions to the Board. The Audit Committee has
carried out these actions for the 2006 ﬁnancial year.
New subsidiaries acquired during the year have not been
included in the above risk management process. They will be
included for the 2007 ﬁnancial year. Material joint ventures and
associates, which BT does not control, outside the UK have not
been dealt with as part of the group for the purposes of this
internal control assessment.
The Board has approved the formal statement of matters
which are reserved to it for consideration, approval or oversight.
It has also approved the group’s corporate governance
framework, which sets out the high level principles by which the
group is managed and the responsibilities and powers of the
Operating Committee and the group’s senior executives. As part
of this framework the development and implementation of
certain powers relating to group-wide policies and practices are
reserved to identiﬁed senior executives.
US SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
BT has securities registered with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, BT is obliged to
comply with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
applicable to foreign issuers. BT complies with the legal and
regulatory requirements introduced pursuant to this legislation,
in so far as they are applicable to the group.
With the appointment of Phil Hodkinson, it is the opinion of
the Board that the Audit Committee now includes a member who
is an ‘audit committee ﬁnancial expert’, and who is
independent (as deﬁned for this purpose). The Board considers
that the Committee’s members generally have broad
commercial and business leadership experience, having held
various roles in accountancy, ﬁnancial management and
supervision, treasury and corporate ﬁnance and that there is a
broad and suitable mix of business, ﬁnancial and IT experience
on the Committee.
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, after
evaluating the effectiveness of BT’s disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
Report and Form 20-F, have concluded that, as of such date,
BT’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure
that material information relating to BT was made known to
them by others within the group. The Chief Executive and
Group Finance Director have also provided the certiﬁcations
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
There were no changes in BT’s internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting that occurred during the year ended 31 March 2006
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, BT’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
Preparations are well advanced for BT to be able to comply with
the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. BT
is required to report under Section 404 in the 2007 Annual
Report and Form 20-F.
The code of ethics for the Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director and Director Group Financial Control and Treasury,
adopted for the purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is posted
on the company’s website at www.bt.com/ethics
THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE
The company, as a foreign issuer with American Depositary
Shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is
obliged to disclose any signiﬁcant ways in which its corporate
governance practices differ from the corporate governance
listing standards of the NYSE.
The company has reviewed the NYSE’s new listing standards
and believes that its corporate governance practices are
consistent with them, with the following exception where the
company does not meet the strict requirements set out in the
standards. The standards state that companies must have a
nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely
of independent directors and with written terms of reference
which, in addition to identifying individuals qualiﬁed to become
board members, develops and recommends to the Board a set
of corporate governance principles applicable to the company.
BT has a Nominating Committee chaired by the Chairman Sir
Christopher Bland. It does not develop corporate governance
principles for the Board’s approval. The Board approves the
group’s overall system of internal controls, governance and
compliance authorities. The Board and the Nominating
Committee are made up of a majority of independent, non-
executive directors.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC and NYSE introduced rules
on 31 July 2005 requiring the company to comply with certain
provisions relating to the Audit Committee. These include the
independence of Audit Committee members and procedures for
the treatment of complaints regarding accounting or auditing
matters. The company is fully compliant with these
requirements.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
So far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant
information that has not been disclosed to the company’s
auditors and each of the directors believes that all steps have
been taken that ought to have been taken to make them aware
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the
company’s auditors have been made aware of that information.
A statement by the directors of their responsibilities for
preparing the ﬁnancial statements is included in the Statement
of directors’ responsibility. The directors’ statement on going
concern is included in the Operating and ﬁnancial review –

The Audit Committee is chaired by Sir Anthony Greener, the
Deputy Chairman and senior independent director. The other
members are Maarten van den Bergh, Clay Brendish, Phil
Hodkinson, John Nelson and Carl Symon. They are all
independent non-executive directors. They were members of
the Committee throughout the 2006 ﬁnancial year with the
exception of Phil Hodkinson who was appointed on 1 February
2006. Lou Hughes stepped down on 31 March 2006 when he
stepped down from the Board. The Board considers that the
Committee’s members have broad commercial knowledge and
extensive business leadership experience, having held various
roles in accountancy, ﬁnancial management and supervision,
treasury and corporate ﬁnance and that there is a broad and
suitable mix of business, ﬁnancial and IT experience on the
Committee. The Board has reviewed membership of the
Committee and is satisﬁed that several of the Committee’s
members have the recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience
required for the provisions of the Combined Code and, with the
appointment of Phil Hodkinson, it is the opinion of the Board
that the Audit Committee includes a member who is an ‘audit
committee ﬁnancial expert’ for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002.
COMMITTEE ROLE
The Committee recommends the appointment and
reappointment of the company’s external auditors and
considers their resignation or dismissal, recommending to the
Board appropriate action to appoint new auditors. It ensures
that key partners are rotated at appropriate intervals. It
discusses with the auditors the scope of their audits before they
commence, reviews the results and considers the formal reports
of the auditors and reports the results of those reviews to the
Board. It reviews the auditors’ performance, including the scope
of the audit, and recommends to the Board appropriate
remuneration.
As a result of regulatory or similar requirements, it may be
necessary to employ the company’s external auditors for certain
non-audit work. In order to safeguard the independence and
objectivity of the external auditors, the Board has determined
policies as to what non-audit services can be provided by the
company’s external auditors and the approval processes related
to them. Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will
not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear
efﬁciencies and value added beneﬁts to the company. The
overall policies and the processes to implement them were
reviewed and appropriately modiﬁed in the light of the
provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 relating to
non-audit services that external auditors may not perform. The
Audit Committee monitors the extent of non-audit work being
performed by the company’s auditors and approves such work
before it is undertaken. It also monitors the level of non-audit
fees paid to the external auditors.
The Audit Committee reviews the company’s published
ﬁnancial results, the Annual Report and Form 20-F and other
published information for statutory and regulatory compliance.
It reports its views to the Board to assist it in its approval of the
results’ announcements and the Annual Report and Form 20-F.
The Committee also reviews the disclosure made by the Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director during the certiﬁcation
process for the annual report about the design or operation of
internal controls or material weaknesses in the controls,
including any fraud involving management or other employees
who have a signiﬁcant role in the company’s ﬁnancial controls.
The Board, as required by UK law, takes responsibility for all
disclosures in the annual report.
COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
During the year, the Audit Committee monitored and reviewed
the standards of risk management and internal control, the
effectiveness of internal control, ﬁnancial reporting, accounting
policies and procedures, and the company’s statements on
internal controls before they are agreed by the Board for each
year’s annual report. It also reviewed the company’s internal
audit function and its relationship with the external auditors,
including internal audit’s plans and performance. It reviewed
the arrangements for dealing, in conﬁdence, with complaints
from employees about accounting or ﬁnancial management
impropriety, fraud, poor business practices and other matters.
At each of its meetings it reviewed with the group chief internal
auditor and appropriate executives the implementation and
effectiveness of key operational and functional change and
remedial programmes including major contracts and IT
programmes. The Committee also set aside time at every
meeting to seek the views of the company’s internal and
external auditors in the absence of executives.
In addition to carrying out those regular tasks described
above under the Committee’s terms of reference, which are
posted on the company’s website at www.bt.com/committees,
the Committee also carried out its annual consideration of the
group’s risk register process, and reviewed the company’s
system of internal control, its accounting systems, IT security
and fraud and related matters. It also considered the effect on
the company’s results of the introduction of international
ﬁnancial reporting standards, which have applied to the
company’s results for the 2006 ﬁnancial year. Additionally, the
Committee has reviewed at each of its meetings during the
2006 ﬁnancial year the steps being taken within the group with
regard to the application of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act dealing with
the internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. It also speciﬁcally
evaluated its performance and processes by again inviting
Committee members and several executives and the external
auditors to complete questionnaires. This process formed part
of the annual Board and Committee evaluation. Committee
members, and those others consulted, regard the Committee as
effective on both behaviours and processes. There is a similar
view too of the external audit process, which is regarded as
effective. The evaluation highlighted the need for the
Committee to consider action both to reduce paperwork and to
increase the length of the quarterly meetings to give more
discussion time, if at all possible. The Committee also reviewed
the experience, skills and succession planning within the
Group’s ﬁnance function.
The Group Finance Director, the Secretary, the group’s chief
internal auditor and the company’s external auditors attend the
Committee’s meetings. The Committee met four times during
the 2006 ﬁnancial year. The minutes of Audit Committee
meetings are sent, at their request, to directors who are not
members of the Committee.

The Nominating Committee consisted of the Chairman, the
Deputy Chairman, Maarten van den Bergh and John Nelson,
throughout the 2006 ﬁnancial year. Three of its four members
are independent non-executive directors. The Secretary and,
where appropriate, at the invitation of the Chairman, the Chief
Executive attends the Committee’s meetings.
COMMITTEE ROLE AND ACTIVITIES
The Nominating Committee ensures an appropriate balance of
experience and abilities on the Board, using this evaluation to
review the size and composition of the Board and to
recommend any proposed changes to the Board. It keeps under
review the need for appointments to the Board, prepares a
description of the speciﬁc experience and skills needed for an
appointment, considers candidates who are put forward by the
directors and external consultants, and recommends to the
Board the appointments of all directors after having met short-
listed candidates. It also reviews the time required from the
Deputy Chairman and other non-executive directors to carry out
their duties and advises the Board on succession planning for
the positions of the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Chief
Executive and all other Board appointments. The Committee
met four times during the 2006 ﬁnancial year. It reviewed
Board succession, the size, proﬁle and composition of the Board
and the Board and Board committee evaluation questionnaire
and process. The Committee also reviewed and recommended
to the Board the continued appointments of non-executive
directors and the new appointments of Matti Alahuhta and Phil
Hodkinson.
The terms of reference of the Nominating Committee are
posted on the company’s website at: www.bt.com/
committees. The minutes of Nominating Committee meetings
are sent, at their request, to directors who are not members of
the Committee.
BOARD EVALUATION
During summer 2005, the Board carried out, through a
questionnaire and discussion with directors, its third formal
evaluation of Board and Board committee performance and
effectiveness. The individual performance of directors was also
evaluated at one-to-one sessions with the Chairman. The
Deputy Chairman, Sir Anthony Greener, the senior independent
director, led the review of the Chairman’s performance in
consultation with the non-executive and executive directors.
The results of that evaluation were considered by the Board
in July 2005. The directors considered BT’s Board processes
and effectiveness to be good. Key areas highlighted were: the
need for continued focus on Board diversity; continued efforts
to maintain visibility of major capital projects (including post
project reviews); and the amount of time available at Board
meetings for more free-ranging discussion. These matters are
being addressed. Further evaluations will be carried out
annually.
Separate questionnaires about Audit Committee effectiveness
were also completed and the results are reviewed on page 48 in
the Report of the Audit Committee.

REMUNERATION POLICY
This part of the Report on directors’ remuneration is not
subject to audit.
(i) Constitution and process
The directors consider that BT has, thoughout the year,
complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 2003
Combined Code on Corporate Governance. Shareholders will be
invited to approve this report at the company’s 2006 AGM. The
Board is ultimately responsible for both the structure and
amount of executive remuneration, but it has delegated prime
responsibility for executive remuneration to the Remuneration
Committee. The Committee is made up wholly of independent
non-executive directors. The terms of reference of the
Committee are available on the company’s website at
www.bt.com/committees. The Committee’s role is to set the
remuneration policy and individual remuneration packages for
the Chairman and the senior management team, comprising
the executive directors, members of the Operating Committee
(OC) and other senior executives reporting to the Chief
Executive. This includes approving changes to the company’s
long-term incentive plans, recommending to the Board those
plans which require shareholder approval and overseeing their
operation. In this role the Committee also monitors the
structure of reward for executives reporting to the senior
management team and determines the basis on which awards
are granted under the company’s executive share plans. The
Committee met four times during the ﬁnancial year 2005/06.
Sir Anthony Greener has chaired the Committee since 18 July
2001. Other members of the Committee who served during the
ﬁnancial years 2004/05 and 2005/06 were:
s Matti Alahuhta (appointed 7 February 2006)
s Maarten van den Bergh
s Lou Hughes
s Margaret Jay
s Carl Symon.
Lou Hughes stepped down from the Committee on 31 March
2006 when he left the Board.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are invited to attend
meetings. They are not present when matters affecting their
own remuneration arrangements are considered. No director or
executive is involved in any decision relating to his or her
remuneration. Non-executive directors who are not members of
the Committee are entitled to receive papers and minutes of
the Committee. The Committee had access during the year to
professional advisers, both from within the company and
externally. Towers Perrin (Remuneration consultants) and
Kepler Associates (Remuneration consultants), who were
appointed by the company; Ben Verwaayen, Chief Executive;
Hanif Lalani, Group Finance Director; Alex Wilson, Group HR
Director and Larry Stone, Company Secretary, provided advice
that materially assisted the Committee in relation to directors’
remuneration in the ﬁnancial year 2005/06. Remuneration
consultants provide a range of data and advisory services
covering all aspects of executive pay, bonus arrangements,
shares and beneﬁts. The Committee agreed that its
Remuneration consultants, Kepler Associates, may advise both
the Committee and BT, and should be invited to attend
meetings when major remuneration policy issues were
discussed. Towers Perrin provides market data.
BT’s executive remuneration policy is to reward employees
competitively, taking into account individual line of business
and company performance, market comparisons, and the
competitive pressures in the information and communications
technology industry as BT focuses on growth through
transformation. Base salaries are positioned around the mid-

market, with total direct compensation (basic salary, annual
bonus – cash and deferred shares – and the expected value of any
long-term incentives) to be at the upper quartile only for sustained
and excellent performance. There are no plans to change this
policy. A signiﬁcant and increasing proportion of the total
executive remuneration package is linked to line of business and/
or corporate performance. Remuneration arrangements and
performance targets are kept under regular review to achieve this.
(ii) Packages and ﬁnancial year 2005/06 operation
The remuneration package is made up of some or all of the
following:
Basic salary
Salaries are reviewed annually, but increases are made only
where the Committee believes that adjustments are appropriate
to reﬂect contribution, increased responsibilities and/or market
pressures. No base pay changes were proposed or made for
executive directors in 2005/06, save that the Committee
agreed an increase in annual base salary effective from 1 August
2005 for Paul Reynolds to reﬂect his responsibility for delivering
the 21st Century Network and a number of key productivity and
process improvements.
Performance-related remuneration
Annual bonus
The annual bonus plan is designed to reward the achievement
of results against set objectives.
For the ﬁnancial year 2005/06, on-target and maximum
(requiring truly exceptional performance) bonus levels for
executive directors and OC members, as a percentage of salary,
were set at 87.5% and 175% respectively, with approximately
43% of any bonus payable in the form of deferred shares.
The Committee last year increased the deferred share
element of the Chief Executive’s annual bonus but not the cash
element for the ﬁnancial year 2005/06 and subsequent ﬁnancial
years, in order to make his total package more retentive and
competitive with those of the leaders of the 30 largest
companies in the FTSE 100. Both the cash and shares elements
are determined by performance against corporate targets. Up
to two-thirds of his bonus is paid in deferred shares which vest
after three years. This had the effect of increasing his on-target
bonus to 255% of salary, of which 85% would be paid in cash
as previously and 170% of salary would be paid in deferred
shares. His total bonus – cash and deferred shares – is subject
to an overall cap of 300% of base salary in any one year.
Under his contract, the Chairman is not entitled to a bonus.
Corporate performance targets, set at the beginning of the
ﬁnancial year 2005/06 were weighted such that 40% of the
bonus potential was based on earnings per share, 40% on free
cash ﬂow and 20% on customer satisfaction. Delivery against
these operational targets is a key determinant of success and
supports BT’s strategy for transformation and growth. The
Committee agreed that in calculating earnings per share for
purposes of the annual bonus, volatile items which would be
reported under IFRS should be excluded. The impact of market
movements in foreign exchange and ﬁnancial instruments plus
the net ﬁnance income relating to the group’s pension liabilities
were excluded from the target.
For the three line of business Chief Executives and other
relevant executives, the importance of meeting these
operational targets was recognised by linking 100% of their
potential bonus to BT’s corporate performance. The Committee
retains the ﬂexibility to enhance or reduce bonus awards in
exceptional circumstances.

The deferred share element of the annual bonus is paid under
the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP). The shares vest and are
transferred to the executive after three years if still employed by
the company. There are no additional performance measures
for the vesting of deferred share awards. The Committee
considers that deferring a part of the annual bonus in this way
also acts as a retention measure and contributes to aligning
management with long-term shareholder interests.
The deferred awards for Ben Verwaayen, Andy Green, Hanif
Lalani, Ian Livingston and Paul Reynolds at the end of the
ﬁnancial year 2005/06 are contained in the table on page 61.
The initial values of the awards to be granted in respect of the
ﬁnancial year 2005/06 are given in the table on page 57.
As a retention measure and given competitive market
conditions, the Committee decided last year to introduce an
additional special bonus arrangement for Andy Green, Chief
Executive BT Global Services, linked to performance targets for
that line of business. This bonus arrangement, payable in
retention shares (see Retention shares) which will vest three
years after grant, was applied to performance for the ﬁnancial
year 2005/06, and will be applied for 2006/07 and 2007/08.
Awards will be linked to a sliding scale of BT Global Services’
performance, weighted equally around revenue growth, EBIT
and cash generation. The target award is equivalent to 100% of
salary, with a maximum of 150% of salary. The ﬁrst award of
retention shares with a value of £750,000 will be granted in
June 2006 and will vest in June 2009 subject to continued
employment.
Long-term incentives
The BT Equity Incentive Portfolio (the Portfolio) is designed to
ensure that equity participation is an important part of overall
remuneration. It comprises three elements: share options,
incentive shares and retention shares. Incentive shares were
used for equity participation in the ﬁnancial year 2005/06.
Retention shares are used only as a recruitment or retention
tool. No options were granted in the ﬁnancial year 2005/06.
Under his service agreement, the Chairman is not entitled to
receive annual grants of incentive awards or options.
Normally, awards vest and options become exercisable only
if a predetermined performance target has been achieved. The
performance measure for outstanding awards and options is
TSR (total shareholder return) compared with a relevant basket
of companies. TSR for these purposes was calculated by New
Bridge Street Consultants. TSR links the reward given to
directors with the performance of BT against the shares of other
major companies. For grants in the ﬁnancial years 2001/02,
2002/03 and 2003/04, the comparator group was the FTSE
100 at 1 April in each year. For grants in the ﬁnancial year
2004/05 and in 2005/06, TSR was measured against a group of
companies from the European Telecom Sector.
Report on directors’ remuneration BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 51 Filename: 824560_03.3d Time: 14:33:52 Date: 20/05/06
Checksum: 300467509
At 1 April 2005, the group contained the following companies:
BT Group
Belgacom
Cable & Wireless
Cosmote Mobile Telecommunications
Deutsche Telekom
France Telecom
Hellenic Telecommunications
O2
Portugal Telecom
KPN
Swisscom
TDC
Telecom Italia
Telecom Italia Mobile
Telefonica
Telekom Austria
Telenor
TeliaSonera
Vodafone Group
The base price at the beginning of the performance period is
calculated by averaging the share price of BT and other
companies in the comparator group over the six months to
31 March prior to the grant of the award. However, for the
awards granted in the ﬁnancial year 2002/03, the period was
from 19 November 2001 (the date of the O2 demerger) to
31 March 2002. The end price is the average of the share price
over the six months to the end of the performance period,
adjusted for all capital actions and dividend payments that
occur during the performance period.
Incentive shares
For the ﬁnancial year 2005/06, the Committee decided to grant
incentive shares and to increase the annual bonus potential,
payable in deferred shares, instead of the combination of share
options and incentive shares granted in 2004/05. Incentive
shares with a maximum value of 100% of salary were granted.
The Committee determined, with advice from Towers Perrin,
that the change of emphasis would increase the proportion of
variable reward linked to annual performance targets. Incentive
share awards remain a signiﬁcant part of the package and,
together with deferred shares, these modiﬁcations further
aligned management with long-term shareholder interests.
Awards of incentive shares vest after a performance period of
three years, if the participant is still employed by BT and a
performance measure has been met. For awards of incentive
shares in the ﬁnancial years 2004/05 and 2005/06, TSR at the
end of the three year period must be in the upper quartile
relative to the comparator group for all of the shares to vest. At
median, 25% of the shares under award will vest. Below that
point, none of the shares under award will vest. The proportion
of shares that vests reduces on a straight-line basis between
those points. There will be no re-testing, and no matching
shares are being offered to any executive on vesting of the
incentive shares.
The details of incentive share awards held by Ben
Verwaayen, Andy Green, Hanif Lalani, Ian Livingston and Paul
Reynolds at the end of the ﬁnancial year 2005/06 are contained
in the table on page 60.
Share options
No share options were granted in 2005/06.
The price at which shares may be acquired under the Global
Share Option Plan (GSOP) is the market price at the date of
grant. Other than for new recruits, the size of option grant is
based on corporate and individual performance. Options are
exercisable after three years, subject to a performance target
being met. The Committee would not normally expect the initial
value of annual grants of options, based on the market price of
a BT share, to exceed three times base salary. In the ﬁnancial
year 2004/05, the maximum option grant for executive
directors and OC members was reduced to 1.5 times base
salary (see Incentive shares above).
For options granted subject to a TSR measure, BT’s TSR at
the end of the three-year period must be in the upper quartile
for all of the options to be exercisable. At median, 30% of the
options will be exercisable. Below that point, none of the
options may be exercised. The proportion of options that are
exercisable reduces on a straight-line basis between those
points. For options granted in the ﬁnancial year 2002/03, if the
performance measure is not met in full at the ﬁrst
measurement, it may be re-tested against a ﬁxed base in years
four and ﬁve, and for options granted in the ﬁnancial year
2003/04, it may be re-tested in year ﬁve. If TSR has not
reached the median at the end of the ﬁfth year, previously
unexercisable options will lapse. For options granted in the
ﬁnancial year 2002/03, TSR had reached 74th position at the
ﬁrst measurement relative to the FTSE 100, it had reached 73rd
position on the second measurement and performance will be
re-tested in the ﬁnancial year 2006/07. For options granted in
the ﬁnancial year 2003/04, TSR had reached 85th position at
the ﬁrst measurement relative to the FTSE 100 and
performance will be re-tested in the ﬁnancial year 2007/08. If
the performance measure is not met, the options will lapse.
For options granted in the ﬁnancial year 2004/05 there were
no re-testing provisions, and the policy of the Committee is for
there to be no re-testing for future equity awards.
The option granted to Sir Christopher Bland on 22 June
2001 as part of his recruitment package is not subject to a
performance measure as it matched a personal investment in
BT shares of £1 million.
The details of the options held by Sir Christopher Bland, Ben
Verwaayen, Andy Green, Hanif Lalani, Ian Livingston and Paul
Reynolds at the end of the ﬁnancial year 2005/06 are contained
in the table on page 59.
Retention shares
Retention shares are granted under the Retention Share Plan
(RSP) to individuals with critical skills, as a recruitment or
retention tool. As a result, shares currently under award are not
generally linked to a corporate performance target. The length
of the retention period before awards vest is ﬂexible although
this would normally be three years unless the Committee
agreed otherwise. The shares are transferred at the end of the
speciﬁed period if the individual is still employed by BT.
Retention shares are used only in exceptional circumstances
and, in the ﬁnancial year 2005/06, 14 awards were made of
which eight awards were made for recruitment purposes.
In May 2005, an award of retention shares with an initial
market value of £1 million was granted to Ian Livingston, to
help secure his appointment and long-term retention as Chief
Executive, BT Retail. This award will vest in two tranches in
November 2006 and November 2007.
Andy Green will be granted an award of retention shares in
respect of BT Global Services’ﬁnancial performance in 2005/06
under a special bonus arrangement (see Annual bonus on
page 51).
The awards under the RSP held by Sir Christopher Bland and
Ian Livingston at the end of the ﬁnancial year 2005/06, or
which vested during the year, are contained in the table on
page 60.
Other share plans
The executive directors and the Chairman may participate in
BT’s HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved all-employee
share plans, the Employee Sharesave Scheme and Employee
BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 Report on directors’ remuneration 52 Filename: 824560_03.3d Time: 14:33:52 Date: 20/05/06
Checksum: -1397375480
Share Investment Plan, on the same basis as other employees.
There are further details of these plans in note 31 to the
accounts.
(iii) Annual package –ﬁnancial year 2006/07
The Remuneration Committee has determined that there will
not be any general increase in base pay for executive directors
in the ﬁnancial year 2006/07. However, Ben Verwaayen’s base
pay, which has not increased since he joined the company in
2002, will be increased to £750,000 per annum from 1 June
2006. Hanif Lalani’s base pay will be increased to £460,000
per annum from 1 June 2006, following his successful
assumption of, and continuing performance in, the Group
Finance Director’s role.
Long term reward
In the ﬁnancial year 2006/07, incentive shares will again be
granted for equity participation on the same terms as incentive
shares in 2005/06. TSR will continue to be measured against a
comparator group of companies from the European Telecom
Sector.
Annual bonus plan
The bonus structure remains unchanged. However, in line with
the Committee’s policy progressively to make a greater part of
the remuneration packages variable, on-target and maximum
(requiring exceptional performance) bonus levels for executive
directors as a percentage of salary will be 105% and 192.5%
respectively, with approximately 43% of any bonus payable in
deferred shares. The bonus arrangements for the Chief
Executive remain unchanged.
The annual bonus plan will continue to focus on annual
objectives and to reward the achievement of results against
those objectives. Performance will again be against earnings per
share, free cash ﬂow and customer satisfaction measures and
the weighting of those objectives will be the same as in 2005/
06. As in the ﬁnancial year 2005/06, for purposes of calculating
earnings per share for the scorecard, volatile items reported
under IFRS have been excluded from the target.
Group performance targets for the ﬁnancial year 2006/07
are believed by the Committee to be more challenging than the
outturn of the ﬁnancial year 2005/06.
Proportion of ﬁxed and variable remuneration
The targeted composition of each executive director’s
performance-related remuneration, excluding pension, for the
ﬁnancial year 2006/07, comprising annual and long-term
incentives, will be:
Fixed
Base Pay Variable Total
B. Verwaayen 25% 75% 100%
A. Green 40% 60% 100%
H. Lalani 40% 60% 100%
I. Livingston 40% 60% 100%
Dr. P. Reynolds 40% 60% 100%
Total remuneration comprises base salary, annual bonus – cash
and deferred shares – and the expected value of awards under
BT’s long-term incentive plans, excluding retention shares.
Openreach
In the Undertakings given to Ofcom on 22 September 2005, BT
agreed that the incentive elements of the remuneration of
executives within Openreach should be linked to Openreach
performance rather than BT targets or share price. These
incentives cannot be provided by way of BT shares.
New arrangements have been agreed by the Committee and
put in place which will give Openreach executives an
opportunity to receive bonuses and long-term incentive awards
of equivalent value to the bonuses and long-term incentives
awarded to other BT executives. Long-term incentives will,
however, be paid in cash instead of BT shares.
For the ﬁnancial year 2006/07, the annual bonus will
continue to be linked to an annual scorecard but the scorecard
targets will be those of Openreach alone.
As required by the Undertakings a cash arrangement is also
in place to enable Openreach executives to exchange, if they
wish, in June 2006 their options and awards over BT shares for
cash awards.
Openreach executives will continue to participate in the BT
HMRC-approved all-employee share plans on the same terms as
other BT employees. In addition, there would be no changes to
the pension arrangements of these executives.
None of the executive directors will participate in the
Openreach incentive plans.
(iv) Other matters
Executive share ownership
A mandatory shareholding programme was introduced for the
ﬁnancial year 2005/06 onwards. This is to encourage executive
directors and certain other executives to build up a
shareholding in the company over time by retaining shares
received either as a result of participating in a BT employee
share plan (other than the shares sold to pay a National
Insurance or income tax liability) or from on-market purchases.
The Chief Executive is required to build up a shareholding of 2 x
salary and the remaining executive directors 1.5 x salary. Given
that a large part of an executive’s remuneration is already
variable, the requirement excludes the need to make a further
personal investment to build up the shareholding should share
plan awards not vest. Current shareholdings are set out on page
56. Progress towards meeting these targets has been made
during the ﬁnancial year 2005/06.
Pensions
Those directors and other employees, who joined the company
prior to 1 April 2001, are members of the BT Pension Scheme,
which is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. The beneﬁts for the three
executive directors who are members of the scheme are set out
on page 58.
The Committee reviewed the impact of the Lifetime
Allowance under the pension simpliﬁcation legislation which
came into force from 6 April 2006. As a result, BT offered those
members affected the option to opt out of future accruals of
pensionable service and in its place to receive a cash allowance
annually. This was broadly cash neutral for the company.
BT closed the BT Pension Scheme to new members from
1 April 2001. From this date provision is generally made on a
deﬁned contribution basis. The company agrees to pay a ﬁxed
percentage of the executive’s salary each year which can be put
towards the provision of retirement beneﬁts. Additionally, a
lump sum equal to four times salary is payable on death in
service. The beneﬁts for the three executive directors who are
covered by this are set out on page 58.
Pension provision for all executives is based on salary alone –
bonuses, other elements of pay and long-term incentives are
excluded.

Checksum: 286289261
Other beneﬁts
Other beneﬁts for the Chairman and the senior management
team include some or all of the following: company car, fuel or
driver, personal telecommunications facilities and home
security, medical and dental cover for the director and
immediate family, special life cover, professional subscriptions
and personal tax planning and ﬁnancial counselling. The
company has a permanent health insurance policy to provide
cover for the Chairman and certain executive directors who may
become permanently incapacitated.
Service agreements
It is the policy for the Chairman and executive directors to have
service agreements providing for one year’s notice. It may be
necessary on recruitment to offer longer initial periods to new
directors from outside BT, or circumstances may make it
appropriate to offer a longer ﬁxed term. All of the service
agreements contain provisions dealing with the removal of a
director through poor performance, including in the event of
early termination of the contract by BT. Sir Christopher Bland’s
contract expires at the conclusion of the AGM in 2007. On
termination of his contract by BT before that date, he is entitled
to payment of salary and the value of beneﬁts for the period of
12 months from date of termination, or until the conclusion of
the company’s AGM in 2007 if that period is shorter. Ben
Verwaayen’s contract entitles him on termination of his contract
by BT to payment of £700,000. The contracts of Andy Green,
Hanif Lalani, Ian Livingston and Paul Reynolds entitle them on
termination of their contract by BT to payment of salary and the
value of beneﬁts until the earlier of 12 months from notice of
termination or the director obtaining full-time employment. If
the contract of an executive director (other than that of the
Chairman and Hanif Lalani) is terminated by BT within one year
of BT entering into a scheme of arrangement or becoming a
subsidiary of another company, he will be entitled to receive the
higher of that current year’s on-target bonus or the previous
year’s bonus, the market value of shares awarded under an
employee share ownership plan or deferred bonus plan that
have not vested, together with a year’s salary and the value of
any beneﬁts.
The Committee has reviewed contracts taking into account
the joint statement of best practice on executive contracts and
severance by the Association of British Insurers and the National
Association of Pension Funds, and other relevant guidelines,
and believes that contract terms are generally in line with best
practice. The clause described above dealing with termination
following BT entering into a scheme of arrangement or
becoming a subsidiary of another company will be excluded
from contracts for new appointments, as was the case for
Hanif Lalani.
Outside appointments
The Committee believes that there are signiﬁcant beneﬁts, to
both the company and the individual, from executive directors
accepting non-executive directorships of companies outside BT.
The Committee will consider up to two external appointments
(of which only one may be to the Board of a major company),
for which a director may retain the fees. Ben Verwaayen as a
non-executive director of United Parcel Service (UPS), receives
an annual fee of US$75,000. On joining UPS’s Board on
17 March 2005, he received 336 shares of restricted UPS
common stock amounting to US$25,000 and a further grant of
1,180 shares of restricted stock on 9 May 2005, amounting to
US$85,043. Ian Livingston receives an annual fee of £38,000
as a non-executive director of Ladbrokes plc (formerly Hilton
Group plc). Paul Reynolds, as a non-executive director of
E-Access in Japan, receives an annual fee of ¥3,204,000
(approximately £15,600). He was granted an option over 250
shares at ¥76,565 (approximately £367) per share on
1 July 2005. Andy Green was appointed a non-executive
director of NAVTEQ in the US on 16 March 2006. He is entitled
to receive an annual fee of US$40,000, stock options to the
value of US$60,000 and restricted stock units to the value of
US$30,000.
Non-executive directors’ letters of appointment
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment. They are
appointed for an initial period of three years. During that
period, either party can give the other at least three months’
notice. At the end of the period the appointment may be
continued by mutual agreement. Further details of appointment
arrangements for non-executive directors are set out in the
Report of the directors. The letters of appointment of non-
executive directors are terminable on notice by the company
without compensation.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
Eight of the directors on the Board are non-executive directors
who, in accordance with BT’s articles of association, cannot
individually vote on their own remuneration. Non-executive
remuneration is reviewed by the Chairman and the Chief
Executive and discussed and agreed by the Board. Non-
executive directors may attend the Board discussion but may
not participate in it.
The fees paid to non-executive directors were increased with
effect from 1 January 2004 to reﬂect their increasing
responsibilities and time commitments.
The basic fee for non-executive directors is £40,000 per
year. An additional fee for membership of a Board committee is
£5,000 per year and a further £5,000 for chairing a committee.
Sir Anthony Greener, Deputy Chairman and senior non-
executive director, who also chairs both the Remuneration
Committee and the Audit Committee, receives total fees of
£115,000 per year. In recognition of the greater commitment
required, during the year it was agreed that Maarten van den
Bergh and John Nelson should receive an annual fee of £5,000
as members of the Pension Scheme Performance Review Group
and Maarten van den Bergh should receive an additional
£5,000 per annum as chairman of the Group. Carl Symon
receives an annual fee of £50,000 as chairman of the Equality
of Access Board (a Board committee), which was established on
1 November 2005.
To align further the interests of the non-executive directors
with those of shareholders, the company’s policy is to
encourage these directors to purchase, on a voluntary basis,
£5,000 of BT shares each year. The directors are asked to hold
these shares until they retire from the Board. This policy is not
mandatory.
No element of non-executive remuneration is performance-
related. Non-executive directors do not participate in BT’s
bonus or employee share plans and are not members of any of
the company pension schemes.

Performance graph
This graph illustrates, as required by the Companies Act 1985, the performance of BT Group plc measured by TSR (adjusted for
the rights issue and the demerger of BT’s mobile business in the ﬁnancial year 2001/02) relative to a broad equity market index
over the past ﬁve years. We consider the FTSE 100 to be the most appropriate index against which to measure performance for
these purposes, as BT has been a constituent of the FTSE 100 throughout the ﬁve-year period and the index is widely used. TSR is
the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reﬂecting share price movements and assuming
reinvestment of dividends.

Directors’ emoluments for the ﬁnancial year 2005/06 were as follows:
Basic
salary and
Pension

Report on directors’ remuneration BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 57 Filename: 824560_03.3d Time: 14:33:57 Date: 20/05/06
Checksum: 1307611403
The annual salaries of the Chairman, Ben Verwaayen, Andy
Green, Ian Livingston and Hanif Lalani remained unchanged
during the ﬁnancial year 2005/06. On 1 August 2005, the
annual salary of Paul Reynolds was increased from £400,000 to
£450,000. Following this year’s salary review, the Committee
decided that there should be no general increase from 1 June
2006 in basic salaries, save that Ben Verwaayen’s annual salary
will be increased from £700,000 to £750,000 and Hanif
Lalani’s annual salary will be increased from £400,000 to
£460,000, both on 1 June 2006.
A special retention arrangement was established for Hanif
Lalani on 1 July 2004, when he was CFO, BT Wholesale, under
which he will receive a lump sum cash payment of £150,000 on
30 June 2006, provided he is still an employee of the company
on that date. The award will be forfeited without compensation
if Mr Lalani resigns or his employment is terminated by the
company with cause before that date.
Annual cash bonus awards in respect of the ﬁnancial year
2005/06, which are not pensionable, to executive directors
ranged from 80% to 112% of current salary (2005 – 38%
to 64%).
Former directors
Sir Peter Bonﬁeld received, under pre-existing arrangements, a
pension of £352,153 payable in the ﬁnancial year 2005/06
(2004/05 – £340,000).
Loans
Prior to the date of his appointment to the Board on
19 November 2001, Paul Reynolds had an interest-free loan of
£300,000 from the company to assist with relocation. At
31 March 2006, he owed £200,000 (2005 – £230,000). During
the ﬁnancial year 2005/06, the maximum amount outstanding
was £230,000. There are no outstanding loans granted by any
member of the BT group to any other of the directors or
guarantees provided by any member of the BT group for their
beneﬁt. The outstanding amount of a loan of £209,374 granted
to a former director, Pierre Danon, was repaid during the year.
Pensions
Sir Christopher Bland is not a member of any of the company
pension schemes, but the company matches his contributions,
up to 10% of the earnings cap, to a personal pension plan.
Company contributions of £10,560 were payable in respect of
the ﬁnancial year 2005/06. The earnings cap is a restriction on
the amount of pay which can be used to calculate contributions
and beneﬁts due to a tax approved pension scheme.
Ben Verwaayen is not a member of any of the company
pension schemes, but the company has agreed to pay an annual
amount equal to 30% of his salary towards pension provision.
The company paid £31,680 into his personal pension plan, the
maximum permitted by HMRC, plus a cash payment of
£178,320 representing the balance of the pension allowance for
the ﬁnancial year 2005/06. BT also provides him with a lump
sum death in service beneﬁt of four times his salary.
Ian Livingston is not a member of any of the company
pension schemes, but the company has agreed to pay an annual
amount equal to 30% of his salary towards pension provision.
The company paid £21,120 into his personal pension plan, the
maximum permitted by HMRC, plus a cash payment of
£136,380 representing the balance of the pension allowance for
the ﬁnancial year 2005/06. BT also provides him with a lump
sum death in service beneﬁt of four times his salary.
Andy Green is a member of the BT Pension Scheme. From
31 December 1997 the company has been purchasing an
additional 203 days of pensionable service each year to bring
his pensionable service at age 60 up to 40 years. A two-thirds
widow’s pension would be payable on his death.
Hanif Lalani is a member of the BT Pension Scheme. From
7 February 2005, the company has been purchasing an
additional 27 days of pensionable service each year to bring his
pensionable service at age 60 up to 40 years. A two-thirds
widow’s pension would be payable on his death. He chose to
opt out of future accrual of pensionable service from 1 April
2006 and, in its place, to receive a cash allowance of 30% of
salary.
Paul Reynolds is a member of the BT Pension Scheme. From
1 July 1996 the company has been purchasing an additional
109 days of pensionable service each year to bring his
pensionable service at age 60 up to 40 years. A two-thirds
widow’s pension would be payable on his death. He chose to
opt out of future accrual of pensionable service from 1 April
2006 and, in its place, to receive a cash allowance of 30% of
salary.

These amounts represent the deferred pension to which the directors would have been entitled had they left the company on 31 March 2006 and 2005, respectively.
c
Transfer value of the deferred pension in column (a) as at 31 March 2006 calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11. The transfer value represents
a liability of the BT Pension Scheme rather than any remuneration due to the individual and cannot be meaningfully aggregated with annual remuneration, as it is not money the individual is
entitled to receive.
d
The equivalent transfer value but calculated as at 31 March 2005 on the assumption that the director left service at that date.
e
The increase in pension built up during the year, net of inflation. The gross amount can be calculated by deducting the amount under column (b) from the amount under column (a).
f
The transfer value of the pension in column (e), less directors’ contributions.
g
Directors’ contributions in the financial year 2005/06 were as follows: Andy Green, £30,000.
(2005 – £26,625); Hanif Lalani £24,000 (2005 – £16,300) and Paul Reynolds, £26,000 (2005 – £24,000).

All of the above options were granted for nil consideration. No options were exercised during the year.
a
Options granted under the GSOP on 22 June 2001. The option is not subject to a performance measure. It was a term of Sir Christopher Bland’s initial service contract that (i) he purchased BT
shares to the value of at least £1 million; and (ii) as soon as practicable after the purchase of the shares (‘invested shares’), the company would grant a share option over shares to the value of at
least £1 million. Sir Christopher Bland was the legal and beneficial owner of the invested shares on 1 May 2004, so the option became exercisable on that date.
b
Option granted under the GSOP on 11 February 2002. The exercise of the option is subject to a performance measure being met. The performance measure is relative TSR compared with the FTSE
100 as at 1 April 2002. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all of the option to become exercisable. At median, 40% of the option will be exercisable. Below that point, none of the option
may be exercised. On 31 March 2005, BT’s TSR was at 74th position against the FTSE 100 and on 31 March 2006, BT’s TSR was at 73rd position against the FTSE 100. As a result, the option did
not become exercisable. The TSR will be re-tested against a fixed base on 31 March 2007.
c
Options granted under the GSOP on 29 July 2002. The exercise of options is subject to a performance measure being met. The performance measure is relative TSR compared with the FTSE 100 as
at 1 April 2002. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all of the options to become exercisable. At median, 30% of the options will be exercisable. Below that point, none of the options may be
exercised. On 31 March 2005, BT’s TSR was at 74th position against the FTSE 100 and on 31 March 2006, BT’s TSR was at 73rd position against the FTSE 100. As a result, the options did not
become exercisable. The TSR will be re-tested against a fixed base on 31 March 2007
d
Options granted under the GSOP on 24 June 2003. The exercise of options is subject to a performance measure being met. The performance measure is relative TSR compared with the FTSE 100
as at 1 April 2003. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all of the options to become exercisable. At median, 30% of the options will be exercisable. Below that point, none of the options may
be exercised. On 31 March 2006, BT’s TSR was at 85th position against the FTSE 100. As a result, the options did not become exercisable. The TSR will be re-tested against a fixed base on 31
March 2008.
e
Options granted under the GSOP on 24 June 2004. The exercise of options is subject to a performance measure being met. The performance measure is relative TSR compared with a group of
companies from the European Telecom Sector as at 1 April 2004. BT’s TSR must be in the upper quartile for all the options to become exercisable. At median 30% of the options will be exercisable.
Below that point none of the options may be exercised.

g
Option granted on 27 June 2003 under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, in which all employees of the company are eligible to participate.
h
Option granted under the GSOP (Special Incentive Award) on 24 June 2003, prior to Mr Lalani’s appointment as a director. This option is not subject to a performance measure as the grant was
linked to personal performance.
i
Option granted on 25 June 2002 under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, in which all employees of the company are eligible to participate.
j
Option granted on 21 December 2001 under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, in which all employees of the company are eligible to participate.
The market price of a share at 31 March 2006 was 222p (2005 – 205.5p) and the range during the ﬁnancial year 2005/06 was
196.5p – 235p.
From 31 March 2006, two thirds of Hanif Lalani’s option granted on 24 June 2003 was exercisable giving an unrealised gain as
at that date of £15,790. There were no further unrealised gains on the above share options at 31 March 2006 (2005 – £2,105),
based on the market price of the shares on 31 March 2006.

Operating Committee
The one member of the Operating Committee (OC) who was
not a member of the Board, left the company on 30 September
2005. The remuneration of that OC member for the ﬁnancial
year 2005/06 was £148,000 (2004/05 – £296,000), together
with pension contributions of £17,000 (2004/05 – £34,000).
No options or awards under the BT Group plans were granted
to the OC member during the ﬁnancial year 2005/06. The
company met its contractual obligations in connection with the
leaving arrangements and a number of outstanding options and
share awards of the OC member were preserved under the
terms of the relevant plans.

UNITED KINGDOM OPINION
Independent auditors’ report to the members of BT Group plc
We have audited the group ﬁnancial statements of BT Group plc for the year
ended 31 March 2006 which comprise the group income statement, the
group balance sheet, the group cash ﬂow statement, the group statement of
recognised income and expense, accounting policies and the related notes.
These group ﬁnancial statements are set out on pages 65 to 122. These
group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial
statements of BT Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2006 and on the
information in the Report on directors’ remuneration that is described as
having been audited. This separate report is set out on page 123.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the group
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU)
are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion,
has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the group ﬁnancial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We report to you whether in
our opinion the information given in the Report of the directors is consistent
with the group ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the directors’
report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the operating and
ﬁnancial review that is cross referred from the Report of the directors. We
also report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects the
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited group ﬁnancial statements. The
other information comprises only the Financial headlines, Chairman’s
message, Chief Executive’s statement, the Operating and ﬁnancial review,
the Report of the directors, the Report of the audit committee, the Report of
the nominating committee and the unaudited part of the Report on
directors’ remuneration. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the group ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the group ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the
directors in the preparation of the group ﬁnancial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group ﬁnancial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the group ﬁnancial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
s the group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the group’s
affairs as at 31 March 2006 and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year
then ended;
s the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation; and
s the information given in the Report of the directors is consistent with the
group ﬁnancial statements.

UNITED STATES OPINION
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to the board of
directors and shareholders of BT Group plc
In our opinion, the accompanying group balance sheets and the related
group statements of income, of cash ﬂows and of statements of recognised
income and expenses present fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial
position of BT Group plc and its subsidiaries at 31 March 2006 and 2005,
and the results of their operations and their cash ﬂows for each of the two
years in the period ended 31 March 2006, in conformity with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union
(EU). These ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the group’s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ﬁnancial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the ﬁnancial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
signiﬁcant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
ﬁnancial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in the accounting policies section to the ﬁnancial
statements, the group has adopted prospectively from 1 April 2005
International Accounting Standards (IAS) 32 –‘Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39 –‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’ in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
EU.
IFRS, as adopted by the EU, vary in certain signiﬁcant respects from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented
in the United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles note within
the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (note 35).

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 Consolidated ﬁnancial statements 64 Filename: 824560_04.3d Time: 14:34:08 Date: 20/05/06
Checksum: 1678384300
(I) BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
These group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in
accordance with applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union
(EU). For BT there are no differences between IFRS as adopted
for use in the EU and full IFRS as published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The ﬁnancial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention,
modiﬁed for the revaluation of certain ﬁnancial assets and
liabilities at fair value.
Where there are signiﬁcant differences to US GAAP, these
have been described in note 35.
IFRS 1, ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards’, has been applied in preparing these
group ﬁnancial statements. These are the group’s ﬁrst ﬁnancial
statements to be prepared in accordance with IFRS; note 34
describes how the directors have applied the ﬁrst-time adoption
provisions as set out in IFRS 1.
The policies set out below have been consistently applied to
all the years presented with the exception of those relating to
ﬁnancial instruments under IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39, ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, which have been
applied with effect from 1 April 2005.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with
IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise its judgement in the process of
applying the group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a
higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where
assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements are disclosed below in ‘Critical accounting
estimates and key judgements’.
The group’s income statement and segmental analysis
separately identiﬁes material one-off or unusual items (termed
‘speciﬁc items’). This is in accordance with IAS 1, ‘Presentation
of Financial Statements’ and is consistent with the way that
ﬁnancial performance is measured by management and assists
in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the
group. Speciﬁc items may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Items which have been
considered material one-off or unusual in nature include
disposals of businesses and investments, business restructuring
and property rationalisation programmes. The directors intend
to follow such a presentation on a consistent basis in the future.
Speciﬁc items for the current and prior year are disclosed in
note 4.
Accounting policies in respect of the parent company
information for BT Group plc are set out on page 124. These
are in accordance with UK GAAP.
(II) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The group ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial
statements of BT Group plc (‘‘the company’’) and entities
controlled by the company (its subsidiaries) and incorporate its
share of the results of jointly controlled entities (joint ventures)
and associates using the equity method of accounting.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition or
up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where
necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to bring the
accounting policies used into line with those used by the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are
eliminated on consolidation.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried at cost
plus post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of the net
assets or liabilities of the associate or joint venture, less any
impairment in value in individual investments. The income
statement reﬂects the group’s share of the results of operations
after tax of the associate or joint venture using the equity
method of accounting.
The group’s principal operating subsidiaries and associate
are detailed on page 127.
(III) REVENUE
Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received
or receivable for services provided and equipment sales, net of
discounts and sales taxes. Revenue from the sale of equipment
and rendering of services is recognised when it is probable that
the economic beneﬁts associated with a transaction will ﬂow to
the group, and the amount of revenue, and the associated costs
incurred, or to be incurred, can be measured reliably. Where
the group acts as agent in a transaction amounts collected on
behalf of the principal are excluded from revenue.
Revenue arising from separable installation and connection
activities is recognised when it is earned, upon activation.
Revenue from the rental of analogue and digital lines and
private circuits is recognised evenly over the period to which the
charges relate. Revenue from calls is recognised at the time the
call is made over the group’s networks.
Subscription fees, consisting primarily of monthly charges for
access to broadband and other internet access or voice services,
are recognised as revenue over the associated subscription
period. Revenue arising from the interconnection of voice and
data trafﬁc between other telecommunications operators is
recognised at the time of transit across the group’s network.
Sales of peripheral and other equipment are recognised
when all of the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership are
transferred to the buyer, which is normally the date the
equipment is delivered and accepted by the customer.
Revenue and costs from long term contractual arrangements
are recognised based on the percentage of completion method.
The stage of completion is estimated using an appropriate
measure according to the nature of the contract. For ﬁxed price
contracts, revenue and costs are recognised on the proportional
performance basis. For milestone based contracts, revenue and
costs are recognised at the time a milestone is achieved and
accepted by the customer. In the case of time and materials
contracts, revenue and costs are recognised as the service is
rendered. An element of the costs incurred in the initial phase
of contracts may be deferred when they relate directly to the
speciﬁc contract, relate to future activity of the contract and will
generate future economic beneﬁts.
The percentage of completion method relies on estimates of
total expected contract revenues and costs, as well as reliable
measurement of the progress made towards completion. Unless
the ﬁnancial outcome of a contract can be estimated with
reasonable certainty, no attributable proﬁt is recognised.
Recognised revenue and proﬁts are subject to revisions during
the contract in the event that the assumptions regarding the
overall contract outcome are changed. The cumulative impact
of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period in which such
revisions become likely and can be estimated. Where the actual
and estimated costs to completion exceed the estimated
revenue for a contract, the full contract life loss is immediately
recognised.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more
separate elements that have value to the customer on a
standalone basis, revenue is recognised for each element as if it

Checksum: 1230368409
were an individual contract. The total contract consideration is
allocated between the separate elements on the basis of fair
value and the appropriate revenue recognition criteria applied
to each element as described above.
(IV) LEASES
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the group holds
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed
as ﬁnance leases.
Finance lease assets are capitalised at the commencement of
the lease at the lower of the present value of the minimum
lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset. The
obligations relating to ﬁnance leases, net of ﬁnance charges in
respect of future periods, are recognised as liabilities. Leases
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. If a sale and leaseback transaction
results in a ﬁnance lease, any excess of sale proceeds over the
carrying amount is deferred and recognised in the income
statement over the lease term.
Leases where a signiﬁcant portion of the risks and rewards
are held by the lessor are classiﬁed as operating leases. Rentals
are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis
over the period of the lease. If a sale and leaseback transaction
results in an operating lease, any proﬁt or loss is recognised in
the income statement immediately.
(V) FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each of the
group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates (the
‘functional currency’). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are
presented in sterling, the functional and presentation currency
of the group.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the
date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in
the income statement in the line which most appropriately
reﬂects the nature of the item or transaction. However, where
monetary items form part of the net investment in a foreign
operation or are designated as hedges of a net investment, or
from 1 April 2005, as cash ﬂow hedges, such exchange
differences are initially recognised in equity.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign
undertakings are translated into sterling at year end exchange
rates. The results of foreign undertakings are translated into
sterling at average rates of exchange for the year (unless this
average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative
effects of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which
case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the
transactions). Foreign exchange differences arising on
retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of
equity, the translation reserve. At the date of transition to IFRS,
the cumulative translation differences for foreign operations
have been set to zero.
In the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, the cumulative
translation difference associated with the undertaking in the
translation reserve is charged or credited to the gain or loss on
disposal.
(VI) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the
acquisition of subsidiaries. On transition to IFRS, the group has
elected not to apply IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’
retrospectively to acquisitions that occurred before 1 April
2004. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business which
occurred between 1 January 1998 and 1 April 2004 is included
in the balance sheet at original cost, less accumulated
amortisation to the date of transition and any provisions for
impairment. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business
which occurred prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly
to retained earnings. From the date of transition, goodwill is not
amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill
might be impaired.
On the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking, joint venture
or associate, from the transition date, fair values are attributed
to the acquired identiﬁable tangible and intangible assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities. Goodwill, which is
capitalised, represents the difference between the fair value of
purchase consideration and the acquired interest in the fair
values of those net assets. Any negative goodwill is credited to
the income statement in the year of acquisition. Gains and
losses on disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of
goodwill relating to the entity or investment sold. Goodwill
previously written off to retained earnings is not recycled to the
income statement on disposal of an undertaking.
(VII) OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets include licence fees, trademarks,
brands, customer relationships, licences, development costs
and computer software.
When intangible assets are acquired in a business
combination, their cost is generally based on fair market values.
Costs directly associated with the development of computer
software for internal use are capitalised where technical
feasibility can be demonstrated, the group is satisﬁed that
future economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the group and the cost can
be separately identiﬁed and reliably measured.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis at
rates sufﬁcient to write off the cost, less any estimated residual
value, over their estimated useful lives.
Licence fees paid to governments, which permit
telecommunication activities to be operated for deﬁned
periods, are amortised from the time the network is available
for use to the end of the licence period on a straight line basis.
Subscriber acquisition costs are expensed as incurred, unless
they meet the criteria for capitalisation, in which case the costs
are capitalised and amortised over the shorter of the estimated
customer life or contractual period.
The estimated useful lives assigned to the principal
categories of intangible assets are as follows:
Telecommunication licences 1 to 5 years
Brands, customer lists and customer relationships 3 to 15 years
Computer software 2 to 5 years
(VIII) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research expenditure is recognised in the income statement in
the year in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure, including internally developed
software, is recognised in the income statement in the year in
which it is incurred unless it is probable that economic beneﬁts
will ﬂow to the group from the asset being developed, the cost
of the asset can be reliably measured and technical feasibility

can be demonstrated. When the recognition criteria are met,
intangible assets are capitalised and amortised on a straight line
basis over their estimated useful lives from the time the assets
are available for use.
(IX) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is included in the balance sheet
at historic cost, less accumulated depreciation and any
provisions for impairment.
Cost
Included within the cost for network assets are direct labour,
contractors’ charges, materials, payments on account and
directly attributable overheads.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment on a
straight line basis from the time the assets are available for use,
so as to write off their costs over their estimated useful lives
taking into account any expected residual values. No
depreciation is provided on freehold land.
The lives assigned to principal categories of assets are as
follows:
Freehold buildings 40 years
Leasehold land and buildings Unexpired portion of
lease or 40 years,
whichever is the shorter
Transmission equipment:
Duct 25 years
Cable 3 to 25 years
Radio and repeater equipment 2 to 25 years
Exchange equipment 2 to 13 years
Computers and ofﬁce equipment 3 to 6 years
Payphones, other network equipment,
motor vehicles and cableships 2 to 20 years
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over the
shorter of the lease term or their useful economic life. Residual
values and useful lives are re-assessed annually and if necessary
changes are recognised prospectively.
(X) ASSET IMPAIRMENT (NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS)
Intangible assets with ﬁnite useful lives and property, plant and
equipment are tested for impairment if events or changes in
circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an
impairment test is conducted, the recoverable amount is
assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of
expected future cash ﬂows (value in use) of the relevant cash
generating unit and the fair value less cost to sell.
Goodwill and other intangible ﬁxed assets with an indeﬁnite
useful life are tested for impairment at least annually.
If a cash generating unit is impaired, provision is made to
reduce the carrying amount of the related assets to their
estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are allocated
ﬁrstly against goodwill, and secondly on a pro rata basis against
intangible and other assets.
Where an impairment loss is recognised against an asset it
may be reversed in future periods where there has been a
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, except
in respect of impairment of goodwill which may not be reversed
in any circumstances.
(XI) INVENTORY
Inventory mainly comprises items of equipment, held for sale or
rental, and consumable items.
Equipment held and consumable items are stated at the
lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions
for obsolescence. Cost is calculated on a ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out basis.
(XII) TERMINATION BENEFITS
Termination beneﬁts are payable when employment is
terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
beneﬁts. The group recognises termination beneﬁts when it is
demonstrably committed to the employees leaving the group.
(XIII) POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The group operates a funded deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme,
which is administered by an independent trustee, for the
majority of its employees.
The group’s net obligation in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt
pension schemes is calculated separately for each scheme by
estimating the amount of future beneﬁt that employees have
earned in return for their service to date. That beneﬁtis
discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of
any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate used is the yield
at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have
maturity dates approximating the terms of the group’s
obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualiﬁed actuary
using the projected unit credit method. The net obligation
recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation less the fair value of the scheme
assets.
The income statement charge is split between an operating
charge and a net ﬁnance charge. The operating charge reﬂects
the service costs which are spread systematically over the
working lives of the employees. The net ﬁnance charge relates
to the unwinding of the discount applied to the liabilities of the
scheme offset by the expected return on the assets of the
scheme, based on conditions prevailing at the start of the year.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period
in which they occur and are presented in the statement of
recognised income and expense.
Actuarial valuations of the main deﬁned beneﬁt scheme are
carried out by an independent actuary as determined by the
trustees at intervals of not more than three years, to determine
the rates of contribution payable. The pension cost is
determined on the advice of the group’s actuary, having regard
to the results of these valuations. In any intervening years, the
actuaries review the continuing appropriateness of the
contribution rates.
The group also operates deﬁned contribution pension
schemes and the income statement is charged with the
contributions payable.
(XIV) SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The group has a number of employee share schemes and share
option plans under which it makes equity settled share based
payments to certain employees. The fair value of options
granted is recognised as an employee expense after taking into
account the company’s best estimate of the number of awards
expected to vest allowing for non market and service conditions.
Fair value is measured at the date of grant and is spread over
the vesting period of the award. The fair value of options
granted is measured using either the Binomial or Monte Carlo
model, whichever is most appropriate to the award. Any
proceeds received are credited to share capital and share

premium when the options are exercised. The group has applied
IFRS 2 ‘Share based payment’ retrospectively to all options
granted after 7 November 2002 and not fully vested at
1 January 2005.
(XV) TAXATION
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, in
respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount
of the group’s assets and liabilities and their tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets
within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group. Any
remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the
basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable
that there will be suitable taxable proﬁts, within the same
jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future against which the
deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected
to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability
settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the income
statement, except when the tax relates to items charged or
credited directly in equity, in which case the tax is also
recognised in equity.
(XVI) DIVIDENDS
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which
they are declared and approved by the company in general
meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
(XVII) PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more
likely than not that an outﬂow of resources will be required to
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is
material.
(XVIII) SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Shares held in the
parent company, BT Group plc, by employee share ownership
trusts and repurchased shares are recorded in the balance sheet
as a deduction from shareholders’ equity at cost.
(XIX) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (TO 31 MARCH 2005)
The accounting policies adopted in respect of ﬁnancial
instruments in periods up to, and including 31 March 2005, are
set out below. However, to provide comparability, certain
classiﬁcation principles have been applied to ﬁnancial assets
and liabilities for periods up to, and including 31 March 2005.
Financial assets are classiﬁed as either ﬁnancial assets at fair
value through the income statement, loans and receivables or
available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets (see below). The classiﬁcation
depends on the purpose for which the investments were
acquired. Management determines the classiﬁcation of its
investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this
designation at each reporting date. Up to 31 March 2005,
ﬁnancial assets in these categories were held at the lower of
cost and net realisable value in accordance with UK GAAP.
Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net proceeds
adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
The effect of the currency element of currency swaps acting
as hedges against ﬁnancial assets and debt is reported
separately in current and non current derivative ﬁnancial
instruments.
Criteria to qualify for hedge accounting
The group considers its derivative ﬁnancial instruments to be
hedges when certain criteria are met. For foreign currency
derivatives, the instrument must be related to actual foreign
currency assets or liabilities or a probable commitment whose
characteristics have been identiﬁed. It must involve the same
currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also
reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the
group’s operations. For interest rate derivatives, the instrument
must be related to assets or liabilities or a probable
commitment, such as a future bond issue, and must also
change the interest rate or the nature of the interest rate by
converting a ﬁxed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Accounting for derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Principal amounts underlying currency swaps are revalued at
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and are
included in current and non-current derivative ﬁnancial
instruments.
Interest differentials, under interest rate swap agreements
used to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates
on borrowings are ﬁxed, are recognised by adjustment of net
ﬁnance expense.
The forward exchange contracts used to change the currency
mix of net debt are revalued to balance sheet rates with net
unrealised gains and losses included in current and non-current
derivative ﬁnancial instruments. The difference between spot
and forward rate for these contracts is recognised as part of net
ﬁnance expense over the term of the contract.
The forward exchange contracts hedging transaction
exposures are revalued at the prevailing forward rate on the
balance sheet date with net unrealised gains and losses being
shown as current and non-current derivative ﬁnancial
instruments.
(XX) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (FROM 1 APRIL 2005)
The following are the key accounting policies used in the
preparation of the restated 1 April 2005 opening balance sheet
and subsequent periods to reﬂect the adoption of IAS 32,
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39,
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
Financial assets
Purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets
All regular way purchases and sales of ﬁnancial assets are
recognised on the settlement date, which is the date that the
asset is delivered to or by the group.
Financial assets at fair value through income statement
A ﬁnancial asset is classiﬁed in this category if acquired
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so
designated by management. Financial assets held in this
category are initially recognised and subsequently measured at
fair value, with changes in value recognised in the income
statement in the line which most appropriately reﬂects the
nature of the item or transaction.
BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 Accounting policies 68 Filename: 824560_04.3d Time: 14:34:09 Date: 20/05/06
Checksum: -437770654
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with
ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market other than:
s those that the group intends to sell immediately or in the
short term, which are classiﬁed as held for trading;
s those for which the group may not recover substantially all of
its initial investment, other than because of credit
deterioration, which are classiﬁed as available for sale.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value
plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, with changes in
carrying value recognised in the income statement in the line
which most appropriately reﬂects the nature of the item or
transaction.
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
Non-derivative ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed as available-for-sale are
either speciﬁcally designated in this category or not classiﬁed in
any of the other categories. Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
are carried at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses (except
for changes in exchange rates for monetary items, interest,
dividends and impairment losses which are recognised in the
income statement) are recognised in equity until the ﬁnancial
asset is derecognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in equity is taken to the income
statement, in the line that most appropriately reﬂects the
nature of the item or transaction.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value, which is
usually the original invoiced amount and subsequently carried
at amortised cost using the effective interest method less
provisions made for doubtful receivables.
Provisions are made speciﬁcally where there is objective
evidence of a dispute or an inability to pay. An additional
provision is made based on an analysis of balances by age,
previous losses experienced and general economic conditions.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current
balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to
insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value and have an original
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash ﬂow statement,
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents
as deﬁned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank
overdrafts are included within loans and other borrowings in
current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a
ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets are impaired.
Where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss
has arisen on assets carried at amortised cost, the carrying
amount is reduced with the loss being recognised in the income
statement. The impairment loss is measured as the difference
between that asset’s carrying amount and the present value of
estimated future cash ﬂows discounted at the ﬁnancial asset’s
original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is only
reversed if it can be related objectively to an event after the
impairment was recognised and is reversed to the extent the
carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at
the date of reversal.
If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising
the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment
and amortisation) and its fair value is transferred from equity to
the income statement. Reversals of impairment losses on debt
instruments are taken through the income statement if the
increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively
related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was
recognised in the income statement. Reversals in respect of
equity instruments classiﬁed as available-for-sale are not
recognised in the income statement.
If there is objective evidence of an impairment loss on an
unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value
because its fair value cannot be objectively measured, or on a
derivative asset that is linked to and must be settled by delivery
of such an unquoted equity instrument, has been incurred, the
amount of loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated
future cash ﬂows discounted at the current market rate of
return for a similar ﬁnancial asset.
Loans and other borrowings
Loans and other borrowings are initially recognised at fair value
plus directly attributable transaction costs. Where loans and
other borrowings contain a separable embedded derivative, the
fair value of the embedded derivative is the difference between
the fair value of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of the
loan or borrowing. The fair value of the embedded derivative
and the loan or borrowing is recorded separately on initial
recognition. Loans and other borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method
and if included in a fair value hedge relationship are revalued to
reﬂect the fair value movements on the hedged risk associated
with the loans and other borrowings.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments mainly to
reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks and interest rate
movements. The group does not hold or issue derivative
ﬁnancial instruments for ﬁnancial trading purposes. However,
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are classiﬁed as held for
trading and initially recognised at cost. Subsequent to initial
recognition, derivative ﬁnancial instruments are stated at fair
value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is
recognised immediately in the income statement in net ﬁnance
expense. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge
accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on
the nature of the hedge. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are
classiﬁed as current assets or current liabilities where they are
not designated in a hedging relationship or have a maturity
period within 12 months. Where derivative ﬁnancial
instruments have a maturity period greater than 12 months and
are designated in a hedge relationship, they are classiﬁed within
either non current assets or non current liabilities.
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or other
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their
risk and characteristics are not closely related to those of host
contracts and host contracts are not carried at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives are
recognised in the income statement in the line which most
appropriately reﬂects the nature of the item or transaction.

Hedge accounting
Cash ﬂow hedge
When a ﬁnancial instrument is designated as a hedge of the
variability in cash ﬂows of a recognised asset or liability, or a
highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or
loss on the derivative ﬁnancial instrument is recognised directly
in equity.
For cash ﬂow hedges of recognised assets or liabilities, the
associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and
recognised in the same line in the income statement in the
same period or periods during which the hedged transaction
affects the income statement.
For highly probable transactions, when the transaction
subsequently results in the recognition of a non-ﬁnancial asset
or non-ﬁnancial liability the associated cumulative gain or loss is
removed from equity and included in the initial cost or carrying
amount of the non-ﬁnancial asset or liability.
If a hedge of a highly probable transaction subsequently
results in the recognition of a ﬁnancial asset or a ﬁnancial
liability, then the associated gains and losses that were
recognised directly in equity are reclassiﬁed into the income
statement in the same period or periods during which the asset
acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness arising on a cash ﬂow hedge of a
recognised asset or liability is recognised immediately in the
same income statement line as the hedged item. Where
ineffectiveness arises on highly probable transactions, it is
recognised in the line which most appropriately reﬂects the
nature of the item or transaction.
Fair value hedge
When a derivative ﬁnancial instrument is designated as a hedge
of the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or
unrecognised ﬁrm commitment, the change in fair value of the
derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are
recorded in the same line in the income statement, together
with any changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability
that is attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of currency
instruments designated as hedges of net investments in a
foreign operation are taken to shareholders’ equity on
consolidation to the extent the hedges are deemed effective.
Any ineffectiveness arising on a hedge of a net investment in a
foreign operation is recognised in net ﬁnance expense.
Discontinuance of hedge accounting
Discontinuance of hedge accounting may occur when a hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the
hedge no longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting or the group
revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged
ﬁnancial asset or liability remains or highly probable transaction
is still expected to occur. Under a cash ﬂow hedge the
cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is
recognised in accordance with the above policy when the
transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer
expected to take place or the underlying hedged ﬁnancial asset
or liability no longer exists, the cumulative unrealised gain or
loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the
income statement. Under a hedge of a net investment the
cumulative gain or loss remains in equity when the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the
hedge no longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting or the group
revokes designation of the hedge relationship. The cumulative
gain or loss is recognised in the income statement as part of the
proﬁt on disposal when the net investment in the foreign
operation is disposed. Under a fair value hedge the cumulative
gain or loss adjustment associated with the hedged risk is
amortised to the income statement using the effective interest
method over the remaining term of the hedged item.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND KEY JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS
requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. It
also requires management to exercise its judgement in the
process of applying the group’s accounting policies. We
continually evaluate our estimates, assumptions and
judgements based on available information and experience. As
the use of estimates is inherent in ﬁnancial reporting, actual
results could differ from these estimates. The areas involving a
higher degree of judgement or complexity are described below.
Interconnect income and payments to other
telecommunications operators
In certain instances BT rely on other operators to measure the
trafﬁc ﬂows interconnecting with our networks. Estimates are
used in these cases to determine the amount of income
receivable from or payments we need to make to these other
operators. The prices at which these services are charged are
often regulated and are subject to retrospective adjustment and
estimates are used in assessing the likely effect of these
adjustments.
Providing for doubtful debts
BT provide services to around 20 million individuals and
businesses, mainly on credit terms. We know that certain debts
due to us will not be paid through the default of a small number
of our customers. Estimates, based on our historical experience
are used in determining the level of debts that we believe will
not be collected. These estimates include such factors as the
current state of the UK economy and particular industry issues.
Goodwill
The recoverable amount of cash-generating units have been
determined based on value in use calculations. These
calculations require the use of estimates.
Useful lives for property, plant and equipment
The plant and equipment in BT’s networks is long-lived with
cables and switching equipment operating for over ten years
and underground ducts being used for decades. The annual
depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated service lives
allocated to each type of asset. Asset lives are assessed annually
and changed when necessary to reﬂect current thinking on their
remaining lives in light of technological change, prospective
economic utilisation and physical condition of the assets
concerned. Changes to service lives of assets implemented from
1 April 2005 had no signiﬁcant impact on the results for the
year ended 31 March 2006.
Property arrangements
As part of the property rationalisation programme we have
identiﬁed a number of surplus properties. Although efforts are
being made to sub-let this space it is recognised that this may
not be possible immediately in the current economic
environment. Estimates have been made of the cost of vacant
possession and any shortfall arising from the sub lease rental
income being lower than the lease costs being borne by BT. Any
such cost or shortfall has been recognised as a provision.
BT Group plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2006 Accounting policies 70 Filename: 824560_04.3d Time: 14:34:09 Date: 20/05/06
Checksum: 1100855728
Long term customer contracts
Long term customer contracts can extend over a number of
ﬁnancial years. During the contractual period, revenue, costs
and proﬁts may be impacted by estimates of the ultimate
proﬁtability of each contract. If, at any time, these estimates
indicate the contract will be unproﬁtable, the entire estimated
loss for the contract is recognised immediately. The company
performs ongoing proﬁtability reviews of its contracts in order
to determine whether the latest estimates require updating.
Key factors reviewed include transaction volumes, or other
inputs, for which we get paid, future staff and third party costs
and anticipated cost productivity, savings and efﬁciencies.
Pension obligations
BT has a commitment, mainly through the BT Pension Scheme,
to pay pension beneﬁts to approximately 354,000 people over
more than 60 years. The cost of these beneﬁts and the present
value of our pension liabilities depend on such factors as the life
expectancy of the members, the salary progression of our
current employees, the return that the pension fund assets will
generate in the time before they are used to fund the pension
payments and the discount rate at which the future pension
payments are discounted. We use estimates for all these factors
in determining the pension costs and liabilities incorporated in
our ﬁnancial statements. The assumptions reﬂect historical
experience and our judgement regarding future expectations.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management
judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised. In
particular, judgement is used when assessing the extent to
which deferred tax assets should be recognised with
consideration given to the timing and level of future taxable
income.
Income tax
The actual tax we pay on our proﬁts is determined according to
complex tax laws and regulations. Where the effect of these
laws and regulations is unclear, we use estimates in determining
the liability for the tax to be paid on our past proﬁts which we
recognise in our ﬁnancial statements. We believe the estimates,
assumptions and judgements are reasonable but this can
involve complex issues which may take a number of years to
resolve. The ﬁnal determination of prior year tax liabilities could
be different from the estimates reﬂected in the ﬁnancial
statements.
Determination of fair values
Certain ﬁnancial instruments are carried on the balance sheet at
fair value, with changes in fair value reﬂected in the income
statement. Fair values are estimated by reference in part to
published price quotations and in part by using valuation
techniques.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, INTERPRETATIONS AND
AMENDMENTS TO PUBLISHED STANDARDS NOT YET EFFECTIVE
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to
existing standards have been published that are mandatory for
the group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April
2006 or later periods, but which the group has not early
adopted. The new standards which are expected to be relevant
to the group’s operations are as follows:
Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 ‘Financial Guarantee
Contracts’ (effective from 1 April 2006)
This amendment requires issued ﬁnancial guarantees, other
than those previously asserted by the entity to be insurance
contracts, to be initially recognised at their fair value and
subsequently measured at the higher of: (a) the unamortised
balance of the related fees received and determined; and (b) the
expenditure required to settle the commitment at the balance
sheet date. Management is currently assessing the impact of
this amendment on the group’s ﬁnancial statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Cash Flow Hedge Accounting of
Forecast Intragroup Transactions’ (effective from
1 April 2006)
This amendment allows the foreign currency risk of a highly
probable forecast intragroup transaction to qualify as a hedged
item in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, provided that: (a)
the transaction is denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency of the entity entering into that transaction;
and (b) the foreign currency risk will affect consolidated proﬁtor
loss. Management does not expect adoption of this amendment
to have a signiﬁcant impact on the group’s ﬁnancial
statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 ‘The Fair Value Option’ (effective
from 1 April 2006)
This amendment changes the deﬁnition of the ﬁnancial
instruments classiﬁed at fair value through the income
statement and restricts the ability to designate ﬁnancial
instruments as part of this category. Management does not
expect adoption of this amendment to have a signiﬁcant impact
on the group’s ﬁnancial statements.
IFRIC 4 ‘Determining whether an arrangement contains a
lease’ (effective from 1 April 2006)
IFRIC 4 requires the determination of whether an arrangement
is or contains a lease to be based on the substance of the
arrangement. Management does not expect adoption of this
interpretation to have a signiﬁcant impact on the group’s
ﬁnancial statements.
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ (effective from
1 April 2007) and amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of
Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures’ (effective from
1 April 2007)
IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures of qualitative and
quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from
ﬁnancial instruments including speciﬁed minimum disclosures
about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including
sensitivity analysis to market risk. The amendment to IAS 1
introduces disclosures about the level of an entity’s capital and
how it manages capital. Management is currently assessing the
impact of IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 on the group’s
ﬁnancial statements.
Amendment to IAS 21 ‘Net Investment in a Foreign
Operation’ (effective from 1 April 2006)
This amendment relaxes the requirement for a monetary item
that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a
foreign operation to be denominated in the functional currency
of either the reporting entity or the foreign operation. It also
clariﬁes the treatment of so called ‘sister company loans’. The
group has assessed the impact of the amendment and
concluded it is not likely to have a signiﬁcant impact on the
group’s ﬁnancial statements.

Checksum: 51642362
IFRIC 7 ‘Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29’
(effective from 1 April 2006)
IFRIC 7 deals with the accounting when an entity identiﬁes the
existence of hyperinﬂation in the economy of its functional
currency and how deferred tax items in the opening balance
sheet should be restated. The group has operations in hyper-
inﬂationary economies. The group has assessed the impact of
the interpretation and concluded it is not likely to have a
signiﬁcant impact on the group’s ﬁnancial statements.
IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’ (effective from 1 April 2007)
IFRIC 8 clariﬁes that transactions within the scope of IFRS 2
‘Share Based Payment’ include those in which the entity cannot
speciﬁcally identify some or all of the goods and services
received. The group has assessed the impact of this
interpretation and has concluded it is not likely to have a
signiﬁcant impact on the group’s ﬁnancial statements.
IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives’ (effective
from 1 April 2007)
IFRIC 9 clariﬁes that an entity should assess whether an
embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host
contract and accounted for as a derivative when the entity ﬁrst
becomes a party to the contract. Subsequent reassessment is
prohibited unless there is a change in the contract terms, in
which case it is required. The group has assessed the impact of
this interpretation and has concluded it is not likely to have a
signiﬁcant impact on the group’s ﬁnancial statements.

1. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Primary reporting format – business segments
The group provides communications services which include networked IT services, local and international telecommunications
services, broadband and internet products and services. The group is organised into three primary business segments; BT Retail,
BT Wholesale and BT Global Services, each with differing risks, rewards and customer proﬁles. Hence these lines of business are
the group’s primary reporting segments. The revenue of each business segment is derived as follows:
BT Retail derives its revenue from the supply of exchange lines and from the calls made over these lines, the leasing of private
circuits and other private services. It also generates revenue from broadband, mobility, data, internet and multimedia services and
from providing managed and packaged communications solutions to customers.
BT Wholesale derives its revenue from providing network services and solutions to communications companies, including ﬁxed and
mobile network operators, ISPs (internet service providers) and other service providers, including other BT lines of business, and
from carrying transit trafﬁc between telecommunications operators.
BT Global Services mainly generates its revenue from the provision of networked IT services, outsourcing and systems integration
work to major corporates and from the ﬁxed network operations of the group’s worldwide subsidiaries.
Other includes the group’s corporate and internal property, vehicle ﬂeet and IT operations.
Openreach was launched on 21 January 2006. We will have completed the separation, conﬁguration and implementation of the
ﬁnancial and operating systems to facilitate the separate reporting of Openreach by the ﬁrst quarter of the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
This is in accordance with the timetable speciﬁed by the Undertakings. Therefore as Openreach is not a discrete segment at
31 March 2006 it is not presented as a separate business segment.
There is extensive trading between BT’s lines of business and the line of business proﬁtability is dependent on the transfer price
levels. For regulated products and services those transfer prices are market based whilst for other products and services the transfer
prices are agreed between the relevant lines of business. These intra-group trading arrangements are subject to periodic review.

policies). This is consistent with the way that ﬁnancial performance is measured by management and we believe assists in providing
a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.

The directors are proposing that a ﬁnal dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2006 of 7.6 pence per share will be paid to
shareholders on 11 September 2006, taking the full year proposed dividend in respect of the 2006 ﬁnancial year to 11.9 pence
(2005: 10.4 pence). This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and therefore the liability
of £632 million (2005: £551 million) has not been included in these ﬁnancial statements. The proposed dividend will be payable to
all shareholders on the Register of Members on 18 August 2006.
8. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average
number of shares in issue after deducting the company’s shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.
In calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential ordinary shares have been taken
into account where the impact of these is dilutive. Options over 52 million shares (2005: 207 million shares) were excluded from
the calculation of the total diluted number of shares as the impact of these is anti-dilutive.
The weighted average number of shares in the years were:

The group has a cross undertaking guarantee facility across certain bank accounts which allows a legally enforceable right of set off
of the relevant cash and overdraft balances on bank accounts included within the scheme. At 31 March 2006, overdraft balances of
£171 million had a legally enforceable right of set off against cash balances of £209 million. These balances have not been netted
above as settlement is not intended to take place simultaneously or on a net basis.
10. NET DEBT
Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents. Loans and other
borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt. For the purpose
of this analysis current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
This deﬁnition of net debt measures balances at the future cash ﬂows due to arise on maturity of ﬁnancial instruments and
removes the balance sheet adjustments made from the re-measurement of hedged risks under fair value hedges and the use of the
amortised cost method as required by IAS 39. In addition, the gross balances are adjusted to take account of netting arrangements
amounting to £171 million. Net debt is a non GAAP measure since it is not deﬁned in IFRS but it is a key indicator used by
management in order to assess operational performance.

Free cash ﬂow is deﬁned as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents less cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities (excluding
interest paid) and less the acquisition or disposal of group undertakings. It is a non-GAAP measure since it is not deﬁned in IFRS
but it is a key indicator used by management in order to assess operational performance.

Impairment tests of goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing the group’s cash
generating units are considered to be the business segments. Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units as follows:
2006 2005
£m £m
BT Global Services 488 360
BT Retail 55 44
543 404
The recoverable amount of each cash generating unit (CGU) is based on value in use calculations. These are determined using cash
ﬂow projections derived from ﬁnancial budgets approved by the board covering a ﬁve year period. They reﬂect management’s
expectation of revenue growth, operating costs and margin for each CGU based on past experience. Cash ﬂows beyond the ﬁve
year period have been extrapolated using estimated terminal growth rates ranging from 0% to 2%. These rates have been
determined with regard to projected growth rates for the speciﬁc markets in which the CGU participates and are not considered to
exceed the long term average growth rates for those markets. Discount rates applied to the cash ﬂow forecasts are derived from
the group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital for non-regulated products of 11.4%.
The forecasts are most sensitive to changes in projected revenue growth rates in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of the forecast period.
However there is signiﬁcant headroom and based on the sensitivity analysis performed we have concluded that no reasonably
possible changes in the base case assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.

The group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 April 2005. The group previously recognised the currency value of derivatives against the loans and other borrowings balance. These recognised
amounts have been reclassified in the comparative period as derivative financial instruments. In addition, the underlying borrowing is stated based on previously applied UK GAAP at the amount of
net proceeds adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt (see accounting policies).
b
The interest rate payable on these notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody’s or Standard and Poor’s (S&P) reduces the rating ascribed to the group’s senior unsecured
debt below A3 in the case of Moody’s or below A minus in the case of S&P. In this event, the interest rate payable on the notes and the spread applicable to the floating notes will be increasedby
0.25% for each ratings category adjustment by each rating agency. In addition, if Moody’s or S&P subsequently increase the ratings ascribed to the group’s senior unsecured debt, then the interest
rate then payable on notes and the spread applicable to the floating notes will be decreased by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by each rating agency, but in no event will the interest rate
be reduced below the minimum interest rate reflected in the above table.
c

d

Commercial paper is denominated in sterling (£35 million), US dollar (£66 million) and euro (£371 million).
The interest rates payable on loans and borrowings disclosed above reﬂect the coupons on underlying issued loans and borrowings
and not the interest rates achieved through applying associated currency and interest rate swaps in hedge arrangements.
The carrying values disclosed above for the current year reﬂect balances at amortised cost adjusted for deferred and current fair
value adjustments to the relevant loans or borrowing’s hedged risk in a fair value hedge. This does not reﬂect the ﬁnal principal
repayment that will arise after taking account of the relevant derivatives in hedging relationships which is reﬂected in the table
below. Apart from ﬁnance leases all borrowings as at 31 March 2006 are unsecured.

The group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 April 2005. The group previously recognised the currency value of derivatives against the hedged financial instrument or within other receivables and
other payables. These recognised amounts have been reclassified in the comparative period as derivative financial instruments. As the balances in the comparative period only reflect the currency
fair value of those instruments they are not directly comparable with those amounts disclosed in the 2006 financial year (see accounting policies).

22. DEFERRED TAXATION continued
At 31 March 2006 the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of
which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to £21.8 billion. The group’s capital losses and other temporary
differences have no expiry date restrictions. The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of
the various territories in which the losses arise. A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out
below:

Capital losses 18,311 No expiry

Total unrestricted losses 20,688
Total 21,795
At the balance sheet date, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was £8.6 billion. No deferred tax liabilities have been
recognised in respect of those unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these
temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Temporary differences
arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insigniﬁcant.

The cash flow reserve is used to record the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet
occurred.
c
The available-for-sale reserve is used to record the cumulative fair value gains and losses on available for sale financial assets. The cumulative gains and losses are recycled to the income statement
on disposal of the assets. The gross gain in the period amounted to £35 million.
d
The translation reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the assets and liabilities of foreign operations. The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income
statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
e
The merger reserve arose on the group reorganisation that occurred in November 2001 and represents the difference between the nominal value of shares in the new parent company, BT Group

Total future minimum operating lease payments 9,782 10,184
Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of land and buildings. Leases have an average term of 25 years and rentals
are ﬁxed for an average of 25 years.
At 31 March 2006, other than disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the
ordinary course of the group’s business and on these no material losses are anticipated. The group has insurance cover to certain
limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on
19 November 2001. O2 plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees. The maximum likely exposure is US$72 million
(£42 million) as at 31 March 2006, although this could increase by a further US$545 million (£314 million) in the event of credit
default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations. The guarantee lasts until O2 UK Ltd has discharged all its
obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the
ﬁnancial position or results of operations of the group.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the
Italian UMTS auction. Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process. On 20 July 2005, the former
BT employee was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the Rome Public Prosecutor. All the other defendents were
also acquitted. The Public Prosecutor is in the process of appealing the courts decision. If the appeal is successful, BT could be held
liable, with others, for any damages. The company has concluded that it would not be appropriate to make a provision in respect
of any such claim.
The European Commission is formally investigating the way the UK Government has set BT’s property rates and those paid by
Kingston Communications. The Commission is examining whether the Government has complied with EC Treaty rules on state aid
in assessing BT’s rates. BT’s rates were set by the Valuation Ofﬁce after lengthy discussions based on well established principles, in
a transparent process. In BT’s view, any allegation of state aid is groundless and BT is conﬁdent that the Government will
demonstrate the fairness of the UK ratings system. A ﬁnding against HM Government could result in BT having to repay any
amount of state aid it may be determined to have received. The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a
provision in respect of any such potential ﬁnding.

29. RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
Background
The group offers retirement plans to its employees. The group’s main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS), is a deﬁned beneﬁt
scheme where the beneﬁts are based on employees’ length of service and ﬁnal pensionable pay. The BTPS is funded through a
legally separate trustee administered fund. This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a
deﬁned contribution scheme. Under this deﬁned contribution scheme the income statement charge represents the contribution
payable by the group based upon a ﬁxed percentage of employees’ pay. The total pension costs of the group, included within the
staff costs, in the year was £603 million (2005: £540 million), of which £552 million (2005: £507 million) related to the group’s
main deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the BTPS.
The increase in the pension cost in the 2006 ﬁnancial year principally reﬂects the introduction part way through the 2005
ﬁnancial year of Smart Pensions, a salary sacriﬁce scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee contributions
and for the company to make additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay. As a result there has been
a switch between wages and salaries and pension costs of £19 million in the year.
The pension cost applicable to the group’s main deﬁned contribution scheme in the year ended 31 March 2006 was £19 million
(2005: £11 million) and £2 million (2005: £1 million) of contributions to the scheme were outstanding at 31 March 2006.
The group occupies two properties owned by the BTPS scheme on which an annual rental of £2 million is payable. The BTPS
assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, ﬁxed interest and index linked securities, deposits and
short-term investments. At 31 March 2006, the UK equities included 15 million (2005: 17 million) ordinary shares of the company
with a market value of £33 million (2005: £36 million).
IAS 19 accounting valuation
In accordance with the amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Beneﬁts’ the disclosures below are provided prospectively from the 2005
ﬁnancial year onwards. BT has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows:
– scheme assets are measured at market value at the balance sheet date;
– scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality
corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability; and
– actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the income statement, in retained
earnings and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The ﬁnancial assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial accounting valuations of the BTPS under IAS 19 at 31 March
2006 are:

The assumption for the expected return in scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return for each
asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year. The expected returns on ﬁxed interest and
interest linked securities are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year. Expected returns on equities and
property are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above, yields on government bonds and consensus
economic forecasts of future returns. The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the
obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net ﬁnance income.

The group expects to contribute approximately £630 million to the BTPS, including £232 million of deﬁciency contributions, in the
2007 ﬁnancial year.
The mortality assumption has been updated to reﬂect experience and expected future improvements in life expectancy. The
average life expectancy assumptions, after retirement at 60 years of age, are as follows:

Number of years Number of years
Male 23.8 23.3

Funding valuation
A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualiﬁed independent actuary, using the
projected unit credit method. The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future
contributions should be sufﬁcient to meet future liabilities. The triennial valuation as at 31 December 2005, is currently being
performed and reviewed in the context of recent regulatory developments and the impact of the Crown Guarantee granted on
privatisation in 1984. Until that concludes contributions will continue to be paid in accordance with the 2002 funding plan. The
contributions for the 2005 and 2006 ﬁnancial years were based on the 31 December 2002 valuation. The funding valuation is
performed at 31 December because this is the ﬁnancial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows:
– scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date; and,
– scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return
reﬂecting the assets of the scheme.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions:

29. RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS continued
At 31 December 2002, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of £22.8 billion (1999: £29.7 billion) and were sufﬁcient to
cover 91.6% (1999: 96.8%) of the beneﬁts accrued by that date, after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries
but not taking into account the costs of providing incremental pension beneﬁts for employees leaving under release schemes since
that date. This represents a funding deﬁcit of £2.1 billion compared to £1.0 billion at 31 December 1999. The funding valuation
uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuary’s view of the median estimate basis, the
funding deﬁcit would have been reduced to £0.4 billion. Although the market value of equity investments had increased and the
investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the beneﬁts paid by £0.3 billion in the three years ended
31 December 2002, the deﬁcit has not improved by the same amount as the liabilities have been calculated on a more prudent
basis. As a result of the triennial funding valuation the group agreed to make employer’s contributions at a rate of 12.2% of
pensionable pay from April 2006 and annual deﬁciency payments of £232 million. This compared to the employer’s contribution
rate of 11.6% and annual deﬁciency payments of £200 million that were determined under the 1999 funding valuation.
In the year ended 31 March 2006, the group made regular contributions of £396 million (2005: £376 million). Additional
special contributions were paid for enhanced pension beneﬁts to leavers in the year ended 31 December 2004 of £nil (2005:
£6 million). Deﬁciency contributions of £54 million were also made (2005: £nil) as a result of the early payment of £380 million
made in the 2004 ﬁnancial year that was scheduled for payment in subsequent years.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS, the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the
deﬁcit over a maximum period of 20 years. The agreed funding plan addresses the deﬁcit over a period of 15 years. The group will
continue to make deﬁciency payments until the deﬁcit is made good. The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and
the age proﬁle of active members will consequently increase. Under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost, as a
proportion of the active members’ pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach
retirement. Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment proﬁle extends over more than 60 years.

The total charge recognised in the income statement for the year in respect of share based payment plans was £76 million
(2005: £50 million). The total value of share options and awards granted in the year ended 31 March 2006 was £64 million (2005:
£77 million).
The company has an employee share investment plan and savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of
participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected employees and an employee stock purchase plan for employees in
the United States. It also has several share plans for executives. All share based payment plans are equity settled and details of
these plans are provided below.
Share option plans
BT Group Employee Sharesave plans
There is an HM Revenue and Customs-approved savings related share option plan, under which employees save on a monthly
basis, over a three or ﬁve year period, towards the purchase of shares at a ﬁxed price determined when the option is granted. This
price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for ﬁve year plans and 10% for three year plans. The options must be
exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse. Options are granted annually, usually in June.
Similar plans operate for BT’s overseas employees.
Employees may cancel sharesave options and remain employed by the group. In such cases the options so cancelled do not vest
and the monthly savings contributions are returned to the employee, with interest if applicable. Such events are accounted for by
ceasing to record a share based payments charge from the date of the employee’s withdrawal from the relevant plan. Previously
recorded compensation expense is not reversed, and no charge is made for the accelerated vesting of future options that will not
now vest.

Options were exercised regularly throughout the year. The weighted average option price of options exercised during the year was
205p (2005: 183p).
The weighted average fair value of savings related share options granted during the year ended 31 March 2006 has been
estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used in
that model: an expected life extending three months later than the ﬁrst exercise date; share price at date of grant of 223p;
estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5% (2005: 5%); risk free interest rates of approximately 4% (2005: 5%); and
expected volatility of approximately 25% (2005: 25%). Volatility has been determined by reference to BT’s historical volatility over
a three-year period, which is expected to reﬂect the share price of BT in the future. The exercise prices are 192p for Sharesave
options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 171p for Sharesave options exercisable ﬁve years after the date of grant.
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 March 2006 was 44p (2005: 41p) for Sharesave
options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 55p (2005: 52p) for Sharesave options exercisable ﬁve years after the
date of grant.
Options granted under BT’s international sharesave, which is a three-year plan, have been valued using the same assumptions.
The weighted average fair value of these share options is 49p (2005: 52p). The exercise price is 171p, and the share price at date
of grant was 214p.
Global Share Option Plan (GSOP)
There were no options granted under the GSOP in the 2006 ﬁnancial year. The options granted in previous years will be
exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets. These options were valued using Monte
Carlo Simulations. The weighted average fair value of options granted under the 2005 GSOP was estimated as 36p. The following
weighted average assumptions were used in that model: dividend yield of 5%, expected volatility of 25% and risk free interest rates
of 4%. Details of this plan are provided in the Report on directors’ remuneration.
BT Group Legacy Option Plan
On the demerger of O2, BT’s share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar BT Group Employee Sharesave
plans and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
The BT Group Legacy Option Plan was launched on 17 December 2001 following the scheme of arrangement and demerger of
O2 in November 2001, and is therefore outside the scope of IFRS 2. Replacement unapproved options over BT Group shares were
granted to all participants in the executive option plans who had released their options over British Telecommunications plc shares.
The value of the replacement options was determined by averaging the combined prices of BT Group plc and O2 plc shares over
the 20 dealing days following the demerger on 19 November 2001. This resulted in a factor of 1.3198 being applied to the former
option over British Telecommunications plc shares in order to give the number of BT Group shares under the new option. The
option prices of the original options were also adjusted to take account of the different number of shares under option. The options
are exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets, on the third anniversary of the date
of grant.
For options outstanding at 31 March 2006 and 2005 in respect of the BT Global Share Option Plan and the BT Group Legacy
Option Plan, the weighted average exercise prices are shown below.

Other share based payment plans
Incentive Share Plan, Deferred Bonus Plan and Retention Share Plan
The BT Group Incentive Share Plan (ISP) and the BT Group Retention Share Plan (RSP) were introduced for employees of the group
in 2001. Under the plans, company shares are conditionally awarded to participants.
Under the ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the
relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure and if the participants are still employed by the group. The corporate
performance measure is BT’s total shareholder return (TSR) measured against a group of companies from the European Telecom
Sector at the beginning of the relevant performance period. The ISP was operated in the 2006 ﬁnancial year with 1,382
participants receiving awards over 23,183,408 shares (2005: 1,406 participants received awards over 12,654,013 shares). Awards
under the ISP have been valued using Monte Carlo Simulations. TSRs were generated for BT and the comparator group at the end
of the three-year performance period, using each company’s volatility and dividend yield, as well as the cross correlations between
pairs of stocks. Simulations were run using averaged one and three-year volatility and dividend yield for BT and the comparator
group. The weighted average fair value of awards of shares granted under the ISP has been estimated at 124p (2005: 98p).

Historical dividend yields of 4.8% and 4.1% and volatility of 18% and 24% were used in the one-year and three-year models
respectively.
Under the RSP, the length of retention period before awards vest is ﬂexible. Awards may vest in annual tranches. The shares are
transferred at the end of a speciﬁed period, only if the participant is still employed by the group. During the 2006 ﬁnancial year
1,107,330 shares vested in 16 participants in the RSP (2005: 1,340,256 shares vested in 11 participants).
The BT Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) was established in 1998 and awards are granted annually to selected employees of the
group. Under this plan, shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continued to be
employed by the group throughout that period. On 1 August 2005, 1,966,496 shares (2 August 2004: 1,280,934 shares) were
transferred to 193 participants (2 August 2004: 219 participants) at the end of the three-year deferred period. At 31 March 2006,
24.7 million shares (2005: 27.8 million shares) in the company were held in trust for employee share plans, of which 12.4 million
shares (2005: 12.7 million shares) were held for the ISP, 2.9 million shares (2005: 2.8 million shares) were held for the RSP and
5.9 million shares (2005: 7.9 million shares) were held for the DBP. In accordance with the terms of the plans, dividends or
dividend equivalents earned on the shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential beneﬁt
of the participants.
Awards under the DBP and RSP were valued by reference to the weighted average market price of the shares on the date of
grant of 223p and 216p respectively.
Employee Share Investment Plan
The BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan (ESIP) has been in operation since December 2001. The ESIP, which has been
approved by HM Revenue & Customs, comprises ‘directshare’ and ‘allshare’. Under directshare, UK employees are given an
opportunity to purchase shares (partnership shares) out of pre-tax salary up to a maximum value of £1,500 per year. During the
2006 ﬁnancial year, 6.4 million shares (2005: 6.1 million shares), including 0.8 million shares (2005: 0.2 million shares) purchased
by dividend reinvestment, were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf of 14,443 (2005: 13,017) employees at a total cost
of £13.7 million (2005: £11.7 million). Allshare, the free shares element of the ESIP allows BT to provide free shares to UK
employees which are held in trust for at least three years. Employees outside the UK receive cash awards equivalent to the value of
the free shares. In 2006, 1% (2005: 0.5%) of pre-tax proﬁts, amounting to £22 million, was allocated to allshare (2005: £11
million). Up to 2% of pre-tax proﬁts would have been available subject to meeting two corporate performance targets; one of these
to maintain earnings per share at the same level as in the 2005 ﬁnancial year, and the other to have ﬁve percent more customers
very or extremely satisﬁed with BT (provided the percentage of customers who are dissatisﬁed did not increase compared with the
2005 ﬁnancial year). The earnings per share target was met but not the one for customer satisfaction. The ESIP replaced the BT
Employee Share Ownership Scheme which operated for employee proﬁt sharing until 2001.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), for employees in the US, enables participants to purchase American
Depositary Shares (ADS) quarterly at a price (the Initial Base Option Price) which is 85% of the fair market price of an ADS at the
start of the Initial Enrolment Period (or, in the case of employees who enrol in the ESPP after the Initial Enrolment Period, 85% of
the fair market price of an ADS on the last business day of the calendar quarter immediately following enrolment). From 15 May
2005 to 15 May 2006, 1,750,560 shares (175,056 ADSs) have been transferred to participants out of treasury under the ESPP
(from 15 May 2004 to 15 May 2005, 934,782 shares (93,478 ADSs)). The third offer, with an Initial Base Option Price of
US$31.52 ended in December 2005. A fourth offer was launched in December 2005 with an Initial Base Option Price of US$32.53
and will expire in December 2006.

32. AUDIT SERVICES continued
Total fees paid or payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in the UK for non audit services in the year ended 31 March 2006 were
£3,015,000 (2005: £5,171,000).
In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non audit services
can be provided by the company’s external auditors and the approval processes related to them. Under those policies work of a
consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efﬁciencies and value added beneﬁts to the
company.
BT’s regulatory obligations require it to publish audited regulatory ﬁnancial statements. The fees for regulatory work principally
reﬂect the audit fees associated with those regulatory ﬁnancial statements. The fees for tax services include tax compliance and tax
advisory services.
33. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The group adopted IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement’ with effect from 1 April 2005. Financial information was previously prepared under UK GAAP for the ﬁnancial
year ended 31 March 2005. Where applicable, information for the comparative period has been separately disclosed below in order
to comply with the previous requirements of UK GAAP.
The group issues or holds ﬁnancial instruments mainly to ﬁnance its operations; for the temporary investment of short-term
funds; and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of ﬁnance. In addition,
various ﬁnancial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the group’s operations.
The group ﬁnances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained proﬁts, deferred taxation, long-term
loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper supported by a committed borrowing facility. The group
borrows in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies. Typically, but not exclusively, the bond markets provide the most
cost-effective means of long-term borrowing. The group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to
market risks from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates against these borrowings. The derivatives used for this purpose
are principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The group also uses ﬁnancial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from its overseas short-term
investment funds and other non-UK assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments. The ﬁnancial instruments used comprise
borrowings in foreign currencies and forward currency contracts and interest and cross currency swaps.
The group does not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments for trading purposes. All transactions in derivative ﬁnancial
instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
The group’s proﬁle of borrowings and short-term funds is managed with consideration of the cash ﬂow from operations. These
borrowings and short term funds are managed by the centralised treasury operation. The types of ﬁnancial instrument used for
investment of short-term funds are prescribed in group treasury policies with limits on the exposure to any one organisation. Short-
term investment in ﬁnancial instruments is partially undertaken on behalf of the group by substantial external fund managers who
are limited to dealing in debt instruments and certain deﬁned derivative instruments and are given strict guidelines on credit,
diversiﬁcation and maturity proﬁles.
The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investment and the group’s
ﬁnancial risk, including risk from volatility in currency and interest rates and counterparty credit risk. The treasury operation is not
a proﬁt centre and the objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The Board sets the policy for the group’s centralised treasury operation and its activities are subject to a set of controls
commensurate with the magnitude of the borrowings and investments under its management. Counterparty credit risk is closely
monitored and managed within controls set by the Board.
During the year ended 31 March 2006 the group’s net debt (note 10) reduced from £7.9 billion to £7.5 billion mainly due to
operational and working capital inﬂows. During the 2006 ﬁnancial year two substantial notes matured, namely the 2005 US dollar
7.875% notes and 2006 Euro 6.375% notes amounting to £3.8 billion and were primarily funded from current ﬁnancial assets and
cash and cash equivalents. The group utilised its commercial paper programme during the year, which was supported by a
committed borrowing facility, as well as raising a sterling ﬂoating rate borrowing of £1 billion.
During the year ended 31 March 2005, the group’s net debt reduced from £8.5 billion to £7.9 billion mainly from working
capital inﬂows and proceeds from the sale of investments. During the 2005 ﬁnancial year, the group restructured some of its
swaps portfolio. As a result, the group terminated cross currency and interest rate swaps with a total nominal of £2.9 billion. A
number of new swaps were transacted which had the same risk management objective as some of those swaps which were
terminated. This resulted in the group paying £107 million in reducing gross debt and receiving a net £14 million of interest
receipts. The interest receipts and payments on restructuring were included within deferred income and other debtors respectively
and were to be amortised to the income statement over the term of the underlying hedged debt. Upon adoption of IAS 32 and
IAS 39 from 1 April 2005, a portion of the interest payments on restructuring was written off to reserves.
There has been no change in the nature of the group’s risk proﬁle between 31 March 2006 and the date of these ﬁnancial
statements.
Interest rate risk management
The group has interest bearing ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities. The group’s policy is to ensure that at least 70% of net debt
is at ﬁxed rates. In order to manage this proﬁle, the group has entered into interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks
and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are ﬁxed. Under interest rate swaps,
the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at speciﬁed intervals, the differences between ﬁxed rate and ﬂoating rate interest
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.

Checksum: -561928449
33. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT continued
The majority of the group’s long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to ﬁxed sterling interest rates after applying the
impact of hedging instruments. At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional
principal amounts totalling £5.1 billion compared to £5.3 billion at 31 March 2005.
At 31 March 2006, the group’s ﬁxed:ﬂoating interest rate proﬁle, after hedging, on net debt was 86:14 (2005: 95:5).
Based on the composition of net debt at 31 March 2006, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the
group’s annual net ﬁnance expense by approximately £10 million. This is consistent with the position at 31 March 2005.
Foreign exchange risk management
The purpose of the group’s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inﬂows
and net outﬂows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
Most of the group’s current revenue is invoiced in pounds sterling, and most of its operations and costs arise within the UK. The
group’s foreign currency borrowings which totalled £5.4 billion at 31 March 2006, are used to ﬁnance its operations. The
borrowings have been predominantly swapped to sterling. Cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts have been entered
into to reduce the foreign currency exposure on the group’s operations and the group’s net assets. The group also enters into
forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases and purchase and sale
commitments on a selective basis. The commitments hedged are principally US dollar and euro denominated. As a result of these
policies, the group’s exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on the residual currency exposure on its non-UK investments in its
subsidiaries and on imbalances between the value of outgoing and incoming international calls.
A 10% strengthening in sterling against major currencies would cause the group’s net assets at 31 March 2006 to fall by less
than £150 million, with an insigniﬁcant effect on the group’s proﬁts. This is consistent with the position at 31 March 2005.
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding contracts to sell or purchase foreign currency with a total gross notional principal
of £6.4 billion (2005: £9.8 billion). The majority of these instruments were cross currency swaps with a remaining term ranging
from 1 to 25 years. The values of forward currency contracts included in the gross notional principal at 31 March 2006 were
£809 million (2005: £427 million) for purchases of currency and £781 million (2005: £782 million) for sales of currency. The
forward currency contracts had a term remaining ranging from three to 364 days.
Credit risk management
The group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk. The group, however, is exposed to credit-related
losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to ﬁnancial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to
meet their obligations. The group limits the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. Where multiple transactions are
undertaken with a single counterparty, or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into a netting arrangement to
reduce the group’s exposure to credit risk. Currently the group makes use of standard International Swaps and Derivative
Association (ISDA) documentation. In addition, where management have a legal right of set off and the ability and intention to
settle net, the relevant asset and liabilities are netted within the balance sheet. The group seeks collateral or other security where it
is considered necessary.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the group’s ﬁnancial assets at 31 March 2006 is represented by the amounts reported
under the corresponding balance sheet headings.
Liquidity risk management
The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into long and short term ﬁnancial instruments to support operational and
other funding requirements. The group’s liquidity and funding management process includes projecting cash ﬂows and considering
the level of liquid assets in relation thereto, monitoring balance sheet liquidity and maintaining a diverse range of funding sources
and back-up facilities. Liquid assets surplus to immediate operating requirements of the group are generally invested and managed
by the centralised treasury function. Requirements of group companies for operating ﬁnance are met whenever possible from
central resources.The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate committed borrowing facilities. During the year the
group utilised its commercial paper programme which was supported by a committed borrowing facility of up to £1,535 million
(2005: £145 million). Of this total, £1,500 million of the borrowing facility is available for a period of ﬁve years. Reﬁnancing risk is
managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any speciﬁed period.
Price risk management
The group has limited exposure to equity securities price risk on investments held by the group.
Hedging activities
The group entered into a combination of interest rate and cross currency swaps designated as a combination of fair value and cash
ﬂow hedges in order to hedge certain risks associated with the the group’s US dollar and euro borrowings. The risks being hedged
consist of currency cash ﬂows associated with future interest and principal payments and the fair value risk of certain elements of
borrowings arising from ﬂuctuations in currency rates and interest rates.
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements in cash ﬂow hedges against borrowings with a
total notional principal amount of £3.2 billion. The fair value of these interest rate swaps at the balance sheet date comprised
liabilities of £405 million. The interest rate swaps have a remaining term ranging from four to 25 years to match the underlying
hedged cash ﬂows arising on the borrowings consisting of annual and semi-annual interest payments. The interest receivable under
these swap contracts are at a weighted average rate of 4.6% and interest payable are at a weighted average rate of 5.9%.

Checksum: -583679447
33. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT continued
At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding cross currency swap agreements in cash ﬂow and fair value hedges against
borrowings with a total notional principal amount of £4.8 billion. The fair value of these cross currency swaps at the balance sheet
date comprised £32 million assets and £433 million liabilities. The cross currency swaps have a remaining term ranging from one
to 25 years to match the underlying hedged borrowings consisting of annual and semi-annual interest payments. The interest
receivable under these swap contracts are at a weighted average rate of 8.0% and interest payable are at a weighted average rate
of 8.5%.
Forward currency contracts have been designated as cash ﬂow hedges of currency cash ﬂows associated with certain euro and
US dollar step up interest payments on bonds. At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a
total notional principal amount of £77 million. The fair value of the forward currency contracts at the balance sheet date comprised
an asset of £1 million and had a remaining term of between three and 11 months after which they will be rolled into new contracts.
The hedged interest cash ﬂows arise on a semi-annual basis and extend over a period of up to 12 years.
Spot movements on forward currency contracts have been designated as cash ﬂow hedges of currency cash ﬂows associated
with certain euro and US dollar commercial paper issues. At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts
with a total notional principal amount of £434 million. The fair value of the forward currency contracts at the balance sheet date
comprised assets of £6 million and had a remaining term of between one and two months to match the cash ﬂows on maturity of
the underlying commercial paper.
Spot movements on forward currency contracts have been designated as cash ﬂow hedges against spot movements on currency
cash ﬂows associated with the forecast purchase of ﬁxed assets and invoice cash ﬂows arising on certain dollar denominated
supplies. At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional principal amount of
£6 million assets and £197 million liabilities and a remaining term of less than one month after which they will be rolled into new
contracts. The forecast cash ﬂows are anticipated to arise over a period of one month to six years from the balance sheet date.
The group has hedged spot movements on currency cash ﬂows associated with US dollar denominated investments using
forward currency contracts. At 31 March 2006, the group had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional
principal amount of £759 million. The fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts at the balance sheet date comprised
liabilities of £5 million and had a remaining term of less than one month.
Other derivatives
At 31 March 2006, the group recognised the fair value of an option contained in a supplier contract which required separate
recognition. The option allows the supplier to acquire a certain share in one of the group’s investments based on the volume of
trade. In addition, two embedded derivatives expired during the year. The ﬁrst related to an option exercisable on the group’sUS
dollar convertible bond (see note 5) and the second related to a put option whose value was based on an underlying interest
differential between sterling ﬁxed and ﬂoating interest rates.
At 31 March 2006, the group held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts that were not in hedging
relationships in accordance with IAS 39. Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and
sales and had a notional principal amount of £16 million assets and £101 million liabilities as at 31 March 2006 and a maturity
period of under 12 months. Interest rate swaps not in hedging relationships under IAS 39 had a notional principal amount of
£1.9 billion at 31 March 2006 and mature between 2014 and 2030. The interest receivable under these swap contracts are at a
weighted average rate of 6.1% and interest payable are at a weighted average rate of 7.7%. The volatility arising from these swaps
is recognised through the income statement but is limited due to a natural offset in their valuation movements.
Fair value of ﬁnancial instruments
The following table discloses the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the group’s ﬁnancial instruments which are not carried
at an amount which approximates to its fair value on the balance sheet at 31 March 2006 and 2005. The carrying amounts are
included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings. The fair value of the ﬁnancial instruments are the amounts at
which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or
sale. In particular, the fair values of listed investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments. The
carrying amount of the short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the
investments held. The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximated to their fair values due to the short
maturity of the amounts receivable and payable. The fair value of the group’s bonds, debentures, notes, ﬁnance leases and other
long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same
maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ﬂows using the appropriate discount rates in
effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist. The fair value of the group’s outstanding
swaps and foreign exchange contracts where the estimated amounts, calculated using discounted cash ﬂow models, that the group
would receive or pay in order to terminate such contracts in an arms length transaction taking into account market rates of interest
and foreign exchange of the balance sheet date.

34. EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS
These are the group’s ﬁrst consolidated ﬁnancial statements prepared in accordance with EU-adopted IFRS.
The accounting policies set out on pages 65 to 72 have been applied in preparing the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended
31 March 2006, the comparative information for the year ended 31 March 2005 and the preparation of an opening balance sheet
at 1 April 2004, the group’s date of transition. IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ and IAS 32,
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ have not been applied to the comparative periods because the group has
taken a transitional exemption and adopted these standards prospectively from 1 April 2005.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the group has made adjustments to amounts previously reported in its ﬁnancial
statements under UK GAAP. IFRS and UK GAAP are not directly comparable. An explanation of how the transition from previous
UK GAAP to IFRS has affected the group’s ﬁnancial position is set out below.

34. EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS continued
First Time adoption exemptions applied
IFRS 1, ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ sets out the transitional rules which must be applied
when IFRS is applied for the ﬁrst time. The group is required to select accounting policies in accordance with IFRS valid at its ﬁrst
IFRS reporting date and apply those policies retrospectively. The standard sets out certain mandatory exceptions to retrospective
application and certain optional exemptions. The exemptions adopted by the group are as set out below.
Business combinations: the group has elected not to apply IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’ retrospectively to business
combinations that occurred before the date of transition (1 April 2004).
Employee beneﬁts: the group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses from employee beneﬁts schemes
at the date of transition. All subsequent actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in full in the period in which they occur in
the statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with IAS 19, ‘Employee Beneﬁts’ (as amended on
16 December 2004).
Share based payments: the group has elected to apply IFRS 2, ‘Share Based Payment’ retrospectively to all equity instruments
granted after 7 November 2002 and which were not fully vested as at 1 January 2005.
Cumulative translation differences: the group has elected to reset the foreign currency translation reserve to zero at the
transition date. Any gains and losses on subsequent disposals of foreign operations will exclude any translation differences arising
prior to the date.
Financial instruments: the group has chosen to utilise the exemption from the requirements to restate comparative information
for IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement’, and hence these standards have been applied prospectively as of 1 April 2005.
NOTES TO EXPLAIN THE EFFECTS OF IFRS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(a) Employee beneﬁts
Under UK GAAP, the group previously measured pension commitments and other related post-retirement beneﬁts in accordance
with SSAP 24, ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’ with additional disclosures provided in accordance with FRS 17, ‘Retirement
Beneﬁts’. Under IFRS the group measures pension commitments and other related post-retirement beneﬁts in accordance with
IAS 19, ‘Employee Beneﬁts’.
Under IAS 19 the income statement charge is split between an operating charge and a net ﬁnance charge. The net ﬁnance
charge relates to the unwinding of the discount applied to the liabilities of the scheme offset by the expected return on the assets
of the scheme, based on conditions prevailing at the start of the year. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in
reserves.
Under SSAP 24, the asset on the balance sheet represented the timing differences between the pension charge recognised in
the proﬁt and loss account and the payments made to the pension scheme. Under IAS 19, the liability on the balance sheet
represents the deﬁcit in the pension scheme. The scheme assets are valued at market value and the liabilities are discounted using
a high quality corporate bond rate.
Under SSAP 24, pension charges for the year ended 31 March 2005 were £465 million, including a charge for the amortisation
of the SSAP 24 deﬁcit in the BTPS, and an interest credit relating to the balance sheet prepayment. Under IAS 19 the total charges
for the year ended 31 March 2005 were £342 million, split between an operating charge and net ﬁnance income. Accordingly, for
the year ended 31 March 2005 there is an additional £75 million charge to operating proﬁt and £198 million of net ﬁnance income
has been recognised under IAS 19. A related deferred tax charge of £37 million has also been recognised. The net effect has been
an increase in proﬁt of £86 million.
A pension liability has been recognised at 31 March 2005 of £4,807 million and a deferred tax asset of £1,434 million, offset by
the reversal of provisions of £44 million for 31 March 2005. The pension prepayment on the UK GAAP balance sheet of
£1,118 million has also been reversed, including the associated deferred tax liability. The net effect has been a reduction in equity
at 31 March 2005 of £4,092 million.
A pension liability has been recognised at 1 April 2004 of £5,136 million and a deferred tax asset of £1,541 million, offset by
the reversal of provisions of £36 million. The pension prepayment of £1,172 million has also been reversed, including the
associated deferred tax liability. The net effect has been a reduction in equity at 1 April 2004 of £4,390 million.
(b) Share based payment
Under UK GAAP an expense was recognised for the award of share options and shares based on their intrinsic value (the difference
between the exercise price and the market value at the date of the award). The majority of BT’s share based payments are made
under all employee ‘Save As You Earn’ plans which were exempt under UK GAAP and the intrinsic value of many of the senior
management schemes is nil.
Under IFRS 2, ‘Share Based Payment’, an expense is recognised in the income statement for all share based payments (both
awards of options and awards of shares). This expense is based on the fair value at the date of grant of the award, using an option
pricing model, and is charged to the income statement over the related performance period.
The adoption of IFRS 2 has resulted in an increased operating charge for the year ended 31 March 2005 of £28 million. A
related deferred tax beneﬁt of £7 million, has also been recognised, with the net effect being a decrease in proﬁt of £21 million.
The credit entry for the share based payments is recognised directly in reserves as the awards are equity settled. The net effect
has been an increase in equity of £7 million at 31 March 2005.

Checksum: 1335686325
34. EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS continued
(c) Goodwill and other intangible assets
UK GAAP required goodwill to be amortised over its expected useful economic life. Under IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’,
goodwill is no longer amortised but held at its carrying value on the balance sheet and tested annually for impairment. In addition,
IAS 38, ‘Intangible Assets’ requires other intangible assets arising on acquisitions after the transition date to be separately
identiﬁed and amortised over their useful economic life, often a shorter period than previously used for goodwill. As a result,
intangible assets such as customer relationships and trademarks, need to be separately valued and recognised on business
combinations, and then amortised over their useful economic lives.
The UK GAAP goodwill amortisation charge in the year to 31 March 2005 of £16 million has been reversed. The other intangible
assets arising from acquisitions since 1 April, 2004 are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives.
Computer software that is not an integral part of the associated hardware is classiﬁed as an intangible asset under IAS 38.
Under UK GAAP, the group’s policy was to categorise all capitalised software as tangible ﬁxed assets. This has resulted in a
balance sheet reclassiﬁcation of £615 million as at 31 March 2005, but has had no impact on proﬁt or equity.
(d) Dividends
Under UK GAAP, the dividend charge was recognised in the proﬁt and loss account in the period to which it related. Under IAS 10,
‘Events After The Balance Sheet Date’, dividends are not recognised in the income statement but directly in reserves. In addition,
the ﬁnal dividend is recognised only when it has been declared and approved by the company in a general meeting.
The ﬁnal dividend liabilities for the 2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years of £551 million and £454 million, respectively have been
reversed at 31 March 2005 and 1 April 2004 as the associated dividends had not been approved at those dates.
(e) Leases
Under IAS 17 ‘Leases’ there is a requirement to view leases of land separately from leases of buildings. Furthermore, there is a
requirement to recognise operating lease charges as an expense on a straight line basis. As a result, the building elements of a
small number of properties have been reclassiﬁed from operating leases under UK GAAP to ﬁnance leases under IFRS, and lease
rentals under the group’s 2001 sale and operating leaseback transaction are recognised on a straight line basis under IFRS.
For those properties reclassiﬁed as ﬁnance leases, proﬁt before tax for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been reduced by
approximately £3 million as a result of the recognition of depreciation and ﬁnance lease interest charges, and the removal of the
UK GAAP operating lease charges. Recognising the operating lease charges, on a straight line basis has further reduced the proﬁt
before tax for the year ended 31 March, by £101 million. A deferred tax beneﬁt of £31 million has also been recognised, with the
net effect being a £73 million reduction in proﬁt.
Those properties reclassiﬁed as ﬁnance leases have been capitalised and are included within property, plant and equipment at
the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the lease asset, which was £93 million at
1 April 2004 and £90 million at 31 March 2005, respectively. The associated ﬁnance lease obligation has also been recognised,
being £105 million and £107 million at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005, respectively. The excess of the sales proceeds over the
previous carrying value has deferred, and is being recognised in the income statement over the lease term. The deferred gain
included in deferred income at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 was £44 million and £42 million respectively. Where the operating
lease rentals are recognised on a straight line basis, the difference between the amounts recognised in the income statement and
the lease payments is included in other creditors, and amounted to £251 million and £352 million at 1 April 2004 and
31 March 2005, respectively. A deferred tax liability of £100 million and £123 million at 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 has been
recognised. The net effect of the above has been a reduction in equity of £215 million and £288 million at 1 April 2004 and
31 March 2005, respectively.
(f) Financial instruments
Under UK GAAP, the group previously measured ﬁnancial assets and liabilities in accordance with the principles of FRS 4, ‘Capital
Instruments’, FRS 5, ‘Reporting the Substance of Transactions’ and SSAP 20, ‘Foreign Currency Translation’. Current asset
investments were recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Debt instruments were stated at the amount of the net
proceeds adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt. Debt and current asset investments were further adjusted
for the effect of the currency element of swaps and forward contracts used as a hedge against these instruments. The group also
provided disclosures in accordance with FRS 13, ‘Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ setting out the
objectives, policies and strategies for holding or issuing ﬁnancial instruments, and the fair value of ﬁnancial instruments held at the
balance sheet date.
IAS 39 requires all derivative ﬁnancial instruments to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. The fair value of derivative
ﬁnancial instruments recognised on the balance sheet on transition at 1 April, 2005 was a net liability of £1.5 billion. This fair value
included a net liability of £0.7 billion which was previously recognised under UK GAAP, reﬂecting the currency element of ﬁnancial
instruments and accrued interest associated with derivatives. The additional net liability of £0.8 billion arising on transition
resulted in a corresponding net decrease to equity. Future market interest rate and currency movements will give rise to
adjustments to these fair values. Where hedge accounting cannot be applied under the prescriptive rules of IAS 39, changes in fair
values of derivative ﬁnancial instruments will impact the income statement.
In addition, the majority of the gains and losses associated with terminated derivative ﬁnancial instruments that were deferred
under UK GAAP have been reclassiﬁed to reserves in accordance with the transitional rules of IFRS 1, resulting in an additional net
increase to equity of £0.3 billion.

Checksum: 120382923
34. EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS continued
Certain ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are required to be recorded at amortised cost under IAS 39. Under UK GAAP, the
majority of this amortised cost value was reﬂected on the balance sheet but elements were separately recorded in current assets
and current liabilities. These amounts have been reclassiﬁed on transition to either ﬁnancial assets or loans and borrowings to
recognise the respective instruments at amortised cost.
The adjustments described above, on adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, have resulted in an overall reduction in total equity as
at 1 April, 2005 of £481 million (£209 million net of deferred taxation).
(g) Other adjustments and reclassiﬁcations
There are a number of other minor adjustments and reclassiﬁcations which include:
– The group’s share of results of associates and joint ventures is presented net of tax and ﬁnance expense on the face of the
income statement. Previously under UK GAAP the group’s share of associates and joint ventures’ interest and tax was included
in the relevant interest and tax line of the income statement.
– Liquid investments with maturities of less than three months at acquisition are classiﬁed within cash and cash equivalents under
IAS 7, ‘Cash Flow Statements’ rather than as current asset investments under UK GAAP.
– Cash ﬂow statements prepared in accordance with IAS 7, ‘Cash Flow Statements’ have a different presentational format.
Although the underlying cash ﬂows remain the same as previously reported, the cash ﬂow statement reﬂects movements in cash
and cash equivalents. In addition, certain leases are non classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases which had previously been treated as
operating leases.
– Under UK GAAP, loans and borrowings and current asset investments were held at foreign currency rates prescribed in the
hedging instrument where hedging had been applied in accordance with the group’s accounting policies. Under IAS 21, ‘The
Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchanges Rates’, such forward rate adjustments are required to be disclosed separately and have
therefore been reclassiﬁed. On adoption of IAS 39 from 1 April, 2005, such forward rate adjustments form part of the overall
fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
– Foreign exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany loans are recognised in the income statement. Under UK GAAP
these amounts were recognised in reserves.
– Proﬁts on the sale of property ﬁxed assets are classiﬁed within other operating income on the face of the income statement.
Under UK GAAP, these amounts had previously been disclosed after operating proﬁt.
– The group has historically recognised revenue arising from calls to our premium rate numbers on a gross basis, with amounts
paid to service providers recorded separately within operating costs. In light of the transition to IFRS and changing market
practice we have reviewed the presentation of these arrangements. We have decided to change our presentation to a net basis
for these calls where we provide basic transmission and connectivity only. For those calls where we add value by providing
interactivity and a more signiﬁcant and valuable part of the service, the associated revenue will continue to be reported on a
gross basis. Whilst reducing revenue and operating costs, this change has had no impact on reported proﬁt, cash ﬂows or the
balance sheet. The impact on revenue and operating costs was £194 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
35. UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union (IFRS), which differ in certain respects from those applicable in the United States. For BT there are
no differences between IFRS as adopted for use in the EU and IFRS as published by the IASB.
(I) DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IFRS AND UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (US GAAP)
The following are the main differences between IFRS and US GAAP which are relevant to the group’s consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
(a) Sale and leaseback of properties
Under IFRS, the sale of BT’s property portfolio is treated as a disposal and the vast majority of the subsequent leaseback is an
operating lease. Under US GAAP as BT has a continuing interest in the properties, these properties are recorded on the balance
sheet at their net book value, a leasing obligation is recognised and the gain on disposal is deferred until the properties are sold
and vacated by BT and the corresponding lease obligation is terminated. Rental payments made by BT are reversed and replaced
by a ﬁnance lease interest charge and a depreciation charge.
(b) Pension costs
Under IFRS, pension costs are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19. Under US GAAP, pension costs are determined in
accordance with the requirements of US Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) Nos. 87 ‘Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions’ and 88 ‘Employer’s Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Deﬁned Beneﬁt Plans and for Termination Beneﬁts’.
Differences between the IFRS and US GAAP amounts arise primarily due to differences in the recognition of actuarial gains and
losses and the application of different measurement dates. Under IFRS, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement
of recognised income and expense whereas under US GAAP actuarial gains and losses are amortised over the average remaining
service period.
Under US GAAP, if the accumulated beneﬁt obligation (ABO) exceeds the fair value of plan assets, the employer is required to
recognise a liability that is at least equal to the unfunded ABO.

Checksum: -2306352
35. UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued
(c) Capitalisation of interest
Under IFRS, the group has chosen not to capitalise interest. Under US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest incurred whilst
constructing major capital projects is included in property, plant and equipment, and depreciated over the lives of the related
assets. The amount of interest capitalised is determined by reference to the average interest rates on outstanding borrowings.
At 31 March 2006 under US GAAP, gross capitalised interest of £350 million (2005 – £349 million) was subject to depreciation
over periods of 3 to 25 years determined by the nature of the related asset.
(d) Financial instruments
The group exercised the exemption available under IFRS 1 to adopt IAS 32, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’
and IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ from 1 April 2005. The comparative periods are therefore
presented in accordance with UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, investments are held on the balance sheet at historical cost. Gains and losses on instruments used for hedges
are not recognised until the exposure being hedged is recognised. Certain derivative ﬁnancial instruments which qualify for hedge
accounting under UK GAAP do not qualify or were not designated as hedges under US GAAP.
From 1 April 2005 the group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 which gave rise to differences in accounting treatments applied under
US GAAP SFAS No. 133 ‘Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities’. On adoption of IAS 39, all derivative
ﬁnancial instruments and the fair value of the hedged risks, where a hedged item is in a fair value hedge, were recognised as a one
time transition adjustment to equity and resulted in a transitional difference between US GAAP and IFRS.
Under IFRS, certain cash ﬂow hedges result in a hedged non-ﬁnancial asset or liability being adjusted from the equity reserve for
the applicable hedged amount. US GAAP does not allow the amounts taken to equity to be transferred to the initial carrying
amount of the non-ﬁnancial asset or liability. The amounts remain in equity and are recognised in earnings as the non-ﬁnancial
asset is depreciated or disposed.
The group did not claim hedge accounting under US GAAP for certain items designated as hedges under IFRS. As a result,
certain gains or losses on derivatives held in the cash ﬂow reserve or translation reserve are credited or charged to the income
statement under US GAAP. In addition, under IFRS, the hedged risk associated with a hedged item is fair valued where the item
has been designated in a fair value hedge. As hedge accounting has not been claimed for those items under US GAAP, this fair
value adjustment will not be reﬂected. These differences will reverse out as the derivatives or hedged items mature, are sold or
expire.
The fair value and book value of derivative instruments as at 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005 is disclosed in note 33.
IFRS prescribes four investment categories, namely held for trading, available-for-sale, loans and receivables and held to
maturity. US GAAP prescribes only three categories, namely held for trading, available-for-sale and held to maturity. Whilst the
held for trading and available for sale categories are similar under both GAAPs, items held in loans and receivables under IFRS are
generally classiﬁed as held to maturity under US GAAP.
(e) Foreign exchange
Under US GAAP, on the sale of a foreign enterprise, foreign exchange differences within the cumulative translation
adjustment (CTA) are included in net income in arriving at a gain or loss on disposal. Although IFRS also requires inclusion of the
cumulative translation differences held in reserves as part of the calculation of gains or losses on disposal, they were reset to zero
on transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004.
(f) Deferred taxation
Under both IFRS and US GAAP, provision for deferred income tax is required on a full provision basis in accordance with IAS 12
‘Income taxes’ and SFAS No. 109 ‘Accounting for Income Taxes’.
Under IFRS, deferred tax is recorded for temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it
is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax
assets not recognised are disclosed in note 22.
Under US GAAP deferred taxes are recorded on all temporary differences and a valuation allowance is established in respect of
those deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion will remain unrealised. Additionally, assets and
liabilities are presented separately where the timing of further recognition does not match and deferred tax balances are split where
applicable between current and non current.
Deferred tax adjustments in the IFRS to US GAAP reconciliation are primarily the result of the deferred tax impact of the other
US GAAP adjustments made in the reconciliation. However, tax adjustments also arise in respect of the timing of recognition of
deferred tax on share options and current tax beneﬁts.
At 31 March 2006, total deferred tax liabilities were £1,767 million primarily in respect of accelerated capital allowances and
total deferred tax assets were £1,454 million, primarily in respect of pension obligations.
The total valuation allowance recognised for deferred tax assets was as follows:

(g) Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Certain network assets previously impaired did not meet the US GAAP criteria for impairment under SFAS No. 144 ‘Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets’.
US GAAP requires that an entity assess whether impairment has occurred based on the undiscounted future cash ﬂows. An
impairment exists if the sum of these cash ﬂows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The impairment loss recognised in
the income statement is based on the asset’s fair value, being either market value or the sum of discounted future cash ﬂows. The
assets that were not impaired under US GAAP are continuing to be depreciated over their remaining useful lives.
(h) Revenue
Under IFRS, long-term contracts to design, build and operate software solutions are accounted for under IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ under
which revenue is recognised as earned over the contract period.
Under US GAAP these contracts are accounted for as multiple element arrangements under EITF 00-21 and SOP 97-2,
‘Software Revenue Recognition’. As vendor speciﬁc objective evidence to support the fair value of the separate elements to be
delivered is unavailable, revenue of £109 million under certain contracts is deferred in the 2006 ﬁnancial year (2005: £162 million).
There was no impact on net income due to the deferral of costs on these contracts. Total deferred revenue and costs recorded
under US GAAP at 31 March 2006 was £348 million (2005: £239 million).
(i) Share-Based Payments
Under IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payment’, share options are fair valued at their grant date and the cost is charged to the income
statement over the relevant vesting periods.
BT early adopted SFAS No. 123 (R) ‘Share-Based Payment’ on 1 April 2005 using the modiﬁed prospective transition method.
Previously the company adopted the disclosure-only provisions in SFAS No. 123 ‘Accounting for Stock Based Compensation’ and
accounted for share options in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 ‘Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees’.
Under the transition method, compensation cost recognised during the year ended 31 March 2006 includes (a) compensation
cost for all share based payments granted prior to but not yet vested at 1 April 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated
in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123 and (b) compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent
to 1 April 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123 (R).
Results for prior periods have not been restated.
As required by SFAS 123(R) the following table illustrates the effects on income from continuing operations, income before tax,
net income and basic and diluted earnings per share in respect of the 2005 ﬁnancial year, when share-based payment
arrangements were accounted for under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.25. There were no impacts from adoption on the
cash ﬂows of the Group.

(j) Goodwill
The group wrote off goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures on acquisition
prior to 1 April 1998, against retained earnings. Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed after 1 April 1998 was capitalised and
amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life. Following transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but
tested annually for impairment and the amount of goodwill previously recorded at the transition date was carried forward under
IFRS.

35. UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued
Under US GAAP up to 31 March 2002, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures was
capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful life. BT adopted SFAS No. 142 on 1 April 2002 and goodwill is no
longer amortised but tested annually for impairment. There was no goodwill impairment charge in the year ended 31 March 2006
(2005: nil).
(k) Property rationalisation provision
In the 2003 ﬁnancial year, a provision in connection with the rationalisation of the group’s London ofﬁce property portfolio was
recorded. Under US GAAP, in accordance with SFAS No 146, these costs are not recognised until the group fully exits and
therefore ceases to use the affected properties. All these properties were exited by 31 December 2004.
(l) Contingent consideration
Under IFRS contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions is recorded when the outcome of the contingency is considered
more likely than not. Under US GAAP the consideration is recorded when the contingent event has occurred.
(m) Termination beneﬁts
Under US GAAP the fair value of termination beneﬁts for employees who are to be retained beyond their minimum contractual
retention period is recognised on a straight line basis over the future service period. Under IFRS these costs are recognised when
the employees agree to leave the group.

Reclassiﬁcations
The following reclassiﬁcations would need to be made in addition to those disclosed elsewhere and in the above reconciliation of
shareholders’ equity in order to present amounts in accordance with US GAAP.
r A pensions intangible asset of £31 million (2005 – £55 million) would be recognised separately from retirement obligations.
r The current portion of pension obligations of £630 million (2005 – £459 million) would be shown as a current liability.
r Cash and cash equivalents and current liabilities would increase by £181 million (2005 – £2 million) in respect of bank
overdrafts.
r Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables would be £348 million higher (2005 – £239 million) – see note (h).
r A ﬁnance lease obligation of £2,325 million and property, plant and equipment of £780 million would be shown and trade and
other payables would be £478 million lower in respect of the property sale and ﬁnance leaseback transaction as described in
note (a).
r Current assets would be £11 million lower (2005 – £6 million lower), current liabilities would be £2 million lower (2005 –
£135 million higher) and long term borrowings would be £12 million lower (2005 – £230 million higher) in respect of ﬁnancial
instruments.
(III) CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
The group cash ﬂow statements are presented in accordance with IAS 7. The statements prepared under IAS 7 present
substantially the same information as that required under SFAS No. 95, ‘Statement of Cash Flows’.
If the cash ﬂow statement had been prepared in accordance with SFAS No 95, the net increase in cash and cash equivalents
would have been higher by £179 million (2005: unchanged). This is because under IAS 7, bank overdrafts are classiﬁed as a
movement in cash and cash equivalents, while under US GAAP, the movements in bank overdrafts are classiﬁed as a ﬁnancing
activity.
(IV) PENSION COSTS
The following position for the main pension scheme (BTPS) is computed in accordance with US GAAP pension accounting rules
under SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 88, the effect of which is shown in the above reconciliation statements. The liabilities of the
BTPS represent substantially all of the group’s pension obligations.
The pension cost determined under SFAS No. 87 was calculated by reference to an expected long-term rate of return on scheme
assets of 7.11% (2005 – 7.27%). The components of the net periodic pension cost for the main pension scheme comprised:

The assumption for the expected return in scheme assets is a weighted average based on an assumed expected return for each
asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year. The expected returns on bonds are based on
the gross redemption yields at the start of the year. Expected returns on equities and property are based on a combination of an
estimate of the risk premium above, yields on government bonds and consensus economic forecasts of future returns. The
expected return of 7.11% per annum used for the calculation of pension costs for the year ended 31 March 2006 is consistent with
that adopted for IAS 19.
(V) INCOME STATEMENT IN US GAAP FORMAT
The group income statements on page 73 comply with IFRS and the directors believe they are in the most appropriate format for
shareholders to understand the results of our business. We believe that it is important to show our results before deducting speciﬁc
items because these items predominantly relate to corporate transactions rather than the trading activities of the group. For SEC
reporting purposes this presentation may be considered ‘non GAAP’ and therefore the group has also prepared the following
income statement which meets the SEC reporting format set forth in Item 10 of Regulation S-X. The numbers disclosed in the
following income statement are prepared under IFRS.

(VI) US GAAP DEVELOPMENTS
In November 2005, the FASB issued Financial Staff Position (‘FSP’) FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, ‘The Meaning of Other-Than-
Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,’ which nulliﬁes certain requirements of Emerging Issues Task
Force (‘EITF’) Issue No. 03-1, ‘The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments’ and
supersedes EITF Abstracts Topic No. D-44, ‘Recognition of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Upon the Planned Sale of a
Security whose Cost Exceeds Fair Value.’ The guidance in this FSP is applied to reporting periods beginning after
15 December 2005. BT does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its ﬁnancial position,
results of operations or cash ﬂows.
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 ‘Accounting Changes and Error Corrections – a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20
and FASB Statement No. 3’. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application of prior periods’ﬁnancial statements for changes in
accounting principles. SFAS No. 154 applies to accounting periods beginning after 15 December 2005. The adoption of SFAS
No. 154 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
In February 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123(R)-4, ‘Classiﬁcation of Options and Similar Instruments
Issued as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event’ (‘FSP FAS 123(R)-
4’). FSP FAS 123(R)-4 addresses the classiﬁcation of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow
for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event. An option or similar instrument that is classiﬁed as equity, but
subsequently becomes a liability because the contingent cash settlement event is probable of occurring, shall be accounted for
similar to a modiﬁcation from an equity to liability award. The application of this FSP did not have a material impact on the results
or net assets of the group.

35. UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued
In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, ‘Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments – an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 133 and 140’, that amends SFAS No. 133, ‘Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities’, and
No. 140, ‘Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities’. This Statement resolves
issues addressed in SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, ‘Application of Statement 133 to Beneﬁcial Interests in
Securitised Financial Assets’. The Statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid ﬁnancial instrument that contains an
embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. Additionally it clariﬁes which interest-only strips and principal-only
strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 155 also establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in
securitised ﬁnancial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid ﬁnancial instruments that
contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. It clariﬁes that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are
not embedded derivatives. Also SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose
entity from holding a derivative ﬁnancial instrument that pertains to a beneﬁcial interest other than another derivative ﬁnancial
instrument. SFAS No. 155 is effective for BT for all ﬁnancial instruments acquired or issued after 31 March 2007. BT is currently
evaluating the impact of this statement.
In March 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, ‘Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets: an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 140’ that amends SFAS No. 140, ‘Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities’, with respect to the accounting for separately recognised servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is
effective for BT on 1 April 2007. BT does not anticipate that the adoption of this new statement at the required effective date will
have a signiﬁcant effect on its results of operations, ﬁnancial position or cash ﬂows.

PARENT COMPANY AUDIT OPINION
Independent auditors’ report to the members of BT Group plc
We have audited the parent company ﬁnancial statements of BT Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2006 which comprise the
balance sheet, accounting policies and the related notes. These parent company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under
the accounting policies set out therein. These parent company ﬁnancial statements are set out on pages 124 to 126. We have also
audited the information in the Report on directors’ remuneration that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the group ﬁnancial statements of BT Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2006. This
separate report is set out on page 63.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the Report on directors’ remuneration and the parent company
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to
be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We report to you whether, in our opinion the information given in the
Report of the directors is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the Report of the
directors includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Operating and ﬁnancial review that is cross referred from the Report of
the directors. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and Form 20-F and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
parent company ﬁnancial statements. The other information comprises only the Financial headlines, Chairman’s message, Chief
Executive’s statement, the Operating and ﬁnancial Review, the Report of the directors, the Report of the audit committee, the
Report of the nomination committee and the unaudited part of the Report on directors’ remuneration. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company
ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
s the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 March 2006;
s the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
s the information given in the Report of the directors is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.

disclosures which comply with FRS 25, ‘Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and Presentation’. Consequently, the company has
taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 25 not to present
separate ﬁnancial instrument disclosures for the company.
(II) CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The company has adopted FRS 17, ‘Retirement beneﬁts’,
FRS 20, ‘Share based payment’, FRS 21 ‘Events after the
balance sheet date’, FRS 23, ‘The effects of changes in foreign
exchange rates’, FRS 25, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation’, FRS 26, ‘Financial instruments: Measurement’,
and FRS 28, ‘Corresponding amounts’ in these ﬁnancial
statements. The adoption of each of these standards represents
a change in accounting policy and the comparative ﬁgures have
been restated accordingly, except where the exemption to
restate comparatives have been taken.
As a result of adopting FRS 21, the company’s proﬁt for the
year ended 31 March 2005 increased by £454 million to
£1,024 million. Accrued dividend income of £454 million for
the 2004 ﬁnancial year was reversed and recognised in the
2005 ﬁnancial year. In addition, the ﬁnal dividends for the
2005 and 2004 ﬁnancial years of £551 million and £454
million respectively have been reversed, as the associated
dividends had not been approved at those dates. None of the
other new accounting standards had any effect on the
company’s proﬁt or net assets.
(III) INVESTMENTS
Fixed asset investments, which comprises investments in
subsidiary undertakings, are stated at cost and reviewed for
impairment if there are indicators that the carrying value may
not be recoverable.
(IV) TAXATION
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing
differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent
that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be
sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts from which the underlying timing
differences can be deducted. The deferred tax balances are not
discounted.
(V) DIVIDENDS
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the year in
which the dividends are approved by the company’s
shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when they are
paid; ﬁnal dividends when authorised in general meetings by
shareholders.
(VI) SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Repurchased shares of
the company are recorded in the balance sheet as treasury
shares and presented as a deduction from shareholders’ equity
at cost.
(VII) CASH
Cash includes cash in hand, bank deposits repayable on
demand and bank overdrafts. Filename: 824560_05.3d Time: 14:34:53 Date: 20/05/06

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this annual report are forward-looking and are made in reliance on the safe harbour provisions of the US
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to analyses and other information which are based on
forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements include, without limitation, those
concerning: BT’s transformation strategy and its ability to achieve it; expected cost savings; growth of, and opportunities available
in, the communications industry and BT’s positioning to take advantage of those opportunities; expectations regarding
competition, market shares, prices and growth; expectations regarding the convergence of technologies; growth and opportunities
in new wave business (such as networked IT services, broadband and mobility); BT’s network development and plans for the
21st century network; plans for the launch of new products and services; network performance and quality; the impact of
regulatory initiatives on operations, including the regulation of the UK ﬁxed wholesale and retail businesses and the impact of the
Undertakings to Ofcom under the Enterprise Act; BT’s possible or assumed future results of operations and/or those of its
associates and joint ventures; BT’s future dividend policy; capital expenditure and investment plans; adequacy of capital; ﬁnancing
plans; demand for and access to broadband and the promotion of broadband by third-party service providers; and those preceded
by, followed by, or that include the words ‘aims’, ‘believes’, ‘expects’, ‘anticipates’, ‘intends’, ‘will’, ‘should’ or similar
expressions.
Although BT believes that the expectations reﬂected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no
assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct. Because these statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual
results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause differences between actual results and those implied by the forward-looking statements include, but
are not limited to: material adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by BT and its lines of business; future
regulatory actions and conditions in its operating areas, including competition from others; selection by BT and its lines of business
of the appropriate trading and marketing models for its products and services; technological innovations, including the cost of
developing new products, networks and solutions and the need to increase expenditures for improving the quality of service; the
anticipated beneﬁts and advantages of new technologies, products and services, including broadband and other new wave
initiatives not being realised; developments in the convergence of technologies; prolonged adverse weather conditions resulting in
a material increase in overtime, staff or other costs; the timing of entry and proﬁtability of BT and its lines of business in certain
communications markets; signiﬁcant changes in market shares for BT and its principal products and services; ﬂuctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; and general ﬁnancial market conditions affecting BT’s performance. Certain of
these factors are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this annual report including, without limitation, in Group risk factors.BT
undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.

The pre-19 November 2001 prices shown have been adjusted for the rights issue and demerger that occurred in the 2002 financial year.
The prices are the highest and lowest closing middle market prices for BT ordinary shares, as derived from the Daily Ofﬁcial List of
the London Stock Exchange and the highest and lowest closing sales prices of ADSs, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
composite tape.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar affect the dollar equivalent of the pound sterling
price of the company’s ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange and, as a result, are likely to affect the market price of the
ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange.
CAPITAL GAINS TAX (CGT)
The rights issue in June 2001 and the demerger of O2 in November 2001 adjusted the value for capital gains tax purposes of
BT shares.
Rights issue
An explanatory note on the effects of the rights issue on the CGT position relating to BT shareholdings is available from the
Shareholder Helpline (see page 143).
Demerger of O2 – capital gains tax calculation
The conﬁrmed ofﬁcial opening prices for BT Group and O2 shares on 19 November 2001 following the demerger were 285.75p
and 82.75p, respectively. This means that, of the total (combined) value of 368.50p, 77.544% is attributable to BT Group and
22.456% to O2. Accordingly, for CGT calculations, the base cost of BT Group shares and O2 shares is calculated by multiplying
the acquisition cost of a BT shareholding by 77.544% and 22.456%, respectively.

DIVIDENDS
Since shortly after its incorporation in 1984, British Telecommunications plc paid interim dividends annually in February and ﬁnal
dividends in September. However, as part of BT’s debt reduction and restructuring plans, neither a ﬁnal dividend for the year
ended 31 March 2001 nor an interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2002 was paid to shareholders.
A ﬁnal dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2005 was paid on 5 September 2005 to shareholders on the register on
5 August 2005, and an interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2006 was paid on 13 February 2006 to
shareholders on the register on 31 December 2005.
The dividends paid or payable on BT shares and ADSs for the last ﬁve years are shown in the following table. The dividends on
the ordinary shares exclude the associated tax credit. The amounts shown are not those that were actually paid to holders of ADSs.
For the tax treatment of dividends paid see Taxation of dividends below. Dividends have been translated from pounds sterling into
US dollars using exchange rates prevailing on the date the ordinary dividends were paid.

Qualifying holders of ADSs on record as of 18 August 2006 are entitled to receive the final dividend which will be paid on 18 September 2006, subject to approval at the annual general meeting.
The US dollar amount of the final dividend of 76 pence per ADS to be paid to holders of ADSs will be based on the exchange rate in effect on 11 September 2006, the date of payment to holders of
ordinary shares.
As dividends paid by the company are in pounds sterling, exchange rate ﬂuctuations will affect the US dollar amounts received by
holders of ADSs on conversion by the Depositary of such cash dividends.
DIVIDEND MANDATE
Any shareholder wishing dividends to be paid directly into a bank or building society account should contact the Shareholder
Helpline (see page 143). Dividends paid in this way will be paid through the Bankers Automated Clearing System (BACS).

DIVIDEND INVESTMENT PLAN

TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reﬂecting share
price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. It is therefore, a good indicator of a company’s overall performance.
Over the last ﬁve years (as shown in the ﬁrst TSR chart below), BT’s TSR (as adjusted for the rights issue and demerger) was
negative 25% compared to a FTSE 100 TSR of positive 25%. This was primarily due to a fall in BT’s share price which, like many
stocks in the telecoms, media and technology (TMT) sector, declined in the early part of the period.
In the period between the demerger on 19 November 2001 and 31 March 2006, BT’s TSR was negative 6%, compared to
negative 15% for the FTSEuroﬁrst 300 Telco Index and positive 31% for the FTSE 100. BT has also outperformed the FTSEuroﬁrst
300 Telco Index in the last 12 months with a return of 13.4% compared to 1.6% for that index.

Checksum: 555207138
Articles
In the following description of the rights attaching to the shares in the company, a ‘holder of shares’ and a ‘shareholder’ is, in
either case, the person entered on the company’s register of members as the holder of the relevant shares. Shareholders can
choose whether their shares are to be evidenced by share certiﬁcates (i.e. in certiﬁcated form) or held in electronic
(i.e. uncertiﬁcated) form in CREST (the electronic settlement system in the UK).
(a) Voting rights
Subject to the restrictions described below, on a show of hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy at any general
meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote for each share which they hold.
Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman of the meeting or by at
least ﬁve shareholders at the meeting who are entitled to vote (or their proxies), or by one or more shareholders at the meeting
who are entitled to vote (or their proxies) and who have, between them, at least 10% of the total votes of all shareholders who
have the right to vote at the meeting.
No person is, unless the Board decide otherwise, entitled to attend or vote at any general meeting or to exercise any other right
conferred by being a shareholder if he or any person appearing to be interested in those shares has been sent a notice under
section 212 of the Companies Act 1985 (which confers upon public companies the power to require information with respect to
interests in their voting shares) and he or any interested person has failed to supply to the company the information requested
within 14 days after delivery of that notice. These restrictions end seven days after the earlier of the date the shareholder complies
with the request satisfactorily or the company receives notice that there has been an approved transfer of the shares.
(b) Variation of rights
Whenever the share capital of the company is split into different classes of shares, the special rights attached to any of those
classes can be varied or withdrawn either:
(i) with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class; or
(ii) with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class.
At any separate meeting, the necessary quorum is two persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one-third in
nominal amount of the issued shares of the class in question (but at any adjourned meeting, any person holding shares of the class
or his proxy is a quorum).
The company can issue new shares and attach any rights and restrictions to them, as long as this is not restricted by special
rights previously given to holders of any existing shares. Subject to this, the rights of new shares can take priority over the rights of
existing shares, or existing shares can take priority over them, or the new shares and the existing shares can rank equally.
(c) Changes in capital
The company may by ordinary resolution:
(i) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger amount;
(ii) divide all or part of its share capital into shares of a smaller amount;
(iii) cancel any shares which have not, at the date of the ordinary resolution, been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and
reduce the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares cancelled; and
(iv) increase its share capital.
The company may also:
(i) buy back its own shares; and
(ii) by special resolution reduce its share capital, any capital redemption reserve and any share premium account.
(d) Dividends
The company’s shareholders can declare dividends by passing an ordinary resolution provided that no dividend can exceed the
amount recommended by the directors. Dividends must be paid out of proﬁts available for distribution. If the directors consider
that the proﬁts of the company justify such payments, they can pay interim dividends on any class of shares of the amounts and on
the dates and for the periods they decide. Fixed dividends will be paid on any class of shares on the dates stated for the payments
of those dividends.
The directors can offer ordinary shareholders the right to choose to receive new ordinary shares, which are credited as fully paid,
instead of some or all of their cash dividend. Before they can do this, the company’s shareholders must have passed an ordinary
resolution authorising the directors to make this offer.
Any dividend which has not been claimed for ten years after it was declared or became due for payment will be forfeited and will
belong to the company unless the directors decide otherwise.
(e) Distribution of assets on winding up
If the company is wound up (whether the liquidation is voluntary, under supervision of the court or by the court) the liquidator can,
with the authority of an extraordinary resolution passed by the shareholders, divide among the shareholders all or any part of the
assets of the company. This applies whether the assets consist of property of one kind or different kinds. For this purpose, the
liquidator can place whatever value the liquidator considers fair on any property and decide how the division is carried out between
shareholders or different groups of shareholders. The liquidator can also, with the same authority, transfer any assets to trustees
upon any trusts for the beneﬁt of shareholders which the liquidator decides. The liquidation of the company can then be ﬁnalised
and the company dissolved. No past or present shareholder can be compelled to accept any shares or other property under the
Articles which could give that shareholder a liability.

Checksum: 1491700128
(f) Transfer of shares
Certiﬁcated shares of the company may be transferred in writing either by an instrument of transfer in the usual standard form or
in another form approved by the Board. The transfer form must be signed or made effective by or on behalf of the person making
the transfer. The person making the transfer will be treated as continuing to be the holder of the shares transferred until the name
of the person to whom the shares are being transferred is entered in the register of members of the company.
The Board may refuse to register any transfer of any share held in certiﬁcated form:
s which is in favour of more than four joint holders; or
s unless the transfer form to be registered is properly stamped to show payment of any applicable stamp duty and delivered to
the company’s registered ofﬁce or any other place the Board decide. The transfer must have with it the share certiﬁcate for the
shares to be transferred; any other evidence which the Board ask for to prove that the person wanting to make the transfer is
entitled to do this; and if the transfer form is executed by another person on behalf of the person making the transfer, evidence
of the authority of that person to do so.
Transfers of uncertiﬁcated shares must be carried out using a relevant system (as deﬁned in the Uncertiﬁcated Securities
Regulations 1995 (the Regulations)). The Board can refuse to register a transfer of an uncertiﬁcated share in the circumstances
stated in the Regulations.
If the Board decide not to register a transfer of a share, the Board must notify the person to whom that share was to be
transferred no later than two months after the company receives the transfer or instruction from the operator of the relevant
system.
The Board can decide to suspend the registration of transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the register of shareholders.
The register must not be closed without the consent of the operator of a relevant system (as deﬁned in the Regulations) in the case
of uncertiﬁcated shares.
(g) Untraced shareholders
BT may sell any shares after advertising its intention and waiting for three months if the shares have been in issue for at least
ten years, during that period at least three dividends have become payable on them and have not been claimed and BT has not
heard from the shareholder or any person entitled to the dividends by transmission. The net sale proceeds belong to BT, but it
must pay those proceeds to the former shareholder or the person entitled to them by transmission if that shareholder, or that other
person, asks for them.
(h) General meetings of shareholders
Every year the company must hold an annual general meeting. The Board can call an extraordinary general meeting at any time
and, under general law, must call one on a shareholders’ requisition.
(i) Limitations on rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders
The only limitation imposed by the Articles on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders is that a shareholder whose
registered address is outside the UK and who wishes to receive notices of meetings of shareholders or documents from BT must
give the company an address within the UK to which they may be sent.
(j) Directors
Directors’ remuneration
Excluding remuneration referred to below, each director will be paid such fee for his services as the Board decide, not exceeding
£50,000 a year and increasing by the percentage increase of the UK Retail Prices Index (as deﬁned by Section 833(2) Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988) for any 12-month period beginning 1 April 1999 or an anniversary of that date. The company may by
ordinary resolution decide on a higher sum. This resolution can increase the fee paid to all or any directors either permanently or
for a particular period. The directors may be paid their expenses properly incurred in connection with the business of the company.
The Board can award extra fees to a director who holds an executive position; acts as chairman or deputy chairman; serves on a
Board committee at the request of the Board; or performs any other services which the Board consider extend beyond the ordinary
duties of a director.
The directors may grant pensions or other beneﬁts to, among others, any director or former director or persons connected with
them. However, BT can only provide these beneﬁts to any director or former director who has not been an employee or held any
other ofﬁce or executive position in the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, or to relations or dependants of, or people
connected to, those directors or former directors, if the shareholders approve this by passing an ordinary resolution.
Directors’ votes
A director need not be a shareholder, but a director who is not a shareholder can still attend and speak at shareholders’ meetings.
Unless the Articles say otherwise, a director cannot vote on a resolution about a contract in which the director has a material
interest (this will also apply to interests of a person connected with the director). The director can vote if the interest is only an
interest in BT shares, debentures or other securities. A director can, however, vote and be counted in a quorum in respect of
certain matters in which he is interested as set out in the Articles.
Subject to the relevant legislation, the shareholders can by passing an ordinary resolution suspend or relax, among other things,
the provisions relating to the interest of a director in any contract or arrangement or relating to a director’s right to vote and be
counted in a quorum on resolutions in which he is interested to any extent or ratify any particular contract carried out in breach of
those provisions.

Directors’ interests
If the legislation allows and the director has disclosed the nature and extent of the interest to the Board, the director can:
(i) have any kind of interest in a contract with or involving BT (or in which BT has an interest or with or involving another
company in which BT has an interest);
(ii) have any kind of interest in a company in which BT has an interest (including holding a position in that company or being a
shareholder of that company);
(iii) hold a position (other than auditor) in BT or another company in which BT has an interest on terms and conditions decided by
the Board; and
(iv) alone (or through some ﬁrm with which the director is associated) do paid professional work (other than as auditor) for BT or
another company in which BT has an interest on terms and conditions decided by the Board.
A director does not have to hand over to BT any beneﬁt received or proﬁt made as a result of anything permitted to be done
under the Articles.
When a director knows that they are interested in a contract with BT they must tell the other directors.
Retirement of directors
Provisions of the legislation which, read with the Articles, would prevent a person from being or becoming a director because that
person has reached the age of 70 do not apply to the company.
At every annual general meeting, any director who was elected or last re-elected a director at or before the annual general
meeting held in the third year before the current year, shall retire by rotation. Any director appointed by the directors
automatically retires at the next following annual general meeting. A retiring director is eligible for re-election.
Directors’ borrowing powers
To the extent that the legislation and the Articles allow, the Board can exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, to
mortgage or charge its business, property and assets (present and future) and to issue debentures and other securities, and give
security either outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of the company or another person. The Board
must limit the borrowings of the company and exercise all the company’s voting and other rights or powers of control exercisable
by the company in relation to its subsidiary undertakings so as to ensure that the aggregate amount of all borrowings by the group
outstanding, net of amounts borrowed intra-group among other things, at any time does not exceed £35 billion.
MATERIAL CONTRACTS
Excluding contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business, no contracts have been entered into in the two years preceding
the date of this document by BT or another member of the group which are, or may be, material to the group or contain a
provision under which a member of the group has an obligation or entitlement which is, or may be, material to BT or such other
member of the group.
TAXATION (US HOLDERS)
This is a summary only of the principal US federal income tax and UK tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of
ordinary shares or ADSs by US Holders (as deﬁned below) who hold their ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets. It does not
address all aspects of US federal income taxation and does not address aspects that may be relevant to persons who are subject to
special provisions of US federal income tax law, including US expatriates, insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, banks,
regulated investment companies, ﬁnancial institutions, securities broker-dealers, traders in securities who elect a mark-to-market
method of accounting, persons subject to alternative minimum tax, investors that directly, indirectly or by attribution own 10% or
more of the outstanding share capital or voting power of BT, persons holding their ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle,
hedging transaction or conversion transaction, persons who acquired their ordinary shares or ADSs pursuant to the exercise of
options or otherwise as compensation, or persons whose functional currency is not the US dollar, amongst others. Those holders
may be subject to US federal income tax consequences different from those set forth below.
For the purposes of this summary, a US Holder is a beneﬁcial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that, for US federal income tax
purposes, is: a citizen or individual resident of the United States, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for US
federal income tax purposes) created or organised in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, an
estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if a US court can exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons are authorised to control all
substantial decisions of the trust. If a partnership holds ordinary shares or ADSs, the US tax treatment of a partner generally will
depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner in a partnership that holds ordinary shares or
ADSs is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding the speciﬁc tax consequences of owning and disposing of the ordinary shares
or ADSs.
In particular, this summary is based on (i) current UK tax law and the practice of Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and
US law and US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) practice, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, existing and
proposed Treasury regulations, rulings, judicial decisions and administrative practice, all as currently in effect and available, (ii) the
United Kingdom–United States Convention relating to estate and gift taxes, and (iii) the United Kingdom–United States Tax
Convention that entered into force on 31 March 2003 and the protocol thereto (the Convention), all as in effect on the date of this
annual report, all of which are subject to change or changes in interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of the Convention and the consequences under UK, US
federal, state and local, and other laws, of the ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs.

Checksum: 305699418
Taxation of dividends
Under current UK tax law, BT will not be required to withhold tax at source from dividend payments it makes.
For US federal income tax purposes, a distribution will be treated as ordinary dividend income. The amount of the distribution
includible in gross income of a US Holder will be the US dollar value of the distribution calculated by reference to the spot rate in
effect on the date the distribution is actually or constructively received by a US Holder of ordinary shares, or by the Depositary, in
the case of ADSs. A US Holder who converts the British pounds into US dollars on the date of receipt generally should not
recognise any exchange gain or loss. A US Holder who does not convert the British pounds into US dollars on the date of receipt
generally will have a tax basis in the British pounds equal to their US dollar value on such date. Foreign currency gain or loss, if any,
recognised by the US Holder on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the British pounds generally will be US source
ordinary income or loss. Dividends paid by BT to a US Holder will not be eligible for the US dividends received deduction that may
otherwise be available to corporate shareholders.
For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit limitation, dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as
income from sources outside the United States and generally will constitute ‘passive income’ or, for certain Holders, ‘ﬁnancial
services income’ for tax years beginning before 1 January 2007, and for tax years beginning after 31 December 2006, will be
treated as ‘passive category income’ or ‘general category income’. The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit
are very complex. US Holders who do not elect to claim a credit with respect to any foreign taxes paid in a given taxable year may
instead claim a deduction for foreign taxes paid. A deduction does not reduce US federal income tax on a dollar for dollar basis like
a tax credit. The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign credits.
There will be no right to any UK tax credit or to any payment from HMRC in respect of any tax credit on dividends paid on
ordinary shares or ADSs.
Certain US Holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of US federal income tax (currently at a maximum rate of
15%) in respect of ‘qualiﬁed dividend income’ received in taxable years beginning before 1 January 2009. For this purpose,
qualiﬁed dividend income generally includes dividends paid by a non-US corporation if, among other things, the US Holders meet
certain minimum holding periods and the non-US corporation satisﬁes certain requirements, including that either (i) the shares (or
ADSs) with respect to which the dividend has been paid are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the United
States, or (ii) the non-US corporation is eligible for the beneﬁts of a comprehensive US income tax treaty (such as the Convention)
which provides for the exchange of information. BT currently believes that dividends paid with respect to its ordinary shares and
ADSs should constitute qualiﬁed dividend income for US federal income tax purposes. Each individual US Holder of ordinary shares
or ADSs is urged to consult his own tax advisor regarding the availability to him of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of his own
particular situation and regarding the computations of his foreign tax credit limitation with respect to any qualiﬁed dividend
income paid by BT to him, as applicable.
Taxation of capital gains
Unless a US Holder of ordinary shares or ADSs is resident in or ordinarily resident for United Kingdom tax purposes in the United
Kingdom or unless a US Holder of ordinary shares or ADSs carries on a trade, profession, or vocation in the United Kingdom
through a branch, agency, or permanent establishment in the UK, and the ordinary shares and/or ADSs have been used, held, or
acquired for purposes of that trade, the holder should not be liable for UK tax on capital gains on a disposal of ordinary shares and/
or ADSs.
A US Holder who is an individual and who has ceased to be resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the United
Kingdom on or after 17 March 1998 or who falls to be regarded as resident outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of any
double tax treaty (Treaty non-resident) on or after 16 March 2005 and continues to not be resident or ordinarily resident in the
United Kingdom or continues to be Treaty non-resident for a period of less than ﬁve years of assessment and who disposes of his
ordinary shares or ADSs during that period may also be liable on his return to the United Kingdom to United Kingdom tax on
capital gains, subject to any available exemption or relief, even though he is not resident or ordinarily resident in the United
Kingdom or is Treaty non-resident at the time of disposal.
For US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder generally will recognise capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other
disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realised on
the disposition and the US Holder’s adjusted tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Such gain or loss
generally will be US source gain or loss, and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the ordinary shares have been held
for more than one year at the time of disposition. Long-term capital gains recognised by an individual US Holder generally are
subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to signiﬁcant limitations.
Passive foreign investment company status
A non-US corporation will be classiﬁed as a Passive Foreign Investment Company for US federal income tax purposes (a PFIC) for
any taxable year if at least 75% of its gross income consists of passive income or at least 50% of the average value of its assets
consist of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. BT currently believes that it did not qualify as a
PFIC for the taxable year ending 31 March 2006. If BT were to become a PFIC for any taxable year, US Holders would suffer
adverse tax consequences. These consequences may include having gains realised on the disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs
treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains and being subject to punitive interest charges on certain dividends and on the
proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs. Furthermore, dividends paid by BT would not be ‘qualiﬁed
dividend income’ which may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation as described above. US Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to BT.

US information reporting and backup withholding
Dividends paid on and proceeds received from the sale, exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to
information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a current rate of 28% (which rate may be subject to change). Certain
exempt recipients (such as corporations) are not subject to these information reporting requirements. Backup withholding will not
apply, however, to a US Holder who provides a correct taxpayer identiﬁcation number or certiﬁcate of foreign status and makes
any other required certiﬁcation or who is otherwise exempt. Persons that are United States persons for US federal income tax
purposes who are required to establish their exempt status generally must furnish IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer
Identiﬁcation Number and Certiﬁcation). Holders that are not United States persons for US federal income tax purposes generally
will not be subject to US information reporting or backup withholding. However, such holders may be required to provide
certiﬁcation of non-US status in connection with payments received in the United States or through certain US-related ﬁnancial
intermediaries.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holder’sUS
federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by
timely ﬁling the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.
UK stamp duty
A transfer of an ordinary share will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax SDRT at 0.5% of the
amount or value of any consideration provided rounded up (in the case of stamp duty) to the nearest £5. SDRT is generally the
liability of the purchaser. It is customarily also the purchaser who pays UK stamp duty. A transfer of an ordinary share to, or to a
nominee or agent of, a person whose business is or includes issuing depositary receipts gives rise to a 1.5% charge to stamp duty
or SDRT of either the amount of the consideration provided or the value of the share issued rounded up (in the case of stamp duty)
to the nearest £5. No UK stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of an ADS (assuming it is not registered in the UK), provided
that the transfer documents are executed and always retained outside the UK.
Transfers of ordinary shares into CREST will generally not be subject to stamp duty or SDRT unless such a transfer is made for a
consideration in money or money’s worth, in which case a liability to SDRT will arise, usually at the rate of 0.5% of the value of the
consideration. Paperless transfers of ordinary shares within CREST are generally liable to SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the value of
the consideration. CREST is obliged to collect SDRT from the purchaser of the shares on relevant transactions settled within the
system.
UK inheritance and gift taxes in connection with ordinary shares and/or ADSs
The rules and scope of domicile are complex and action should not be taken without advice speciﬁc to the individual’s
circumstances. A lifetime gift or a transfer on death of ordinary shares and/or ADSs by an individual holder, who is US domiciled
(for the purposes of the UK/US Estate and Gift Tax Convention) and who is not a UK national (as deﬁned in the Convention) will not
generally be subject to UK inheritance tax if the gift is subject to US federal gift or US estate tax unless the tax is not paid.
LIMITATIONS AFFECTING SECURITY HOLDERS
There are no limitations under the laws of the United Kingdom restricting the right of non-residents to hold or to vote shares in the
company.
