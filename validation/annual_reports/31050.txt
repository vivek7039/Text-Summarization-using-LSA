Chairman’s statement
It is with considerable pride that 
I share with you the notable 
achievements that have been 
key to the continued success of 
our polyhalite Project in 2017. 
First and foremost, the commencement 
of construction, in a safe and secure 
environment, has seen us take major 
strides towards our goal of first 
production in 2021. The impressive 
construction progress over the last 
12 months sits alongside several other 
key achievements which are all 
contributing towards the successful 
fulfilment of our ultimate vision: to 
become a world-class fertilizer business.
Local
At full production over 1,000 high-
skilled jobs will be created with an 
additional 1,500 jobs created in the 
supply chain. The high-skilled jobs 
we will create will also be highly 
productive and well-paid. As the 
largest private sector capital 
investment in the North, we are 
sending a clear message that the 
region is open for business and has 
the necessary skills and ability to 
deliver major infrastructure projects. 
In addition to the employment 
opportunities created, the Company 
expects that, at full production, it will 
make around £85 million in local 
payments each year and will deliver 
approximately £13 million in annual 
contributions to the Sirius Minerals 
Foundation, as well as being a 
catalyst for regeneration with the 
potential to create new economic 
clusters in the region. 
The impressive construction 
progress over the last 12 months 
sits alongside several other key 
achievements which are all 
contributing towards the successful 
fulfilment of our ultimate vision: 
to become a world-class 
fertilizer business.
RUSSELL SCRIMSHAW. CHAIRMAN
PROGRESSING 
TOWARDS 
A BRIGHT FUTURE 5
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
National
Beyond the North East, our project 
will also bring major economic 
benefits to the UK as a whole. At 
full-scale production we are forecast 
to generate significant tax revenues 
to the national exchequer, 
strengthening the UK’s fiscal position 
and supporting public services. The 
Woodsmith Mine and associated 
infrastructure will enable us to 
produce and sell up to 20 million 
tonnes per annum of our primary 
product, POLY4. 
Having been associated with 
significant mining projects for a large 
part of my career, I take great comfort 
that this expected success of our 
business goes well beyond the 
investment proposition. The efforts of 
our team and supporters are already 
creating positive, tangible economic 
change in the UK and we look forward 
to doing so for many years to come.
Global
For me, it is very important that POLY4 
can contribute to easing the challenge 
of global food security. Fertilizers are 
fundamental to improving agricultural 
yields and helping to address the 
forecasted imbalance between food 
supply and demand. Global 
population is growing at a rapid rate, 
and with it, the requirement for more 
food. Unless more effective, more 
efficient and sustainable practices 
are adopted, farmers and food 
producers will struggle to bridge the 
gap between supply and demand. Our 
global research and development 
programme is demonstrating that 
POLY4 delivers greater nutrient uptake 
and improves both yield and quality on 
multiple crops in varying geographic 
conditions across the world.
Sirius’ team has already demonstrated 
their ability to deliver successful 
outcomes in the face of challenges 
others have considered overwhelming. 
In order to achieve our vision and 
ensure the potential benefits for all 
stakeholders come to fruition, the 
tenacity and determination which 
has defined our Company to date, 
will continue to stand us in good 
stead as we progress further into this 
current phase of developing our 
world-class mining operation.
2017 construction commences
After five years of exploration, 
preparation, obtaining planning 
approval and having delivered many 
significant project milestones, I am 
pleased to report that the construction 
of our North Yorkshire polyhalite 
Project is well underway.
At the Woodsmith Mine site all initial 
site works to enable the construction 
of the key infrastructure components 
are complete. The working platforms 
for the main mine shaft and MTS shaft 
were completed early to ensure shaft 
related activities could commence as 
soon as possible. 
At Lockwood Beck, initial site works 
are now complete, including the 
upgrade and repositioning of the 
existing road junction. The new junction 
provides safe entry to the site and has 
also greatly improved the access to 
the existing road infrastructure. The 
shaft sinking platform and 
associated drainage have been 
installed and the site is ready for 
shaft sinking activities to get 
underway in 2018. 
Supply agreements
Market acceptance of POLY4 in 
the form of long-term supply 
agreements, as evidenced 
through our partnership with 
leading agri-business Wilmar, 
reinforces and validates that 
POLY4 will earn its place in the 
global fertilizer market. Our 
partnership with Wilmar enables 
access to key markets with huge 
prospects for POLY4 across South 
East Asia. Wilmar is the latest 
addition to our existing group of 
industry leading customers with 
whom we expect to help drive 
further global demand for POLY4.
Our people
People are critical to the success of 
our business and I am particularly 
pleased with the expanding team 
of highly motivated, diverse and 
experienced individuals who have 
joined the business in 2017. The last 
year has seen our team more than 
double in size and the successful 
move in late 2017 to Resolution 
House, our new office headquarters 
in Scarborough, has provided the 
space, technology and environment 
to support our workforce. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 6
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
I am particularly pleased with the 
overall quality of people who have 
joined us from the local area. To date, 
the majority of our head office team 
in Yorkshire has been sourced from 
the local labour market. I also take 
great satisfaction from the fact that 
many of our younger team members, 
who joined us as apprentices, are 
now integral members of the team. 
Our strong values of responsibility, 
ownership, belief and urgency, based 
on the solid foundations of safety and 
teamwork, have propelled the team 
to achieve more than many people 
thought would ever be possible. 
Move to the Main Market and 
Premium Listing
Following the completion of stage 1 
financing, we announced our 
intention to apply for admission to 
listing on the premium listing segment 
of the Official List of the UK Listing 
Authority (Premium Listing) and 
admission to trading on the main 
market of the London Stock Exchange 
(the Main Market). While AIM had 
provided us with an excellent 
platform to progress the Company 
through the various approval phases 
of the Project, the Company Directors 
believe that a Premium Listing better 
supports the long-term strategy and 
potential of the Company by 
providing us with a more appropriate 
platform for growth, access to broader 
international investor audiences and 
deeper pools of investment capital 
that reflect the world-class nature 
of the Project and Sirius’ long-term 
potential as a global supplier of 
multi-nutrient fertilizer. This important 
milestone was accomplished in 
April 2017 and Sirius finished 2017 
as a FTSE 250 constituent. 
Executive Director and Senior 
Non-Executive Director 
appointments
Early in 2017 we announced the 
appointment of Thomas Staley to the 
Board as Finance Director. Thomas 
played an instrumental role in 
securing the stage 1 financing and 
he will play a pivotal role in a 
successful execution of the stage 2 
debt raising. Thomas’ appointment 
adds to an already very strong 
complement of Board members who 
have the credentials and experience 
required to lead the Company through 
the next phase of development. 
We also announced the elevation of 
one of our very experienced Non-
Executive Board members, Noel 
Harwerth, to the role of Senior 
Independent Director. Noel has a 
wide array of Board experiences 
across several industries, including 
mining and finance. Over the last few 
years she has provided us with wise 
counsel on a regular basis and I am 
very pleased she has agreed to add 
this expanded role to her duties. 
 
Outlook 
2018 will be a pivotal year for us as 
we seek the remaining financing 
required to complete this 
transformational Project. The 
construction of the first new fertilizer 
mine in the UK for a generation is an 
opportunity to create thousands of 
jobs and bring significant economic 
benefits to both national and local 
economies. In order to fully realise this 
transformational opportunity for the 
UK, a partnership with the UK 
Government, in the form of a Treasury 
Guarantee under the Infrastructure 
Project Authority’s scheme, is essential.
Securing this guarantee and our 
stage 2 financing will be our core 
focus for the year ahead and I am 
comforted by our excellent progress 
made to date. With preparations well 
underway to secure commitments for 
financing, we are confident in our 
ability to deliver these goals and look 
forward to taking on the challenges 
which lie ahead. 
The short, medium and long-term 
benefits from our Project are 
significant and will not be diminished 
by Britain’s decision to leave the EU. 
I believe that our ongoing success is 
a clear demonstration of the growing 
local and national public and 
political support for realising the full 
potential of the Woodsmith Mine. 
I would like to thank all our 
shareholders, supporters and 
suppliers for their ongoing support.
Kind regards

Sirius Minerals North Yorkshire Polyhalite Project Credit: Ebor images North York Moors National Park 9
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Situated between the River Tees and 
Scarborough in North Yorkshire, UK, 
Sirius’ Project covers an area of 
750km
2
 onshore and offshore. 
Sirius has secured all the required 
planning permissions and approvals 
along with the necessary mineral 
rights to develop its flagship North 
Yorkshire polyhalite Project which, 
when constructed, will have the 
capacity to deliver up to 20 Mtpa of 
its multi-nutrient, low chloride fertilizer 
product POLY4. POLY4 is derived from 
the naturally occurring mineral, 
polyhalite (K
2
SO
4
MgSO
4
2CaSO
4
2H
2
O).
Polyhalite is a relatively common 
mineral which occurs in marine 
evaporite systems and is usually 
found in accumulations several 
centimetres thick. In Yorkshire, Sirius 
has intersected high-grade seams of 
polyhalite up to 70 metres thick. 
Sirius has defined a JORC compliant 
reserve of 280 million tonnes of 
polyhalite with a mean grade of 
88.4%, from a JORC compliant 
inferred and indicated resource of 
2.66 billion tonnes of 85.7% polyhalite. 
The polyhalite formed when an 
ancient sea, the Zechstein Sea, 
evaporated some 260 million years 
ago. The polyhalite seams that are 
the focus of the Company are 
located approximately 1,550 metres 
below surface level and have a mean 
reserve thickness of 25 metres. The 
current extent of the mineral resource, 
which has exploration potential in all 
directions, is defined from an area of 
only 7% of the Company’s total 
mineral rights holdings.
To access its world-class mineral 
resource, Sirius has designed its mine 
infrastructure to not only be 
sympathetic to the sensitive location 
of its Woodsmith Mine within the North 
York Moors National Park but to also 
allow the Company to efficiently mine 
and transport up to 20 Mtpa of 
polyhalite from the Woodsmith Mine 
site to the Materials Handling Facility 
(MHF) on Teesside causing minimal 
surface impact. The low impact 
infrastructure ensures no mineral will 
come to surface until after it leaves 
the National Park and arrives at the 
MHF. 
The scale and quality of the mineral 
resource combined with the relative 
proximity to a deep-water port 
present significant economic and 
operational advantages and give the 
Project all the hallmarks of a world-
class resource asset.

WHAT WE ARE 
CONSTRUCTING
Industry-leading design and 
construction techniques are being 
deployed to develop the largest mine 
of its type anywhere in the world. The 
low impact design coupled with an 
innovative ore delivery system is 
setting a new standard for 
sustainable mine development. 
Shafts
At the Woodsmith Mine site, two deep 
shafts are being constructed to access 
the polyhalite in the centre of the 
mineral reserve: the production shaft 
reaching a depth of 1,594 metres and 
the service shaft reaching a depth of 
1,565 metres. Once constructed the 
production shaft will be fitted out with 
two Blair multi-rope winders, each 
capable of hoisting 6.7 Mtpa of 
polyhalite ore for a combined capacity 
of 13 Mtpa. A third shaft, the Mineral 
Transport System (MTS) access shaft 
will also be constructed. The MTS 
access shaft is being constructed to 
facilitate construction of the MTS. 
Shaft construction will utilise proven 
shaft sinking methodologies. A 
detailed hydrogeological and 
geotechnical ground investigation 
has been completed at the 
Woodsmith Mine site to characterise 
the nature of the geology which will 
be encountered during shaft 
construction. The extensive ground 
investigation programme has also 
informed the design of the 
permanent shaft lining.
To achieve full 20 Mtpa capacity, the 
MTS shaft at the Woodsmith Mine will 
require further deepening from the 
360m level to the polyhalite mining 
horizon.

Mineral Transport System 
The MTS will carry mined polyhalite 
ore 37km underground from 
the Woodsmith Mine to the MHF 
at Wilton International. A high-
capacity conveyor will transport 
mined ore within a 4.3 metre 
diameter, concrete-lined tunnel. 
The MTS incorporates industry 
standard equipment, providing a 
transport system that is reliable, 
low-maintenance and low-cost. 
The MTS is being constructed to 
operate at 20 Mtpa capacity.
The MTS will be constructed using 
three tunnel boring machines 
(TBMs). TBMs are a widely used 
tunnel construction methodology 
designed for safe and efficient 
operation. TBMs will be launched 
from the Woodsmith Mine site, the 
MHF and from an intermediate site 
along the route of the tunnel at 
Lockwood Beck. The MTS is being 
constructed within the Redcar 
Mudstone, a geological formation 
which can be excavated efficiently 
but has the structural integrity to 
accommodate a tunnel.
Materials Handling Facility 
Located at Teesside on the Wilton 
International site, the MHF will consist 
of the plant and equipment 
necessary for a simple and cost-
effective granulation process to 
produce bulk volumes of POLY4. 
The polyhalite ore will undergo a 
simple process of crushing, grinding, 
granulation, screening and drying to 
produce the finished POLY4 granular 
product. 
The MHF will have an initial phase 1 
production capacity of 10 Mtpa and 
a footprint that will enable an increase 
in capacity to 20 Mtpa. The MHF is 
large enough to accommodate the 
necessary storage requirement for up 
to 20 Mtpa of POLY4 and sufficient 
operating capacity to transfer finished 
product from the MHF to the harbour 
facility for efficient ship loading.

Harbour Facility
The Project benefits from 
being close to a port, relative 
to other fertilizer producers. 
The Bran Sands site on the 
River Tees is ideally located 
for the bulk export of POLY4. 
Finished product will be 
transported approximately 
3.5km from the MHF on a covered 
overland conveyor to a new quay 
which will be constructed on the 
River Tees. Long-travel, wide-span 
ship loaders will transfer finished 
product into a ship’s hold at 
5,000 tonnes per hour.
Expansion to facilitate an increase 
in production to 13 Mtpa and 
then to 20 Mtpa will require the 
installation of a second berth 
and a second ship loader. 
The Bran Sands site has the 
capacity to accommodate 
any future expansion.

Macro-nutrients necessary for effective plant growth
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Market context
WELL POSITIONED 
TO MEET DEMAND
Fertilizers are a fundamental 
requirement of modern agriculture 
and the global food supply chain.
Every growing season, plants take up 
nutrients from the soil, depleting those 
that are naturally available. Unless 
the nutrients are replaced, soil will 
become nutrient deficient and a 
plant’s ability to grow efficiently will 
be reduced.
There are six macro-nutrients all 
plants require: nitrogen (N), 
phosphorus (P), potassium (K), 
magnesium (Mg), sulphur (S) and 
calcium (Ca). Each nutrient serves a 
different vital role in plant function, 
structure and development. 
A balance of nutrients is necessary to 
maximise nutrient use efficiency, as a 
shortage of any single nutrient may 
compromise a plant’s overall health. 
This is because most nutrients have a 
specific biochemical function.
According to the United Nations 
Department of Economic and Social 
Affairs, the world’s population 
numbered nearly 7.6 billion as of 
mid-2017, implying the world has 
added approximately one billion 
inhabitants over the last 12 years. 
Population growth rates of 1.1% per 
year mean 83 million people are 
added to global population annually. 
This will result in a forecast global 
population of 9.8 billion by 2050. In 
response to this growth, food 
production will have to increase by 
>60% to keep pace with demand. 
The increase in food demand could, 
in part, be achieved by devoting 
more land to agriculture. However, 
additional land is not readily 
available. 
The more sustainable option is to 
make better use of the already 
available agricultural land and adopt 
more effective and efficient fertilizer 
practices. 15

POLY4 
EXPLAINED
WHAT IS POLY4? 
POLY4 is derived from the naturally 
occurring mineral, polyhalite. POLY4 
is unique in that it provides a natural 
combination of four of the six key 
macro-nutrients plants require to 
grow effectively: potassium (K),

In addition to its multi-nutrient 
content, POLY4 is certified for organic 
use and has a number of other 
positive characteristics which make it 
suitable for widespread commercial 
use, including: 
• suitability for chloride sensitive crops;
• efficient nutrient release profile;
• ability to reduce agricultural 
impact on the environment by 
improving fertilizer use efficiency, 
reducing erosion and nutrient loss;
• availability for use as a direct 
application fertilizer; and
• compatibility for use with other 
fertilizer products.

ESTABLISHING  
THE GLOBAL MARKET 
FOR POLY4
A multi-channel market adoption 
approach has been established to 
achieve awareness and market 
penetration of POLY4 into the 
established fertilizer industry. 
Long-term partnerships have 
been developed with universities, 
customers, governments and food 
manufacturers to validate the 
efficacy of POLY4 and to ensure the 
Company’s comprehensive research 
and development programme 
is appropriate for the global 
marketplace. These partnerships, 
combined with a targeted regional 
sales strategy, have enabled Sirius 
to enter into a number of binding 
large-volume, long-term supply 
agreements under which customers 
have agreed to buy a minimum 
amount of POLY4 once production 
begins and pay a given price. 
To date, the Company has entered 
into supply agreements totalling 
4.4 Mtpa at their respective full 
volumes, with the majority of pricing 
mechanisms linked to the underlying 
nutrient value and competing 
product benchmark pricing.

DELIVERING RESULTS 
A BRIGHT FUTURE
Chief Executive’s review
2017 was a milestone year for us, 
with commencement of construction, 
incremental supply agreements 
signed (bringing the total to 4.4 million 
tonnes per annum), a move to the 
Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange and inclusion in the 
FTSE 250 among the highlights. 
Our numerous successes along the 
development journey drive us to 
approach this next phase of 
development with the same ownership, 
belief and urgency which are some of 
the key values which define who we 
are. For those who have supported 
us over the years I hope the 
commencement of construction 
provides further validation of our 
commitment to succeed. 
Safety
Safety is paramount to the success of 
our business. Our culture places 
safety at the forefront of everything 
we do and we are continuously 
engaged with our contractors and 
consultants to ensure they adopt our 
safety culture and company values. 
Two recordable incidents have 
occurred during the first year of 
construction and we are constantly 
working to improve our processes and 
find safer ways of working in order to 
ensure that we all return home to our 
families at the end of each day. 
For those who have supported 
us over the years I hope the 
commencement of construction 
provides further validation of our 
commitment to succeed.
CHRIS FRASER. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 19
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
4 May 2017: formal commencement of 
construction
Expanding global research and 
development programme
Our strategy
The Company has a clear and robust 
strategy and is focused on executing 
this strategy successfully. 
Our strategy is to:
• build a world-class, long-life, 
low-cost production facility;
• develop an industry leading product;
• penetrate existing markets and 
drive long-term value; and
• execute a financing plan that 
delivers returns for shareholders.
Along our journey we have made 
strategic decisions within this 
framework, whether it be switching to 
a more efficient, low impact transport 
system or even the nature of our 
product. Optimisation through 
evolution will always be at the heart 
of our strategic decision-making 
process. Through this process, 
we believe that the Sirius value 
proposition continues to grow 
and be further enhanced. 
Build a world-class, long-life, 
low-cost production facility
It has always been our intention to 
construct a production facility which 
enables us to maximise the potential 
of our unique polyhalite resource. The 
scale, thickness and quality of the 
deposit means highly efficient, bulk 
mining methods can be employed to 
maximise output over hundreds of 
years and these considerations are at 
the forefront of our approach to mine 
design and construction. We believe the 
asset we are constructing will be among 
the most cost-competitive multi-nutrient 
fertilizer producers globally.
For those of you who have driven past 
the Woodsmith Mine site over the 
past 12 months you will be impressed 
with its transformation. Formal 
commencement of construction 
started officially on 4 May 2017 and 
the work completed over the course 
of the year is the first step in executing 
on this part of our strategy. 
Develop an industry-leading 
product
POLY4 is a natural, low chloride, 
multi-nutrient fertilizer, the likes of 
which has never been widely 
available in the major growing 
regions of the world. Our ever-
expanding global agronomy 
programme provides partners and 
potential customers with an 
independently validated dataset 
which demonstrates the efficacy of 
POLY4 on a wide range of different 
crops in varying geographic and 
climatic conditions. Leading industry 
participants and potential customers 
are excited by the prospects of POLY4 
and are enthusiastic about introducing 
it into their product portfolios. 
 
During 2017 we articulated the four 
cornerstones of POLY4: Effectiveness, 
Efficiency, Flexibility and Sustainability. 
The cornerstones describe POLY4’s 
unique value proposition and are 
proving to be an effective marketing 
tool. I encourage you to visit 
the POLY4.com website to learn more 
about the product.
Penetrate existing markets and drive 
long-term value
We have a three-step approach to 
our marketing strategy:
• Substitution – utilising POLY4 as a 
substitute for other existing fertilizers 
which include one or more of the 
same primary nutrients contained 
in polyhalite. This disruptive 
approach will ensure POLY4 is 
widely available in all markets. 
• Market growth – today there is an 
unmet demand for lower chloride 
potassium sources, and making 
POLY4 widely available at a 
commercial price point will unlock 
new sources of demand and 
opportunities to adopt greener 
and more sustainable agricultural 
practices. 
• Performance – our successful 
extensive crop trial programme 
consistently demonstrates strong 
performance from POLY4 and we 
believe this performance will 
underpin premium pricing for the 
product over the long term.

Chief Executive’s review 
continued
The Company continues to work 
hard at building its customer base 
and I was pleased to welcome Wilmar 
International as a customer during 
2017. They are the leading agri-
business in South East Asia and will be 
a strong partner for the Company. 
Execute a financing plan that 
delivers returns for shareholders
The Company has taken a rigorous, 
phased approach to executing the 
financing plan. At each stage of 
development, appropriate capital 
has been raised to deliver the next 
development milestone. 2016 saw 
the first successful completion of the 
stage 1 financing, which provided 
the equity and equity-linked capital 
components of the construction 
financing plan. 
In 2017 the Company obtained a 
Premium Listing on the Main Market 
and was included in the FTSE 250. 
Behind the scenes, work was 
underway to prepare for the 
execution of the Company’s stage 2 
financing in late 2018. It is intended 
that this financing will be 100% debt in 
nature and ultimately provide all of 
the capital required to complete the 
construction component of the 
Company’s strategy. 
The year ahead
2017 has been a year of meaningful 
progress on the ground in North 
Yorkshire and in the global fertilizer 
markets. 2018 will be another year of 
significant progress on all fronts, with 
that progress ultimately culminating 
in the successful completion of the 
stage 2 financing. 
There is a lot more work to do in 
order to successfully execute on the 
Company’s strategy but I am confident 
our team has the necessary expertise to 
deliver. The culture we have throughout 
the organisation is reflected in our 
corporate values. These values embody 
why we have succeeded in achieving 
a number of challenging milestones 
but also how we will continue to deliver 
on what we set out to achieve. It is our 
shared belief in achieving our goals 
and our unwavering drive to succeed 
that will see us successfully through 
the next phase of development. 
Thank you all for your ongoing support.

BUILD A WORLD-CLASS,  
LONG-LIFE, LOW-COST 
PRODUCTION FACILITY
Strategy in action
1
We have engaged 
the services of world-
class construction 
partners to develop 
our innovative mine 
which is being 
constructed to extract 
large volumes of 
polyhalite at low-cost.
We are utilising proven, well 
understood construction techniques 
to build what will be the largest mine 
of its type anywhere in the world. From 
the outset it has been our intention to 
construct a low-impact, large-scale 
operation with a long operating life.
The Woodsmith Mine is being 
constructed to handle an initial 
capacity of 10 Mtpa but is scalable 
to up to 20 Mtpa of polyhalite using 
largely existing infrastructure. An 
increase in production capacity to 
20 Mtpa would be achieved through 
expansion following ramp up and will 
be funded by operating cash flow. 
Mining at the Woodsmith Mine will 
adopt simple and conventional bulk 
mining methods to enable maximum 
extraction and low-cost operations. 
From the base of the shafts we can 
mine in all directions, maximising our 
ability to optimise ramp up from initial 
production. Using a combination of 
room and pillar and drill and blast 
mining methods we can excavate the 
thicker areas of the seam up to a 
height of 40 metres. 
We are constructing a mine to realise 
the potential of our world-class 
deposit. The exceptional nature of 
our resource means that all mine 
development will be excavated 
entirely within the polyhalite seam. 
This will result in a 1:1 mining ratio 
ensuring that every tonne of ore 
mined becomes a tonne of POLY4. 
To efficiently move large volumes of 
polyhalite ore from the Woodsmith 
Mine to the MHF at Wilton 
International, we are constructing 
a 37km long, concrete-lined 
subterranean MTS. The MTS 
construction employs proven, 
industry-leading tunnelling 
techniques to establish a high 
capacity transport system, capable 
of transporting up to 20 Mtpa of 
polyhalite ore. The MTS has been 
designed to be in place for the life 
of the mine with little ongoing 
maintenance requirement. 
Our innovative approach to 
construction effectively moves the 
minehead from its location within 
the North York Moors National Park to 
the harbour facility on Teesside, thus 
enabling the efficiencies which come 
with close proximity to an export 
facility.

POLY4 is the trademark name of Sirius Minerals’ 
flagship granular polyhalite product. 
In addition to nutritional benefits brought about by 
the chemical composition of POLY4, our product has 
a range of characteristics which distinguish it from 
existing products and make it an attractive option for 
end users. POLY4 has four key attributes that benefit 
farmers by increasing their profits in a sustainable way 
through improved crop yields, reduced costs or both.
1. Efficiency
POLY4 is an efficient multi-nutrient fertilizer:
• Improves fertilizer use efficiency by delivering 
greater nutrient uptake;
• High nutrient density – delivers four macro-nutrients 
in one easy-to-use, cost-effective granular delivery 
system.
Trial results show that POLY4 delivers better nutrient uptake 
for both macro and micro-nutrients. This is a key profit 
driver as more nutrients are used by the crop for yield 
and quality improvements. 
POLY4’s multi-nutrient properties help farmers to control 
costs by decreasing fertilizer and farm inputs, while 
reducing nutrient waste by delivering nutrients over a time 
frame, which more closely aligns with the needs of a plant.
POLY4’s nutrient release profile supports the crop 
from establishment through to harvest compared 
to conventional fertilizers, which tend to be applied 
and deliver nutrients ahead of crop demand. 27
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
2. Effectiveness
POLY4 is an effective multi-nutrient fertilizer:
• Improves both yield and quality;
• Improves macro and micro nutrient uptake; 
• Minimises crop losses through disease resilience;
• Has a desirable nutrient release profile; 
• Granular product that handles, stores, blends and 
spreads effectively.
By improving the availability of a broad spectrum of 
nutrients for plants, POLY4 promotes yield, quality and 
nutritional health, which can minimise crop losses through 
disease. These macro and micro-nutrients also become 
available over a longer time frame, which more closely 
meets the nutrient uptake pattern of the plant. 
Available in granulated, powdered or standard form, 
POLY4 is compatible with all major input sources for NPK 
blending, demonstrating both chemical and physical 
compatibility. In a small number of cases minor caking 
was observed after 17 months in storage, which far 
exceeds the practical storage period of a blend. POLY4 
also spreads effectively up to 36 metres, preventing 
uneven fertilizer distribution and subsequently reduction 
in crop yields.
3. Flexibility
POLY4 is a flexible multi-nutrient fertilizer:
• Low chloride and pH neutral product that can be 
used on all plants and soils in all growing climates;
• Successful as a straight fertilizer or as a component 
of blend formulations;
• No negative interactions with other fertilizers;
• Allows a farmer to choose the timing of application.
As a low chloride, multi-nutrient fertilizer, POLY4 avoids 
toxicity issues commonly associated with the application 
of potassium chloride (MOP) and other high chloride 
fertilizer sources. Many crops benefit from a reduction of 
chlorides in the soil. POLY4 also has no detrimental effect 
on a soil’s electrical conductivity or pH, both of which can 
be harmful to crops. 
 
POLY4 can be used directly or in an NPK blend to supply 
potassium, sulphur, magnesium, calcium and a range of 
valuable micro-nutrients. Farmers can rely on POLY4 to 
maintain its granular physical integrity until it reaches the 
field and, as there are no negative interactions with other 
fertilizers, POLY4 is a beneficial yet safe addition to a blend.
As a granular product, POLY4’s nutrients are readily 
available to the plant, and its release profile gives farmers 
the flexibility to choose the timing of application.
4. Sustainability
POLY4 is a sustainable multi-nutrient fertilizer:
• Improves soil strength, structure and nutrient 
legacy; 
• Reduces agriculture’s impact on the environment 
by improving fertilizer use efficiency, reducing 
erosion and nutrient loss; 
• Certified for organic use;
• Excellent environmental profile.
The calcium within POLY4 helps to increase a soil’s 
resilience to compaction, erosion and runoff, which 
allows a plant to access the nutrients it needs to thrive 
and reduces nutrient waste into watercourses and 
beyond. 
Application of the broad spectrum of nutrients that 
POLY4 delivers can make soil-bound nutrients more 
available to the plant and prevent nutrient mining  
– a common threat to sustainable crop production.
Polyhalite is a naturally-occurring mineral which results 
in a low carbon footprint for POLY4, offering farmers an 
effective, yet responsible, fertilizer solution. The 
organically-certified POLY4 has no requirement for 
chemical processing, has the lowest CO
2
 emissions 
and is more environmentally-friendly compared to most 
fertilizer products. POLY4 helps to rebalance and 
reconstruct the soil structure supporting sustainable 
land management.

2. Market growth
Multiple growth opportunities have been identified which 
build on POLY4’s suitability for crops that are sensitive to 
chloride and also POLY4’s potential to address the 
increasingly recognised problem of vast areas of farmland 
becoming deficient in sulphur. These opportunities are 
compounded further by the growing demand for the 
adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices.
POLY4 is low in chlorides. Currently 32% of global potassium 
is used on chloride-sensitive crops. Only 9% of this supply is 
chloride-free. This represents an incremental opportunity of 
circa 70 Mtpa for chloride-free fertilizers such as POLY4. The 
agronomic benefits of chloride-free potassium are widely 
known however, due to limited supply and premium prices, 
the market is restricted. 
1. Substitution
There is a well-established market for the component 
nutrients contained in POLY4. This market is currently 
supplied by a range of fertilizer products and POLY4 has 
the potential to be used as a substitute for other existing 
fertilizers which include one or more of the same primary 
nutrients contained in POLY4.
Independent market analysis suggests the total market 
for these potentially contestable fertilizers is expected to 
increase from 376 Mtpa in 2018 to 440 Mtpa in 2025 in 
polyhalite equivalent terms (representing the amount of 
polyhalite which would be necessary to fulfil the current 
potassium, sulphur and magnesium nutrient demand). 
This opportunity is approximately 20 times the maximum 
output when the Woodsmith Mine is operating at 20 Mtpa 
capacity.
Our strategy is to penetrate and disrupt the 
existing market via a three-phased approach of 
substitution, market growth and performance. 29
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
POLY4 has a sulphur content of 19%. The Sulphur Institute 
estimates that the world plant nutrient sulphur deficit could 
require annual application of 60 Mtpa of polyhalite 
equivalent sulphur to address the imbalance. Unless nutrient 
deficits are addressed, nutrient mining will increase year 
on year. 
Sustainable product characteristics are becoming more 
attractive to customers. The world’s population is predicted 
to hit 9.8 billion by 2050. Over the next 35 years more food 
needs to be produced than has been to date in human 
history. The pressure this places on the agricultural industry 
will require farmers to use balanced fertilization to increase 
yields. Application of fertilizers is identified as a significant 
source of greenhouse gases. Increased fertilizer use requires 
an ever-increasing need to improve fertilizer use efficiency. 
The estimated value of global warming potential (GWP) of 
POLY4 is 0.051kg CO
2
e per kg of product: considerably lower 
than other potassium and sulphur-based fertilizers.
3. Performance
Application of low-chloride potassium fertilizers has 
been shown to improve crop yield, quality and taste 
and also improve plant resistance to drought, frost, 
insects and diseases. This, combined with the multi-
nutrient composition of our product, means POLY4 has 
universal application. Our extensive R&D programme 
demonstrates POLY4 can be used on a multitude of 
crops in numerous geographies with varying climatic 
conditions. The way POLY4 interacts in the soil and its 
interplay between chemical elements means crucial 
nutrients are readily available when plants need them 
throughout the growing cycle. These benefits manifest 
in increased yields and stronger, healthier crops. 
Independently validated crop trial results demonstrate 
POLY4 works effectively and outperforms traditional 
products such as MOP on a range of high value and 
broadacre crops such as tomatoes, corn, soybean and 
wheat. To date, over 260 trials have been initiated on 32 
different crops in 17 countries.

BUSINESS MODEL
Our value proposition
Operational volume 
and margin
The fundamental drivers which 
generate value for the Company are 
volume and margin. In recognition 
of this, our business has been 
designed to deliver high production 
capacity and low operating costs.
We believe the Company can deliver 
industry-leading margins of between 
70–85% which will generate significant 
value across a range of volume and 
price scenarios and ensure our 
business can be robust and 
responsive to changing market 
conditions.
The matrix below illustrates this point 
and also indicates how the Company 
expects the business to evolve. The 
volume axis shows the production 
ramp up from 10 Mtpa to 20 Mtpa 
and the margin axis shows the 
forecasted cash margins resulting 
from a range of POLY4 prices.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Chief Financial Officer’s review
2017 has seen a step change in the 
level of development activity on the 
Project as a result of the successful 
completion of the stage 1 financing 
in 2016. This year has been the first in 
which the Group has not had funding 
constraints over its development 
activities and as a result the value 
of spend on the Project activities in 
2017 has grown materially. 
The Group’s operating loss for 2017 
was £24.0 million compared to £16.9 
million in 2016, with the increased 
loss being driven by an increase in 
activity following the completion of 
the stage 1 financing. The Group has 
historically made a loss which has 
been largely reflective of the Group’s 
prudent approach to expensing 
all indirect and overhead costs 
through the development phase 
and this practice has continued 
since construction commenced. 
Furthermore, the Group’s operating 
costs in 2017 have contained a 
number of one-off corporate costs 
which are not reflective of the 
underlying level of overhead spend, 
with the key items being as follows:
2018 will be another 
transformational year for Sirius as 
construction advances and the 
development of key infrastructure 
gathers momentum.
THOMAS STALEY. CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 35
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
During 2017 the Group made a total loss of £78.9 million compared to a loss of 
£23.0 million in 2016. The following table sets out the main drivers of the Group’s 
loss for the period. 
As can be seen from the table, 
the main driver of the loss is the 
fair value re-measurement of the 
derivatives associated with the 
convertible note and, to a lesser 
extent, the royalty financing. These 
derivative liabilities increase in size 
as the share price of the Company 
increases. With the share price 
increasing by more than 20% 
over the period, the size of the 
loss attributable to the derivatives 
has increased materially. As the 
convertible notes are converted 
and the royalty financing is 
drawn, these derivative liabilities 
will be reclassified from liabilities 
to equity and require no cash 
settlement by the Group.

Chief Financial Officer’s review 
continued
The Company has deployed £233.7 million during 2017 for the purposes 
of developing the Project. The table below breaks out the key items:
Total capital expenditure incurred 
for the period was £138.1 million with 
a significant portion of that unpaid 
as at the balance sheet date. In 
addition to this, numerous financial 
commitments for items such as the 
permanent winders and D-walling 
activities have been made and 
these items are not reflected in 
the financial statements. The local 
authorities’ security requirements 
reflect a combination of providing 
reinstatement security for construction 
works and the security requirements 
of the Section 106 agreements. 
Total funds at the end of December 
2017 were £468.5 million, comprising 
bank deposits and cash equivalents 
of £394.0 million and restricted 
cash of £74.5 million. The table 
opposite provides a breakdown 
of movements through the period 
in total funds, split between 
available cash (comprising cash 
and cash equivalents and bank 
deposits) and restricted cash.
A number of convertible bond 
conversion notices were received 
during the period resulting in 22% of 
the initial bonds being converted. 
Because of these conversions, 
291 million shares were issued 
during the period. 1,552 bonds 
remain outstanding with an 
aggregate face value of 
US$310 million.

With so many key components 
underway simultaneously, our 
disciplined approach to capital 
expenditure will be maintained. The 
successful execution of stage 2 
financing will be a significant 
milestone as it will secure the balance 
of the capital funding required to 
complete construction and will 
contribute to the ongoing de-risking 
of our North Yorkshire polyhalite 
development.
Thank you for your ongoing support.

SUSTAINABLE 
CONTRIBUTION  
TO GLOBAL  
FOOD SECURITY
Responsible business 
continued
The world’s population 
is set to increase by a 
third by 2050 and the 
demand for food 
production is forecasted 
to increase by >60%.
Global food security
Over the next 35 years more food 
needs to be produced than has 
been to date in human history. 
At the same time, the land available 
for farming is decreasing and soils 
have widespread deficiencies in the 
nutrients that plants need to grow. 
Food production rates are already 
struggling to keep up, yet the global 
agricultural system is required to 
produce more in the future.
• POLY4 has the lowest CO
2
e 
emissions compared to other 
fertilizer products.
• The lower CO
2
e emissions 
associated with POLY4 are 
due to its environmentally 
friendly and sustainable 
method of production.
Promoting sustainable 
agricultural practices
The conventional wisdom that  
more fertilizer brings more yield has 
resulted in the over-application  
of the wrong fertilizers in many 
regions, resulting in soil erosion  
and degradation that has led to 
pollution, increased land conversion 
and habitat loss. 
What is required is for farmers and 
food producers to use balanced 
fertilization to increase yields and 
improve soil health.

The Company is committed to 
supporting the best and most 
sustainable fertilizer application 
practices through its ongoing 
research and development 
programme. To date this has 
involved over 260 trials, on 32 crops, 
in 17 countries. The programme 
consistently demonstrates that 
POLY4 improves crop yield and 
quality and has positive 
environmental characteristics.
POLY4 is certified for organic use and 
has no requirement for chemical 
processing. As a result, it has a lower 
carbon footprint compared to other 
fertilizers. Furthermore, POLY4 has also 
been shown to improve soil strength, 
structure, nutrient legacy and reduce 
agriculture’s impact by improving 
fertilizer use efficiency (ensuring more 
fertilizer is taken up by the plant and 
not lost into the environment).
Good nutrient stewardship – ensuring 
nutrients are applied at the correct 
rate, time and place – is a critical 
element of a more sustainable 
approach. The Company is working 
with a range of stakeholders to 
promote these more sustainable 
practices in key agricultural markets.
Fertilizers are identified as a significant 
source of greenhouse gases (GHG). 
The estimated value of the global 
warming potential (GWP) of POLY4 is 
0.051 kg CO
2
e per kg of product. This 
is low compared with other fertilizers 
and considerably lower than other 
potassium (K) source fertilizers such 
as MOP; (0.13-0.265 kg CO

common sulphur (S) source fertilizers 
such as ammonium sulphate (0.58 kg

OUR COMMITMENT 
COMMUNITY  
ENGAGEMENT
Responsible business 
continued
The Group takes its 
responsibility to the 
local area very seriously 
and is committed to 
taking an active and 
positive role in the local 
community.
Education and skills
Sirius believes in supporting young 
people to fulfil their potential from 
an early age and continues to 
deliver its extensive education 
outreach programme. 
A key aspect of this is to broaden 
aspirations and raise awareness of 
science, technology, engineering 
and maths (STEM) related careers. 
In 2017 alone the Company has taken 
part in 35 education events and 
activities with primary and secondary 
school students in North Yorkshire and 
Tees Valley. People from across the 
Sirius team have been encouraged 
to get involved, particularly younger 
team members, to talk to students 
about their role at Sirius Minerals 
and how they got involved.
The Company is proud to have 
been the headline sponsor of 
Scarborough Engineering Week 
for the last six consecutive years. 
Work also started on a £1 million 
programme in Tees Valley and 
North Yorkshire to support the STEM 
curriculum over the next ten years. 
Sirius continues to provide 
opportunities for young people 
across the area, including 
apprenticeships, work placements 
and taking on new graduates. 
Sirius Minerals Foundation 
The Sirius Minerals Foundation 
has been established as an 
independent charity to support 
community projects that benefit the 
local area. 
During operations, Sirius Minerals will 
contribute an annual royalty of 0.5% 
of revenue to the Foundation. 
For the construction period, Sirius has 
made an initial payment of £2 million 
to the Foundation. Earlier this year, 
the first funding round was opened 
to support community projects, 
awarding grants of between £500 
and £5,000. In December, 80 projects 
were awarded a total of around 
£300,000 across the local area.
The activities funded include: 
improving community facilities and 
restoration works, new equipment, 
supporting families and vulnerable 
people, environmental enhancements, 
and education and training.

ENVIRONMENTAL
PRESERVATION
Responsible business 
continued
From the outset, the 
Company has been 
committed to limiting 
the environmental 
impact of the Project 
as much as possible. 
This is reflected in the 
low-impact design, 
operational philosophy 
and approach to 
construction.
This section summarises the 
Company’s approach to sustainable 
development, which is covered in 
more detail in the 2017 Corporate 
Responsibility Report, available on our 
Company website.
Sustainable design
Sirius is proud of the design 
choices it has made throughout 
the Project’s evolution, to ensure 
that it has the lowest impact 
possible on the surrounding area.
Woodsmith Mine is located in North 
York Moors National Park and the 
Company has set a new standard 
in sustainable design in recognition 
of this. The number and size of the 
buildings has been reduced to 
a minimum, which together with 
extensive landscaping and planting, 
will ensure the site is screened and 
blends with the surrounding area.
Mined ore will be transported 
underground, in recognition of the 
sensitivity of the area, to the MHF 
at Wilton International in Teesside. 
To produce POLY4 involves a simple 
granulation process which does 
not require chemical processing 
and has no waste products.
Carbon emissions
The Company is always looking at 
ways to be more energy efficient 
during the intensive construction 
period in order to minimise its  
carbon footprint.
In line with regulatory requirements 
the Company’s Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) performance is calculated 
using the latest Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol and set out in the table 
below. This includes direct GHG 
emissions from the combustion of 
fuels (Scope 1) and indirect GHG 
emissions from the consumption 
of purchased electricity, steam or 
other sources of energy (Scope 2). 
As reporting procedures mature, 
the Company will look to include 
other indirect GHG emissions 
(Scope 3). In 2017 emissions 
totalled 2,063 tonnes of CO
2
e.
tCO 2 e
 Scope 1 emissions 1,943
 Scope 2 emissions 120
 Gross carbon emissions 2,063
  In t e n si t y me t r i c :  
per £10 million spend 129
Within the constraints of a large 
construction project the Company 
is working, together with its 
contractors, to proactively reduce 
carbon emissions. Measures 
include using low emission fuels 
for site plant, reducing the reliance 
on diesel generated power and 
implementing a travel plan to restrict 
the number of vehicle movements 
associated with the Project.
The Company is providing 
significant funding, through 
its Section 106 agreements, 
to safeguard and enhance 
the local landscape and to 
offset carbon emissions. 45

Construction
The Company is working closely 
with the relevant authorities, 
statutory bodies and contractors 
to implement environmental and 
mitigation plans for each phase 
of construction. 
These ensure that the stringent 
planning conditions are adhered to 
and that impacts are limited across 
a range of matters including lighting, 
noise, visual and landscape, wildlife 
and ecology, hydrology and air 
quality.
In addition, the Company is providing 
significant funding, through its 
Section 106 agreements, to 
safeguard and enhance the local 
landscape and to offset carbon 
emissions. This will amount to a total 
of £130 million over the lifetime of the 
Project. During 2017, first payments of 
£122,500 for the landscape and 
ecology contribution and £85,000 for 
tree planting were made to North York 
Moors National Park Authority.

OUR PEOPLE
DELIVERING
Responsible business 
continued
201 7 was an exciting 
year of growth for the 
Sirius team, which saw us 
double our headcount 
with 1 16 people now 
directly employed 
by the Group, an 
impressive year-on-year 
increase of 1 1 1%. 
We welcomed new members into 
the business, predominantly in 
Scarborough but also into London 
and further afield, strengthening 
our presence and key business 
relationships in North America, 
Latin America and South East Asia.
Building a more diverse and inclusive 
workforce is critical to developing a 
sustainable and successful business. 
Our ambition is to attract, develop 
and retain talented individuals who 
reflect the communities where we 
do business, supporting the local 
community to benefit from the 
opportunities that Sirius can provide.
We continue to be successful in hiring 
local people to join our expanding 
workforce; 69% of total employees 
have been sourced from the Yorkshire 
region, reinforcing our commitment to 
the community in which we operate.
Empowering our people
Our people are critical to the 
success of this project and we 
strive to empower, motivate and 
encourage everyone to contribute. 
During 2017, we have been promoting 
the behaviours and values that have 
contributed to the many achievements 
to date.
We are one team focused on one clear 
goal and during the year we have 
introduced various development and 
performance management activities to 
encourage everyone to play their part 
in delivering the 2021 first production 
targets. Recruitment of new colleagues 
now looks at the ‘way’ people work as 
well as their technical capabilities. 
We’ve designed a new induction 
programme, established a process for 
clear goal setting, launched values 
alignment sessions and a monthly 
values recognition scheme. 
We strive to promote an open and 
honest working environment, in 
which everyone has a voice and 
feels confident to share their ideas. 
In December, a new independent 
disclosure line was introduced called 
the ‘Speak-Up Line’ which allows the 
workforce to report matters of 
concern confidentially. This further 
reinforces our commitment to safety 
and invites everyone to take 
responsibility to ensure that we can 
move forward at pace by respecting 
the safety and security of others, 
ourselves and our environment.
Growing our people
In addition to ongoing professional 
skills development, staff regularly 
have the opportunity to engage in 
wider community events.
The Company has participated in 
education outreach events, local 
careers fairs as well as presenting at 
national conferences; all of which has 
supported the personal development 
of team members as well as 
promoting good relationships in the 
region and markets in which we 
operate. During 2017 Sirius has 
supported various charity activities 
both on an individual and group 
basis, raising over £9,000.
69% of total 
employees have 
been sourced 
from the Yorkshire 
region. 47

Resolution House
In September, the Company was 
excited to move into Resolution 
House, our new headquarters. 
The open plan office boasts space, 
technology and a fresh environment 
transforming the way that people 
collaborate and integrate. Resolution 
House is an inspirational workplace not 
only for our existing staff but for those 
that aspire to be part of the team.
The London office also completed 
a refurbishment in 2017 and both 
locations now have the facilities 
and technology that represents a 
workplace fit for the future.
Looking forward
2018 will be another year of steady 
hiring to expand our workforce and 
introduce key talent predominantly 
into the construction team.
We will continue to strengthen the 
building blocks required to lead and 
develop a growing workforce and 
ensure that everyone can contribute 
to the delivery of the business 
priorities. Positive reinforcement of our 
unique culture and investment in 
development activities to drive our 
health and safety agenda is also a 
top priority for 2018.

IDENTIFYING AND 
MANAGING RISKS
Risk management
The Group’s strategy exposes it to various risks. 
The Board is responsible for determining the nature 
and extent of the risks that the Group is willing to 
take in achieving its strategic objectives.
The Board has an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the principal risks faced 
by the Group.
The Board has performed a robust 
assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, taking into account 
those that would threaten its business 
model (see page 32), future 
performance, solvency or liquidity, 
as well as the Group’s strategic 
objectives (see page 22). In addition, 
the Board considered how risks evolve 
and potential emerging risks. The 
most significant risks arising from this 
assessment, including details of their 
management and mitigation, are 
detailed in the Strategic Report on 
pages 49 to 52.
The Group has a system of internal 
controls which is designed to manage 
and mitigate these risks and which 
the Board is responsible for. This 
system is in accordance with the 
Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting as issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council and 
its key features include:
• a defined organisational structure 
with appropriate delegation of 
authority and clearly defined lines 
of reporting and responsibility, 
whereby the incurring of 
expenditure and assumption of 
contractual commitment can only 
be approved by specified 
individuals and within pre-defined 
limits;
• formal authorisation procedures for 
all banking transactions, 
expenditure and investment 
decisions;
• a comprehensive system for 
budgeting and planning whereby 
annual budgets are prepared and 
approved by the Board and 
subsequently monitored with 
variances reported to the Board at 
Board meetings; and
• regular and comprehensive 
information provided to the 
Board from the Group’s senior 
management team, covering 
financial performance and key 
performance indicators, including 
non-financial measures.
The Group’s system of internal controls 
(including each of those detailed 
above) has been in place for the year 
under review and up to the date of 
the approval of this Annual Report. 
This system is regularly reviewed by 
the Board and a review of the 
effectiveness of all material controls 
was carried out by the Audit 
Committee during the year. This 
effectiveness review considered the 
design of controls associated with key 
risks and the evidence as to their 
proper operation throughout the 
year. No significant failings or 
weaknesses were uncovered in the 
course of this review.
Brexit
The Group is aware that the 
referendum vote in June 2016 
pursuant to which the United 
Kingdom has indicated its intent to 
withdraw from the European Union 
might present risks for companies, 
including uncertainty about the 
process, timings and consequences 
of the final withdrawal. The Group 
does not currently trade with Europe. 
It is also not in receipt of EU foreign 
direct investment (FDI). Most of the 
Group’s future sales are likely to be in 
US Dollars. Therefore, the risk relating 
to Brexit is low for the Group and is not 
considered one of its principal risks. 
The Group continues to monitor 
political, regulatory and legislative 
aspects of the withdrawal from the 
European Union and is aware of the 
aspects of this potential risk. 49

STRATEGIC RISKS
Exploration and 
development
The Group is completely dependent on 
the ability of the Project and engineering 
team to successfully deliver operational 
mine and infrastructure facilities.
The geological, mining, processing and 
infrastructure challenges of the Project are 
inherent in a mining and infrastructure 
Project of this size, and are not of an 
extraordinary level or nature.
Site investigation work through a programme 
of seismic surveys and investigative boreholes 
continues as part of the Project. As engineering 
progresses this risk naturally reduces.
Development risks are assessed, evaluated 
and reduced as far as reasonably possible 
as part of the Project management function 
performed by our experienced owner’s team.
FINANCIAL RISKS
Liquidity risks
The Group’s current activities do not 
generate revenues and there is a risk 
that, despite raising the initial funds to 
commence construction, we will have 
insufficient funds to finalise development 
and construction of the Project to a point 
of production where the Group 
generates positive operating cash flows, 
which will affect our ability to manage 
operating costs and capital expenditure. 
There is no assurance that adequate 
funds will be available when they are 
required. 
We have a strong Board and management 
team with extensive experience in financing 
large, multi-billion Dollar Projects.
We have been successful in raising funds in 
the recent past, including in 2016 to 
commence construction of the Project and 
signing a non-binding mandate letter with 
financial institutions in relation to a potential 
senior debt financing which would fund the 
majority of the remainder of the operating 
costs and capital expenditure required to 
finalise the development and construction of 
the Project and reach a point of production 
where the Project generates positive 
operating cash flows. 
Commodity price 
There is a risk that fertilizer prices, 
including potash and polyhalite, could 
fall to levels at which it would not be 
economically viable to develop the 
Project. Such conditions would materially 
and adversely affect production, 
earnings and the financial position and 
could result in the cessation of mining 
activities that become uneconomic or 
could result in the economics of the 
Project not being sufficient to enable the 
Group to raise the next stage of funding 
to take the Project to production, halt or 
delay the development of new areas to 
mine, and reduce funds available for 
proving reserves, resulting in the 
depletion of reserves. There is no 
assurance that, even as commercial 
quantities of polyhalite ore are produced, 
a profitable market will exist for it.
Our research team continues to analyse 
various fertilizer markets, including NPK, 
potash and polyhalite. Current studies 
support the continued growth in world 
demand and a positive price outlook over 
the medium term.
Feasibility study work indicates that the 
anticipated cost of production for polyhalite 
is circa US$30. At this cost, the Project would 
rank in the bottom quartile of potash 
producers and is therefore well positioned 
for significant price downturns.

PRINCIPAL RISKS MITIGATION TREND
STRATEGY 
LINK
Currency
Sirius Minerals will have currency 
exposures arising from both its capital 
expenditure and operating costs and the 
sale of polyhalite ore.
Revenue from polyhalite sales and the 
majority of future financings for the 
Project are expected to be denominated 
in US Dollars, providing a natural 
exchange rate hedge. However, a 
significant portion of the construction, 
development and operating expenses for 
the Project will be incurred in non-US 
Dollar currencies, in particular Pounds 
Sterling.
Accordingly, appreciation of such 
non-US Dollar currencies, without 
offsetting improvement in US Dollar 
denominated polyhalite prices, could 
adversely affect the Project’s profitability 
and financial position. 
The Group has mitigated the currency risk 
in the medium to long-term, by planning a 
capital structure where it has raised funds in 
Pounds Sterling and US Dollars, to broadly 
match the anticipated currency split of its 
expected capital expenditure and operating 
cost needs.
The Group monitors its exposure to currency 
risk based on the Project expenditure 
forecast and the stage of development. 
The treasury policy sets out appropriate risk 
tolerances for currency exposure and the 
treasury team implement appropriate 
hedges to ensure the Group is compliant 
with the treasury policy.
This risk is 
increasing as the 
time frame for 
Brexit draws 
closer and drives 
increased volatility 
in the foreign 
exchange 
markets. As the 
proceeds from the 
stage 1 financing 
are spent, the 
Group’s exposure 
to sterling is also 
increasing 
because the 
stage 2 financing 
is likely to be 
predominantly in 
US Dollars.
EXTERNAL RISKS
Permits and 
licences
The Project requires a range of permits 
and licences to operate. As the Project 
progresses, the details of the works will 
require changes to the planning 
permissions. There is no guarantee 
that these will be forthcoming.
The Group is in possession of the planning 
permissions required to commence the 
construction of the minehead, MTS, MHF and 
has also received a development consent 
order for the construction of the harbour 
facility. Any changes applied for do not 
affect these permissions, but rather either 
modify or replace the existing permissions 
once approved.
Up to this point the minor non-material 
changes sought have been approved. 
A minor material change for the Woodsmith 
Mine site has also been approved by 
the NYMNPA.
Sirius Minerals has a broad range of 
consultant advisers that specialise in 
obtaining the remaining permits, licences 
and secondary approvals and licences 
needed for the Project to operate.

Competitors
There are high barriers for potential new 
entrants into the market. The major 
competitors all have substantial existing 
infrastructure, less leverage and 
substantially greater financial resources. 
There can be no assurance that Sirius 
Minerals or its Project will be able to 
successfully respond to such competitive 
pressures or the competitive activities of 
the other major suppliers in its markets.
Our polyhalite product contains four of the 
six macro-nutrients (potassium, sulphur, 
magnesium and calcium) required for plant 
growth. Polyhalite is an effective, direct 
application, multi-nutrient fertilizer and can 
also be combined with nitrogen and 
phosphorous to create high-value NPK 
fertilizer products that contain all six macro-
nutrients. As such, we are less exposed to the 
existing potash supply structure with respect 
to product supply and demand dynamics. 
The Group continues to develop its 
marketing and sales strategy to utilise the 
unique characteristics of polyhalite.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
Construction delays
The Project may experience construction 
and schedule delays due to unforeseen 
technical issues. 
Detailed assessment and planning will 
be carried out continuously by the 
management team and external 
consultants as part of the Project’s 
continued development to mitigate and 
de-risk the Project during construction.
The Group also continues to pursue all 
acceleration options available to reduce 
the time required to reach first production. 
Contractors are incentivised to bring their 
scopes forward.
Contractors and 
suppliers
The performance of our contractors and 
suppliers is critical to the success of the 
Project. Performance issues or a lack of 
alignment could introduce cost and 
schedule risks to the Project.
This risk would manifest itself in cost, delay 
and/or quality issues.
An active and experienced management 
team is in place with a focus on being clear 
about expectations, verifying performance, 
and doing everything possible within the 
contracts to ensure the success of our 
contractors and suppliers. Performance is 
actively monitored and managed, with 
mitigating change instigated should 
performance not meet expectations.
In working with our contractors we are 
focused on ensuring that they are working 
within their area of specialisation, that their 
senior management are engaged in our 
Project, that regular communication and 
progress updates are maintained and 
that major construction contractors are 
incentivised around the success of the 
Project.

Construction cost 
overruns
The Project may experience construction 
cost overruns due to unforeseen 
technical issues or scope change.
The owner’s team has a strong focus on cost.
Confidence in the final cost will increase 
as detailed engineering progresses and 
contracts are put in place for the works.
Prices received from contractors and 
suppliers so far have been in line with the 
DFS and budget. In addition, the Project was 
costed with significant contingency and 
escalation provisions in case of cost 
pressures. The fall in the value of the pound 
also provides comfort in this area.
Safety and 
environmental 
performance
A significant safety or environmental 
incident would affect the delivery of the 
Project and the Group’s reputation.
We continuously assess the risk and ensure 
that we have the right people in the right 
place. Nonetheless, the Group is not 
complacent about the risks in this area.
The owner’s team is set up to manage safety 
and the environment effectively. A key part 
of our work in this area is in ensuring that we 
engage contractors who have the right 
attitude and systems, and that we welcome 
expertise and improvement from employees, 
contractors and external parties.
Ongoing focus areas include leadership 
activities, work with our contractors 
(including onboarding processes and 
auditing), developing the culture of the 
Project team, and the identification and 
control of major hazards.

Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over 
a five-year period, taking account of the Company’s current position and principal risks.
Time frame
The Board believes that five years is the most appropriate time frame over which the Board should assess the long-
term viability of the Company. The Company’s current activities do not generate any revenues or positive operating 
cash flow, and construction of the Project and the development necessary to commence production and generate 
revenues will require significant capital expenditures. The Project is not expected to generate positive net cash flow 
until approximately 2022, some four years from now.
Assessing viability
The main assumptions are that the stage 2 financing of up to US$3 billion is completed in the second half of 2018 and 
that the U$300 million royalty financing due from Hancock British Holdings Limited is paid on or around the same time. 
If these transactions are not concluded in this time frame the Company may not be able to ensure that the Project 
will become operational, nor that commercial production will commence on schedule (or at all).
Principal risks
In addition, in making their assessment, the Board has taken into account the principal risks as described in detail on 
pages 49 to 52 and also the scenario modelling and sensitivity analysis undertaken by the Company and various 
consultants which has been conducted as part of the development of the Project. The modelling demonstrates 
profitability over a range of negative assumptions, both individually and in aggregate. The scenarios considered took 
into account the impacts of:
• a Project capital cost overrun;
• a delay in Project completion;
• lower realised polyhalite sales prices;
• lower long-run polyhalite sales volumes;
• higher long-run operating costs; and
• a reasonable downside scenario taking into account a combination of the above.
Based on the financial impact of the analysis outlined above and the associated risk, management actions and 
controls that are either in place or could be implemented, the Board has been able to conclude that the Group will 
be able to deliver the construction of the Project, provided the stage 2 financing is completed as described.
Confirmation of viability
Taking account of these matters, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to December 2022, assuming that the 
stage 2 financing referred to above is completed as described.
The Group’s going concern statement is detailed in note 1 on page 114.

CHAIRMAN’S 
INTRODUCTION
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the corporate 
governance report for the year ended 
31 December 2017.
Last year was a year of many 
significant achievements for Sirius. 
One of our key achievements 
occurred on 28 April 2017, when the 
Company’s ordinary share capital 
was admitted to trading on the 
Main Market.
As the Company is now on the Main 
Market, we are subject to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code). The Code encourages 
me, as Chairman, to report personally 
on how the principles relating to the 
Board’s role, and effectiveness of 
them, have been applied, and I am 
pleased to do so.
This section of the Annual Report 
sets out our approach to corporate 
governance using the five main 
principles of the Code and explains 
how the Board and its Committees 
are structured and their areas of 
focus during 2017. The Board is 
committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance and the 
Board supports the principles of the 
Code. The Directors believe that the 
Company has complied during the 
year with the principles and provisions 
of the 2016 UK Corporate Governance 
Code with the exception of provision 
D.2.1 of the Code with respect to the 
composition of the Remuneration 
Committee, as described on page 
86.
The Sirius Board recognises the 
importance of sound corporate 
governance. Its role is to provide 
leadership of the Company and its 
executives with myself, as Chairman, 
being responsible for leading the 
Board and ensuring its effectiveness. 
It is therefore important that the Board 
has the correct balance of skills and 
experience and that its members 
work together effectively in pursuit of 
our corporate goals and objectives.
The Board is committed to the 
highest standards of corporate 
governance.

• Received and considered an 
anti-bribery and corruption 
memorandum updating the

• Approved changes to the 
Disclosure and Inside Information 
Policy and adopted a schedule 
of matters reserved to the Board.
• Reviewed developments in 
corporate governance, legal 
and regulatory updates.
• Received investor relations 
reports.
During the year, Thomas Staley was 
appointed to the Board as Finance 
Director, further strengthening the 
Board’s set of critical skills, especially 
with regard to financing. Additionally, 
Noel Harwerth, a very experienced 
and long-standing Non-Executive 
Director of several major companies 
was appointed as our Senior 
Independent Director. The Board now 
comprises two Executive Directors, 
six Non-Executive Directors, one of 
whom is the Senior Independent 
Director, providing, I believe, an 
appropriate balance of executive 
and non-executive positions on the 
Board. The Directors have a broad 
range of relevant capabilities 
including strategic, construction, 
mining, financial, governance and 
other experience to support the 
Company in pursuit of our key 
objective of becoming one of the 
world’s most important producers of 
multi-nutrient fertilizer.
In 2017 a review of the performance 
of the Board and its Committees 
was carried out internally via a 
questionnaire circulated to all 
Directors. The review confirmed that 
the Board and all of its Committees 
are operating effectively. More details 
can be found on page 62 and in 
each of the Board Committee reports 
in this section on pages 66 to 98.
With our move to the Main Market 
during 2017 we are now pleased to 
provide an increased level of detailed 
reporting in our Annual Report. 
Included in this increased reporting 
you will find the Remuneration Report 
on pages 73 to 98 which details our 
three-year Remuneration Policy that 
will be put to a binding shareholder 
vote at our Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) in May 2018. The Annual 
Report on Remuneration 2017 also 
sets out the details of Directors’ 
remuneration throughout 2017, and 
this will be subject to an advisory vote 
by shareholders at the upcoming AGM.
This year our AGM will be held 
at 1pm on Thursday 31 May 2018 at 
The Events Centre, The Principal York, 
Station Road, York, YO24 1AA and 
I look forward to welcoming you.

Governance
The Role of  
the Board
The Board provides leadership 
of the Company and direction 
for management. It is 
responsible for the long-term 
success of the Company and 
for ensuring the appropriate 
management and operation of 
the Company in pursuit of its 
objectives.
The Board is responsible for 
setting the Company’s strategy, 
values and standards and 
ensuring the necessary controls 
and resources are in place for the 
Company to deliver it. The Board 
has regular scheduled meetings 
and has a formal schedule of 
matters requiring its approval and 
specifically reserved for its 
decision, which form the core of 
the Board’s agenda. These include:
• approving the Group’s long-
term objectives;
• approval of the annual 
operating and capital 
expenditure budgets;
• approving contracts for more 
than a certain monetary 
amount;
• extension of the Group’s 
activities into new business or 
geographic areas;
• approval of major capital 
projects; and
• approval of key policies and 
procedures.
Board meetings
During 2017, the Board met eight 
times during the year, excluding 
Board Committee meetings to 
approve the financial results and 
matters in connection with the move 
to the Main Market. Individual Director 
attendance at each Board meeting is 
set out in the table opposite.
Directors are expected, where 
possible, to attend all Board 
meetings, relevant Committee 
meetings, the AGM and any General 
meetings. If a Director is unable to 
attend a specific Board or Committee 
meeting, he or she still receives all the 
papers for discussion at the meeting 
and can advise the Board Chairman 
or Committee Chairman of their 
comments in advance of the 
meeting.
Board meetings are normally 
attended by the Chief Development 
Officer and the Chief Marketing 
Officer. Other senior members of the 
management team and external 
advisers will attend, at the invitation 
of the Board, and as appropriate to 
the matters under discussion.
During the year the Chairman and 
the Non-Executive Directors also met 
on several occasions without the 
Executive Directors present to allow 
informal discussions on a variety of 
issues. The Non-Executives met once 
during the year without the Chairman 
to evaluate the Chairman’s 
performance.
The core activities of the Board are 
documented and planned on an 
annual basis and a list of matters 
arising from each meeting is 
maintained and followed up at 
subsequent meetings. Full minutes of 
each Board and Committee meeting 
are kept by the Secretary, detailing 
the matters considered and decisions 
taken.
The Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive are held separately and 
their responsibilities are clearly 
documented and established. Russell 
Scrimshaw is the Chairman and is 
responsible for the leadership and 
effective running of the Board. Chris 
Fraser is the Chief Executive and is 
responsible for the running of the 
Group’s business and implementation 
of the strategy and policies adopted 
by the Board.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors constructively 
challenge and scrutinise the 
performance of management and 
help develop proposals on strategy. 
The terms and conditions of 
appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection 
at each AGM and at its registered 
office during normal business hours.
Senior Independent Director
Noel Harwerth is the Senior 
Independent Director (SID) of the 
Company, having been appointed 
on 25 April 2017. As well as being 
available to shareholders whose 
concerns have not been resolved 
through normal channels or 
when such channels would be 
inappropriate, the SID provides a 
sounding board for the Chairman 
and serves as an intermediary for the 
other Directors, where necessary. The 
SID also has responsibility for leading 
the annual appraisal of the 
Chairman’s performance.

businesses, implementation of its 
strategy, policies and budgets and its 
financial performance. Executive 
management meetings comprise the 
Executive Directors and senior 
management and are held bi-
monthly to discuss current issues.
Principal Committees of the Board
The Board has delegated certain 
aspects of its responsibilities to four 
Committees (as shown on page 65): 
the Audit Committee, the 
Nominations Committee, the 
Remuneration Committee and the 
Disclosure Committee.
Each Committee operates within 
defined terms of reference, which 
are reviewed and updated as 
appropriate on an annual basis and 
are available on the Company’s 
website at siriusminerals.com. Each 
Committee reports its proceedings to 
the Board verbally and through the 
submission of reports and minutes as 
appropriate.
Reports of the Audit, Nominations 
and Remuneration Committees are 
provided on pages 66 to 98, and 
include information on each 
Committee’s membership, duties, 
attendance at meetings and work 
throughout the year.
The Disclosure Committee comprises 
Chris Fraser (Managing Director and 
CEO), Thomas Staley (Finance 
Director and CFO), Nicholas King 
(General Counsel and Company 
Secretary) and Gareth Edmunds 
(External Affairs Director). Chris Fraser 
is the Chair of the Committee. 
The Committee ensures that the 
Company is able to make timely and 
accurate disclosure of all information 
that is required to be disclosed to the 
market in accordance with its legal 
and regulatory obligations as a 
company with Officially Listed 
securities which have been admitted 
to trading on the Main Market. The 
creation of the Disclosure Committee 
is not required by the Code but, in 
ensuring that the Company has in 
place systems and procedures to 
enable it to discharge its obligations, 
was considered an appropriate 
response and one which has been 
widely adopted by other companies. 
The Disclosure Committee met a 
number of times during the year as 
was necessary and appropriate to 
fulfil its responsibilities. The Terms of 
Reference for the Committee are set 
out in detail on the Company’s 
website at siriusminerals.com.

Composition of the Board
The Board is comprised of eight 
Directors, which includes the Non-
Executive Chairman, two Executive 
Directors and five other independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
A list of individual Directors, their 
biographies and Committee 
memberships as at the date of this 
report are on pages 56 and 57.
The Board believes that there is an 
appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and 
knowledge on the Board. The Board 
also believes that there is an 
appropriate balance of Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors.
The Board considers all of its  
Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent. The Non-Executive 
Directors disclose to the Board their 
other significant commitments and 
the procedure adopted by the 
Company in relation to Directors’ 
conflicts of interest is detailed on 
page 100.
Louise Hardy, Jane Lodge and 
Noel Harwerth are independent in 
character and independent in 
judgement and are therefore 
independent Non-Executive Directors 
in accordance with the Code. Lord 
Hutton and Keith Clarke hold share 
options in the Company as detailed 
on page 93. These outstanding share 
options were granted in 2012 and 
2013 respectively, when the Company 
was listed on AIM. No further grants 
have been made to the Company’s 
current Non-Executive Directors since 
2013 and the Company does not 
intend to include share options or 
other performance-related elements 
in the remuneration of the Non-
Executive Directors in the future. 
Notwithstanding these share options, 
the Board considers Lord Hutton and 
Keith Clarke to be independent in 
character and independent in 
judgement and therefore deemed to 
be independent Non-Executive 
Directors.
Prior to taking on the role as 
Chairman, Russell Scrimshaw was 
viewed as independent in character 
and independent in judgement. 
The Chairman’s other significant 
commitments are detailed on page 56.
Performance evaluation
In October 2017 the Board undertook 
an internal evaluation of its 
performance in accordance with the 
Code through the completion of a 
comprehensive questionnaire using 
the electronic board portal. The 
results of the evaluation were 
presented to the Board at its meeting 
in December 2017 and confirmed that 
overall the Board was operating 
effectively. The review confirmed that 
there were a small number of areas 
for action for 2018, including the 
design and implementation of a 
formal training and development 
programme for Board members and 
more opportunities for the Board to 
meet informally ahead of scheduled 
Board meetings.
It is the intention that in accordance 
with the Code an annual review of 
the effectiveness of the Board will be 
undertaken with input from an 
independent external adviser in 2020 
and every three years thereafter.

Training, development and 
induction of new Directors
Ongoing professional development is 
provided to all Directors. In 2017 the 
Board’s professional development 
consisted of various updates, 
presentations and memoranda from 
the Company’s external advisers 
focused primarily on the 
responsibilities and duties of a 
director of a Premium Listed company 
given the Company’s move from AIM 
to the Main Market as well as a health 
and safety presentation and updates 
on regulatory and legislative 
developments. A number of the 2017 
Board meetings were held in 
Scarborough to enable the Directors 
to attend site visits to see the 
development of the Project.
As there have been no new external 
appointments to the Board during the 
year, a formal induction programme 
was not delivered during the year. 
Thomas Staley was appointed to the 
Board during the year but had been 
with the Company since 2012 as 
Corporate Development Director and 
more recently Chief Financial Officer. 
Thomas attended the Board meetings 
in his previous roles before being 
appointed as an Executive Director in 
February 2017 and, as such, was 
familiar with the workings of the Board 
and the Company so a formal induction 
process was not deemed necessary.
Information and support
All Directors have access to the 
Company Secretary. It is the 
responsibility of the Company 
Secretary to ensure that there are 
good information flows to the Board 
and its Committees and between 
the Executive team and the 
Non-Executive Directors. The 
Company Secretary advises the 
Board on all legal and corporate 
governance matters and assists the 
Chairman in ensuring that the 
Directors have suitably tailored and 
detailed induction and ongoing 
professional development 
programmes. The appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary 
is a matter for the Board as a whole.
The Board uses an electronic board 
portal which provides quick, easy 
and secure access to board papers 
and materials in advance of each 
meeting and in sufficient time to 
allow proper consideration of their 
contents.
There is a process by which 
Directors may obtain independent 
legal advice at the Company’s 
expense if they believe it may be 
required in the furtherance of 
their duties.

Composition
The Audit Committee is made up 
of three members: Jane Lodge 
(Committee Chair), Keith Clarke 
and Noel Harwerth, who are all 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Board is satisfied that the 
members of the Audit Committee 
bring a wide range of skills, expertise, 
experience and competence 
relevant to the sector in which the 
Company operates. The Board is also 
satisfied that Jane Lodge possesses 
the necessary recent and relevant 
financial experience, as set out in the 
Code, to effectively chair the 
Committee.
Responsibilities
The main role of the Audit Committee 
includes:
• monitoring the integrity of the 
Company’s financial statements, 
including reviewing its annual and 
half-year financial statements and 
accounting policies;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
external audit, internal controls, risk 
management, whistleblowing and 
fraud systems in place across the 
Group; and
• overseeing the relationship with 
the Company’s auditor, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 67
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The Terms of Reference for the 
Committee are set out in detail  
on the Company’s website, 
siriusminerals.com. These terms were 
updated in March 2017 to reflect 
current best practice for a Premium 
Listed company ahead of the 
Company’s move from AIM to the 
Main Market and are reviewed on at 
least an annual basis.
Meetings
The Committee has regular 
scheduled meetings and holds 
additional meetings as and when 
required. Members are expected, 
where possible, to attend all 
Committee meetings. The Committee 
had four meetings in 2017 and 
individual attendance is set out in the 
table opposite.
The Committee meets with the 
external auditor at least once a year 
without management present.
Meetings are normally attended by 
the Board Chairman, Executive 
Directors, Deputy Chief Financial 
Officer, Financial Controller and the 
External Auditor. Other senior 
members of the management team 
will attend at the invitation of the 
Committee, and as appropriate to 
the matters under discussion.
Agendas, briefing notes and reports 
for each Committee meeting are 
distributed via a secure electronic 
Board portal in advance of each 
meeting and in sufficient time to 
allow proper consideration of their 
contents.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 68
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Governance
Committee evaluation
During the year the Committee 
undertook an internal evaluation of its 
performance in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code and its Terms 
of Reference. The Company 
Secretary, on behalf of the Chairman, 
circulated a comprehensive 
questionnaire to members and 
attendees of the Committee using 
the electronic Board portal covering 
all issues related to the functioning of 
the Committee. The responses were 
consolidated and anonymised and 
common themes identified in order 
for the Committee to determine key 
actions and next steps for improving 
Committee effectiveness and 
performance.
The results of the 2017 internal 
evaluation show that overall the 
Committee is operating effectively. 
Areas identified for action for 2018 
include the incorporation of a 
programme of training and 
presentations into the Committee 
meeting schedule at appropriate 
times, including updates on 
corporate governance and 
accounting developments by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and 
subject matter ‘deep dives’; 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to carry 
out a benchmarking exercise of the 
Company’s 2017 Annual Report; the 
length of Committee meetings to be 
increased to allow sufficient time for 
the agenda and papers to be 
considered; and more Committee 
meetings held in person rather than 
conference call.
Significant issues in 2017
The Committee considered a number 
of matters during the year as 
described above, the most significant 
of which was in relation to the 
valuation of the royalty financing 
agreement and the Group’s US$400 
million convertible loans. As a result of 
the stage 1 financing undertaken in 
2016, a number of complex financial 
instruments (US$250 million royalty 
agreement with Hancock British 
Holdings Limited (Hancock), a US$50 
million equity arrangement with 
Hancock and US$400 million 
convertible loans) were entered into 
by the Group with a number of third 
parties. Due to the complexity of the 
accounting for each of these 
financial instruments, the Committee 
received and considered 
comprehensive reports from 
management throughout the year to 
explain the proposed accounting 
treatment for the US$50 million equity 
arrangement and initial drawdown of 
the US$250 million royalty agreement 
together with detailed summaries of 
the subsequent accounting 
considerations for the royalty host 
instrument and the royalty embedded 
derivative. The Committee also took 
into account the views of the external 
auditor. The Committee concluded 
that the proposed accounting 
treatment of the financial instruments 
in the Company’s 2017 financial 
statement was appropriate.
Risk management and internal 
control
Details of the Group’s internal controls 
and risk management framework are 
more fully set out on page 48 of the 
Strategic Report.
The Committee, on behalf of the 
Board, carried out a review of the 
effectiveness of the systems of risk 
management and internal controls 
during the year. This effectiveness 
review considered the design of 
controls associated with key risks and 
the evidence as to their proper 
operation throughout the year. The 
review did not identify any significant 
failing or weaknesses in the system of 
internal control and risk 
management.
Internal audit
Due to the Group’s current size and 
complexity, the Audit Committee did 
not deem it necessary to operate an 
internal audit function during the 
year. The Audit Committee was able 
to satisfy itself as to the proper 
implementation and operation of 
controls during the year through the 
review of the Group’s FPPP report as 
well as regular reporting from senior 
management as to the operation of 
the Group’s controls in the year. As 
the level of construction activity 
increases on the Project in the 
coming year, it is the Audit 
Committee’s view that an internal 
audit function will become necessary. 
Therefore, the Committee has begun 
to plan for the implementation of this 
in 2018 in order to support its ongoing 
monitoring of the Group’s system of 
controls.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED  69
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Auditor
The Committee is responsible for 
managing the relationship with the 
company’s auditor, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have 
been the Company’s auditor since 
October 2012. The Committee 
confirms its compliance for the 
financial year ending 31 December 
2017 with the provisions of the 
Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit 
Committee Responsibilities) Order 
2014. The Company last put its 
external audit contract out to tender 
in 2012, following which 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was 
appointed as the Company’s auditor. 
Under current regulations, the 
Company will be required to retender 
the audit no later than in respect of 
the year ending 31 December 2022. 
The Committee recognises that audit 
tenders and transitions to new 
auditors require significant resource. 
Given that the Company is new to the 
Main Market, the Committee 
considers that it is in the best interests 
of the Company to retain 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP until 
2022 to provide stability and 
continuity. It is therefore the 
Company’s intention to tender the 
audit no later than for the year 
ending 31 December 2022.
In accordance with best practice and 
professional standards, the Company 
requires its External Auditor to adhere 
to a rotation policy whereby the audit 
engagement partner is rotated after 
five years. During the year the 
Committee oversaw the rotation of 
the Senior Statutory Auditor with 
Randal Casson replacing Ian 
Morrison as the audit engagement 
partner. The External Auditor is also 
required to periodically assess 
whether, in its professional opinion, it 
is independent and to share those 
views with the Committee.
In order to ensure the independence 
and objectivity of the External Auditor, 
the Committee has a policy 
regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by its External Auditor to 
ensure that such services do not 
impair the independence or 
objectivity of the External Auditor. Any 
non-audit services provided must be 
pre-approved by the Committee 
unless the activity will have a total 
value of less than £5,000. Control over 
total non-audit fees is monitored on a 
regular basis by the Committee with 
the intention to remain below an 
audit fee to non-audit fee ratio of 1:1 
and within the FRC guidance of the 
70% cap that will be required from 
2019. However, the Committee 
recognises that there may be times 
where it is appropriate to engage the 
external auditor for additional 
services which may result in the 1:1 
ratio being exceeded. 2017 was an 
exceptional year for the Company 
with its move from AIM to the Main 
Market and this resulted in the 
non-audit fees being higher than the 
audit fees due to 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s work in 
connection with the prospectus for 
the Premium Listing. This was the one 
non-audit service that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
provided to the Company during the 
year and no other non-audit fees 
were incurred in 2017. An analysis of 
fees paid in respect of audit and 
non-audit services provided by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for 2017 
is set out in note 22 on page 134. 
Having reviewed such non-audit 
services the Committee is satisfied 
that they did not prejudice 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s 
independence or objectivity.
The Committee assesses the quality 
of the external audit annually and 
considered the performance of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP taking 
into account the Committee’s own 
assessment, feedback from senior 
finance personnel and views from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on 
their performance as detailed in a 
report of their audit findings at the 
year end, which they took the 
Committee through at the meeting 
in February 2018. Based on this 
review, the Committee was satisfied 
with the effectiveness of the audit 
for the year ended 31 December 
2017.
Speak Up policy
Due to the Company’s move from 
AIM to the Main Market, the Group’s 
whistleblowing arrangements were 
reviewed for best practice and as a 
result the Group implemented an 
externally managed independent 
phone and web reporting Speak Up 
service and a new Speak Up policy 
during the year to allow employees 
to raise concerns in confidence. 
Prior to this, the Group had a 
whistleblowing policy in place 
whereby an employee could raise 
any concerns direct with 
management. Updates on any 
matters raised are provided to the 
Committee at each meeting.

and export credit backed debt, 
mezzanine debt and equity. Given his 
experience and the fact that he had 
demonstrated his strong capabilities 
as CFO since joining the Company in 
2014, especially in the delivery of the 
Company’s stage 1 financing, the 
Committee was of the view that 
Thomas would bring the necessary 
required skills to the Board and was 
the most suitable candidate.
Female representation on the Board is 
currently 37% with the Audit 
Committee at 66%, the Remuneration 
Committee having 50% and the 
Nominations Committee at 33%.

Committee evaluation
During the year the Committee 
undertook an internal evaluation of its 
performance in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code and its Terms 
of Reference. The Company 
Secretary, on behalf of the Chairman, 
circulated a comprehensive 
questionnaire to members and 
attendees of the Committee using 
the electronic Board portal, covering 
all issues related to the functioning of 
the Committee. The responses were 
consolidated and anonymised and 
common themes identified in order 
for the Committee to determine key 
actions and next steps for improving 
Committee effectiveness and 
performance.
The results of the 2017 internal 
evaluation showed that overall the 
Committee is operating effectively. 
The main recommendation for action 
for 2018 was for the Committee to 
have an increased focus on 
succession planning for the Board 
and senior management team to 
ensure that the business is prepared 
for the future while also assisting in 
the design of a programme of 
training for the Board. The length of 
Committee meetings would also be 
increased to allow sufficient time for 
the agenda and papers to be 
considered and more Committee 
meetings held in person rather than 
conference call.
Diversity
Over the last 12 months, there have 
been a number of diversity reviews, 
including The Hampton-Alexander 
Review on gender balance in FTSE 
leadership; the McGregor-Smith 
review on race in the workplace and 
The Parker Review on ethnic diversity 
on UK boards.
The Committee continues to review 
and monitor the balance and 
composition of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board as 
appropriate as evidenced by the 
Committee’s activity during the year 
under review. It is the Committee’s 
intention to have a continued focus 
on diversity in 2018.
All Board appointments are made on 
merit, in the context of the skills and 
experience that the Board, as a 
whole, requires in order to maintain 
and enhance its effectiveness. The 
appointment of Thomas Staley to the 
Board in February 2017 followed an 
assessment by the Committee that an 
additional Executive Director with 
financial expertise was necessary 
ahead of the Company’s move to the 
Premium List of the London Stock 
Exchange and the associated 
enhanced governance requirements 
and also in preparation for the 
Company’s stage 2 debt financing. 
Thomas has over ten years of 
experience developing and financing 
energy, resource and infrastructure 
projects across a range of 
international markets. His core 
competency was structuring 
commercial arrangements and 
financing projects utilising a wide 
range of capital including project  73

REMUNERATION  
COMMITTEE REPORT 
CHAIRMAN’S ANNUAL  
STATEMENT
Our aim is to create a remuneration 
framework that is appropriate whilst 
supporting our strategic goal to 
develop and implement our world-
class North Yorkshire polyhalite 
Project within budget and schedule.
LORD HUTTON. CHAIR
Dear Shareholder
As Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, I am pleased to present 
our Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for the year ending 31 December 
2017, our first report following our 
admission to the Main Market.
In line with the applicable 
regulations, this report is presented 
in two sections: firstly our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (the Policy) 
containing our forward looking 
policy in relation to Directors’ 
remuneration; and then our Annual 
Report on Remuneration which 
provides details of the amounts 
earned in respect of the 2017 
financial year and how our Policy 
will be implemented in the 2018 
financial year. Our Policy is subject 
to a binding shareholder vote at the 
2018 AGM and, subject to approval 
by shareholders, will become 
effective from that date. Our Annual 
Report on Remuneration will be 
subject to an advisory vote at the 
2018 AGM.
How we link executive 
remuneration to our strategy
Given the unique nature of our 
business, we designed our Policy to 
ensure that it will be appropriate for 
the UK Premium Listed company 
environment whilst continuing to 
support our strategic goal to 
develop and implement our 
world-class North Yorkshire 
polyhalite Project within budget 
and schedule. We will emerge as a 
disruptive, world-leading fertilizer 
operation and the opportunity to 
create value for our shareholders is 
sizeable. The nature of this 
opportunity and the focus required 
to deliver transformational 
milestones within a clear time frame 
during a loss-making period were 
the basis for the Policy for which we 
are seeking shareholder approval.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT 74
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Governance
Reflecting the development stage of 
our Project and that the Company is 
still some years from becoming a 
cash flow-generating company, the 
fixed pay for our Managing Director 
and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
and Finance Director and Chief 
Financial Officer (CFO) are positioned 
at the lower end of the market for FTSE 
250 companies. Instead, our 
package is geared towards variable 
pay, based on the delivery of our 
strategic milestones towards first 
production.
Our Policy provides for a maximum 
annual bonus opportunity of up to 
175% of salary for our CEO and up to 
150% for our CFO. In exceptional 
circumstances, linked to the 
achievement of a transformational 
strategic milestone, the maximum 
bonus awarded may be increased up 
to 200% of salary.
We have introduced individual limits 
in our Policy on the level of long-term 
incentive awards that can be granted 
each year to our Executive Directors. 
Ordinarily, LTIP awards of up to 200% 
of salary may be granted to our CEO 
and up to 175% of salary may be 
granted to our CFO. Vesting of LTIP 
awards are linked to the delivery of 
our strategic milestones. We have 
included the ability to grant 
exceptional LTIP awards (i.e. an 
additional 300% of salary for the CEO 
and CFO so the overall LTIP award 
could be up to 500% of salary for the 
CEO and up to 475% of salary for the 
CFO). Any exceptional LTIP awards will 
be subject to aspirational stretch 
targets. For the avoidance of doubt, 
there is no intention to grant such 
exceptional awards on an ongoing 
basis.
The ability to grant exceptional 
awards reflects that we are a unique 
business at a critical point in our 
development. Recognising the 
importance of our strong team 
culture and the contribution of the 
wider team, the principle of awarding 
exceptional LTIP awards for the 
delivery of transformational strategic 
milestones significantly ahead of plan 
will also apply to the wider team 
eligible to participate in the LTIP. 
Achieving our transformational 
milestones significantly ahead of plan 
would require outstanding Company 
performance through consistent 
innovation, constant drive and 
successful execution. This would also 
result in significant increased value 
being delivered to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee 
recognises that this exceptionally 
strong performance of the Company 
should also result in a substantial rise 
in our share price as a consequence 
of this performance. Although this 
provides a strong alignment between 
executive reward, Company 
performance and shareholder value 
creation, the Remuneration 
Committee is mindful that there may 
be scenarios where the level of reward 
is materially greater than envisaged 
at the time that the awards are 
granted. Taking into account the 
current executive remuneration 
environment, to mitigate the risk that 
the overall maximum remuneration 
payable may have the potential of 
being simply too high irrespective of 
outstanding Company performance, 
the Remuneration Committee has 
decided to include an overall total 
annual remuneration cap of £20 
million. It should be noted that this 
cap is intended to mitigate the risk of 
the overall remuneration policy 
having unintended consequences 
and is only likely to be in point due to 
exceptional share price accretion 
and if more than one LTIP award 
vested in respect of a milestone being 
achieved and the Company’s market 
capitalisation increased from circa 
£1 billion to over £7 billion.
Reflecting best practice, our Policy 
also includes a shareholding 
guideline which requires Executive 
Directors to build up a shareholding 
with a value equal to 200% of salary. 
Alignment with shareholders is further 
enhanced by the following (which will 
apply to bonus and long-term 
incentive awards from 2018):
• the deferral into shares, for two 
years, of any bonus earned in 
excess of 100% of salary; and
• an additional holding period for 
long-term incentive awards, such 
that vested LTIP awards will only be 
released to an Executive Director 
prior to the fifth anniversary of the 
date of grant (so they can dispose 
of the shares acquired) if the 
shareholding guideline has been 
achieved, although sales to cover 
tax would be permitted.
As at 31 December 2017 Chris Fraser’s 
shareholding equated to 50 times 
salary and Thomas Staley’s 
shareholding equated to 0.7 times 
his salary.
Our performance and incentive 
outturns in 2017
As outlined in the Chairman’s 
statement on pages 4 to 6, 2017 has 
been a year of significant progress 
for our business. We accomplished 
a number of significant Project 
milestones and successfully executed 
a number of key activities that are 
pivotal to the success of this exciting 
Project.
Following a robust assessment of the 
Executive Directors’ contribution to 
the achievement of these strategic 
goals, and measured against the pre-
set objectives for the Executives, the 
Remuneration Committee awarded 
cash bonuses of £332,500 and 
£250,000 to Chris Fraser and Thomas 
Staley respectively. Further detail in 
relation to the performance achieved

and the associated bonuses earned 
in respect of 2017 is set out on page 89 
to 90. Shareholders will recognise that 
the nature and stage of our business 
means that setting conventional 
financial targets is not appropriate; 
our bonuses for 2017 and for 2018 
are based on the delivery of specific 
elements of the Project and substantive 
progress towards transformational 
milestones on time and within budget, 
which are all lead indicators to the 
success of the business.
No long-term incentives vested in 
respect of performance in 2017.
Implementation of our Policy in 2018
• Fixed pay: No base salary 
increases are proposed for the 
Executive Directors for 2018. 
Pension contributions for our 
Executive Directors will continue to 
be in line with auto enrolment 
minimum contribution requirements 
at the level of circa. 1% of salary 
(2% with effect from April 2018) in 
line with the wider workforce and 
auto-enrolment requirements.
• 2018 maximum bonus opportunity: 
Maximum bonus opportunity of up 
to 175% of salary for Chris Fraser and 
up to 150% of salary for Thomas 
Staley. However, the maximum 
bonus earned for 2018 may be 
increased up to 200% of salary if a 
successful stage 2 financing is 
achieved. This recognises the 
critical importance and 
transformational impact of a 
successful stage 2 financing. Further 
details in relation to the annual 
bonus performance measures for 
2018 are set out on page 96.
• 2018 long-term incentive grants: 
Subject to shareholder approval of 
the Policy, we intend to grant LTIP 
awards of up to 500% of salary to 
Chris Fraser and up to 475% of 
salary for Thomas Staley following 
the 2018 AGM. This reflects the 
significant changes brought about 
by commencement of construction 
during 2017, our ambitious goals for 
the Project through the next phase 
of development and the 
prospective construction over the 
next several years of a complex 
and large scale project and first 
mining of polyhalite. This event is 
expected to be a seminal and 
unique achievement for the 
Company in its lifecycle. The 2018 
LTIP grant consists of two elements: 
ordinary grants of 200% of salary for 
Chris Fraser and 175% for Thomas 
Staley, and an ‘exceptional stretch 
award’ of 300% of salary to 
encourage rapid and early 
construction which, we believe, will 
result in significant additional 
benefits to shareholders, potentially 
of many hundreds of millions of 
pounds. As set out in further detail 
on page 97, the vesting of the 2018 
LTIP awards will be based on the 
critical milestone of first polyhalite 
being extracted from the ore body. 
Remuneration at a glance
2017 annual bonuses earned of 
approximately 70% and 76% of 
salary based on Chris Fraser’s and 
Thomas Staley’s contribution to the 
achievement of significant strategic 
milestones during the year that are 
pivotal to the success of the Project 
(see page 89 to 90). 
Salaries for 2018 will not be 
increased.
Pension contributions for our 
Executive Directors will continue to 
be line with the wider workforce at 
circa 1%.
Maximum bonus opportunity for 
2018 will be up to 175% of salary for 
Chris Fraser and up to 150% of salary 
for Thomas Staley. However, the 
maximum bonus earned for 2018 
may be increased up to 200% of 
salary if a successful stage 2 
financing is achieved. From 2018, 
bonus awards above 100% of salary 
will be deferred into shares for 
two years. 
Exceptional LTIP awards of up to 
500% of salary for Chris Fraser and 
up to 475% of salary for Thomas 
Staley to be granted in 2018 based 
on the critical milestone of first 
polyhalite being extracted from the 
ore body (see page 97). 
Reflecting best practice a 200%  
of salary shareholding guideline 
applies. 
LTIP awards granted from 2018 will 
only be released to an Executive 
Director prior to the fifth anniversary 
of the date of grant if the 
shareholding guideline has 
been achieved.
To mitigate the risk that the overall 
maximum remuneration payable 
may have the potential of being 
simply too high, irrespective of 
outstanding Company performance, 
an overall total remuneration cap of 
£20 million has been incorporated 
into the Policy.
Maximum vesting of the ordinary 
award requires this milestone to 
be achieved by 31 March 2022. 
The exceptional element of the 
awards is subject to the delivery 
of this transformational milestone 
significantly ahead of plan (with 
maximum vesting requiring this 
milestone to be achieved by 
15 March 2021).
We are committed to a responsible 
approach to executive pay that 
reflects appropriately the unique 
nature of our business and is 
aligned with the next phase of 
development into what will be a 
disruptive, world-leading fertilizer 
operation. We have consulted with 
shareholders on the design and 
implementation of our Policy and 
have taken into consideration the 
feedback received, which resulted 
in some changes (including to our 
approach to bonus deferral, the 
inclusion of time frames on LTIP 
milestones and reduction in the 
proposed total annual 
remuneration cap). We will 
continue to engage with our 
shareholders and trust that you will 
support the resolutions to be 
proposed at the 2018 AGM in 
relation to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.

DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION POLICY
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out Sirius Minerals’ Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy) which, 
subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 Annual General Meeting, shall take binding effect from the close of that 
meeting. Remuneration arrangements entered into with Directors before the move from AIM to the Main Market do not 
form part of the forward looking Policy, but may be satisfied in accordance with their terms as referred to on page 85.
The principal aim of the Policy, which has been determined by the Remuneration Committee, is to align the interests of 
Executive Directors with the Company’s strategic vision and the long-term creation of shareholder value. The Policy is 
intended to remunerate our Executive Directors competitively and appropriately for effective delivery of this and allows 
them to share in this success and the value delivered to shareholders.

MEASURES
Base salary Core element of fixed 
remuneration 
reflecting the 
individual’s role and 
experience.
The Remuneration 
Committee ordinarily 
reviews base salaries 
annually, taking into 
account a number of 
factors including (but 
not limited to) the 
value of the 
individual and their 
experience and 
performance.
The Remuneration 
Committee also takes 
into consideration:
• pay increases 
within the Group 
more generally; 
and
• Group organisation, 
affordability and 
prevailing market 
conditions.
Whilst there is no maximum salary, 
increases will normally be within the 
range of salary increases awarded 
(in percentage of salary terms) to other 
employees in the Group. However, 
higher increases may be awarded in 
appropriate circumstances, including 
(but not limited to):
• an increase in scope of the role or the 
individual’s responsibilities;
• where an individual has been 
appointed at a lower than typical 
market salary to allow for growth in the 
role, in which case larger increases 
may be awarded to move salary 
positioning to a typical market level as 
the individual gains experience;
• change in size and complexity of the 
Group; and/or
• significant market movement.
Such increases may be implemented 
over such time periods as the 
Remuneration Committee deems 
appropriate.
While no formal 
performance 
conditions apply, 
an individual’s 
performance in the 
role is taken into 
account in 
determining any 
salary increase. 77

Long-term 
incentives 
(the Sirius 
Minerals Plc 
Long Term 
Incentive 
Plan or LTIP)
Long-term incentive 
awards will be 
granted under the 
LTIP, which provides a 
clear link between 
the remuneration of 
the Executive 
Directors and the 
creation of value for 
shareholders by 
rewarding the 
Executive Directors for 
the achievement of 
objectives aligned to 
shareholders’ 
interests. 
Awards may be 
granted in the form of 
conditional shares, 
nil-cost options or 
Jointly Owned Equity* 
awards, or as 
cash-based 
equivalents.
The vesting of awards 
will be subject to the 
satisfaction of 
performance 
conditions.
Recognising the 
Company’s strategy 
and the stage of its 
development, 
performance 
conditions may be 
achieved, so that 
awards vest, before 
the third anniversary 
of the date of grant. 
However, vested 
shares will, ordinarily, 
only be released to 
the Executive Director 
so that he can 
dispose of them 
(other than sales to 
cover tax liabilities 
arising in relation to 
the award) before the 
fifth anniversary of 
the date of grant of 
the award if the 
Executive Director 
satisfies the 
shareholding 
guideline.
Recovery provisions 
apply, as referred to 
below.
The overall maximum value of shares 
over which a participant may be granted 
an award in respect of any financial year 
of the Company is up to 500% of base 
salary. However, in normal 
circumstances, the maximum annual 
award will be up to 200% of base salary 
for the Company’s CEO and up to 175% of 
base salary for the Company’s CFO. Any 
additional award up to the overall 
maximum will only be granted where 
awards are subject to exceptional / 
aspirational stretch targets.
Performance 
conditions will be 
determined by the 
Remuneration 
Committee in 
advance of each 
grant and aligned 
with the Company’s 
strategy. These 
conditions may be 
based on operational 
strategic milestones 
or financial measures.
Vesting will be 
determined in 
accordance with a 
vesting schedule set 
by the Remuneration 
Committee as at the 
date of grant.
* A Jointly Owned Equity award (JOE) gives the participant an interest in the future growth in value of shares owned jointly with a trustee. A JOE award may 
also include the right to acquire the trustee’s interest in the shares for nil cost, so that the participant is entitled to the full value of the vested shares.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED 79
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Recovery provisions (malus and clawback)
Bonus and LTIP awards are subject to the following recovery provisions:
Malus: The bonus opportunity may be cancelled or reduced before payment and an LTIP award may be cancelled or 
reduced before vesting in the event of material error or misstatement of results, material failure of risk management, 
material misconduct by the Executive Director, material health and safety failure.
Clawback: For up to two years following the vesting of a bonus or an LTIP award, the bonus paid may be recovered 
(and any deferred bonus award may be cancelled or reduced) and the LTIP award may be cancelled or reduced 
(if it has not been realised) or may be recovered in the event of material error or misstatement of results, material 
misconduct by the Executive Director, material health and safety failure.
Explanation of performance measures chosen
In order that incentive remuneration is appropriately linked to the delivery of the Company’s strategy and taking into 
account the stage of the Company’s development, LTIP awards will typically be subject to performance conditions 
based on the delivery of operational milestones linked to the delivery of the Company’s North Yorkshire polyhalite 
Project.
The Remuneration Committee may vary or substitute any performance measure if an event occurs which causes it to 
determine that it would be appropriate to do so (including to take account of acquisitions or divestments, a material 
change in strategy or a change in prevailing market conditions), provided that any such variation or substitution is fair 
and reasonable and (in the option of the Remuneration Committee) the change would not make the measure less 
demanding than the original measure would have been but for the event in question. If the Remuneration Committee 
were to make such a variation, an explanation would be given in the next Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Shareholding guidelines
To align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has adopted 
formal shareholding guidelines in accordance with which each Executive Director is required to build a shareholding 
equal to 200% of his or her annual base salary. In accordance with the Policy table set out above, a post-vesting 
holding period applies to the LTIP awards until the holding is achieved. Shares subject to awards which have vested 
but have not been realised and shares subject to any deferred bonus award count towards the guidelines on a net of 
assumed tax basis.
Operation of share plans
The Remuneration Committee may amend the terms of awards and options under its share plans in accordance with 
the plan rules in the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital or a demerger, special dividend or other 
similar event or otherwise in accordance with the rules of those plans. The Remuneration Committee may operate any 
such plan in accordance with its rules. Share awards granted under any such plan may be settled in cash, although 
the Remuneration Committee would only do so where the particular circumstances made this the appropriate course 
of action (for example, where a regulatory reason prevented the delivery of shares).
Total remuneration – annual cap
For the reasons referred to in the statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, there is an overall 
annual total remuneration cap of £20 million for each Executive Director. If the remuneration otherwise disclosable in 
the single figure table in the Directors’ Remuneration Report for a year would exceed this limit, the Remuneration 
Committee shall reduce variable pay as it considers appropriate.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED 81
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Policy for the remuneration of employees more generally
The Group aims to provide a competitive remuneration package which is appropriate to promote the long-term 
success of the Company. The Company intends to apply this policy fairly and consistently and does not intend to pay 
more than is necessary to attract and motivate staff. In respect of the Executive Directors, a greater proportion of the 
remuneration package is ‘at risk’ and determined by reference to performance conditions. A significant number of the 
Company’s employees participate in LTIP awards in line with the Company’s ethos of ensuring that incentives for the 
wider employee population remain aligned to the interests of shareholders.
Illustrations of application of the remuneration policy
The following charts provide an illustration, for each of the Executive Directors, of the application for the 2018 financial 
year of the remuneration policy. The charts show the split of remuneration between fixed pay (i.e. base salary, benefits 
and employer pension contributions/salary supplement), annual bonus and long term incentive pay. The regulations 
require us to show remuneration on the basis of minimum remuneration, remuneration receivable for performance in 
line with Sirius Minerals’ expectations and maximum remuneration. Reflecting our approach to LTIP awards and the 
intention to grant awards at the level of 500% of salary in 2018 (subject to the exceptional performance target for 
delivering the first polyhalite significantly ahead of plan), we have shown both an ‘ordinary’ maximum and a ‘super 
stretch’ maximum which assumes the vesting of a 500% LTIP award. The charts do not take into account any share 
price appreciation.

Recruitment remuneration policy
When hiring a new Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will typically align the remuneration package with 
the above Policy.
When determining appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Remuneration Committee may include other elements 
of pay which it considers are appropriate. However, this discretion is capped and is subject to the principles and the 
limits referred to below.
• Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the Executive Director being appointed. 
This may include agreement on future increases up to a market rate, in line with increased experience and/or 
responsibilities, subject to good performance, where it is considered appropriate.
• Retirement benefits will be provided in line with the above Policy.
• The Remuneration Committee will not offer non-performance related incentive payments (for example a ‘guaranteed 
sign-on bonus’).
• Other elements may be included in the following circumstances:
 ° an interim appointment being made to fill an Executive Director role on a short-term basis;
 ° if exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a Non-Executive Director takes on an executive function 
on a short-term basis;
 ° if an Executive Director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or 
long-term incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance. Subject to the 
limit on variable remuneration set out below, the quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may 
be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis; and
 ° if the Director will be required to relocate in order to take up the position, it is the Company’s policy to allow reasonable 
relocation, travel and subsistence payments. Any such payments will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
• The Remuneration Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period and vesting period, deferral 
period and holding period of the bonus or LTIP if the Remuneration Committee determines that the circumstances of 
the recruitment merit such alteration. The rationale will be clearly explained in the next Directors’ Remuneration Report.
• The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted (excluding ‘buyout’ awards as referred to below) 
is 700% of salary, reflecting an annual bonus opportunity of up to 200% of salary and an LTIP grant of up to 500% of 
salary. However, awards at these levels would only be made in the event of exceptional performance targets applying.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED 83
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The Remuneration Committee may make payments or awards in respect of hiring an employee to ‘buyout’ 
remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will 
take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to the forfeited arrangements and 
the time over which they would have vested. The Remuneration Committee will generally seek to structure buyout 
awards or payments on a comparable basis to the remuneration arrangements forfeited. Any such payments or 
awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above. ‘Buyout’ awards will 
ordinarily be granted on the basis that they are subject to forfeiture or ‘clawback’ in the event of departure within 12 
months of joining Sirius Minerals, although the Remuneration Committee will retain discretion not to apply forfeiture or 
clawback in appropriate circumstances.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under Sirius Minerals’ existing share plans. 
If necessary and subject to the limits referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside of these plans as 
permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the 
recruitment of an Executive Director.
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall 
be allowed to continue in accordance with their terms.
Fees payable to a newly appointed Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be in line with the policy in place at the 
time of appointment.
Executive Directors’ service agreements and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Company’s policy is for Executive Directors to be employed on service agreements which, ordinarily, may be 
terminated on not more than six months’ notice by the Executive Director or the Company. However, the Company 
reserves the right to offer a notice period of up to 12 months for any Executive Director appointed after the date on 
which this Policy becomes effective. Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but serve under letters of 
appointment which may be terminated on three months’ notice by the Non-Executive Director or the Company.
Details of the service contracts, letters of appointment and notice periods for the current Directors are set out below.

Payment for loss of office
Eligibility for the various elements of remuneration is set out below:
Executive Directors
PROVISION TREATMENT
Fixed remuneration Salary, benefits and pension contributions (or salary supplement) will paid to the date of termination. 
Payments in lieu of 
notice 
Where a payment in lieu of notice is made this will include salary, benefits and pension contributions (or a 
salary supplement) until the end of the notice period that would otherwise have applied. Alternatively, the 
Company may continue to provide the relevant benefits.
Bonus This will be reviewed on an individual basis and the decision whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part 
will be dependent upon a number of factors including the circumstances of the Executive Director’s 
departure and his or her contribution to the business during the bonus period in question. Any bonus 
payment would typically be pro-rated for time in service to termination and paid at the usual time (although 
the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to pay the bonus earlier in appropriate circumstances).
If bonus deferral would otherwise apply to any bonus for the year of termination or previous year, the 
Remuneration Committee may pay the full bonus earned in cash.
Any outstanding deferred bonus awards would typically continue (other than in the event of summary dismissal, 
where the entitlement would lapse) and vest at the originally anticipated date, although the Remuneration 
Committee retains discretion to release any such award at the date of cessation or some other date. 
LTIP LTIP awards will vest if the participant is a ‘good leaver’ to the extent determined by the Remuneration 
Committee taking into account their assessment of performance relative to the performance condition and 
such other factors as they consider relevant, which may include the length of time from grant to cessation. 
The Remuneration Committee shall determine whether awards vest at cessation or continue and can vest 
following satisfaction of the milestone, or on some other date.
For these purposes, ‘good leaver’ reasons are death, injury, redundancy, agreed retirement and any other 
reason at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion.
If an Executive Director ceases employment with the Group after an award under the LTIP has vested but during a 
post-vesting holding period, the realised shares will, ordinarily, remain subject to the original holding period.
Other payments The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are 
made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such 
obligation) or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of 
a Director’s office or employment. Any such payments may include, but are not limited to, paying any fees for 
outplacement assistance and/or the Director’s legal and/or professional advice fees in connection with his 
cessation of office or employment and/or in respect of accrued holiday entitlement.
Where a ‘buyout’ or other award is made in connection with recruitment, the leaver provisions would be 
determined at the time of the award.
In accordance with his service agreement entered into in January 2011, Chris Fraser is also entitled on 
termination by the Company to a minimum of one month’s base salary for every year of employment by the 
Company, pro-rated for any part year of service.
Change of control LTIP awards will vest on a change of control to the extent determined by the Remuneration Committee. In 
determining the extent of vesting, the Remuneration Committee would have regard to the extent to which the 
performance measures had been satisfied, and other factors the Remuneration Committee considers relevant.
Any deferred bonus shares will vest on a change of control or other relevant event.
As described on page 83, the notice to which Chris Fraser is entitled to increases to 12 months’ in certain 
change of control situations.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED 85
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation on termination of their appointment in excess of their 
fees for the notice period.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Remuneration Committee does not formally consult with employees as part of its process when determining 
Executive Director pay. However, as noted in the Policy table on page 76, the level of salary increases of employees 
within the wider Group is considered when setting base salary for Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee is 
also kept informed of general decisions made in relation to employee pay and related issues.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee believes that ongoing dialogue with major shareholders is of key importance. During the 
financial year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with shareholders in relation to the Policy and our proposals 
have been finalised having regard to feedback received.
Legacy remuneration arrangements
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of 
office (including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they 
are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed: (i) before the Policy came 
into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the 
Remuneration Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the 
Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award 
is granted.
These legacy remuneration arrangements include:
• an entitlement on the part of each Executive Director to one business class return flight per year for him and his 
family to Australia and, in certain termination scenarios, to the reasonable costs incurred in the Executive Director 
and his family relocating to Australia;
• an entitlement on the part of Thomas Staley to be awarded 1,000,000 shares on completion of agreed milestones 
under the Milestone Award granted to him and referred to in the Prospectus; and
• share options held by the Directors disclosed in the Prospectus and referred to on page 92 to 93.

ANNUAL REPORT  
ON REMUNERATION
This report provides details on remuneration in the period and some other information required by the applicable 
regulations. It will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 Annual General Meeting. The relevant sections 
of this report have been audited, as required.
Composition
The Remuneration Committee is made up of four members: the Chairman of the Board (Russell Scrimshaw) and three 
independent Non-Executive Directors (Lord Hutton, Louise Hardy and Jane Lodge). The Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee is Lord Hutton.
Louise Hardy was appointed to the Committee on 15 December 2017 and until, her appointment, the composition of the 
Committee did not meet the requirement under provision D.2.1 of the Code.
Responsibilities
The main role of the Committee is to:
• review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy;
• review and approve the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors;
• recommend and monitor the level and structure of remuneration of senior management; and
• produce the Annual Report on the Directors’ remuneration.
The Terms of Reference for the Committee are set out in detail on the Company’s website, siriusminerals.com. 
These terms were updated in March 2017 to reflect current best practice for a Premium Listed company ahead 
of the Company’s move from AIM to the Main Market and are reviewed on at least an annual basis.
Meetings
The Committee has regular scheduled meetings and holds additional meetings as and when required. Members are 
expected, where possible, to attend all Committee meetings. Three meetings were held in 2017 and individual 
attendance is set out in the table below.
At the invitation of the Committee, and as appropriate to the matters under discussion, meetings may be attended by 
the Executive Directors.
Agendas, briefing notes and reports for each Committee meeting are distributed via a secure electronic Board portal in 
advance of each meeting and in sufficient time to allow proper consideration of their contents.
The core activities of the Committee are documented and planned on an annual basis and a list of matters arising from 
each meeting is maintained and followed up at subsequent meetings. Full minutes of each meeting are kept by the 
Company Secretary, detailing the matters considered and decisions taken by the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee has access to the Company Secretary for assistance as required and can obtain other 
professional advice at the Company’s expense, if required. Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) has provided advice to the Committee 
during the year in relation to its consideration of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration. Deloitte is retained to provide 
independent advice to the Committee as required. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, 
as such, voluntarily operated under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. 
Deloitte’s fees for providing remuneration advice to the Committee were £30,000 for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
The Committee assesses from time to time whether this appointment remains appropriate or should be put out to tender 
and takes into account the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct when considering this. Deloitte was 
appointed by the Committee and has provided share scheme advice, other tax advice and general remuneration advice to 
the Company. 87

Committee evaluation
During the year the Committee 
undertook an internal evaluation of its 
performance in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code and its Terms 
of Reference. The General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, on behalf of 
the Chairman, circulated a 
comprehensive questionnaire to 
members and attendees of the 
Committee using the electronic 
board portal covering all issues 
related to the functioning of the 
Committee. The responses were 
consolidated and anonymised and 
common themes identified in order 
for the Committee to determine key 
actions and next steps for improving 
Committee effectiveness and 
performance.
The results of the 2017 internal 
evaluation show that overall the 
Committee is operating effectively. 
Areas identified for action for 2018 
include incorporation of a 
programme of training and 
presentations into the Committee 
meeting schedule at appropriate 
times, including updates from Deloitte 
on topical issues, such as key trends 
and issues in UK executive 
remuneration; the development of an 
enhanced induction programme for 
new Remuneration Committee 
members; and more Committee 
meetings held in person rather than 
conference call.
Committee activity in 2017
During the year the Committee:
• engaged Deloitte to 
undertake a benchmarking 
exercise of Executive Directors’ 
salaries and Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees ahead of the 
Company’s move from AIM to 
the Main Market (the ‘Deloitte 
Benchmarking Exercise’);
• considered, and 
recommended to the Board, 
changes to the remuneration 
packages of the CEO and 
senior management team 
and the annual fees of the 
Non-Executive Directors and 
Board Chairman having 
considered the Deloitte 
Benchmarking Exercise;
• considered and 
recommended to the Board, 
2017 share awards;
• in preparation for the move 
from AIM to the Main Market, 
received a briefing 
memorandum from Deloitte 
on future expectations and 
obligations regarding 
remuneration and a gap 
analysis of the Company’s 
current position;
• reviewed the design of the 
2017 Remuneration Report 
including consideration of the 
binding Remuneration Policy;
• approved the process for the 
Committee’s 2017 annual 
performance evaluation;
• reviewed the annual schedule 
of agenda items for the 
Committee;
• conducted and reviewed the 
results of the 2017 
performance evaluation of 
the Committee and agreed 
actions for 2018; and
• received and considered an 
update on market and 
governance developments in 
UK executive remuneration 
and the implications for the 
Company.

1 Thomas Staley was appointed a Director on 2 February 2017 and the salary disclosed in respect of 2017 is for the period from his appointment date 
until 31 December 2017.
2 Louise Hardy was appointed to the Board on 12 May 2016.
The figures in the single figure tables above are derived from the following:
SALARY AND FEES THE AMOUNT OF SALARY/FEES RECEIVED IN THE YEAR
Benefits The taxable value of benefits received in the year in respect of qualifying services as an Executive Director.
Annual bonus 2017: Cash bonus approved and payable in 2018 based on the Committee’s assessment of performance 
achieved during the year ended 31 December 2017 (see further details below).
2016: In respect of Chris Fraser, a cash bonus of £540,000 was approved and paid in April 2017. This bonus 
was based principally on the Committee’s assessment of performance achieved during the year ended 
31 December 2016. In respect of Thomas Staley, a cash bonus of £220,000 was approved and paid in April 
2017. Although this bonus was paid when Thomas Staley was an Executive Director, this bonus was based 
principally on the Committee’s assessment of performance achieved during the year ended 
31 December 2016 (prior to his appointment as an Executive Director). This bonus has therefore not been 
shown in the Directors’ remuneration table above.
LTIP 2017: No long-term incentive awards held by Executive Directors vested by reference to performance in 2017.
2016: No long-term incentive awards held by Executive Directors vested by reference to performance in 
2016.

T Staley* £330,000 – –
* Thomas Staley was not a Director of the Company in 2016.
Salaries for the Executive Directors were disclosed in the Prospectus published in April 2017. Reflecting the development 
stage of our Project, and that the Company is still some years from becoming cash flow-generating, the base salaries 
are positioned at the lower end of the market for FTSE 250 companies. The Committee set them with a focus on the 
balance between fixed and variable pay so that the overall package was appropriate where stretch performance is 
delivered. 
Annual Short-term Incentive Plan
For the financial year ended 31 December 2017, the Executive Directors earned cash bonuses of £332,500 (in the case 
of Chris Fraser) and £250,000 (in the case of Thomas Staley). These bonuses were approved in 2018 based on the 
Committee’s assessment of performance achieved during the year ended 31 December 2017 as set out below. For 
2017, it was also agreed that whilst the Executive Directors performance was at or above targets set in all areas, the 
Company should continue to be conservative in its cash bonus awards assessment, given that stage 2 financing has 
not yet been achieved. Bonuses were approved by the Remuneration Committee following a robust assessment of the 
Executive Directors’ contribution to the delivery of the following specific strategic objectives linked to Project stage 
progress, safety, financing, leadership and regulatory approvals.

The graph below shows the total shareholder return (TSR) performance for the Company’s shares in comparison to the 
FTSE 250 for the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017. The Company is a constituent of this Index and as such 
it has been selected as an appropriate comparator group. For the purposes of the graph, TSR has been calculated as 
the percentage change during the period in the market price of the shares, assuming that dividends are reinvested. The 
graph shows the value, by 31 December 2017, of £100 invested in the Group over the period compared with £100 invested

disclosure, the maximum opportunity for each year is assumed to be 175% of the salary for the year, in line with the normal maximum annual bonus 
opportunity under the Company’s proposed Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
2 LTIP awards of 857,143 shares which vested in three tranches in 2014 and 2015 and 2016 were granted on 21 May 2013. These awards were subject to 
continued employment only. Therefore this LTIP has been included in the single figure table at grant based on the closing middle market share price on 
21 May 2013 of 25.25 pence. There were no other awards which vested in respect of a performance period ending in the five years to 31 December 2017.

1 In order for the comparisons to be meaningful, the group of employees selected for the wider workforce comprised: (1) in relation to salary, those 
employees who were with the business in both 2016 and 2017 and, accordingly, were eligible for a salary review in 2017; (2) in relation to taxable 
benefits, those employees who were received taxable benefits in 2016 and those employees who received taxable benefits in 2017 (other than benefits 
related to JOE awards, as described below); and (3) in relation to bonuses, those employees who were eligible for a bonus in both 2016 and 2017. 
These groups have been selected in order to provide a meaningful comparison and so that remuneration between 2016 and 2017 can be viewed on a 
like-for-like basis.
2 Salary increase for the CEO is a consequence of the resetting of base salaries when the Company was admitted to the Main Market as explained in 
the salary and fees note to the single figure table on page 89.
3 Benefits provided to the CEO and to other employees who receive JOE awards include the payment by the Company of the income tax and employee 
National Insurance contributions due in respect of the award of JOE awards under the LTIP. Because these benefits relate to the value of the long-term 
incentive awards granted to the CEO and other employees, they are excluded for the purposes of this analysis as, in the opinion of the Committee, 
their inclusion would not result in meaningful disclosure of the increase in the benefits.

For 2018, the Executive Directors’ maximum bonus opportunity will be 175% of salary for Chris Fraser and 150% of salary for 
Thomas Staley. However, the maximum bonus earned for 2018 may be increased up to 200% of salary if a successful 
stage 2 financing is achieved. This recognises the critical importance and transformational impact of a successful 
stage 2 financing.
Details of the bonus measures and targets for 2018, to the extent that they can be shared prospectively, and the 
weightings which apply to each element are provided below. The Company will disclose further detail to explain how 
performance is assessed against each of these strategic goals on a retrospective basis in the 2018 Annual Report.
Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary will be deferred into shares for a period of two years.

Long-term Incentive Plan
Subject to shareholder approval of the Policy, we intend to grant LTIP awards of up to 500% of salary to Chris Fraser and 
up to 475% of salary for Thomas Staley following the 2018 AGM. This reflects the significant changes brought about 
by commencement of construction during 2017, our ambitious goals for the Project through the next phase of 
development and the prospective construction over the next several years of a complex and large scale project 
and first mining of polyhalite. This event is expected to be a seminal and unique achievement for the Company in 
its lifecycle.
The 2018 LTIP share grant consists of two elements: ordinary grants of 200% of salary for Chris Fraser and 175% for 
Thomas Staley and an ‘exceptional stretch award’ to encourage rapid and early construction which, we believe, 
will result in significant additional benefits to shareholders, potentially of many hundreds of millions of pounds. This 
exceptional stretch award would be up to 300% of salary. As set out in further detail below, the vesting of the 2018 
LTIP awards will be based on the critical milestone of first polyhalite being extracted from the ore body.
‘Ordinary’ award  
(up to 200% of salary for Chris Fraser  
and up to 175% of salary for Thomas Staley).
Vesting of the ordinary award is linked to the delivery of the first polyhalite 
by 31 March 2022 for maximum vesting of the ordinary award. Given the 
scale and complexities and nature of the Project a threshold award would 
vest regardless of when first polyhalite is delivered. However, the amount 
that would vest in this case would be modest (20% of the ordinary award).
% of ordinary award vesting
31 March 2022 100%
30 June 2022 75%
31 October 2022 60%
31 December 2022 50%
30 June 2023 35%
First polyhalite achieved 20%
‘Exceptional Stretch Award’  
(up to an additional 300% of salary).
Vesting of the exceptional stretch award is linked to the delivery of the first 
polyhalite significantly ahead of schedule. If polyhalite is not delivered by 
30 September 2021 then none of the exceptional stretch award will vest. 
Maximum vesting of the exceptional stretch award requires this milestone 
to be delivered by 15 March 2021.

In addition the Committee will apply a general performance underpin (either up or down) which means that any 
formulaic amount which would vest will be considered against the overall performance of the business in determining 
the appropriateness of that level of vesting.
Vested shares will only be released to the Executive Director so that he can dispose of them (other than sales to cover tax 
liabilities arising in relation to the award) before the fifth anniversary of the date of grant of the award if the Executive 
Director satisfies the shareholding guideline.

OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION CONTINUED
Appointment and replacement of 
Directors
The appointment and replacement of 
Directors is governed by the 
Company’s Articles of Association 
(Articles), the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (Code), the 
Companies Act 2006 (Act) and 
related legislation. The Board may 
appoint a Director either to fill a 
casual vacancy or as an addition to 
the Board so long as the total number 
of Directors does not exceed the limit 
prescribed in the Articles. An 
appointed Director must retire and 
seek election to office at the next 
AGM of the Company. In addition to 
any power of removal conferred by 
the Act, the Company may by 
ordinary resolution remove any 
Director before the expiry of their 
period of office and may, subject to 
the Articles, by ordinary resolution 
appoint another person who is willing 
to act as a Director in their place. In 
line with the Code and the Board’s 
policy, all Directors are required to 
stand for re-election at each AGM.
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all the Directors 
will retire at the 2018 AGM and offer 
themselves for re-election. The Board 
is satisfied that each Director is 
qualified for re-election by virtue of 
their skills, experience and 
contribution to the Board. In addition, 
the Board considers that all Directors 
have the necessary skills and 
experience as set out in their 
biographies on pages 56 and 57.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the provisions of the 
Articles of Association, the Directors 
may exercise all the powers of the 
Company.
A shareholders’ authority for the 
purchase by the Company of a 
maximum of 10% of its own shares 
was in existence during the year. 
However, the Company did not 
purchase any of its shares during that 
time. The authority expires at the 
forthcoming AGM and it is proposed 
that a similar authority be approved.
Conflicts of interest
Under the Companies Act 2006 and 
the provisions of the Company’s 
Articles of Association, the Board is 
required to consider potential 
conflicts of interest. The Company has 
established formal procedures for the 
disclosure and review of any conflicts, 
or potential conflicts, of interest which 
the Directors may have and for the 
authorisation of such matters of 
conflict by the Board. To this end the 
Board considers and, if appropriate, 
authorises any conflicts, or potential 
conflicts, of interest as they arise and 
reviews any such authorisation 
regularly. The Board believes that the 
procedures established to deal with 
conflicts of interest are operating 
effectively.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Company has provided each 
Director with an indemnity to the 
extent permitted by law in respect of 
the liabilities incurred as a result of 
their holding office as a Director of 
the Company.
The Company has in place 
appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ 
Liability insurance cover in respect of 
potential legal action against its 
Directors.
Directors’ interests in contracts
Except as stated in note 18 on page 
128, no contract existed during the 
year in relation to the Company’s 
business in which any Director was 
materially interested.

forward-looking statements should 
be treated with caution due to the 
inherent uncertainties underlying 
any such forward-looking

these forward-looking statements, 
which are not a guarantee of 
performance and which are subject 
to a number of uncertainties and 
other events, many of which are

DIRECTORS’  
RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law 
the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in 
accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union 
and Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, and 
applicable law). Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group and 
Company for that period. In 
preparing the financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union 
have been followed for the Group 
financial statements and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101, have been 
followed for the Company financial 
statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial 
statements;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements 
on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Group and Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show 
and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group 
and Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that, to the best of our 
knowledge:
• the financial statements, which 
have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SIRIUS MINERALS PLC
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OPINION
In our opinion:
• Sirius Minerals Plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the financial statements) give a true 
and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss 
and cash flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’, and applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated and Parent 
Company statements of financial position as at 31 December 2017; the consolidated income statements and statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of cash flows, and the consolidated and Parent Company statements 
of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the 
significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were 
not provided to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in the Directors’ Report, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the Company 
in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Overview
Key audit 
matters
Audit scope
Materiality
• Overall Group materiality: £4.0 million (2016: £4.0 million), based on 0.5% of total assets.
• Overall Company materiality: £3.6 million (2016: £3.9 million), based on 0.5% of total assets.
• We, as the Group engagement team, audited Sirius Minerals Plc, York Potash Limited and Sirius 
Minerals Finance Limited. Each is considered to be a financially significant component of the 
Group due to the quantum of their asset base. Taken together these three entities represent 97% 
of the Group’s total assets and 100% of its loss before tax.
• Valuation of complex financing arrangements (Group and Parent). 105
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it 
operates, and considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including 
fraud. We designed audit procedures at group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. 
We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and Company financial 
statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules,financial conduct and UK tax legislation. 
Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting 
documentation, review of correspondence with tax authorities, review of correspondence with legal advisors and enquiries 
of management. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-
compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely 
we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed 
the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any 
comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Valuation of complex financing arrangements
The Group’s stage 1 financing activities during the 2016 
financial year has resulted in a number of complex financing 
arrangements being entered into with third parties, 
specifically:
• US$250 million royalty agreement with Hancock British 
Holdings Limited
• US$50 million equity arrangement with Hancock British 
Holdings Limited
• US$400 million of Group issued Dollar denominated 
convertible bonds.
Accounting for each of these financing instruments under 
IFRS is complex and, where valuation models are required, 
the eventual accounting treatment is sensitive to key 
management judgements.
The accounting framework for each of these financing 
instruments and the respective valuation models employed 
by management remain consistent with those adopted in 
2016. However, the valuations recognised in the 2017 
financial statements remain sensitive to current year inputs in 
the valuations models. Given the material nature of these 
instruments and the judgemental nature of these inputs we 
consider this to be a key audit matter.
(Group and Parent)
We obtained management’s valuation model for each of 
the financing instruments listed. To assess application we:
• read the underlying contract and assessed whether the 
contract terms supported the accounting treatment 
adopted;
• assessed whether the valuation model adopted was 
consistent with the model applied during the period 
ended December 2016;
• evaluated discount rate assumptions made by 
management, engaging our PwC valuation experts to 
assist with this evaluation;
• confirmed convertible bond conversion rates to source 
documentation;
• read the disclosure made in the financial statements.
We found, based on the results of our testing, that the 
valuation, recognition and disclosures made in the financial 
statements in respect of these financial instruments were 
consistent with the supporting evidence we obtained.

Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group, headed by Sirius Minerals Plc, comprises 13 wholly owned statutory entities, nine of which are registered and 
domiciled in England and Wales. The remaining entities are registered and domiciled in each of Jersey, Canada, Singapore 
and the USA. 
The Group’s activities are fully centred on its UK operations, in particular the development of the Woodsmith Mine, an asset held 
by York Potash Limited. The Group is financed via equity and external debt instruments held principally by Sirius Minerals Plc and 
Sirius Minerals Finance Limited. Each of these three entities is considered to be a financially significant component due to the 
quantum of their asset base. Taken together these three entities represent 97% of the Group’s total assets and 100% of its loss 
before tax.
The Group audit team has performed statutory audits on each of the financially significant components. In addition the Group 
audit team has performed statutory audit on York Potash Processing & Ports Limited, York Potash Holdings Limited, SACH 1 
Limited, SACH 2 Limited and Sirius Minerals Holdings Limited.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall Group materiality £4.0 million (2016: £4.0 million). £3.6 million (2016: £3.9 million).
How we determined it 0.5% of total assets. 0.5% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied The Group is in a pre-trading phase 
and is focused on developing the 
Woodsmith Mine asset. Accordingly 
total assets is the primary measure 
used by shareholders in assessing 
the performance of the Group, and 
is a generally accepted auditing 
benchmark.
The Company holds investments in 
wholly owned subsidiary entities 
focused on developing the Woodsmith 
Mine asset. Accordingly total assets is 
the primary measure used by 
shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the Company, 
and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. 
The range of materiality allocated across components was between £1.4 million and £3.6 million. Certain components were 
audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.1 million 
(Group audit) (2016: £0.1 million) and £0.1 million (Company audit) (2016: £0.1 million) as well as misstatements below those 
amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of the Directors’ statement in the financial statements 
about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the 
Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, this statement is not a 
guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating to Going Concern 
in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
REPORTING ON OTHER INFORMATION 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our 
auditors’ report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions 
and matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).

Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on page 48 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 53 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our 
review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making enquiries and considering the Directors’ 
process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the Directors, on page 102, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the 
Group and company obtained in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 66 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 102, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. REFERENCE INFORMATION
Sirius Minerals Plc (the Company) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Registration number 04948435). The Company is registered in England and its registered address is 
Third Floor, Greener House, 68 Haymarket, London, SW1Y 4RF. 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
These consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together, the Group) have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The standards used are those published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and 
endorsed by the EU as at 31 December 2017.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by financial assets and 
financial liabilities (principally derivatives) stated at fair value through profit or loss. The principal accounting policies set out 
both below and throughout the subsequent notes have been consistently applied to all periods presented. The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Sterling (rounded to the nearest thousand), which is the functional currency of the 
Company and its principal subsidiaries.
GOING CONCERN
The Group continues to incur losses and cash outflows due to the significant level of development activity that it is 
undertaking in supporting the construction of its polyhalite project in North Yorkshire (the Project). The Group does not 
currently anticipate generating any revenues from the Project until late 2021. Therefore its ability to continue as a going 
concern for the time being is dependent upon it attracting sufficient financial investments from external parties to enable it 
to complete commercial development of the Project.
The stage 1 financing conducted in November 2016 generated sufficient funds to allow the Group to commence 
construction of the Project. As a result the Group continues to hold total cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits of 
£393,982,000 at 31 December 2017 (2016: £582,345,000). In addition, the Group currently anticipates that a further US$300 
million of cash will be received in the second half of 2018 in relation to its royalty financing arrangements with Hancock 
British Holdings Limited, subject to the satisfaction of certain contractual conditions precedent.
The Group is in the process of negotiating its stage 2 financing and has mandated a group of six financial institutions on the 
basis of a non-binding but mutually agreed term sheet. The UK Government’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority (formally 
IUK) has also confirmed its interest in supporting the stage 2 financing for the Project. The Group expects to complete its 
stage 2 financing during the second half of 2018 which will provide it with sufficient funding to complete the construction of 
the Project and result in the ongoing generation of revenues and profits.
The Group’s latest cash flow forecasts indicate that it will have sufficient liquidity to continue development of the Project on 
its current schedule for at least the next 12 months. Should there be any delay in securing the stage 2 financing, the Group 
would be able to curtail certain expenditures until further financing was secured.
Having assessed the principal risks and having regard for the above, based on the current likelihood of the success of the 
stage 2 financing and the technical completion of construction of the Project, the Directors consider it appropriate to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these consolidated financial statements. Therefore, 
these financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the going concern basis of preparation was 
inappropriate.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Group’s consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled 
by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. All intra-group transactions and balances are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting policies that are material to the financial statements are generally described in the specific note in relation to 
the individual component of the financial statements indicated by a  symbol. The accounting policies set out in the 
following paragraphs within this note are considered to be general to the financial statements and not covered by a specific 
subsequent note. 115
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
1. REFERENCE INFORMATION CONTINUED
All accounting policies applied are consistent with those used in the preparation of the prior year financial statements with 
the exception of the presentation of foreign exchange revaluations described within this note in the next section below.
Segment reporting
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires information to be disclosed about each business activity and economic environment in 
which the Group operates. Management has determined the operating segments by considering the business from both a 
geographic and activity perspective.
The Group is currently organised into one business division: the UK segment which consists of Project-related activities and 
the corporate operations. This division is the segment for which the Group reports information internally to the Board of 
Directors. The Group’s operations are predominantly in the United Kingdom. The Group has a number of non-UK based 
entities that are either dormant or whose operations are insignificant in the context of the Group. Therefore disclosures 
required under IFRS 8 are already included in the primary statements and so no further information requires disclosure.
Foreign currencies
The presentation and functional currency of the Group is Sterling. Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are 
translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rate prevailing at that date. All exchange 
differences are reported as part of finance costs in the income statement.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations which have a functional currency other than Sterling are 
translated into Sterling at foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The expenses of these subsidiary 
undertakings are translated at average exchange rates applicable in the period. All resulting exchange differences are 
recognised through other comprehensive income and accumulated within other reserves. Upon the disposal or dissolution 
of foreign subsidiaries all historic exchange differences associated with that subsidiary are recycled from other reserves 
through the income statement.
The year-end rate which was applied in translating balances denominated in US Dollars into Sterling in the financial 
statements at 31 December 2017 was £1=$1.35 (2016: £1=$1.23). The average exchange rate which was applied to US Dollar 
transactions occurring during 2017 was £1=$1.29 (2016: £1=$1.35).
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include various instant access deposits and short-term fixed deposits with original maturities of 
three months or less.
Bank deposits
Amounts reported as bank deposits represent short-term investments held by the Group which it intends to hold until 
maturity, at which point it will receive cash from the counterparty. These amounts are recorded at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are recognised by the Group when it becomes party to contractual arrangements which include derivative 
features on a standalone basis or embedded within a linked host non-derivative instrument. Derivatives are measured at 
fair value at each reporting date with all changes in fair value being recognised within finance costs within the income 
statement. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY
From 1 January 2017 the Group has elected to change its accounting policy in accounting for foreign exchange 
revaluation gains and losses in relation to cash, restricted cash and bank deposits. Previously these were classified within 
operating costs but the Group has now chosen to classify these within finance costs. This is on the basis that such gains 
and losses are more representative of outcomes from the Group’s finance hedging strategy rather than a part of underlying 
operating costs.
The Group has retrospectively made this restatement from 1 January 2016 in these financial statements, resulting in an 
increase in reported operating costs and a reduction in finance costs of £4,986,000 for the year ended 31 December 2016 
compared to those amounts disclosed in the 2016 financial statements. The effect on the current period has been a 
decrease in operating costs and increase in finance costs of £22,595,000. This change in accounting policy has not led 
to any change in any balance on the statement of financial position nor statement of changes in equity in any period.

1. REFERENCE INFORMATION CONTINUED
NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP
There are no new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial 
year beginning after 1 January 2017 that have had a material impact on the Group.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning 
after 1 January 2017 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. The majority of these 
are expected by the Group to not have a material impact upon the consolidated financial statements. The new accounting 
standards with the most potentially significant impact upon these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group is in the 
process of assessing the full impact of adopting IFRS 9, but based on the current nature of the Group’s financial instruments it is 
not currently expected that this will have a material impact upon adoption.
IFRS 16 Leases is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group is yet to complete its 
impact assessment of the new standard however, based on the current level of operating lease commitments the Group has 
entered into (as set out in note 19 on page 129), as well as the absence of any finance leases, then the effect of transition to 
this new standard is unlikely to materially impact the Group’s financial statements.
The Group currently expects to adopt each of these standards in the period that they become mandatory.
JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES
The preparation of financial statements requires the exercise of judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also 
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the 
estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are summarised below and set out in more detail in the 
related notes in the boxes denoted by a  symbol.
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The judgements that carry the most significant risk of an outcome that differs from the amount recognised in the financial 
statements are as follows:
ACCOUNTING FOR ROYALTY FINANCING AGREEMENT
In November 2016 the Group entered into a royalty financing agreement. IFRS does not provide explicit guidance on how 
transactions with the features of this agreement should be accounted for and therefore judgement is required in applying the 
most appropriate and faithful accounting treatment for the contract. For more information see note 14 on page 126.
FAIR VALUATION OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group has certain financial instruments associated with the stage 1 financing which it is required to classify as derivatives 
and measure at fair value. The fair value of each of the derivatives is not directly observable from market prices and so the Group is 
required to exercise judgement in estimating the appropriate fair values. For more information see note 21 on page 133.
Other accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
ESTIMATION OF PROVISIONS
As part of the planning permissions that the Group must comply with as it develops its Project, it is required to restore 
environmental disruption caused on the sites on which it operates. Such restoration costs are not expected to be settled until 
the final exhaustion of the Project, however the cost of liabilities incurred by each balance sheet date must be estimated and 
provided against. For more information see note 12 on page 124.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any of its assets may be impaired and 
recognises an impairment if the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Estimation is required in assessing 
the recoverable amount of a given asset at each measurement date. For more information see note 7 on page 120.

Total Directors’ emoluments and emoluments of the highest paid Director, together with full details of Directors’ remuneration, 
pensions and benefits in kind are given in the Annual report on remuneration on pages 86 to 98.
4. FINANCE COSTS
Interest income is accrued using the effective interest rate method. Interest expense is expensed as 
incurred except where it relates to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets. 
Interest on borrowings directly relating to the financing of qualifying assets in the course of construction is 
added to the capitalised cost of those projects under Capital works in progress’, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Where funds have been borrowed specifically 
to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred net of all 
interest income earned on the temporary re-investment of those borrowings prior to utilisation. All other 
borrowing costs are recognised as part of interest expense in the period in which they are incurred.

5. TAXATION
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Research and development tax credits are 
recognised within current tax when they can be reasonably estimated.
2017
£000s
2016

Corporation tax credit received 362 468
Total tax recognised in statement of comprehensive income 362 468
The tax credit for the year is lower (2016: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for the year ended 
31 December 2017 of 19.25% (2016: 20%). The differences are explained below:
2017
£000s
2016

Loss on ordinary activities before taxation (79,249) (23,422)
Loss on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation taxation in the UK of 19.25% 
(2016: 20%) 15,255 4,684
Taxation effects of:
Expenses not deductible for tax purposes (7,930) (15)
Tax losses not recognised (see note 17) (7,325) (4,669)
Research and development tax credit 362 468
Total tax credit for the year 362 468
The standard rate of corporation tax changed from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017. Accordingly the Group’s loss for the year is 
taxed at an effective rate of 19.25%. Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance 
Bill 2017 (on 6 September 2016). These include reductions to the main rate to reduce the rate to 17% from 1 April 2020. Deferred 
taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these enacted tax rates and reflected in these financial statements
The research and development tax credit is in relation to the HMRC Research and Development Relief Scheme for SMEs and 
enables the Group to realise tax losses on certain qualifying expenditure to be received immediately in cash rather than waiting 
for taxable profits to set them against in the future.
6. LOSS PER SHARE
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For all periods presented, the Group’s potentially dilutive ordinary share equivalents (being share options issued under 
equity-settled share-based payment schemes, the convertible loans, and share options issued to Hancock British Holdings 
Limited under the royalty financing arrangement) reduce the loss per share and have therefore not been included in 
determining the total weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the purposes of calculating diluted loss 
per share.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 119
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
EXPLORATION COSTS AND RIGHTS
Costs arising from exploration and evaluation activities are accumulated separately for each area of 
interest and only capitalised as part of intangible assets where such costs are expected to be recouped 
through successful development. Expenditure capitalised comprises direct costs that have a specific 
connection with a particular area of interest.
Capitalised expenditure in respect of areas of interest is written off in the income statement when the 
above criteria do not apply or when the Directors assess that the carrying value may exceed the expected 
recoverable amount. Capitalised costs in respect of an area of interest that is abandoned are written off in 
the period in which the decision to abandon is made.
When technical feasibility and commercial viability of an area of interest have been demonstrated, all 
capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure in respect of that area of interest is reclassified from 
intangible assets to capital works in progress within property, plant and equipment. All subsequent 
development expenditures on that area of interest are capitalised and classified as capital works in progress 
within property, plant and equipment, provided commercial viability conditions continue to be satisfied.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of identifiable net 
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset 
and allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. Any goodwill recognised is 
stated at cost less accumulated impairment and any impairment is recognised immediately in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
OTHER INTANGIBLES
Research expenditure is expensed to the income statement as incurred. Development costs on activities 
that have moved past the research phase are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful 
lives. Prior to any sales occurring of the products to which the development costs relate, they are held at 
cost and tested annually for impairment. 
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairments, and is amortised 
on a straight-line basis over its useful life (ranging between three and five years). Amortisation of software 
is included within operating costs in the income statement.
IMPAIRMENT
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any of its intangible 
assets may be impaired. Where an indication of impairment exists (or, on an annual basis in the case of 
goodwill), the Group makes a formal estimate of recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an 
asset exceeds its recoverable amount (estimated as the value-in-use of the asset) the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances based on the Group’s latest approved forecasts.

IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Group is required to consider whether any impairment may exist in each of its intangible assets. As a result 
the Group was required to estimate the value in use of each of these assets based on predicted future cash 
flows to compare to the assets’ carrying values. The estimation of these future cash flows is inherently 
uncertain and the use of different assumptions could lead to an impairment being recognised.
All of the net book value of goodwill relates to the Group’s acquisition of York Potash Limited (the legal entity developing the 
Project) in January 2011.
Recoverable amount has been assessed using fair value less costs of disposals based on discounted cash flow techniques 
where the resulting estimate is based on the detailed long-term production plan which was made public as part of the Group’s 
stage 1 financing. The lowest-output future production plan in that document calculated a net present value of the Project of 
US$7.1 billion as at October 2016. A discount rate of 10% (which is considered to be appropriate for a project of this nature and 
size and consistent with industry norms), was applied in calculating that valuation. No reasonably possible change in the key 
assumptions on which the goodwill’s recoverable amount is based would cause its value to fall short of its carrying amount as 
at 31 December 2017.

8. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Cost includes all expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of these items 
and, for assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, borrowing costs. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the costs can be measured reliably. 
All other costs, including repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement in the 
period in which they are incurred. 
Capital works in progress include all spend directly attributable to the development of the Project, 
including buildings, civil works, equipment, labour, direct services and professional fees. These assets are 
not depreciated. At the point in time in the future when the Project commences production, all assets 
within this category will be transferred to appropriate separate asset classes and depreciation will 
commence from that point.
The plant and equipment category currently represents assets used for generally administrative purposes 
and which are not directly involved in development of the Project, including the Group’s head office 
leasehold improvements and IT hardware. Depreciation is provided on all assets within this category 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally between three and five years. Freehold 
land is not depreciated.

During January 2017 the Group commenced significant development work at its Project. All exploration costs and rights in 
relation to the Project previously capitalised by the Group have been transferred from intangible assets to property, 
plant and equipment from that date since the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the Project had clearly 
been demonstrated.

US Dollar amounts reported by the Group are in relation to the US$400 million convertible loans, as further described in note 13 on 
page 126. Sterling amounts are in respect of local authorities’ security requirements which reflect a combination of providing 
environmental restoration for construction works and the security requirements of the Section 106 agreements. All amounts are 
classified as non-current except for those amounts which are expected to be released back to the Group within the next 
12 months.
10. SHARE CAPITAL
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments (generally ordinary shares) issued by the Group are recorded 
at the proceeds received, with the par value of shares issued being recorded within ordinary share capital 
and any surplus, net of any direct issue costs, being recorded in the share premium account.
The Company has only one class of share capital, being ordinary shares with a par value of 0.25p each. Shares included in the 
table below are all allotted, issued and fully paid up.

11. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain Directors, senior managers, employees 
and consultants. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of 
non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of 
the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the 
effect of non-market based vesting conditions. For employees employed directly in relation to the Project, 
any charge in relation to options or awards held by them is capitalised as part of additions to property, 
plant and equipment.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options and awards that are 
expected to vest and immediately recognises any impact of the revision to original estimates.
The accumulated expense recorded prior to vesting in respect of each share-based payment is 
recognised within the share-based payment reserve and reclassified to share capital upon the issuance 
of the underlying shares. If fully vested share options are not exercised and expire then the accumulated 
expense in respect of these is reclassified to accumulated losses.
The Group operates three equity-settled share-based payment arrangements as part of its employee remuneration strategy 
which are detailed below. The total expense recognised within the income statement in relation to equity-settled 
share-based payment transactions in the year is £822,000 (2016: £884,000). Further amounts of £1,217,000 (2016: £127,000) 
have been capitalised within property, plant and equipment (2016: intangible assets) in relation to the fair value of 
share-based payments earned by employees who are employed solely on direct development work on the Project.
Share options
The Group’s share option scheme provides for the grant of share options to certain parties at stipulated exercise prices. The 
options are generally conditional upon the completion of a set service period (between one and three years) and typically 
expire ten years after grant date. The Group used the Black-Scholes model to value the share options that it awarded under 
the scheme. The options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.9 years 
(2016: 3.1 years) and exercise prices between 10.2p-43.7p (2016: 10.2p-43.7p). For the options exercised during 2016, the 
weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 22.86p.

11. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED
Senior awards
The senior awards scheme provides for grants of awards in the form of conditional free shares or nil cost options to certain 
senior employees in the Group. Shares in relation to the awards vest to participants upon the Group’s achievement of strategic 
milestones to which the individuals directly contribute. The fair value of awards made under the scheme is equal to the share 
price on the grant date of the awards. Movements in the number of shares awarded under the scheme are as follows:
Number of ordinary share awards (thousands) 2017 2016
Outstanding at 1 January 9,840 18,167
Granted 3,200 11,858

Outstanding at 31 December 10,790 9,840
Employee benefit trust awards
The Group operates an employee benefit trust award scheme in the form of conditional free shares which are granted to all 
employees (although employees remain liable for any personal tax consequences of the grant). The vesting of the shares to 
employees is conditional upon employees’ continued employment with the Group and the achievement of key Group-level 
strategic milestones (principally, shaft-sinking, the completion of stage 2 financing and first commercial ore sale). The fair value 
of awards made under the scheme is equal to the share price on the grant date of the awards. Movements in the number of 
shares awarded under the scheme are as follows: 
Number of ordinary share awards (thousands) 2017 2016
Outstanding at 1 January 3,119 –

12. PROVISIONS
The Group is required to rehabilitate sites and associated facilities during construction and at the end of their 
lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities in compliance with licence requirements and other 
commitments made to stakeholders. The costs associated with these obligations are provided for in the 
accounting period when the obligation arising from the related disturbance occurs. Such costs do not include 
any additional obligations which are expected to arise from disturbance expected to be caused in future years.
Provisions are initially recognised at the net present value of the future cash flows associated with them. When 
provisions are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset within property, plant and 
equipment, representing part of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation.

The initiation of the Group’s development work at the Project during the year has given rise to the future need to undertake 
restoration activities in order to maintain compliance with relevant planning consents. The Group’s obligation is to undertake 
the necessary restoration activities at the end of the Project’s life in order to restore sites to their previous character.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 125
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
12. PROVISIONS CONTINUED
In order to estimate the value of the provision, the Group has relied upon valuations which were undertaken for the purposes 
of determining the value of local security requirements that are held in restricted cash at the end of the year. These amounts 
were valued by third parties based on the estimated present-day cost that would be required to remediate the disruption 
caused by the Group’s activities by the end of the year. These costs, which the Group does not plan to be incurred for in 
excess of 50 years, have been discounted at a real risk free rate of 2% per annum, based on an estimate of the long-term, 
risk free, cost of borrowing.
The Group is required to estimate the net present value of future restoration obligations in settling upon the 
value of provisions to recognise at each measurement date. The actual costs of restoration may vary from 
estimates made at the reporting date. Such obligations will not be settled for many years and the extent of 
restoration works that will ultimately be required is inherently uncertain. Estimates can also be impacted by 
the emergence of new restoration techniques and experience gained between the measurement date 
and prior to the costs’ incurrence. Where possible, the Group relies upon third-party valuations to assist 
with reliably estimating the value of provisions liable at each measurement date.
13. CONVERTIBLE LOANS
Convertible loans represent liabilities entered into by the Group which are principally loans that require 
repayment, but which may ultimately be settled by conversion into shares at the option of the Group  
and/or counterparty based on the terms of a conversion element which is written into the terms of the 
loan contract.
Convertible loans are assessed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements. The 
conversion element of each agreement is split out of the host loan and is classified as a liability or 
equity on the basis of the contractual characteristics of the conversion features. Conversion features of 
convertible loans denominated in the Group’s functional currency of Sterling are typically classified as 
equity amounts and not re-measured while conversion features of convertible loans denominated in a 
currency other than Sterling are classified as derivative financial instruments.
All transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the convertible loans are deducted 
from the initial carrying value of the host loan. These transaction costs are amortised in line with the host 
loan and recognised as part of finance costs.
At inception the conversion element is separated from the host loan and is assigned a fair value based on 
an appropriate fair-valuation technique. The initial carrying amount of the host loan is equal to the funds 
raised less the fair value attributable to the conversion option at inception and less transaction costs. The 
host loan is held at amortised cost and measured using the effective interest rate method, with all interest 
being charged to finance costs.
Conversion elements that are derivative instruments are re-measured to fair value at each balance sheet 
and conversion date with any movement in fair value being recorded in finance costs. 
Upon conversion, the carrying value of the host loan and conversion derivative is extinguished from 
liabilities and reclassified into equity as share capital and share premium.
FAIR VALUE ESTIMATION OF THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE
The Group is required to apply judgement in estimating the fair value of the embedded derivative at each 
point in time. Further information about the nature and sensitivity of this estimate is provided in note 21 on 
page 133.

On 28 November 2016 the Group issued US$400 million of seven year, 8.5% quarterly coupon US Dollar-denominated convertible 
loans at par, receiving gross proceeds of £319,923,000. The key terms of the convertible loans are that at any date subsequent to 
8 January 2017 up until maturity a loanholder may convert their loans into ordinary shares in the Company at a conversion price 
of US$0.31 per share.
If a loanholder elects to convert prior to 28 November 2018 then, as well as receiving ordinary shares in the Company, they will 
also receive a make-whole cash payment equal to the total value of coupon payments that they would have been owed had 
they held their loans until 28 November 2018. The Group also has a call option to redeem all loans at par should the Company’s 
share price consistently exceed US$0.54 from 19 December 2018 onwards. Loanholders may not request early cash-repayment 
of their bonds except under certain protective clauses relating to changes of ownership in the Group.
Under the terms of the convertible loan, the Group has also been required to set aside an amount in an Escrow bank account in 
respect of all coupon payments due until 28 November 2019, which is disclosed as part of restricted cash. The Group is not able 
to use this restricted cash for any purpose other than the payment of quarterly coupons and make-whole payments.
Due to the conversion terms of the loans leading to the issuance of a fixed number of ordinary shares in the Company in return 
for the extinguishment of the bonds whose value is variable in terms of the Company’s functional currency of Sterling, the Group 
has accounted for the bonds as a host loan instrument containing an embedded derivative liability in respect of the 
conversions features.
During 2017, conversion notices in respect of 22.4% of the US$400 million convertible loans were delivered by convertible 
loanholders to the Group, leading to the creation of 291,287,368 new ordinary shares in the Company.
14. ROYALTY FINANCING AGREEMENT
ACCOUNTING FOR ROYALTY FINANCING AGREEMENT
The Group entered into a royalty financing agreement during 2016. Significant judgement is required in 
determining how the agreement should be accounted for due to the lack of explicit guidance for these types 
of arrangements under IFRS. Based on the precise contractual terms of the agreement, the Group has 
concluded that the agreement should be accounted for as a financial instrument, to be accounted for in 
accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Furthermore, the Group has 
concluded that prior to drawdown occurring the agreement is analogous to a loan commitment and 
therefore no recognition of it is necessary in the financial statements until drawdown occurs.
LOAN COMMITMENTS
Loan commitments are a financial instrument, to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IAS 39 specifically excludes loan commitments from recognition 
and measurement prior to drawdown. Once drawdown of the loan commitment occurs, the loan will be 
initially recognised at fair value (generally the value of loan proceeds received) and will be subsequently 
re-measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
14. ROYALTY FINANCING AGREEMENT CONTINUED
On 25 October 2016 the Group entered into a royalty financing agreement with Hancock British Holdings Limited (Hancock). 
Under the agreement Hancock will pay consideration of US$250 million in return for future royalty payments amounting to 5% 
of gross revenues on the first 13 million tonnes of product sold in each calendar year and a further 1% of gross revenues on 
sales in excess of 13 million tonnes, for the life of the Project.
Drawdown of the US$250 million consideration is subject to certain conditions precedent being met, principally the Group 
giving notice to Hancock that it has expended US$630 million of the proceeds of the Group’s November 2016 stage 1 
financing and that all material permits, commercial arrangements and authorisations for the Project remain in place. 
The Group has until October 2020 to achieve these conditions.
The agreement also commits Hancock to subscribe for 200 million new ordinary shares in the Company for an additional 
consideration of US$50 million at the time of drawdown of the royalty consideration. A derivative liability (2016: asset) is 
recognised in respect of this commitment and its fair value is measured as the difference between the fair value of the US$50 
million that will be received and the fair value of 200 million new ordinary shares that will be issued on the drawdown date. 
Further information about the fair value estimation of this derivative is provided in note 21 on page 133.

less all interest-bearing debt. Interest-bearing debt includes only the host loan element of the US$400 million convertible 
loans and not the embedded conversion derivative on the basis that the Group has no obligation to cash-settle the 
embedded derivative.

17. DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred taxation represents temporary differences in the accounting carrying values of assets and liabilities 
and the tax base of those same assets and liabilities. Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability 
method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. In line with IAS 12 Income taxes, no deferred tax is 
recognised on the initial recognition of an asset or liability that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting, nor taxable profit or loss (unless the transaction is a business combination). 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted (or substantially enacted) by the 
balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred 
tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised, or to the extent that they offset deferred tax 
liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate 
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities 
where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
The following table shows the nature of deferred tax assets/(liabilities) recognised by the Group:

At 31 December 2017 (10,748) (3,806) 14,554 –
All deferred tax balances arise from timing differences in relation to UK corporation taxes and are expected to be able to be 
offset between companies. Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are only recognised to the extent that they offset deferred 
tax liabilities.
In addition to those tax losses recognised above, the Group has further unused UK tax losses which would represent a deferred 
tax asset of £9,716,000 (2016: £2,297,000). These losses have not been recognised due to uncertainty over the availability of 
future taxable profits against which to set them.
In the UK tax losses generally have no expiry. However for companies which have not yet begun formal trading (including the 
Group’s main subsidiary), only expenditure from the seven years prior to the date of commencement of trade are available for 
future use. Consequently, £1,129,000 of the potential deferred tax asset in respect of unrecognised losses noted above are

19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Operating lease commitments
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are 
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received 
from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Group leases certain buildings under operating lease agreements. The lease terms are between two and fifteen years 
and the majority of agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period, at market rate. The lease expenditure 
charged to the income statement during the year is disclosed in note 2 on page 117. 
The future aggregate minimum lease payments outstanding under operating leases agreements are:
2017
£000s
2016
£000s
No later than 1 year 376 185
Later than 1 year and no later than 5 years 1,800 249
Later than 5 years 1,925 –
Total amounts due under operating leases 4,101 434
Capital expenditure commitments and contingent liabilities
At 31 December 2017 the Group had contracted but unrecognised capital expenditure commitments of £20,806,000. 
The Group has no other commitments or contingent liabilities at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: nil). 
20. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
On 14 February 2018 the Group announced that it had signed a design and build contract with DMC Mining Services UK Ltd 
for the construction for the Project’s shafts. The target price of this contract is consistent with the previously announced 
allocated Project budget.
21. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to the availability of funds to meet business needs (liquidity risk) and 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates (market risk).
a. Liquidity risk and capital management
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on overall liquidity is to ensure that it can call on sufficient funds to facilitate all ongoing operations and 
planned expansion of the Project on its optimal production timetable.
The Group monitors its levels of working capital and financial investments to ensure that it can meet its payments as they fall 
due. The following table shows the gross contractual maturities of the Group’s recognised financial liabilities, including 
unrecognised future interest payments:

All cash flows contractually due in respect of the convertible loans until the end of 2019 will be settled with the Group’s 
restricted cash.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure that it is best placed to further its development of the Project, 
whilst also safeguarding the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Group defines capital as being cash and cash 
equivalents plus bank deposits. The Board of Directors monitors the level of capital as compared to the Group’s commitments 
and approves plans to adjust the level of capital accordingly in the best interests of shareholders. The Group is not subject to 
any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of the annual budgeting and long-term planning process the Group’s cash flow forecast is reviewed and approved by 
the Board. The cash flow forecast is updated on a monthly basis taking account of the latest expenditure forecasts. Based on 
the size and timing of the forecast expenditures, the Group adjusts the mix of holdings of its cash and cash equivalents and 
bank deposits in order to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its expenditures, whilst maximising the return on its funds, 
within the bounds of the Group’s Board-approved treasury policy. 
b. Foreign currency exchange rate risk
The Group’s operations are essentially based in the United Kingdom and it is expected that future revenues will be denominated 
in US Dollars. The majority of the Group’s operating and capital expansion costs are denominated in Sterling although a 
significant portion of capital expansion costs are expected to be denominated in Euros and Canadian Dollars. The Group’s 
debt financing is denominated in US Dollars.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 131
Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
21. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
The Group is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than 
the proceeds of the stage 1 financing (Sterling and US Dollars). It is the Group’s policy to hedge foreign currency exposures 
associated with committed or probable expenditures in order to mitigate this potential transaction risk. The Group achieves 
this by purchasing cash and bank deposits in the relevant foreign currencies ahead of the occurrence of the transactions 
and simultaneously designating these foreign cash and bank deposits as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge 
relationships. As a result the Group is able to significantly mitigate its exposures to movements in the Sterling/Euro and 
Sterling/Canadian Dollar exchange rates, both in its expected cash flows and upon its income statement.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk since its convertible loan debt financing (net of surplus cash 
that the Group holds which was received on issuance of the convertible loan) is denominated in US Dollars. It is the Group’s 
policy to not hedge this risk. As a result, movements in the Sterling/US Dollar exchange rate will impact upon the Group’s 
reported financial position and performance. A strengthening of the US Dollar against Sterling would have an adverse 
impact on reported losses and the Group’s financial position. It is expected that this exposure will reduce over time by 
conversion of the convertible loans (which will crystallise all currency fluctuations in equity without requiring any cash 
settlement by the Group), meaning that this is not expected to give rise to a material cash flow risk.
The impact of a 10% weakening in the Sterling/US Dollar exchange rate compared to the rate prevailing at 31 December 
2017 would be an increase in reported loss of £9,125,000 (December 2016: £1,440,000) and a reduction of £9,126,000 
(December 2016: £1,456,000) to the Group’s reported equity.
The Group has put in place a foreign exchange risk management system within its intercompany borrowing structure to 
minimise the risk that any adverse fluctuations in the Sterling/US Dollar exchange rate indicated by the sensitivities in the 
paragraph above could give rise to any material cash tax exposures.
c. Interest rate risk
The Group’s convertible loans have a fixed rate of interest of 8.5% and so interest payments due under these loans are not 
exposed to any cash flow risk arising from fluctuations in market interest rates. The Group has no other interest-bearing liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and restricted cash held by the Group all earn interest which is either floating 
or fixed for no longer than one year. The Group seeks to invest its interest-bearing financial assets in such a way so as to 
maximise the interest earned based on prevailing market rates, within the bounds of first minimising credit risk associated 
with the investments and ensuring that the investments are sufficiently liquid to allow the Group to service its day-to-day 
operating and expected capital expenditures.
d. Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and restricted cash. The 
Group’s maximum credit exposure is equal to the carrying value of its financial assets as reported in the statement of 
financial position.
This risk is mitigated by placing bank deposits and entering into financial instruments only with approved institutions who 
have an S&P credit rating of at least A-. Furthermore, to prevent concentration risk, the Group’s treasury policy mandates 
that no more than 20% of the Group’s surplus funds can be placed with any single institution (other than the Group’s primary 
relationship bank).

The carrying value of all the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is equivalent to their fair value except for the convertible loans 
(where the host loan element is measured at amortised cost). The fair value of the convertible loans at 31 December 2017 was 
£286,514,000 (2016: £334,679,000) compared to the stated carrying value of £249,325,000 (2016: £321,366,000). The traded 
market price of the Group’s convertible loan at 31 December 2017 was 124.5 (2016: 102.9).

Sirius Minerals Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017
21. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
f. Fair value
The Group is required to exercise judgement in appropriately estimating the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments held by the Group do not have observable market 
prices and so the Group is required to identify appropriate valuation models in calculating these fair 
values. In making its estimates, priority is given to inputs based on actual market data and transactions, 
although these valuations nevertheless require some level of subjective assessment and the use of 
different valuation assumptions could have a significant impact upon the Group’s reported financial 
performance and position.
Financial instruments measured at fair value are grouped into one of three levels as set out by IFRS 13 Fair Value based on 
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. These levels are as follows:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) based on active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(that is, prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices);
Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The only assets or liabilities that the Group has which are measured at fair value are the derivatives associated with the 
convertible loans and the royalty financing. These have both been assessed to be a level 2 financial liability since the 
derivatives themselves are not traded on an active market but their fair values are determined by valuation techniques 
that are based solely on observable market data. The main inputs to the derivatives’ valuations are: the traded price of the 
Group’s convertible loans; the traded price of the Group’s shares; forward exchange rates and the debt yields of entities 
with similar credit profiles to the Group.
In order to estimate the fair value of the convertible loans’ embedded derivative at any point in time, the Group estimates 
the fair value of the cash flows due under the host loan at an assumed discount rate that would likely apply to any debt 
issued by the Group which was not convertible and subtracting this from the market value of the convertible loans (based 
on the quoted trading price) at the measurement date. In estimating this assumed discount rate, the Group considers 
publicly quoted bond yield data of comparable entities with similar credit profiles and their prevailing bond yields at the 
measurement date.
The fair value of the royalty equity investment derivative is estimated as the net present value of the difference between the 
US$50 million receivable (in Sterling terms) and the 200 million shares to be issued on the royalty drawdown date (whose 
value is based on their spot price at the measurement date).
The inputs used in the fair valuation estimates of these derivatives exposes the Group to further market risks. Movements in 
these inputs cause the fair valuation (but not the cash flows) of the derivatives to fluctuate and affect reported finance costs. 
Increases in the convertible loans’ price and share price (which generally move synchronously) would cause an increase in 
the loss reported from both derivatives while an increase in the discount rate assumed would cause an increase in the loss 
reported from the convertible loans’ embedded derivative. Conversely, a fall in the Group’s share price would cause a gain 
to be reported on these instruments’ fair value. The sensitivity of the derivatives’ valuation upon the reported loss for the year 
and total equity resulting from a 10% change in these inputs is as follows:
2017
£000s
2016
£000s
Convertible loans and share price increase/(decrease) 33,089/(33,089) 36,632/(36,632)

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A. REFERENCE INFORMATION
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
These financial statements relate to Sirius Minerals Plc, a publicly traded company incorporated and domiciled in England. 
The registered address is Third Floor, Greener House, 68 Haymarket, London, SW1Y 4RF.
These financial statements present the results of the Company as an individual entity and are prepared on the going 
concern basis, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101) and the 
Companies Act 2006. These financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as detailed in note 1 on 
page 114 of the consolidated Group financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under the standard in 
relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in 
respect of share capital, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective and related party transactions. 
Where required, equivalent disclosures are provided in the consolidated Group financial statements of Sirius Minerals Plc.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by financial assets and 
financial liabilities (including derivatives) stated at fair value through profit or loss. The principal accounting policies set out 
below have been consistently applied to all periods presented. The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
Sterling (rounded to the nearest thousand), which is the functional currency of the Company.
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies which have been applied by the Company when preparing the financial statements are in 
accordance with FRS 101. FRS 101 is based on the recognition and measurement requirements of EU-adopted IFRS, under 
which the consolidated Group financial statements have been prepared. As a result, the accounting policies of the 
Company are consistent with those used and disclosed in the consolidated Group financial statements, except for the 
policy relating to investments in subsidiaries, which is detailed in note D on page 138.
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY
Consistent with the equivalent change in Group accounting policy detailed in note 1 on page 115, during the year the 
Company elected to change its accounting policy in accounting for foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses in 
relation to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and bank deposits. 
The Company has made this restatement from 1 January 2016 in these financial statements. This change in accounting 
policy has not led to any change in any balance reported within the Company’s own financial statements.
JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES
The preparation of financial statements requires the exercise of judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. 
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The most significant estimates and judgements relevant to the 
Company’s financial statements are broadly the same as those for the consolidated Group financial statements as detailed 
in note 1 on page 116. The only additional risk is around that of impairment in investments in subsidiaries, which is detailed 
further within note D on page 138.
B. PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
The Company has not presented its own income statement or statement of comprehensive income as permitted by section 
408 of the Companies Act 2006. The loss for the Company for the year was £74,690,000 (2016: £107,596,000). Included in the 
Company’s profit and loss account is a charge of £106,000 (2016: £78,000) in respect of the Company’s audit fee.

Detailed information concerning Directors’ remuneration, interests and options is shown in the table within the Annual report on 
remuneration which is subject to audit on pages 86 to 98 which forms part of the Annual Report. Details on key management 
compensation is contained within note 18 on page 128 of the consolidated Group financial statements.
D. INVESTMENTS 
Investments are initially stated at cost. Investments are tested for impairment when an indication of 
impairment becomes apparent. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that 
the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by the discounted future cash flows 
from the investment.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings 
in the Company is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured 
by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in 
subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS
At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether there is any indication that any of its investments may 
be impaired. Where an indication of impairment exists the Company makes a formal estimate of recoverable 
amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (estimated as the value-in-
use of the asset if the carrying value of the subsidiary’s’ net assets is less than the carrying value of the 
Company’s investment in it) the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
The Company is required to exercise judgement in estimating the recoverable value of subsidiaries. Estimation 
is required with regard to subsidiary’s value-in-use in a similar way to that described in note 7 on page 120 in 
relation to the estimates used in estimating the recoverable value of intangible assets.

Disclosure of the Company’s subsidiaries is given in note 23 on page 134 of the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
The Directors believe that the carrying value of the investments is supported by the projected discounted cash flows of the 
subsidiaries which are based on the latest Board-approved budgets.

E. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

£000s
2016
£000s
Hancock equity investment derivative (10,033) 1,041
Convertible loans conversion derivative (48,466) (42,433)
Total derivative financial assets/(liabilities) (58,499) (41,392)
The Hancock equity investment derivative liability (2016: asset) is the same as that disclosed in note 14 on page 127 of the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements. The convertible loans conversion derivative is effectively identical to that 
disclosed in note 13 on page 126 of the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Further disclosures in relation to these 
derivatives are included within note 21 on page 133 of the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
F. LOANS TO SUBSIDIARIES
All loans to subsidiaries do not bear interest, are unsecured and are repayable on demand. 
G. LOANS FROM SUBSIDIARIES
2017
£000s
2016
£000s
Loan from Sirius Minerals Finance Limited 249,632 370,252
Other loans from subsidiaries 375,807 – 
Total loans from subsidiaries 625,439 370,252
An intercompany loan is in place from Sirius Minerals Finance Limited (SMF) to the Company for the gross proceeds of the 
US$400 million convertible loans.
The terms of the intercompany loan mirror the terms of the external convertible loans detailed in note 13 to the consolidated 
Group financial statements. The liability recognised by the Company in its own financial statements reflects the principal 
amount of all loans, all accrued interest and the gross value of all make-whole payments potentially payable. The 
intercompany loan has a stated interest rate of 8.5% payable on the outstanding par value of all unredeemed convertible 
loans held by SMF. 
Upon any conversion of the US$400 million convertible loans the Company will receive a redeemable preference share 
in SMF from external bondholders. These redeemable preference shares are generally redeemed on the day of issuance 
against the intercompany loan, meaning that the gross intercompany liability faced by the Company continues to mirror 
the gross contractual liability that the Group has to external bondholders at each point in time.
All other loans from subsidiaries do not bear interest, are unsecured and are repayable on demand. 
H. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The total charge for the year in respect of share-based remuneration schemes was £624,000 (2016: £797,000). The grant by 
the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as 
a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is 
recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to 
the share-based payment reserve.
The key elements of each scheme, along with the assumptions employed to arrive at the charge in the profit and loss 
account, are set out in note 11 to the consolidated Group financial statements.
I. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 101 from disclosing transactions with other 
Group undertakings. Information on the Group can be found in note 23 on page 134 of the consolidated Group financial 
statements. There were no other related party transactions during the year other than those already disclosed in note 18 
of the consolidated Group financial statements on page 128.
