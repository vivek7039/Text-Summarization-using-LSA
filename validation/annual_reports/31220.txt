At a glance
Altyn’s main asset is its 100% interest in the
Sekisovskoye gold mine in North East Kazakhstan
with probable reserves of 2.26Moz.
The Company is continuing to develop the
underground mine at Sekisovskoye, and its
exploration asset at Karasuyskoye. The Company
spent US$1.4m in relation to exploration costs at
Karasuyskoye in the current year. 
The mining licence for Sekisovskoye is valid until
18 July 2020 with an automatic pre-emptive
contractual right to extend after this period.
The Company was awarded the subsoil
exploration contract for the Karasuyskoye ore
field for a 6-year term in 2016 with the right to
extend for another 4 years if there is a
commercial discovery of resources. The site
encompasses an area of approximately 198km
2
,
and geological data purchased by the Company
indicates that there are several mineralised zones,
each with the potential to contain significant
gold resources.
Throughout 2014, the Company worked on a
Competent Persons Report (CPR) in relation to
the Sekisovskoye mine site and the results of the
findings were announced in November 2014. The
significant highlights are summarised in the
mineral resources statement on page 12. It is the
intention of the Company to update the CPR in
the near future to also incorporate the site at
Karasuyskoye.
The Company’s principal shareholders, the
Assaubayev family (through their investment
vehicle African Resources Limited), have provided
strong financial support and commitment to the
current development of the Company. The
family’s shareholding currently stands at 69.8%.
Our focus
During the current year the underground mine and infrastructure
have been prepared to ramp up production once the necessary
equipment is in place. In the current year the focus was on the
development of access and preparation of the ore bodies.
The key highlights are documented below:
Underground development & exploration
▲ The transport decline was taken from the developmental level
of 225masl down to 150masl.
▲ Access portal, for the second transport decline was completed
during H2 2017.
▲ The processing plant was overhauled involving a number of
replacement parts/equipment, to ensure efficient working at
higher volume levels.
▲ Capital investment of US$2.6m (2016: US$5.6m) which included
a new load-haul-dumper (LHD), and drilling machine at
Sekisovskoye.
▲ Exploration work continued on the prospective Karasuyskoye
site with extensive drilling in a number of areas on the site in
order to better define the ore bodies and grade content.
Financial highlights
▲ Turnover increased in the year to US$21.6m (2016: US$15.9m).
▲ 16,747oz of gold sold (2016: 12,602oz), an increase of 4,145oz.
▲ Average gold price achieved (including silver as a by-product),
US$1,293oz, (2016: US$1,259oz).
▲ Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation and excluding impairment) of US$3.7m (2016:
US$260,000).
▲ EBRD loan was repaid in the year, in the current year capital and
interest amounting to US$3.5m was repaid.
▲ In February 2018 the Company converted US$9.7m of the
US$10m bond issued to African Resources into 233,333,333 new
ordinary shares. It is the intention to convert the remaining
shares and interest into ordinary shares in Q3 2018.
Operational highlights
▲ Gold poured 16,717oz, (2016: 10,970oz) a 52.4% increase
year-on-year, the production was constrained by the closure of
the processing plant for maintenance and availability of the
necessary equipment.
▲ Operating cash cost US$774/oz, (2016: US$846/oz).
▲ Gold recovery rate 83.54% (2016: 80.20%) improvements in
processing production techniques.

The Sekisovskoye deposit is the Company’s flagship
asset and is located close to the village of
Sekisovka, approximately 40km from the North East
Kazakhstan regional capital, Ust Kamenogorsk.
The mineral rights at Sekisovskoye are held by a
100% owned subsidiary of the Company, DTOO
GRP Baurgold , and the processing plant is owned
by the 100% owned subsidiary of the Company
TOO GMK Altyn MM.
The Sekisovskoye deposit was discovered in 1833
with surface mining taking place during the
periods 1833 to 1847, 1932 to 1935, and 1943 to
1946. From 1975 to 1986, a range of exploration
work was carried out. Between 1978 and 1982
“AltaiZoloto” of the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Industry,
KazSSR, mined the oxidised area of the ore body. In
2003, under Hambledon Mining’s ownership
(subsequently renamed to Altyn Plc), further
exploration work was undertaken and gold
production from the mine and processing plant
commenced in 2008.
In 2014, the Company released the findings of the
mining consultant, Venmyn Deloitte’s Competent
Persons Report on the mine, which demonstrated
JORC reserves of 2.26Moz, JORC resources of
5.14Moz and a development plan to increase annual
gold production to 100,000oz. This is to be achieved
by accessing higher grade reserves through the
continued development of the underground mine
and by increasing the processing plant’s throughput
capacity from the current 850,000t per year to
1 million tonnes per year.
The extraction of the gold reserves is now
undertaken solely from the underground mine. The
Company is in the process of enhancing the
production from the underground mine gradually
increasing production with the aim to achieve upto
1,000,000t in the future.

Karasuyskoye Ore Fields
In May 2016, the Company was awarded the
subsoil exploration contract to conduct further
testing at the site Karasuyskoye ore field for the 6
year term with the right to extend for another
4 years in case of commercial discovery of
resources.
The geological data that the Company acquired
indicates that there are several mineralised zones at
Karasuyskoye and this leads the Company to
believe that this project has the potential to contain
significant gold resources. The Company is
validating the geological data by twinning previous
drill holes and undertaking additional metallurgical
test work. The initial results are very encouraging
and this work will facilitate the preparation of an
independent Competent Persons Report (CPR) to
international standards, it is to be completed in the
near term.
On completion of the (CPR), the Company
envisages progressing towards mining from the
Karasuyskoye Ore Fields, initially using cash
generated from existing operations, external
funding will be considered as the project
progresses and the cost of development is
considered.

Areas of exploration During the year the Company
maintained tight control of costs
to conserve working capital” . 
Dear shareholders,
We were expecting to be moving forward towards
the targets set in the prior year in terms of
production, however our progress was held back
by the lack of equipment. Positive progress was
made in developing the underground mine in
relation to the ore bodies and infrastructure.
However the lack of equipment had a direct effect
on the level of output and grade achieved.
During the year in order to move the project
forward, which requires capital investment, a great
deal of work was done with investment advisors
and potential lenders. The potential offers were
carefully vetted and assessed to ensure that the
finance to be provided was the correct fit for the
Company. This necessarily involved additional time
and resources and the time lines were extended to
those originally envisaged. The management are
working to ensure that the current funding being
accessed for the required investment in equipment
is at a competitive price for the shareholders and
affordable for the Company. To this end they have
identified two sources that will provide the
necessary funding required to move the project
forward, and are currently in the final stages of
confirming the funding.
During the year the Company maintained tight
control of costs to conserve working capital, with
further savings being made in 2018 both at head
office and at subsidiary Company level in
Kazakhstan. At Head Office the administrative costs
have been reduced by cutting office and
professional fees. In the subsidiaries rent, travel and
other overheads have been reduced. In Q1 2018
these have been further reduced. Employment
costs have been reduced with a rationalisation of
the workforce principally at the mine site. 
During the year the Company met its commitment
to repay the balance of the EBRD loan, which was
settled in October 2017. The consequent finance
cash flows in relation to servicing of this debt will
prove useful in meeting its obligations on any new
financial liability. 
The decline has now progressed down to 150masl,
and a number of ore bodies are now accessible to
progress 2018 production.
Underground development
150masl
The decline is now at 150masl and a number of ore
bodies are now accessible to progress production in
2018
We are confident from the work conducted so far
that the mine will generate a very good return to
the shareholders. The underground asset and
infrastructure have been developed so that it can
deliver the production required, via the new range
of equipment to be purchased. This is expected to
quickly transform the productive capacity, and
move towards the targeted output levels. The
recent drilling undertaken at Karasuyskoye has
delivered promising results and the Company are
expecting to move the project forward to the CPR
stage in the near term.
I would like to thank the shareholders for their
patience, as I am aware that the gold price was
trending up whilst our share price was trending
down. Based on the fundamentals and our
understanding of the asset we see the long-term
future of the Company in a positive light and the
patience of shareholders will be rewarded.
With the ore bodies ready for exploitation and
infrastructure in place including the refurbished
processing plant. The additional equipment will
now provide the necessary feed stock to the
processing plant to see the results of all the hard
work come to fruition.
Finally, may I once again thank all our employees
and our Management team for their hard work, and
we look forward to an exciting and fruitful year
ahead for Altyn.

Annual Report 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
With the financing for the
equipment almost in place the
Company will be ready to move
to the next phase of its
development plan.”
Overview
The Company is very close to securing the
finance to purchase the equipment necessary
to increase the output from its current levels to
its initial target of 40,000t a month, moving to
70,000t in 2019.
Infrastructure enhancements and progress of
the underground decline have been continuing
in the year. This will provide a good
springboard for increasing the output once the
available equipment is in situ.
In terms of expected timelines the production is
planned to increase from Q3 2018, once the
equipment is commissioned and delivered.
Current developments
The following progress was achieved in developing
the underground mine in the year:
 Development of the decline was taken down to
150masl, this gave access to ore bodies 10, 3-8
and ore body 5. There is no further requirement
in the short term to develop the decline as this
together with the original decline giving access
to ore body 11, will provide sufficient mineable
ore for the current planned production.
 Ore bodies have continued to be prepared for
production however the lack of equipment has
been a hindrance in this regard. In addition it
has been difficult to target the ore bodies in a
precise manner in order to extract the grade of
ore as indicated by the exploration drilling,
resulting in a higher than expected dilution in
the grade.
 The actual overall processing grade achieved in
the FY17 was 1.89 g/t (2016: 1.66g/t). As
explained this was due to two factors a dilution
issue and because lower grade ore stockpiled
ore was mixed with the higher-grade ore to
maintain operational efficiency in the processing
plant. In the year the Company did not have the
necessary equipment for contouring and drilling
the ore bodies in order to maximise the
extraction of the higher grade ore without
dilution. The underground ore grade fell to
2.08g/t from 2.70g/t in 2016. The expectation is
that these issues will be settled once the new
equipment is in place.
 Refurbishment of the processing plant and the
preparation of the ore bodies together with the
completion of tailings dam 4 in early 2017, now
allows for the rapid increase in production once
the equipment is in situ expected to be in Q3
2018. The tailings dam will provide sufficient
storage for at least three years.
 During the year the company purchased a LHD
Fambition (load-haul-dumper used to fill the
underground trucks with ore), and a prospect
drilling machine, CSK Sondaj – C400 (used to
define and contour the ore bodies to target and
extract the higher-grade ores). 
 In addition, the costs of exploration at
Karasuyskoye were capitalised in accordance
with the accounting policy this amounted
approximately US$1.4m, (475mKzt), which was
principally invoiced by third party consultants to
conduct detailed geological testing, and project
documentation.
Underground development
“ Looking forward
 The decline was developed to the 150masl
during the year further development of the
decline will be limited, as there is sufficient
access to the ore bodies at this level which can
be prepared for production. Ore body 11
contains on average higher-grade ore and is
expected to be mined during 2018.
 Preparatory works will be undertaken to include
horizontal shaft development to access ore
bodies 3-8,5 and 10 down to this level.
 With the new equipment to come on stream in
Q3 2018 the production is expected to increase
from this point gradually increasing to the run
rate of 70,000t a month.
Capital requirements
An update to the current projected development
capital requirements is given in the table to the
right.
In summary part of the capex requirement was met
in 2017 from the Company’s own resources of the
total amount shown above the external funding
being sourced is in the range of US$30m –
US$35m, the balance will be funded from the
Company’s operations. The Company has entered
into an agreement with Freedom Finance to raise
US$15m of the external funding requirement. The
Company is also in discussions with another party
to provide direct equipment financing. Taken
together this will enable the Company to progress
its development plans.
Sekisovskoye operational update
The operational performance of the Company’s
Sekisovskoye gold mine during 2017 against the
prior year is shown in the tables to the right.
In the year to December 2017, the ore mined has
increased substantially from last year, as extensive
preparation work was done on the ore bodies in the
prior year and is continuing in to the current year.
The underground gold grade is lower than in 2016,
and has dropped from 2.70 to 2.08, this is
principally due to the lack of currently available
mining equipment to target the ore body in the
most efficient way. This led to a higher than
anticipated dilution and a lower grade of ore
recovered, lower grade ore was being mined from
around the targeted ore zone. It is anticipated that
the gold grade will increase as more targeted
drilling is undertaken once the necessary
equipment is available. 
During the year the company gold mining grades
ranged from a low of 1.50 to a high in a particular
month of 2.59. This was a reflection of the amount
of development ore that was included within the
ore mined. This is not an ideal situation and is
expected to be remedied as noted above as further
drilling equipment is deployed.
The mineral processing has increased significantly,
however it should be noted that the actual

As in the prior year the processed ore was a mixture
of lower grade ore from the stock piles and the
developmental ore from the higher grade

low level from the stock piles and was only used in
order to keep the plant operational. This process of
mixing the ores will be discontinued once sufficient
feed stock is generated from the underground
sources.

refurbishment in 2017. However there is a
significant uplift in production for the period which

The gold production increased from H1 of 7,327oz
to 9,390oz in H2, production will only build
significantly from this point once the new

MARKET REVIEW AND SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE
The share price of the Company has been trading
at a low level, and is a disappointment to the
Directors, who are of the opinion it does not reflect
the true value and potential of the Company. 
The Board has worked hard in order to ensure that
the Company is set up and restructured to be
operationally efficient and to be cost efficient. It has
taken time to move to this stage, and the next
stage of development is dependent on further
funding being made available. 
The current share range has seen a drop from the
prior year and in the region of 1.0-1.3p (2016:
1.5-2.0p). The Directors feel that this is not a true
reflection of the value of the Company and expect
the share price to improve significantly as
production improves and the potential of the
Company is realised.
In addition to the current site which is producing at
Sekisovskoye, the Company is pressing ahead with
the development of the resources at Karasuyskoye.
It is hoped that 2018 will see a significant
improvement in the share price as production and
profitability improves with a stable gold price. It is
expected that the gold price would continue to
trade in the range US$1,250-US$1,300 an ounce,
similarly no significant impact is expected in
exchange rate fluctuations in the forthcoming year,
the Tenge is currently trading at 329 to the US
Dollar.

KZT/USD Our strategy is to grow and
develop by continuing to
upgrade our underground mine
at Sekisovskoye, targeting
annual gold production of
100,000oz.
Beyond this, the highly prospective Karasuyskoye
Ore Fields, adjacent to the Sekisovskoye mine,
has the potential to enable us to grow
significantly beyond our core asset.
In addition to growing our production and asset
base, our progression to the Main Board of the
London Stock Exchange in December 2014
represented not only a natural step in our growth
strategy, but also our commitment to the London
investor base and regulatory environment, and
we remain committed to meeting best practice
governance standards.
Our business model is simple – we intend to generate profits for
our Company and value for our shareholders through the mining
and sale of gold at our flagship operation, the Sekisovskoye mine in
North East Kazakhstan.
In order to ensure long-term success in this regard, we plan to continue developing the high grade
underground mine. This should result in gold production increasing to 100,000oz annually in the
future once the necessary equipment is in place.
The acquisition of the adjacent Karasuyskoye Ore Fields geological data and imminent conclusion
expected of subsoil user rights should ensure gold production growth into the future. This is now
progressing to development of the site with extensive drilling to confirm the mineral resources, with
the next step to progress with a CPR. The Company is continually looking to complement existing
operations with other targeted acquisitions.
We have four pillars to our business:
Mining – In prior years, we have demonstrated our cost effective open pit production track record at
Sekisovskoye to our shareholders and stakeholders. We intend to demonstrate our capabilities once
again with the development of the underground mine.
Development – In ensuring our long-term future, we are in the process of developing the
underground mine at Sekisovskoye in order to access the significant deeper ore reserves. Accessing
these reserves should add significantly to the life of mine and increase our annual gold production to
100,000oz.
Exploration – The Company has been conducting extensive drilling at the Karasuyskoye site, with
positive results. Geologically, we see potential for this area to contain multiple mineralised zones that
could potentially host future mines. We believe our efforts are well focused in this highly prospective
land package that has obvious synergies with our current production facilities.
Growth and Evaluation – We are committed to adding value for our shareholders and believe the best
approach to achieve this is to set the foundations in place for future production growth. As we intend
to focus our efforts on production, development, exploration and evaluation, we are confident that we
can deliver increased gold production for the long term. We frequently evaluate investment
opportunities which are presented to us both in Kazakhstan and in the wider Central Asia area and, as
part of our long-term business development plan, we will continue to evaluate other potential
opportunities going forwards.

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
The gold poured increased to 16,717oz this is a
significant increase from last year. In terms of
production and revenue generation, there is
expected to be a significant step up once the
Company is able to purchase further equipment. As
the Company is still in the process of obtaining the
equipment it is expected this will only have the
effect of uplifting production significantly in Q3
2018. However production with the current capex
levels is also budgeted to increase from 2017 levels,
but not by a significant amount. Gold prices are
budgeted to remain stable at current levels, and
there is not expected to be any change in the
principal customer purchasing the gold.
As in the prior year the Company has made use of
low grade ore from that remaining in the stock
piles this has again led to the low levels of grade
and recovery rates, as it was principally used to
maintain the operation of the processing plant at
efficient levels. As the low grade ore will be used in
2018 a write back has been made to the profit and
loss account of US$374,000, to reflect the fact that
this stock will be utilised in 2018.
The total cash cost of production, which includes
administrative costs but excludes depreciation and
provisions, amounted to US$1,075/oz, (2016:
US$1,238oz). The operating cash cost amounts to
US$774/oz (2015: US$832/oz). This is based on the
above but excluding administrative expenses. The
cash cost of production has fallen as costs have
been controlled in both consumables and the
number of workers used to generate the increased
level of production. As the level of production
increases with tight control over costs, it is
anticipated that the cash cost of production will
continue to fall to the targeted level of US$540. 
The Company has reported a net loss of US$1.9m
(2016: US$6.4m), with a gross profit of US$4.2m
(2016: US$2.3m). The operational loss is US$484,000
(2016: loss US$4.1m). The reduction in the loss is a
reflection of tighter production costs as noted
above and partly a result of head office savings,
which are budgeted to reduce further in 2018. In
Q1 2018 the Company has also further restructured
the work force in Kazakhstan by outsourcing the
transportation department and reducing the
building/maintenance department. The EBITDA is
US$3.6m (2016: US$0.3m), after adjusting the
operating loss of US$484,000 (2016: US$4.1m) for
depreciation of US$4.5m (2016: US$3.3m), and
impairment gain of US$374,000 (2016: loss
US$1.1m).
During 2017, the Company sold 16,747oz of gold
(2016: 12,602oz). The average price achieved per oz
in 2017 was US$1,293 similar to last year, which
achieved an average price of US$1,259. The prices
are budgeted to stay at similar levels in 2018, and
there are no changes anticipated to the sales
offtake agreement currently in place to the Kazakh
national refinery.
The current cash position and anticipated trading is
sufficient for the budgeted capex (with no
expansion), and budgeted production for the next
year. The principal shareholders have agreed to
provide monetary support as necessary, in order to
provide any short term financing that may be
required. 
Cash at year-end was US$704,000 (2016: US$2.2m).
Resources are sufficient to meet the current
working capital requirements. The Company
generated an EBITDA of US$3.6m (2016: US$0.3m).
Financing commitments can be met from the cash
generation of the Company, and are expected to
be at a reduced level from the prior year, being
principally interest commitments on the US$2m
convertible loan and repayment of short term
borrowings, in total these are expected to amount
to approximately US$1m in 2018. At the start of the
year, the Company had convertible bonds
amounted to US$12m. In February 2018, US$9.7m
of the US$10m issued to the principle shareholder
African Resources Limited was converted to
233,333,333 ordinary shares at a conversion price of
3p. The principal shareholders have agreed to defer
any loan repayments, in addition it is anticipated
that the remaining amounts due under the
convertible bond due to African Resources to
include accrued interest will be converted into new
ordinary shares in Q3 2018.
As stated in the CEO report the Company is in the
final stages of obtaining the finance to purchase
further capital equipment in order to increase the
processing output. Until this is in place costs
including further capital investment will be kept at
low levels and it is budgeted to be in line with 2017
at approx. US$3m, to include further exploratory
work at the Karasuyskoye site.
The consolidated net assets of the Company are
US$33.2m (2016: US$33.9m), no significant changes
from the prior year.

Risk Mitigation
Fiscal changes in Kazakhstan Given that Altyn operates solely in Kazakhstan, the Company is naturally at risk of adverse
changes to the fiscal regime in the country. Kazakhstan is a relatively young country and
there have been fiscal changes in recent years, in some cases related to the mining industry.
However, the country is outward looking and committed to attracting direct foreign
investment. Kazakhstan has hosted international exhibitions and sporting events, and is
positively encouraging investment, including relaxing visa requirements We therefore
believe that the Kazakh government is aligned with potential foreign investors and would be
very cautious in implementing any fiscal changes which could deter investment. Recent tax
audits of the subsidiary companies have not revealed any material discrepancies, the
Company has consulted with the tax authorities and provided all necessary information as
and when required, and will seek expert tax advice as and when necessary.
No access to capital – funding Sekisovskoye In order to continue with the underground development at Sekisovskoye, the Company
must incur additional capital expenditure. Currently, the Company does not have the funds
available to complete the capital work programme. The Company is therefore dependent on
cash from external sources and therefore its future is at risk if funds from these external
sources are unavailable. While the required level of funding has not been secured, the
Assaubayev family, which owns 69.8% of the Altyn shares through its vehicle, African
Resources, has invested in and lent to the Company in the past and is keen to see the
Company succeed. However, without further external funding to complete the underground
mine, production would proceed at a much slower pace than that currently planned. The
Company is currently in the process of seeking further investment, and has engaged brokers
and other consultants to market the Company to potential investors. 
Commodity price risk The Company generates its revenue from the sale of gold and silver that it has produced.
While the Company has no control over commodity prices, it is in a fortunate position to
have a very robust mine and development project in Sekisovskoye that can withstand
prolonged weak precious metals prices. Given the higher grades expected to be processed
and the low cash cost of production the Company has a significant buffer and will remain
profitable at lower gold prices.
Currency risk The US Dollar has remained stable during 2017 against the Kazakh Tenge. As at
31 December 2017, 1 US Dollar equated to approximately 330KZT and is expected to remain
in this range in the foreseeable future. As the revenue is generated in US Dollars any
strengthening of the US Dollar against the Kazakh Tenge will favour the Company, in
addition as the Company has a relatively low cost of production, local price inflation is not
expected to have a significant impact.
Reliance on operating in one country Currently all of the Company’s mining assets are in Kazakhstan. The Company believes that
Kazakhstan has significant future mineral potential, hence the choice of jurisdiction. The
Company makes it its business to be well informed of any in-country changes which may
adversely affect the business. While the Company knows and understands Kazakhstan well
and hence has a strong position in-country, it has stated that it would look at other
opportunities in the future within the Central Asia region and this may mitigate risk.

Risk Mitigation
Altyns reliance on one operation Currently, the Company only generates revenue from one mine – Sekisovskoye. The Group is
actively exploring its adjacent property, Karasuyskoye, and is now developing this asset for
future production.
Encountering technical difficulties in further developing the underground mine at
Sekisovskoye would be negative for the future of the Company. To mitigate this, the
Company uses external consultants to provide validate the work which has been undertaken
to date. The Company is in discussions with international consultants to ensure that the
most appropriate development methods are utilised.
Failure to achieve production estimates Failure to achieve production estimates could arise due to various circumstances, not the
least mining issues, processing plant issues and breakdowns, and political and other
disruptions. Given that Company revenues are dependent on producing gold and silver from
the Sekisovskoye mine, failure to achieve production targets would adversely affect the
Company’s profitability and ability to generate cash. The Company mitigates this risk by
careful operational planning and detailed technical appraisal work, as well as regular
maintenance work
The Company’s management has analysed the risks and uncertainties and has in place
control systems that monitor daily the performance of the business via key performance
indicators. Certain factors are beyond the control of the Company such as the fluctuations in
the price of gold and possible political upheaval. However, the Company is aware of these
factors and tries to mitigate these as far as possible. In relation to the gold price the
Company is pushing to achieve a lower cost base in order to minimise possible downward
pressure of gold prices on profitability. In addition it maintains close relationships with the
Kazakhstan authorities, in order to minimise bureaucratic delays and problems.
Technical difficulties developing the underground
mine at Sekisovskoye CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
10 Altyn plc
Annual Report 2017
“Each of the Company’s facilities is
subject to external environmental
checks on a quarterly basis.”
Human resources
The Company has maintained a strong
commitment to equality of opportunity in its
employment policies, practices and procedures. It is
continually looking at proactive ways to manage
the work force and introduce measures that will
benefit the work force.
The accompanying table shows their current
employees and gender.
In December 2017 after a thorough review of the
employment requirements of the Company it was
decided that a number of the functions could be
better fulfilled by outsourcing certain activities. As a
result a number of the workforce particularly in
transport and construction were outsourced, and
approximately 180 people made redundant. The
Company are conscious of their social
responsibilities and have ensured that the
employees have been dealt with in a fair and
responsible way.
Human rights
Whilst the Company does not have a specific
human rights policy, it does have policies such as
Equal Opportunities and an Anti-bribery policy that
adhere to internationally proclaimed human rights
principles.
Employment policies and diversity
The Company is in the process of implementing
and developing its diversity policy and
communicating it to its employees in a formal
manner after consultation with the local authorities
it is fully supported by senior management and
employee representatives Once formally in place
the policy will be monitored and reviewed annually
to ensure that equality and diversity is continually
promoted in the workplace. Based on the
movement of employees, one female left the
Company on a net basis. The Company is currently
reviewing in particular the number of senior
women managers with an aim to increase numbers
if justified.
The Company currently does adopt high standards
in diversity and is dedicated to encouraging a
supportive and inclusive culture amongst the
whole workforce, this now needs to be formally put
in place.
The aim is to ensure that all employees and job
applicants are given equal opportunity and that our
organisation is representative of all sections of
society. Each employee will be respected and
valued and able to give their best as a result. This
policy reinforces our commitment to providing
equality and fairness to all in our employment and
not provide less favourable facilities or treatment
on the grounds of age, disability, gender
reassignment, marriage and civil partnership,
pregnancy and maternity, race, ethnic origin,
colour, nationality, national origin, religion or belief,
or sex and sexual orientation. 
We are opposed to all forms of unlawful and unfair
discrimination. All employees, no matter whether
they are part-time, full-time, or temporary, will be
treated fairly and with respect. The Company will
enforce current work practice and work within the
spirit of the law.
When selecting candidates for employment,
promotion, training, or any other benefit, it will be
on the basis of their aptitude and ability. 
The policy will aim to create an environment in
which individual differences and the contributions
of all team members are recognised and valued. To
create a working environment that promotes
dignity and respect for every employee. To not
tolerate any form of intimidation, bullying, or
harassment, and to discipline those that breach this
policy. To make training, development, and
progression opportunities available to all staff. To
promote equality in the workplace. To encourage
anyone who feels they have been subject to
discrimination to raise their concerns so we can
apply corrective measures. To encourage
employees to treat everyone with dignity and
respect. To regularly review all our employment
practices and procedures so that fairness is
maintained at all times. 
Employee involvement
Members of the management team regularly visit
subsidiaries and discuss matters of current interest
and concern with members of staff.
Gender diversity

Environment
During 2017 each of the Company’s facilities was
environmentally monitored on a quarterly basis by
accredited outsourced companies. This included
the following checks:
 Checks were made on the water at surface and
sub-surface levels to ensure that it was within
safe limits, within both the production site and
the tailings dump site.
 Checks were regularly made on the air quality at
the production site, to include testing of the air
extraction systems at the crushing and grinding
plant, laboratory and transfer conveyors.
Appropriate repairs were carried out in the year
if there was any deviation from the accepted
norms.

 Soil samples were analysed at the tailings
dumps to ensure that there was no adverse
effects on the environment. 
Of primary importance to the Company is to
ensure that the tailings dam and water discharges
are within environmentally safe limits. The facility
has a system in place that provides treatment and
discharge of mine water into the surface reservoir –
quarterly testing is done to ensure all required
standards are met. This is reported to the
authorities on a quarterly basis.
The Company has introduced systems to control
the processing of waste in a controlled and
environmentally compliant manner. All household
waste produced is disposed of to specialised landfill
sites. Tyres are temporarily stored prior to removal
to a specialised site. Hazardous waste such as
Mercury is carefully sent for recycling as are plastic
waste from plastic packaging and other plastic
waste from pipes cutting sand geomembrane to
reduce the amount being sent to the landfill sites.
Metal scraps and exhausted oils are recycled as far
as possible on the production site.
In 2017 an energy saving system was used in the
production facilities to reuse the heat being
generated from the compressor plant. The energy
saving system allowed the heat previously wasted
to be recycled with the facility, resulting in fuel
savings and lower gas emissions.
It is in the Company’s plans to further refine and
develop its environmental management systems.
Further development of the tailings dump and
future ways of dealing with this waste in the most
efficient and environmentally manner remain a key
objective of the Company.
Our approach to the environment
The Company’s policies outline our commitment to
environmental responsibility. Safeguarding the
environment and training our employees to
minimise the environmental impact of our activities
are important aspects of our business. We remain
committed to achieving the highest environmental
standards.
Greenhouse gas reporting
Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), are classified as
either direct or indirect and which are divided

Our November 2014 Competent
Persons Report identified JORC
compliant indicated and inferred
mineral resources which total
5.14Moz and a further 3.3Moz
have been identified as an
exploration result.”
In 2014, a Competent Persons Report (CPR),
commissioned by the Company was completed to
assess the mineral resources and provide a valuation
of the potential of the underground mine. The
Competent Persons Report was prepared in
compliance with and to the extent required by the
2012 Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration
Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC).
Venmyn Deloitte (Deloitte) are Competent Persons
and Competent Experts as defined by the JORC
Codes, as well as other international Reporting Codes.
The mineral resource statement was prepared for the
Sekisovskoye underground deposit. The Company
also acquired mining data in relation to the
Karasuyskoye concession adjacent to Sekisovskoye
and this is currently being developed with a view to
obtaining the subsoil user licence in the near future.
For clarity the resources in relation to the
Karasuyskoye site are not included in the analysis
below, and will be subject to an independent
Competent Persons Report in the future.
The Company has a 100% shareholding in the
Sekisovskoye Project and holds the Mining Licence
covering a total area of 85.5ha, valid until 2020, and
expected to renew until 2033. The Sekisovskoye
Project is located at the village of Sekisovka,
approximately 40km north of the town of Ust-
Kamenogorsk, the capital city of the East Kazakhstan
region. The current operation is exploiting two open
pits where the near-vertical deposits extended to
surface.
The ore body has been mined in the open pit
environment since 2008 and the relationship
between ore and waste is well understood.
The Sekisovskoye Project is set to be a selective-
mining underground operation, which requires a
level of confidence to be developed to support the
new input and output parameters.
Venmyn Deloitte conducted a review of the
exploration drilling, metallurgical testing, geological
modelling and the GKZ Reserve and Resource
prepared by the Company, and has used this
information to estimate the JORC (2012) compliant
gold and silver Mineral Resources. These are shown
in the following tables.
Subsequent to estimating the Indicated Resource,
Venmyn Deloitte applied the appropriate modifying
factors (including dilution and mining losses) and
has estimated a Probable Reserve of 2.26Moz of
gold.
Altyn has not updated its mineral resources since
2014.
JORC Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources total
5.14Moz. In addition, a further 3.30Moz have been
identified as an Exploration Result below the –800masl.
While these will require further exploration drilling to
be potentially upgraded to Mineral Resources, this
result does highlight the potential for a larger Mineral
Resource than is currently estimated. Assuming that
this potential were to be realised, Sekisovskoye would
contain in excess of 8Moz of gold.
Geologically, the Sekisovskoye Project is suitable for
mining of underground extensions of the deposit,
which is shown to extend almost vertically below
the currently exploited open pits. Geological features

in the underground area are expected to be similar
in nature to those in the near surface portion of the
deposit. The exploration method is systematic and
appropriate for the style of mineralisation and the
targeted resources and reserves are of sufficient
quantity to support an expanded mining operation.
The risks for underground production are reduced by
the following:
 the Sekisovskoye Project has operated
successfully for a number of years in the open pit
environment;
 the Company has created an extensive drilling
database for geological modelling of the breccia
zones and mineralised ore bodies;
 the underground mining method is based upon
a block model that has identified important
breccia zones that can be selectively mined;
 the underground ore body is a natural extension
of the open pit ore;
 the mining, metallurgical plant, power, water and
tailings facilities are all established including the
main underground ramp ways; and
 the ore reserve and mineral resource estimates
have been based on a very substantial
exploration programme which represents more
than 170,083m of drilling.

The Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and Procedure (“the Anti-Bribery Policy”) forms part of our Ethics Policy and represents a commitment to doing what is
right. 
The Group expects its employees to demonstrate honesty, integrity and fairness in all aspects of their business dealings and exercise appropriate standards of
professionalism and ethical conduct in all their activities. 
The Group expects the same approach to doing business from its business partners and suppliers. Pursuant to this, the Group will not tolerate bribery1 or
corruption2 in any form and has a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to any breach of this policy.
Application This means that the Group and its employees will never seek, accept or give a bribe, facilitation payment, kickback or other improper payment. 
It will ensure that it operates with appropriate transparency in our business dealings.
The Company will take appropriate steps to ensure that: 
p directly or indirectly, offer, promise, give, accept or demand a bribe or other undue advantage (including excessive gifts and hospitality) in order to obtain or
retain business, or gain any other improper advantage. 
p not offer, nor give in to demands, to make illicit or illegal payments to agents, public officials (at whatever level), or the employees of business partners or
anybody else that we do business with. 
p engage and remunerate agents and other third parties only for legitimate services and adopt appropriate transparency in our approach.
p promote employee awareness of, and compliance with, company policies against bribery and corruption through appropriate dissemination of our own
procedures (including disciplinary procedures) policies and training programmes on induction and subsequently. 
p adopt management control systems that discourage bribery and corruption, and adopt financial and tax accounting and auditing practices that prevent the
establishment of “off the books” secret accounts or the creation of documents which do not properly and fairly record the transactions to which they relate.
p make illegal or inappropriate contributions to candidates for public office or to political parties or to other political organisations. 
p raise awareness of the need to combat bribery and corruption with our business partners by publication of this Policy and (where appropriate) relevant
contractual provisions and support initiatives designed to reduce the risk of bribery and corruption.

releases have been issued throughout the year; the Company’s website www.altyn.uk is regularly updated and contains a wide range of information about the
Company. Enquiries from individuals on matters relating to their shareholdings and the business of the Company are dealt with informatively and promptly. The
Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available on a website. Financial statements are published on the
Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary
from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility

Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at the offices of BDO LLP at 55 Baker Street, London, W1U 7EU, United Kingdom on Friday 29 June 2018
at 11.00am.
The details of the resolutions are given on page 59. The Directors consider that all of the resolutions to be put to the meeting are in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders as a whole. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of all resolutions.
Donations
The Company has made no charitable or political donations during the year (2016: Nil).
Future development and availability of project finance/going concern
To progress the mine to the full projected capacity the Company requires further funding, which the Company has made good progress in putting in place. It is
currently in the advanced stages of finalising funding for new equipment from two parties. It is seeking bond finance from one party and direct equipment
purchasing from another party, in order to secure the necessary investment.
The Company is continuing to develop its underground mine, production is continuing at a steady pace with gold sold in the current year of 16,747 oz. From the
operating cash flows generated the Company paid the balance of the EBRD loan, which with interest amounted to US$3.5m. In order to preserve cash flow,
savings have been made in overhead costs at both head office and subsidiary level. In January 2018, African Resources Limited converted US$9.7m of the US$10m
convertible loan debt into new ordinary shares. No interest was paid in relation to this loan in the year and it is expected that the balance of the bond to include
accrued interest will be converted into new ordinary shares in Q3 2018.
The Directors have reviewed the cash flows for 15 months from the date of approval of the financial statements based on the projected trading. The Directors are
confident that should the fund raising not be successful to provide the funds in the expected timeframe the Company will be able to adapt its operational plans
such that it continues to operate.
Furthermore the major shareholder has confirmed their intention to provide further funding to enable the Company to continue its planned operations for at least
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
On this basis the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.

STATEMENT OF THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises of two Directors – Ashar Qureshi and Neil Herbert. Alain Balian resigned in December 2017. The Committee,
which meets as required, is responsible for determining the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits of the Executive Directors. The remuneration of the
Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board within the limits set out in the articles of association. None of the Committee members has any personal
financial interest in the matters to be decided (other than as shareholders), potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-Directorships, or any day-to-day
involvement in running the business. The Committee has access to professional advice from inside and outside the Company at the Company’s expense. There
were no Remuneration Committee meetings held during the year.
Details of the remuneration paid in the year are shown below.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
All appointments to the Board are made on merit. The components of a new Director’s remuneration package (who is recruited within the life of the approved
remuneration policy) would comprise at present a base salary. As outlined above the approach to such appointments are detailed within the future policy table
below. The Company will pay such levels of remuneration to new Directors that would enable the Company to attract appropriately skilled and experienced
individuals that is not in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee excessive.
Service contracts
All Executive Directors have full-time contracts of employment with the Company. Non-Executive Directors have contracts of service. No Director has a contract of
employment or contract of service with the Company, its joint venture or associated companies with a fixed term which exceeds three years. Directors’ notice
periods (see page 24 of the financial statements) are set in line with market practice and of a length considered sufficient to ensure an effective handover of duties
should a Director leave the Company.
All Directors’ contracts as amended from time to time, have run from the date of appointment. Service contracts are kept at the registered office.
Policy on payment for loss of office
There are no contractual provisions agreed that could impact on a termination payment. Termination payments will be calculated in accordance with the existing
contract of employment or service contract. It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to issue employment contracts to Executive Directors with normal
commercial terms and without extended terms of notice which could give rise to extraordinary termination payments.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
In setting this policy for Directors’ remuneration the Remuneration Committee has been mindful of the Company’s objective to reward all employees fairly
according to their role, performance and market forces. In setting the policy for Directors’ remuneration the Remuneration Committee has considered the pay and
employment conditions of the other employees within the Group. No formal consultation has been undertaken with employees in drawing up the policy. The
Remuneration Committee has not used formal comparison measures.
Consideration of shareholder views
Shareholder views have been taken into account when formulating this policy, and was approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2015, and will be reconfirmed
this year at the Annual General Meeting.

The total amount remaining unpaid with respect to Directors’ remuneration amounted to US$127,000 (2016: US$79,444). The total directors’ remuneration for 2017
and 2016 includes only salaries and fees.
The change in the year was due to, Neil Herbert being appointed as an Executive Director in February 2017, a position he subsequently stood down from in
November 2017. As it was an Executive position it was at a higher remuneration level, the share options previously issued under the term of his role as Executive
Director in February 2017 were forfeited.
The remuneration levels will be in the range of US$400,000 in the forthcoming year.

Annual Report 2017
REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Altyn Plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which
comprise the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of
financial position, the parent company statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the parent company statement of changes
in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the parent company statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of
significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group and parent company financial statements is applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
p the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss
for the year then ended;
p the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
p the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
p the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the Group financial statements,
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are
further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the parent
company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as
applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the parent company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the parent company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the parent company and the parent company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
p the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
p the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the parent
company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on:
the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context
of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
to the members of Altyn Plc
Governance Strategic report Financial statements Matter Carrying value of intangible assets
As detailed in note 13, the Group’s intangible assets represent historical geological data of $8.6m and exploration &
evaluation costs of $3.3m pertaining to the Karasuyskoye ore fields, adjacent to the Group’s current mining licence area
production facilities at Sekisovskoye, which are significant assets and total $11.9m at 31 December 2017.
For the year ended 31 December 2017 management was required to assess whether there was any indication that this asset
may be impaired in accordance with accounting standards. Management have carried out an assessment of impairment
indicators during the year and concluded that no adjustment is required for impairment.
There are a large number of estimates and judgements used by the management in assessing the indicators of impairment
including non-financial and financial data. Therefore given the subjectivity involved in determining whether an impairment
provision is required and quantifying this, the carrying value of the intangible assets is considered to be a key audit matter.
Our Response We reviewed management’s assessment of the impairment indicators in accordance with accounting standards.
We read the correspondence, contracts and other documents regarding the license to confirm that the Group has a
contractual right for exploration in the Karasuyskoye area.
We obtained the exploration results to date and discussed with management who confirmed that the area remains
prospective;
We reviewed management’s plans and budgets which show that the Group is committed to the progressing the project;
and
We assessed the Group’s amortisation policy and useful life assessment against the length of legal title to the project area.
Matter Carrying value of property, plant and equipment
As detailed in note 14, the Group’s property, plant and equipment represent its most significant assets and total $35.2m at
31 December 2017.
For the year ended 31 December 2017 management was required to assess whether there was any indication that an asset
may be impaired in accordance with accounting standards. Management have carried out an assessment of impairment
indicators during the year and concluded that no adjustment is required for impairment.
Management’s assessment of the impairment indicators contain a number of key assumptions that require significant
estimation and judgements, including gold prices, gold reserves and production level, gold grade, exchange rates, cost
assumptions and discount rates. Given the subjectivity involved, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment is
considered to represent a key audit matter.
Our Response We reviewed in detail the key assumptions and judgements exercised in management’s assessment of the indicators of
impairment, challenged the management’s judgements by reference to the results from the operations and those that
would be expected given the stage of development.
We compared the actual performance with the economic model provided previously and investigated any material
deviations and considered whether these represent an indicator of impairment. The main deviations were noted in gold
grade and levels of production.
We visited the Sekisovskoye mine, observed and discussed the operations, operational results and mining processes with the
mine management and the chief geologist. During the visit to the Sekisovskoye mine we discussed the mine plan with the
chief geologist and confirmed the main reason of underperformance in 2017 was lack of funds available for investments in
mining equipment, which affected the volume and grade mined.
We assessed the reasonableness of factors explained above and confirmed that in the ore bodies where there was a
sufficient targeting and drilling equipment in place, the operational results met the expectations and supported the model
in place. Additionally, we considered if the operational results in the period would invalidate the latest independent technical
report issued by Venmyn Deloitte and noted that, despite the operational difficulties mentioned above, the assumption
regarding mineable reserves continued to be valid.
Our work did not indicate that management’s assessment that there are no indicators of impairment in respect of the
carrying value of property, plant and equipment was unreasonable.

Annual Report 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT continued
to the members of Altyn Plc Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. We consider materiality to be the
magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial
statements. Importantly, misstatements below this level will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified
misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
Performance materiality is the application of materiality at the individual account or balance level set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Performance materiality
was set at $480,000 for the Group and at $360,000 for the parent company (2016: $500,000 for the Group and $360,000 for the parent company) which represents
60% (2016 60%) of the above materiality levels.
Whilst materiality for the financial statements as a whole was $800,000, each significant component of the Group was audited to a lower level of materiality
ranging from $400,000 to $600,000.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $40,000 (2016: $40,000), as well as differences below
that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
There were no misstatements identified during the course of our audit that individually, or in aggregate, were considered to be material in terms of their absolute
monetary value or on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group, its environment and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Our group audit scope focused on the Group’s principal operating locations being the Sekisovskoye and Karasuyskoye exploration project held in DTOO
Gornorudnoe Predpriatie Baurgold and revenue recognised in TOO GMK Altyn MM, which were subject to a full scope audit with the audit work performed by
overseas component auditors under our direction and supervision. Together with the parent company and its group consolidation, which was also subject to a full
scope audit, these represent the significant components of the Group.
These locations represent the principal business units and account for 100% of the Group’s revenue (2016:100%) and 100% of the Group’s total assets (2016:100%).
The remaining component of the Group, Hambledon Mining Company Limited, was considered non-significant and we completed analytical procedures for this
intermediate holding company on an entity only basis to confirm there are no significant risks of material misstatements within this entity.
The audits of each of the components were principally performed in Kazakhstan and the United Kingdom. All of the audits were conducted by BDO LLP and BDO
member firms.
As part of our audit strategy, the audit partner and a senior member of the audit team visited each of the principal operating locations in the year.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of
this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Basis for determining
materiality

75% of group materiality (2016: 1.5% of total assets, capped

Rationale for the benchmark
applied
We have determined an assets based measure is appropriate as the Group is currently developing an underground mining
project that requires significant capital expenditure. It is consistent with our approach adopted in previous years.

Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic report Financial statements Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
p the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the
financial statements; and
p the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not
identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
p adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited
by us; or
p the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
p certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
p we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the
Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at:
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters which we are required to address
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the Board of directors on 26 March 2013 to audit the financial statements for the
year ending 31 December 2012 and subsequent financial periods. This is the 6th year of our engagement as auditor.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Company and we remain independent of the Company and the Group
in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.

Annual Report 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
year ended 31 December 2017
1 General information
Altyn Plc (the “Company”) is a Company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The address of its registered office, and place of
business of the Company and its subsidiaries is set out within the Company information on page 65 of this annual report. The principal activities of the Company
and subsidiaries are set out on page 16 and, the strategic review within this annual report.
2 Basis of preparation
The annual report is for the year ended 31 December 2017 and includes the consolidated and parent company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies set
out in note 4 which are consistent with all applicable IFRSs and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs. For
these purposes, IFRSs comprises the standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and interpretations issued by the International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee that have been endorsed by the European Union. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention, except for the adjustment in relation to the fair value of the derivative element included in the US$10m bond raised with African Resources, and on a
going concern basis.
Going concern
To progress the mine to the full projected capacity the Company requires further funding, which the Company has made good progress in putting in place. It is
currently in the advanced stages of finalising funding for new equipment from two parties. It is seeking bond finance from one party and direct equipment
purchasing from another party, in order to secure the necessary investment.
The Company is continuing to develop its underground mine, production is continuing at a steady pace with gold sold in the current year of 16,747 oz. From the
operating cash flows generated the Company paid the balance of the EBRD loan, which with interest amounted to US$3.5m. In order to preserve cash flow,
savings have been made in overhead costs at both head office and subsidiary level. In January 2018, African Resources Limited converted US$9.7m of the US$10m
convertible loan debt into new ordinary shares. No interest was paid in relation to this loan in the year and it is expected that the balance of the bond to include
accrued interest will be converted into new ordinary shares in Q3 2018.
The Directors have reviewed the cash flows for 15 months from the date of approval of the financial statements based on the projected trading. The Directors are
confident that should the fund raising not be successful to provide the funds in the expected timeframe the Company will be able to adapt its operational plans
such that it continues to operate.
Furthermore the major shareholder has confirmed their intention to provide further funding to enable the Company to continue its planned operations for at least
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
On this basis the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
3 Accounting standards issued but not adopted
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial
statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU):
lFRS 9 Financial Instruments
lFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts
IFRS 16 Leases
The only standard that is anticipated to be significant or relevant to the Group is IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” . The new standard will replace existing accounting
standards. It is applicable to financial assets and liabilities and will introduce changes to existing accounting concerning classification, measurement and
impairment (introducing an expected loss method).
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ is not expected to have a material impact on the Group at this stage of the Group’s operations. The revenue
contracts held by the Group usually contain a single performance criteria that is satisfied at a point in time. The Group will adopt the above standards at the time
stipulated by that standard. The Group does not at this time anticipate voluntary early adoption of any of the standards.
IFRS 16 will require the recognition of an asset and liability with respect to the material operating lease commitments that the group have. Management are
currently considering the impact that this will have on the financial statements. 39 Altyn plc

Basis of consolidation
Where a company has control over an investee, the investee is classified as a subsidiary. A company controls an investee if all three of the following elements are
present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns.
Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany
transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the statement of financial position, the
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations
are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on
which control ceases.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts received for goods provided in the normal course of
business, net of VAT and any other sales related taxes.
The Company’s revenue is generated entirely from the sale of the gold and silver (“Precious Metal”) content of gold doré. Gold doré was delivered to a precious
metal refiner, based in Kazakhstan during 2017 and 2016, which also purchased all precious metal that was refined. Title of the Precious Metal passes upon
acceptance of the delivery from the Company to the refiner. Sales of Precious Metal are only recognised when the delivery has been accepted and title for the
Precious Metal has accordingly been passed to the refiner.
The Company does not hedge or otherwise enter into any derivatives in respect of its sales of gold doré. Sales are recorded at the actual selling price of the gold
doré which is based on current market prices.
Foreign currencies
The Company has prepared its financial statements in United States Dollars (US$). The functional currency of the companies in Kazakhstan is the Kazakhstan Tenge
(KZT). The functional currency of the Company and Hambledon Mining Company Limited is the United States Dollars (US$).
The rates used to convert Pound Sterling and Kazakhstan Tenge into United States Dollar in these financial statements are as follows:

The year end and average rates used for the Kazakh Tenge have been obtained from the National Bank of Kazakhstan.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each respective entity are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the relevant functional currency at the closing rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange
differences arising from the restatement of monetary assets and liabilities at the closing rate of exchange at the reporting date or from the settlement of monetary
transactions at a rate different from that at which the asset or liability was recorded are dealt with through the statement of profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into US dollars, the presentation currency, at rates approximating to those ruling when the
transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on
translating the opening net assets at the opening rate and the results of overseas operations at the actual rate are recognised directly in the consolidated
statement of other comprehensive income.
The intercompany loans form a part of the Company’s investment in a foreign operation. The exchange difference arising on the intercompany loans is recognised
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity until disposal of the foreign operation.
Intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected economic life. In the
Directors’ opinion this was initially estimated to be over the expected useful life of the data being 20 years, this has been revised down to 10 years from 10 May
2016 being the minimum period over which the exploration licenses have been awarded. 40 Altyn plc

Exploration and evaluation costs
All costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal right to undertake exploration and evaluation activities on a project are written off as incurred. All costs associated
with mineral exploration and investments are capitalised on a project by project basis, pending determination of the feasibility of the project. Costs incurred
include appropriate technical and administrative expenses. If an exploration project is successful and the project is determined to be commercially viable, the
related costs will be transferred to mining assets and amortised over the estimated life of the mineral reserves on a unit of production basis. Where a project is
relinquished, abandoned, or is considered to be of no further commercial value to the Group, the related costs are written off. Impairment reviews performed
under IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources’ are carried out on a project by project basis, with each project representing a potential single cash
generating unit. An impairment review is undertaken when indicators of impairment arise; typically when one of the following circumstances applies:
p sufficient data exists that render the resource uneconomic and unlikely to be developed
p title to the asset is compromised
p budgeted or planned expenditure is not expected in the foreseeable future
p insufficient discovery of commercially viable resources leading to the discontinuation of activities.
Property, plant and equipment: mining properties and leases
Mining properties comprise previously capitalised exploration, evaluation and development expenditure incurred during the exploration and development stages
of the Company’s mining projects.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. As well as the purchase price, cost include directly attributable costs and estimated
present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling and removing items. The corresponding liability is recognised within provisions.
Assets under construction represent assets under development that are not at the stage that can be used commercially to generate revenues, no depreciation is
applied to these assets.
Depreciation
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate. Assets are fully depreciated over their
economic lives, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter.
Buildings 8-10 per cent. per annum
Equipment, fixtures and Fittings 10-40 per cent. per annum
Plant machinery and vehicles 7-30 per cent. per annum
Mining properties and leases Unit of production based on the proven reserves 
Assets under construction are not depreciated.
Impairment of non-current assets
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are assessed for impairment at each reporting date when events or a change in circumstances suggest that
the carrying amount of an asset may exceed the recoverable amount.
Where there has been an indication of a possible impairment, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by comparing it with the
estimated discounted future net cash flows generated by the asset based on management’s expectation of future production and selling prices. Any identified
impairment is charged to the statement of profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount but such that the
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior
years.
A reversal of impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion
and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows:
Spare parts and consumables – Purchase costs on a first in, first out basis
Ore stockpiles, work in progress and finished gold – Dependent on the current stage in the production cycle, the cost will reflect cost of direct materials,
power, labour and a proportion of overhead, to bring the product to its current state 41 Altyn plc

Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of profit or loss because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for by using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the
initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither
the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in joint ventures except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits
will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability
is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged to other comprehensive
income or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt within equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Indirect tax balances are not discounted.
Financial instruments
Financial assets
The Company classifies its financial assets only as loans and receivables. These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of
contractual monetary assets (other receivables). They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or
issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised costs using effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at reach reporting date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of
one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been impacted.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three
months and which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value; for the purposes of statement of
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts.
Investments and loans to subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries are included at cost less amounts written off. Loans to subsidiaries are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised costs.
Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories discussed blow, depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss comprise only the conversion option related to $10m loan note classified as derivative financial liability. They
are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement. Other than
these derivative financial instruments, the Group does not have any liabilities held for trading nor has it designated any other financial liabilities as being at fair
value through profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities comprise borrowings, trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities. These are initially measured at fair value and subsequently
recognised at amortised cost using effective interest rate method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled, or they expire. 42 Altyn plc

Fair value measurement hierarchy
The Group classifies its financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in
making the fair value measurement (note x). The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
p quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
p inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from
prices) (level 2);
p inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3);
p the level in the fair value hierarchy within the financial asset or financial liability is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement.
Compound instruments
The component parts of compound instruments (convertible notes and loans with detachable warrants) issued by the Company are classified separately as
financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
A conversion option that will be settled by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash for a fixed number of the Company’s own equity instruments is an equity
instrument.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non convertible instruments. This
amount is subsequently recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished upon conversion or at the
instrument’s maturity date.
The conversion option or detachable warrant classified as equity is determined by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the
compound instrument as a whole. This is recognised and included in equity, net of income tax effects, and is not subsequently re-measured. No gain or loss is
recognised in profit or loss upon conversion or expiration of the conversion option.
Transaction costs that relate to the issue of the compound instruments are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the fair value of the
debt and equity components. Transaction costs relating to the equity component are recognised directly in equity. Transaction costs relating to the liability
component are included in the carrying amount of the liability component and are amortised over the lives of the compound instruments using the effective
interest method.
Share capital
Financial instruments used by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability or financial asset.
The Company’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments and are recorded at proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
US$10m Convertible bond
As further discussed in the note 20 the Group entered into a $10m loan arrangement with African Resources PLC. The loan can be converted into ordinary shares
of the Company at a price of 3p per share any time prior to maturity. The conversion feature has been classified as derivative given there is an obligation to issue a
variable number of shares as the amount of liability to be settled depends on the foreign exchange rate at the date of settlement. The Company engaged Global
View Limited as a third party expert to update the value of the embedded derivative liability.
Their fair value of derivative liability on the grant date and the reporting date was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation. For each iteration of the simulation,
the simulated share price was analysed to determine the value. The fair value was based on the following assumptions:
p share price at the 31 December 2017 £0.0124 (2016 : £0.0185);
p GBP/USD exchange rate at 31 December 2017 – £0.7407 (2016: £0.8109);
p volatility of share price at 31 December 2017 – 55.3% (2016: 63.8%);
p volatility of the forex rate at 31 December 2017 – 7.0% (2016: 13.5%); and
p time period at 31 December 2017 3.2 years (2016: 4.2 years). 43 Altyn plc

Level 3 fair value measurements
The derivative liability has been deemed to be Level 3 liability under the fair value hierarchy as fair value measures of these liabilities are not based on observable
market data.

The amount of derivative as at 31 December 2017 has been included in the value of Convertible bond in Note 22.
Provision for commitments and contingencies
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation at the reporting date, which occurred as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the
Company will be required to settle that obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Possible obligations that are less than probable, and commitments to make purchases and incur expenditure in future periods, are not recognised as provisions
but are disclosed as commitments and contingencies.
Provision for site rehabilitation and decommissioning costs and the associated asset is recorded at the present value of the expected expenditure required to settle
the Company’s future obligations. Actual outcomes may vary. Details regarding the provision for site rehabilitation and decommissioning costs are set out in note
21 to the financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the Directors have made judgments and estimates that may have a significant effect on the amount
recognised in the financial statements. These include:
p carrying value of property, plant and equipment, including estimates made in respect of reserves and resources, discount rate and future gold prices (note 14);
p recoverability of inventories (note 16);
p carrying value of provisions (note 21);
p recognition of deferred taxation assets (note 23);
p carrying value of intangible assets (note 13);
p recognition of derivatives (note 22); and
p carrying value of indirect taxes – the Directors consider that it is appropriate to carry these balances without the need for provision based on the legal right
and the mechanism for recovery. The balances are not discounted in accordance with the accounting policy. 44 Altyn plc

The taxation rate used for taxation on loss on ordinary activities is the standard rate for United Kingdom corporation tax, currently 19.25% (2016: 20%), being the
average applicable rate for the Company in 2017. The rate applicable to the Company’s subsidiaries in Kazakhstan is 20%.
12 Loss per ordinary share
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is based upon the retained loss from continuing operations for the financial
year of US$1.9m (2016: loss of US$6.4m).
The weighted average number of ordinary shares for calculating the basic loss in 2017 and 2016 is shown below. As the Company was loss making in 2017, the
impact of the potential ordinary shares outstanding from the conversion of the Convertible loan notes would be anti-dilutive, and as such the basic and diluted
earnings per share are the same. The total number of all non-dilutive potential shares related to the issue of the convertible loans is disclosed in Note 22.

The intangible assets relate to the historic geological information pertaining to the Karasuyskoye ore fields. The ore fields are located in close proximity to the
current open pit and underground mining operations of Sekisovskoye. The Company obtained a contract for exploration and evaluation on the site in May 2016
from the Kazakh authorities. The contract is valid for a period of 6 years, which is a right to extend for a minimum period of 4 years. 47 Altyn plc

The directors took the view that initially a 20 year write off was appropriate in relation to the absorption of the costs given the current development of the site,
this has been revised to write off the geological data over the period the licence expires being with the minimum extension to May 2026 a period of 10 years.
The costs amortised are capitalised in line with the Company’s accounting policy. The effect is to increase the amortisation charge from US$522,000 to
US$1,021,000, there is no effect on the income statement as the amortisation costs are capitalised as part of exploration and evaluation costs. Based on results of
further work performed during the year, the Directors do not consider there to be any indicators of impairment and consider the project to remain prospective.

Capitalised cost of mining property and leases are amortised over the life of the licence from commencement of production on a unit of production basis. This
basis uses the ratio of production in the period compared to the mineral reserves at the end of the period. Mineral reserves estimates are based on a number of
underlying assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Mineral reserves estimates take into consideration estimates by independent geological consultants.
However, the amount of mineral that will ultimately be recovered cannot be known until the end of the life of the mine.
Any changes in reserve estimates are, for amortisation purposes, treated on a prospective basis. The recovery of the capitalised cost of the Company’s property,
plant and equipment is dependent on the development of the underground mine.
The Directors are required to consider whether the non-current assets comprising, mineral properties leases, plant and equipment have suffered any impairment.
In determining if there any indicators of impairment, the Directors have considered the operational performance in the period and do not consider that there is an
indicator of impairment. Should an indicator of impairment have been identified, the recoverable amount would have been determined based on value in use
calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the
cash flows. The directors have concluded that no adjustment is required for impairment.

Investments and loans to subsidiaries – Company continued
The investments together with the loans which are denominated in US Dollars represent the investments into the subsidiaries and in the opinion of the directors
the aggregate value of the investments in the subsidiaries is not less than the amount shown in these financial statements. The directors review the intercompany
borrowings on a regular basis, together with the associated cash flows of each company, and consider that no impairment is required.
The historic loans are shown within fixed assets as quasi-equity investments and represent the initial funding to the subsidiaries. The recent loans to subsidiaries are
charged at a fixed interest rate of 5% and are repayable in 2019 or on a three year rolling evergreen facility, repayment to be made three years from the date of any
formal request for repayment from Altyn Plc, these are included within fixed assets. The Directors have reassessed the fair value market rate applicable to the loans
advanced to the subsidiaries, which has resulted in an adjustment to the interest receivable in the prior periods.

The Directors have re-considered the terms of the inter company loans in the context of the requirements of IAS 39 and do not consider that this is representative
of the rate of interest that would be applied to such loans from a third party. As such they have discounted the contractual cash flows at a market rate of interest
and restated the prior year reported figures. The impact of this has been to:

Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases of goods and services. The majority of the trade creditors relate to the
Company’s trading subsidiaries in Kazakhstan. It is not practical to calculate the average credit period taken in respect of trade purchases for these creditors due to
current business practices in the former Soviet Union. For most suppliers, interest is not charged on these trade payables. The Company regularly reviews all
outstanding payables to ensure they are paid within the appropriate timeframe.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

The subsoil use contract (the “Contract”), under which TOO Sekisovskoye holds the exploration and mining rights to the Sekisovskoye deposit stipulates that it
must pay a total of US$3,312,000 to the Kazakhstan Government for historic costs. From 1 January 2009, the balance of the historical costs is being paid on a
quarterly basis and the final payment is due to be paid on 21 December 2018.
The future historic costs have been discounted to their net present value. This discounted value has been capitalised as Property, plant and equipment (note 14)
and will be amortised over the productive period. Any changes in estimated costs and discount rate are dealt with prospectively and result in a corresponding
adjustment to property plant and equipment.

Abandonment and restoration costs
In accordance with the provisions of the subsoil use contract (the “Contract”), DTOO GRP Baurgold is liable for site restoration costs upon completion of production
activities. It is not possible to predict accurately the amount which might ultimately be payable for site restoration as it includes assumptions such as inflation in
Kazakhstan over the life of the Contract which are inherently uncertain. An estimate of the future cost of restoration has been discounted and a provision
recognised. The discounted amount for cost of restoration has been capitalised as a tangible fixed asset (note 14) and will be amortised using the unit of
production method over the life of the mine.
In accordance with the subsoil use agreement, DTOO GRP Baurgold has established a cash fund to pay for the cost of restoration. The cash fund is maintained in a
separate bank account in the name of DTOO GRP Baurgold. DTOO GRP Baurgold is required to contribute each year an amount equal to 1% of its operating
expenses to this fund. Any transfers from the bank account require the authorisation of the Government of Kazakhstan. This fund will be used to pay for the costs
of restoration as and when they become due. If the funds in the account are insufficient to pay for the costs, DTOO GRP Baurgold will be required to pay any
deficit. If there are funds surplus to those required for restoration these will be returned to DTOO GRP Baurgold. During 2017 it was agreed with the Kazakh
authorities that the amount of US125, 000 that had been accrued in the restricted deposit account would be used to settle outstanding tax liabilities, no
contributions were made in the year. It is the intention of the Company to repay this amount in to the restricted cash fund.The Company is corresponding with
the relevant authorities in Kazakhstan in relation to the timing and exact amount of funds to be transferred. 52 Altyn plc

EBRD Bank loan
In 2012, two of the Company’s subsidiaries, TOO GMK Altyn MM (“GAM”) and DTOO GRP Baurgold entered into a loan agreement with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The principal terms of the loan was as follows:
p The loan of US$10m was, on a joint and several basis, and repayable in twelve quarterly instalments commencing on 10 January 2015. The final installment of
the loan was repaid on the 10 October 2017, in total an amount including interest of US$3.5m was repaid in the year;
p Interest was charged at a rate of three months London Inter Bank Rate (LIBOR) plus 7% per annum. The effective interest rate on the loan in the period was
7.5% (2016: 7.5%).
Convertible bonds
US$10m convertible bond
In 2016 the Company secured a total of US$10m proceeds from a convertible loan with the major shareholder, African Resources Limited. The loan bears a coupon
of 10% per annum, payable semi-annually and was due for repayment in 2021. In January 2018 the bond holders elected to convert US$9.7m of the bond into
ordinary shares of the Company at the conversion price of 3p per share , resulting in the issue of 233,333,333 new ordinary shares being issued to African
Resources Limited, (see note 28).
As further discussed in the note 4 the total value of the conversion option was determined at fair value as at 31 December 2016 to be US$1.9m, as at 31 December
2017 the fair value of the conversion option has fallen to US$0.5m, and the difference recognised in the profit and loss statement. The residual value was assigned
to the debt host liability and accounted for at amortised cost using the effecting interest rate of 17%, the total liability is US$10.7m and includes accrued interest,
(2016 US$9.6m).
The balance includes accrued interest payable of US$1,347,000 (2016: US$561,000), net of withholding taxes. It is the intention of African Resources Limited to
convert the balance of the principal and interest due into ordinary shares of the Company, once the necessary administrative procedures have been completed.
US$2m convertible bond
In 2016 the Company entered into US$2m convertible loan with institutional investors. The loan bears a coupon of 10% per annum, payable semi-annually and is
due for repayment in 2021. The Notes can be converted into Ordinary Shares of the Company at a price of 2.15p per share any time prior to maturity. The
exchange rate of US$1.466 for £1 shall be used to determine the number of conversion shares. The potential number of shares to be issued is 136,372,093.
The conversion option meets the fixed-for-fixed criteria and therefore has been classified as equity instrument in the other reserves. On initial recognition
Management have assessed the value of the contractual cash flows discounted at the interest rate of 15% being the market interest rate for the similar instruments
without a conversion feature. The value of liability component was determined to be US$1.8m (2016 US$1.7m), with the remaining balance of $0.3m allocated to
the residual equity component. The balance includes US$27,000 (2016: US$27,000) accrued interest payable.
Other Loans
Other loans comprise amounts that were received from Amrita Investments Limited see details in note 20, and an amount received from a third party amounting
to US$724,000, for short term financing requirements, no interest is payable on this amount. 53 Altyn plc

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset were they arise within the subsidiaries in Kazakhstan. The Group has recognised the deferred tax asset only to the extent
that it is probable that the taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. The future tax profits are expected to
derive from the gold mining operations in Kazakhstan.
The tax losses arising in the prior periods will reduce the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ future tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognised as the Directors
believe that sufficient taxable profits will be made against which the carried forward losses can be utilised.
Unutilised taxation losses arising in Kazakhstan of US$56.8m (2016: US$60.2m) are available to carry forward for a maximum of 10 years. It is estimated that the tax
losses available to carry forward will be utilised by 2025. Unutilised tax losses arising in the UK amount to US$3m (2016: US$3m).

Included within the unrecognised taxable losses above is an amount of US$0.6m (2016: US$0.7m) in relation to the Company, and US$4.7m (2016: US$6.9m) in
relation to the Kazakh subsidiaries. This amount has been carried forward as the Directors do not believe there will be sufficient taxable profits in the foreseeable
future to offset the losses incurred.

26 Financial instruments
Policy on financial risk management
The Company’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade and other payables, provisions, other financial liabilities
and borrowings. The Company’s accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis on which income and expenses are
recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are set out in note 4 – “accounting policies” . The Company does not
use financial instruments for speculative purposes. The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.
Capital risk management
The Company’s primary objective when managing risk is to ensure there is sufficient capital available to support the Company’s funding requirements, including
capital expenditure, in a way that optimises the cost of capital. Maximises shareholders’ returns and ensures the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
There were no changes to the Company’s capital management approach in the year.
The Company may make adjustments to the capital structure as opportunities arise, as and when borrowings mature or as and when funding is required. This may
take the form of raising equity, debt finance, equipment supplier credit or a combination thereof.
The Company monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio, which is defined as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings
(including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is
calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position plus net debt. While the Company does not set absolute limits on the ratio, the
Company believes that a ratio of 30%-40% was acceptable in the final stages of the construction and the commissioning phase of the Sekisovskoye mine, and that
optimally this should reduce to and remain below 25% thereafter. The Company’s policy in respect of capital risk management is the same as that of the Group.

Derivatives, financial instruments and risk management
The Company does not use derivative instruments or other financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
interest rates and commodity prices.
Foreign currency risk management
The Company and its subsidiaries have transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by the Company’s two subsidiaries in
Kazakhstan, in currencies other than the Company’s functional currency. The functional currency of TOO GMK Altyn MM and DTOO Gornorudnoe Predpriatie
Baurgold is the Kazakh Tenge. The currency transactions giving rise to this foreign currency risk are primarily USD denominated revenues, USD denominated
borrowings and other financial liabilities and certain USD denominated trade payables. The Company and its subsidiaries do not enter into hedging positions in
respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ foreign currency denominated net monetary assets and monetary liabilities at 31 December, are as
follows:
2017 US$000 2016 US$000

Commodity price risk
The Company is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in the price of gold and silver which are quoted in US Dollars on the international markets. The Company
prepares annual budgets and periodic forecasts including sensitivity analyses in respect of various levels of prices of these metals.
The Company’s only significant sales during the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 were sales of gold doré containing gold and silver. The sales proceeds
for gold doré is fixed by reference to the gold and silver prices based on average gold and silver price in the month of sale. The Company does not plan in the
future to hedge its exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the price of gold or silver and therefore it held no financial instruments that are sensitive to commodity
price changes at either reporting date.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter-party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company. The Group has adopted a
policy of only dealing with creditworthy counter-parties. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counter-parties are monitored by the Board of Directors
to ensure that the aggregate value of transactions is spread amongst approved counter-parties.
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade debtors and other accounts receivables. Cash equivalents include amounts held on
deposit with financial institutions.
The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk on its cash equivalents and trade and other receivables as per the balance sheet. The maximum exposure to credit risk is
represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet which at the year end amounted to US$1.2m (2016: US$2.4m).
The credit risk on liquid funds held in current accounts and available on demand is limited because the Group’s counter-parties are mainly banks with high credit
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Trade receivables comprise amounts receivable from a refinery in respect of sales of gold doré. On the sale of the gold doré, payment is received on shipment.
It is often impractical in Kazakhstan to carry out a check of creditworthiness of suppliers before making the contracted prepayments. There were no significant
balances at 31 December 2017 and 2016 in respect of which suppliers had defaulted on their obligations.
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of loans recorded in the financial statements. There are majority of the loans are
on fixed repayment terms for the loans, however they are not considered overdue or impaired.
Liquidity risk
During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Company was financed by internally generated funds, and other borrowings. The Company manages its liquidity
risk. The Directors monitor cash flow and cash flow forecasts on a regular basis and ensure that the loan commitments and working capital commitments are
adequately funded. The Directors obtain assurances from the major shareholders as required that funds will be made available to fund any shortfall as required.
The following tables detail the Company’s and its subsidiaries remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on
the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Company and its subsidiaries can be required to pay. The table includes
both interest and principal cash flows.

Borrowings and interest rate risk
The Company and its subsidiaries entered into a long term borrowing agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) on
21 February 2012 in order to fund capital commitments. Interest was payable at 7% per annum above Libor.
The bank loan was repaid in October 2017.
There is no exposure to interest rate risk as the current borrowings in the Company and its subsidiaries are at fixed rates. The bonds at a fixed coupon rate of 10%,
and the other borrowings at an average interest rate of 7%, see note 22.
27 Commitments and contingencies
General conditions
In recent years, the Republic of Kazakhstan has undergone substantial political and economic change. As an emerging market, the Republic of Kazakhstan does
not possess a well-developed business infrastructure such as generally exists in a more mature free market economy. As a result, operations carried out in the
Republic of Kazakhstan can involve risks which are not typically associated with those in developed markets. Significant identified risks have been provided for, or
disclosed in these financial statements as appropriate.
(a) Contractual liabilities
Subsoil use rights are not provided to the Company on an indefinite basis, and each renewal shall be approved before the current contract or license expires.
These rights can be cancelled by the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan (hereinafter referred to as “the Government”) if the Company does not fulfil
contractual liabilities.
Deposit development costs
In accordance with the subsoil use contract, the Company has an approved working programme which may be reviewed and reconsidered depending on the
economic viability and operational conditions of the deposit. The management of the Company believes it has fulfilled the requirements of the Contract.
Training for Kazakhstani specialists
In accordance with the terms of the contract the Company is liable for the annual costs incurred in respect of the professional training of the Kazakhstani
personnel involved in the work. The costs are estimated to be at least 1% of the operational costs during the development and operational process.
As at 31 December 2017 the Company has met the conditions of the Contract.
Development of the social sphere of the region
According to the terms of the contract, the Company is liable for supporting the development and ensuring social support for the activity of the communities near
the area of operations of the Company. As at 31 December 2017, the Company has met all the conditions of the Contract. 58 Altyn plc

General conditions continued
Liabilities on the restoration of the mine
Within eighty calendar days upon the expiration of the contract the Company is liable for the development of the mine restoration programme and its inspection
by the competent authority of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Company is liable for implementation of the programme upon its approval.
(b) Insurance
In accordance with the subsoil use contract the Company is liable for the development of the insurance programme and its submission for approval by the
competent authority.
The Company has several contracts of obligatory insurance including insurance of the vehicle owners, the employer’s liability and insurance of the subsoil users’
liability where the activity of such subsoil users is connected to the damage to third parties.
(c) Court proceedings
The claims on the Company are periodically set out in the courts along with the Company’s activities. As at the reporting date, there are no material claims against
the Company.
As part of the settlement in relation to the tailings dam restoration programme, the Company has a memorandum signed with the local authorities, whereby the
Company is liable for arranging the construction of the paste plant for US$1,800,000 (600m Tenge). It has been agreed that the Company will use its best
endeavors to have this completed once all necessary permits are obtained.
Other than the paste plant as at the reporting date the Company has fulfilled all of its obligations in relation to the outstanding works which required in relation to
the tailings dam restoration program.
(d) Taxation risks
The tax system of Kazakhstan, being relatively new, is characterised by frequent changes to the legal norms, official interpretations and court decisions, which are
often not explicit and can be contradictory. This leads to differing interpretations by the tax authorities. The examination and investigations of the accounts to
ensure that the tax payable is accurate are carried out by several regulatory bodies. These bodies have the power to impose heavy fines and penalties. The
accuracy of the tax computation can be investigated five calendar years after the end of the accounting period. In certain circumstances this period can be
increased.
These circumstances may lead to the taxation risks being much higher in Kazakhstan compared to other countries. The management of the Company, based on
their understanding of the tax legislation, regulatory requirements and court decisions, considers the tax liabilities to be fully reflected in the accounts.
Nevertheless, the interpretation of these provisions by the corresponding authorities can be different and in that case should the authorities prove the lawfulness
of their position, it may significantly affect these financial accounts.
28 Subsequent events
On the 17 January 2018 African Resources Limited acquired 117,730,632 shares at a consideration price of 3p per share. It subsequently acquired on the 23 January
2018 an additional 233,333,333 shares when US$9.7m of the existing convertible bond of US$10m was converted in ordinary shares at a conversion price of 3p per
share. This increased the shareholding of African Resources Limited from 61.69% to 69.8% of the total shares in issue.
The subsidiary DTOO GRP Baurgold has entered into an agreement with JSC Freedom Finance, a subsidiary of Freedom Holding Corp. to assist in raising c. US$15m,
through the issue of five-year non-convertible Tenge denominated bonds secured by the assets of the subsidiary Company.

entitlements, record dates, legal or practical problems in or under the laws of any territory or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange;
and
b. the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to paragraph 9a. above) of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of £256,767.
The power granted by this resolution will expire on the date which is 18 months after the date on which this resolution is passed or, if earlier, the conclusion of the
Company’s next annual general meeting (unless renewed, varied or revoked by the Company prior to or on such date) save that the Company may, before such
expiry make offers or agreements which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the directors may allot equity securities in
pursuance of any such offer or agreement notwithstanding that the power conferred by this resolution has expired.
This resolution revokes and replaces all unexercised powers previously granted to the directors to allot equity securities as if section 561(1) of the Act did not apply
but without prejudice to any allotment of equity securities already made or agreed to be made pursuant to such authorities.

NOTES TO THE NOTICE OF 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Relevant Securities means:
p Shares in the Company other than shares allotted pursuant to:
– an employee share scheme (as defined by section 1166 of the Act);
– a right to subscribe for shares in the Company where the grant of the right itself constituted a Relevant Security; or
– a right to convert securities into shares in the Company where the grant of the right itself constituted a Relevant Security.
p Any right to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the Company other than rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares allotted
pursuant to an employee share scheme (as defined by section 1166 of the Act). References to the allotment of Relevant Securities in the resolution include the
grant of such rights.
Entitlement to attend and vote
1. Only those shareholders registered in the Company’s register of members at:
p 6.00 pm on Wednesday 27 June 2018; or,
p if this meeting is adjourned, at 6.00 pm on the day two days prior to the adjourned meeting, 
shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting. Changes to the register of members after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the
rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
Appointment of proxies
2. If you are a shareholder who is entitled to attend and vote at the meeting, you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend,
speak and vote at the meeting and you should have received a proxy form with this notice of meeting. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set
out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form.
3. If you are not a member of the Company but you have been nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy information rights, you do not have a right to
appoint any proxies under the procedures set out in this “Appointment of proxies” section. Please read the section “Nominated persons” below.
4. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. You may appoint more than one proxy provided
each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share.
To appoint more than one proxy, each proxy must be appointed on a separate proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the meeting you
will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the chairman) and give your instructions directly to them.
5. Shareholders can:
p appoint a proxy and give proxy instructions by returning the enclosed proxy form by post (see note 7);
p register their proxy appointment electronically (see note 8);
p if a CREST member, register their proxy appointment by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service (see note 9).
Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting and
vote in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
6. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting
indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in
relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting.
Appointment of proxy by post
7. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy how to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.
To appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must be:
p completed and signed;
p sent or delivered to Neville Registrars (the “Registrar”), at 18 Laurel Lane, Halesowen, West Midlands B63 3DA; and
p received by the Registrar no later than 11.00am on 27 June 2018.
In the case of a shareholder which is a company, the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company
or an attorney for the company.
Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with
the proxy form.
If you have not received a proxy form and believe that you should have one, or if you require additional proxy forms, please contact the
Registrar on +44 (0) 121 585 1131.
Appointment of proxies electronically
8. As an alternative to completing the hard-copy proxy form, you can appoint a proxy electronically online at sharegateway.co.uk and completing the
authentication requirements as set out on the proxy form. For an electronic proxy appointment to be valid, your appointment must be received by the Registrar
no later than 11.00am on 27 June 2018.
Appointment of proxies through CREST
9. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting and any
adjournment(s) of it by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com). CREST Personal Members or other CREST 62 Altyn plc

NOTES TO THE NOTICE OF 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING continued
sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (EUI) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as
described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a
previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Registrar ID 7RA11 no later than 11.00am on 27 June 2018, or,
in the event of an adjournment of the meeting, 48 hours before the adjourned meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as
determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry
to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the
appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in
CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting
service provider(s), to procure that his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting
service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations
2001.
Appointment of proxy by joint members
10.In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders completes a proxy appointment, only the appointment submitted by the most senior
holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect
of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
Changing proxy instructions
11.Shareholders may change proxy instructions by submitting a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Note that the cut-off time for receipt of
proxy appointments (see above) also apply in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off time will
be disregarded.
Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another hard-copy proxy form, please
contact the Registrar on +44 (0) 121 585 1131.
If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.
Termination of proxy appointments
12.A shareholder may change a proxy instruction but to do so you will need to inform the Company in writing by:
p Sending a signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to Neville Registrars, at 18 Laurel Lane, Halesowen, West
Midlands B63 3DA. In the case of a shareholder which is a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf
by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a
duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with the revocation notice.
The revocation notice must be received by the Registrar no later than 11.00am on 27 June 2018.
If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time specified, your original proxy appointment will remain valid
unless you attend the meeting and vote in person.
Corporate representatives
13.A corporation which is a shareholder can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise, on its behalf, all its powers as a member provided
that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers over the same share.
Issued shares and total voting rights
14.As on 6pm at 27 April 2018, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 2,567,675,463 ordinary shares of 0.1p each. Each ordinary share carries the right to
one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company is 2,567,675,463.
The Company’s website, www.altyn.uk will include information on the number of shares and voting rights.
Notification of shareholdings
15.Any person holding 3% or more of the total voting rights of the Company who appoints a person other than the Chairman of the Annual General Meeting as
their proxy will need to ensure that both they, and their proxy, comply with their respective disclosure obligations under the Disclosure Rules and Transparency
Rules. 63 Altyn plc
Annual Report 2017
Governance Strategic report Financial statements
Questions at the meeting
16.Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must answer any question you ask relating to the business being dealt with
at the meeting unless:
p answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information;
p the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or
p it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
Nominated persons
17.If you are a person who has been nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights (Nominated Person):
p You may have a right under an agreement between you and the shareholder of the Company who has nominated you to have information rights (Relevant
Shareholder) to be appointed or to have someone else appointed as a proxy for the meeting.
p If you either do not have such a right or if you have such a right but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a right under an agreement between you and
the Relevant Shareholder to give instructions to the Relevant Shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
p Your main point of contact in terms of your investment in the Company remains the Relevant Shareholder (or, perhaps, your custodian or broker) and you
should continue to contact them (and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating to your personal details and your interest in the
Company (including any administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from you.
Documents on display
18.Copies of the service contracts of the executive directors and the non-executive directors’ contracts for services are available for inspection at the Company’s
registered office during normal business hours and at the place of the meeting from at least 15 minutes prior to the meeting until the end of the meeting.
Communication
19.Except as provided above, shareholders who have general queries about the meeting should use the following means of communication (no other methods of
communication will be accepted):
p Contact the Company by e-mail to info@altyn.uk.
You may not use any electronic address provided either:
p in this notice of annual general meeting; or
p any related documents (including the chairman’s letter and proxy form),
to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated. 64 Altyn plc
Annual Report 2017
EXPLANATION OF RESOLUTIONS
An explanation of each of the resolutions is set out below.
ORDINARY BUSINESS
Resolutions 1 to 8 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions and will be passed if more than 50% of shareholders’ votes cast are in favour.
Resolution 1: To receive the 2017 Report and Accounts
The directors of the Company (the ‘Directors’) must present their Annual Report and Accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 (the ‘Annual
Report’) to shareholders for formal adoption at the Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 2: Directors’ remuneration report
The Directors’ remuneration report is set out in the Annual Report. In accordance with the provisions of the Act the Directors’ remuneration report is the Annual
Report contains:
p a statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee;
p the Directors’ remuneration policy in relation to future payments to the Directors and former Directors’; and
p the Annual Report on remuneration, which sets out payments made in the financial year ending 31 December 2017.
The statement by the Remuneration Committee Chairman and the Annual Report on remuneration will be put to an annual advisory shareholder vote by ordinary
resolution.
Accordingly, Resolution 2 is the ordinary resolution to approve the Directors’ remuneration report and Directors remuneration policy. As it is an advisory vote it
does not affect the actual remuneration paid to any Director.
Resolutions 3 to 5: To re-elect the Directors
Under the Company’s articles of association, one third of the Directors or, if their number is not a multiple of three, then the number nearest to but not less than
one-third must retire from office and then stand for re-election.
Biographical details of directors to be re-elected are set out in the Annual Report and are also available for viewing on the Company’s website at
www.altynplc.com.
Resolutions 6 & 7: To reappoint the auditors and authorise the Audit Committee of the Board to determine their remuneration
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general meeting at which the annual accounts and report are to be laid before the Company, to hold office
until the conclusion of the next such meeting. The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external auditors, BDO
LLP , on behalf of the Board which now proposes their reappointment as auditors of the Company. Resolution 7 also authorises the Audit Committee of the Board,
in accordance with standard practice, to negotiate and agree the remuneration of the auditors.
SPECIAL BUSINESS
As well as the ordinary business of the meeting outlined above, a number of special matters will be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting. Resolution 6 will be
proposed as an ordinary resolution and will be passed if more than 50% of shareholders’ votes cast are in favour. Resolution 9 will be proposed as a special
resolution. For this resolution to be passed, at least 75% of shareholders’ votes cast must be in favour.
Resolution 8: Directors’ authority to allot shares
At the 2017 Annual General Meeting held on 28 June 2017 the Directors were given authority to allot shares in the Company, and Resolution 8 seeks to renew this
authority for a period until the date which is 18 months after the date on which this resolution is passed or, if earlier, the date of the next annual general meeting
of the Company.
This resolution would give the Directors authority to allot ordinary shares, and grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares in the Company, up
to an aggregate nominal value of £778,114.04. This amount represents approximately one-third (33.33%) of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company, as at
27 April 2018, the last practicable date prior to the publication of this document. The Company does not currently hold any shares in treasury. The extent of the
authority follows the guidelines issued by institutional investors.
The Directors consider that it is appropriate for this authority and these powers to be granted to preserve maximum flexibility for the future.
Resolution 9: Disapplication of pre-emption rights
Section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 gives all shareholders the right to participate on a pro-rata basis in all issues of equity securities for cash, unless they agree
that this right should be disapplied. The effect of this resolution is to empower the Directors, until the date which is 18 months after the date on which this
resolution is passed or, if earlier, the date of the next annual general meeting of the Company, to allot equity securities for cash, without first offering them on a
pro-rata basis to existing shareholders, but only up to a maximum nominal amount of £233,434.21 representing approximately 10% of the Company’s issued
ordinary share capital on 26 April 2018 (being the latest practicable date before the date of this document). In addition, the resolution empowers the Directors to
deal with fractional entitlements and any practical problems arising in any overseas territory on any offer made on a pro-rata basis. The Directors consider that it is
appropriate for this authority and these powers to be granted to preserve maximum flexibility for the future. 65 Altyn plc

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Grade The tenor or concentration by weight of a metal in a mineral deposit or ore.
masl Metres above sea level.
Tonne A metric tonne of 1,000 kilograms.
oz Troy ounce.
g/t Grammes per tonne of mineralised rock.
JORC code Australasian code for the reporting of exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves (Joint Ore Reserves
Committee). See www.jorc.org/main.php
Mineral resource A concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in such form, grade (or quality), and quantity that
there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade (or quality), continuity and
other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological
evidence and knowledge, including sampling.
Indicated resource That part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are
estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine
planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed
and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops,
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade (or quality) continuity between
points of observation where data and samples are gathered. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence
than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Ore Reserve.
Inferred resource That part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade (or quality) are estimated on the basis of limited geological
evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade (or quality) continuity.
It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that
applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the
majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.
Ore reserve The economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and
allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at Pre- Feasibility
or Feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time
of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. The reference point at which Reserves are defined, usually the point
where the ore is delivered to the processing plant, must be stated. It is important that, in all situations where the reference
point is different, such as for a saleable product, a clarifying statement is included to ensure that the reader is fully informed
as to what is being reported.
Probable reserve The economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence
in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Ore Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proved Ore Reserve.
Mineral inventory A term used to describe mineral resources and mineable reserves which are not static as additional resource delineation is
not yet complete, and engineering calculations are pending. As such what might be a mineral resource today may be a
mineable reserve tomorrow.  Altyn plc
