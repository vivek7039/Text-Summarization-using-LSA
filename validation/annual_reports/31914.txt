Chairman’s statement
Further detail on strategic progress is outlined 
throughout this Annual Report and is intended to be 
detailed to investors and analysts at investor briefings 
in October 2017.
Acquisition of Danlind a/s
On 4 September 2017, the Group announced the 
proposed acquisition of the entire share capital of 
Danlind a/s, a supplier of auto dishwash and laundry 
products, based in Denmark. Danlind provides 
McBride with access to accelerated growth in the key 
strategic category of auto dishwash tablets, through 
its well-invested capacity, technology platform and 
high quality product range. Danlind has a significant 
range of retail and contract customers along with a 
well-established position in the Nordic region and in 
the commercial laundry and dishwash markets. Danlind 
will enable McBride to gain entry into growth segments 
where it is currently under-represented. Additionally, 
Danlind’s strong position in Ecolabel products can 
be developed further through McBride’s extensive 
European reach. 
Danlind operates from three manufacturing sites in 
Denmark, and has approximately 250 employees. For the 
year ended 31 December 2016, Danlind reported revenues 
of £58.4 million, EBITDA of £1.6 million, a loss before 
tax of £1.3 million, and had gross assets of £48.0 million 
as at 31 December 2016. For its financial year ending 
31 December 2017, on a standalone basis, Danlind is 
currently expected to generate c.£2.5 million of EBITDA. 
McBride expects to realise significant commercial, 
technical and operational improvement synergies 
from the acquisition. The acquisition is expected to be 
immediately earnings enhancing for the Group. Post-tax 
return on invested capital is expected to meet cost of 
capital in the third full year of ownership.
Consideration of £10.8 million will be payable to 
the shareholder of Danlind, Lind Holdings ApS, and 
c.£28 million of net debt in Danlind will be assumed by 
McBride at completion. The acquisition will be funded 
from McBride’s existing banking facilities.
The acquisition, which is subject to customary 
regulatory and closing conditions, is expected to 
complete in early October 2017.
On completion, Danlind, the management team 
and its employees will form part of the Household 
products segment. 
Results
The past year has demonstrated further progress in 
the quality of the Group’s profits and a step closer to 
our medium-term profitability ambitions. Underlying 
revenues for the year were lower by 3.8% in constant 
currency terms, with a further 2.1% reduction a result of 
the deliberate action to simplify the customer portfolio. 
In spite of this revenue decline, adjusted profits before 
tax increased to £34.6 million (2016: £29.4m) with 
adjusted operating profit margins moving up to 5.9% 
(2016: 5.3%), a near doubling compared to the 3.0% in 
2014. Reported operating profit increased by 21% on 
prior year with reported profits before tax decreasing to 
£19.2 million (2016: £25.8m) primarily due to exceptional 
costs incurred as part of the Group refinancing. 
A business active in a change 
programme whilst delivering 
a progressively more 
sustainable financial position.
Dear Shareholder
Welcome to the 2017 Annual Report, which reviews the 
past twelve months – my first full year as your Chairman.
The business has delivered another strong year of 
progress towards our medium-term ambitions and 
progressed extensively in the first months of the 
‘Prepare’ phase of the ‘Repair, Prepare, Grow’ strategy. 
This report demonstrates a business active in a change 
programme whilst delivering a progressively more 
sustainable financial position.
Strategic progress
We outlined at the interim stage that the Group was 
closing out the ‘Repair’ phase of the transformation 
strategy. The Group has been busy with ‘Prepare’ 
actions in the meantime. These include key activities 
in the development of the sales growth plan, covering 
both organic development and possible acquisition 
opportunities in markets and categories. Support 
actions for this growth have been developed, including 
in particular the capital expenditure required to ensure 
our manufacturing platform is to the capacity and 
standard required. The commercial plan and outline 
capital programme were reviewed by the Board during 
an engaging and challenging two-day session with 
the executive and senior managers. The key ‘Prepare’ 
action relating to improving organisation and people 
development is now under way and will continue to 
adapt as we progress into the ‘Grow’ phase.  5 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report
The loss of contribution from the targeted customer 
and product rationalisation programme started in 
the 2016 financial year has facilitated significant cost 
reduction from the ensuing simplification. With raw 
material pressures in the second half and market 
conditions meaning wholesale price increases are 
not feasible; the business has delivered savings from 
product engineering and further reductions across all 
cost categories. At the back end of the financial year, 
the Group reset its financing arrangements with the 
outstanding US$ Private Placement lending replaced 
by a new five-year credit facility, providing the Group 
with significantly lower borrowing costs going forward 
and five-year funding certainty in support of the 
‘Grow’ phase. 
Payments to shareholders
In September 2015, the Board reset its policy concerning 
payments to shareholders. During the period of the 
‘Repair’ phase, the payment was held at 3.6 pence per 
share, now that we have exited this phase and in light 
of the improved financial performance of the Company, 
the Board will recommend to increase the payment to 
shareholders to 4.3 pence per share. This represents a 
19% increase and brings the payment in line with our 
policy of a dividend cover range of 2x-3x, taking into 
account funding availability.
Brexit
McBride is a European business. Exit from the EU has 
potential implications in a number of areas of McBride’s 
activities. These include chemical and other regulatory 
policies, tariffs, currency volatility and availability of 
staff. A number of colleagues at McBride have migrated 
to the UK from elsewhere in the EU for employment 
purposes and are valued members of the business. 
We urge Governments to quickly clarify the uncertainty 
over their right to remain in the UK and the timing of 
any changes to the current free market situation.
Governance
The Board remains focused on ensuring that the UK 
Corporate Governance Code’s principles of leadership 
and board effectiveness are applied. My introduction to 
the Corporate governance report on page 35 sets out 
how the Board has complied with the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (‘the Code’) which 
applied throughout the financial year ended 30 June 2017.
Board
There have been no changes to the Board during the year. 
I would like to express my thanks to my fellow Board 
members for their valuable contribution over the past year.
Our people
Our employees are certainly our most important asset, 
and the opportunities for long-term growth within the 
Group will ensure that they find McBride a place where 
they will continue to enjoy rewarding careers. The Board 
would like to welcome all new colleagues who have 
joined the Group, thank everyone who has contributed 
to what has been yet another successful year and look 
forward to their continued contribution in achieving our 
strategy going forward.
Current trading and outlook
The Group has made a satisfactory start to the new 
financial year. Markets continue to demonstrate varied 
dynamics with stable core demand. Raw material pricing 
pressures continue as the Group remains determined 
to drive its cost base still lower. The capital programme 
is in full flow and the benefits of these programmes 
will position the Group well in its chosen categories, 
channels and territories. My Board colleagues and 
I are confident on the delivery of the new strategy.
John Coleman
Chairman
7 September 2017 6 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
McBride is the leading European manufacturer and supplier of Contract 
Manufactured and Private Label products for the Household and 
Personal Care markets. We offer tailored services aligned with specific 
customer and channel requirements, strengthening these relationships 
and leveraging our scale through a complete focus on improving our 
operational excellence and driving our cost competitiveness.
Input costs
Chemicals and plastics are a major part of 
our product cost. Volatile pricing feeds into 
margins, with changes in customer pricing 
typically lagging.
Discounters
Discounters have seen a steady increase in sales 
across Europe, with their combined market share 
of the EU grocery market rising from 8.4% in 
1999 to 15.2% by 2014. Most products offered 
by discounters are usually private label, as they 
compete on price, quality and simplicity rather 
than offering a wider choice of brands.
Brand owners
Brand owners often use private label suppliers to 
co-manufacture their products, however, recently 
an increase in the demand for longer-term, more 
structural arrangements is emerging. For McBride, 
this is not different from direct supply to major 
retail customers, while assisting in maximisation 
of asset utilisation. 
Channels
Changing consumer habits and the battleground 
between discounters and retailers means that 
McBride must be present in many channels, 
including in emerging arenas of pound stores 
and online.
Regulatory environment
McBride embraces initiatives to improve safety 
for the consumer. More stringent regulations 
concerning the production, use and application 
of our type of products can drive a cost increase in 
the development, production, distribution and use 
of products. 
Concentration
The retail markets in many of the countries in 
which we operate are highly concentrated with a 
limited number of supermarket retailers, resulting 
in fierce competition. Retailers will increasingly rely 
on sophisticated large private label manufacturers 
to assist them with competitive advantage.
Consumers
Consumers are becoming more dynamic and 
mobile in their shopping habits. The desire for 
value and convenience are growing aspects 
of shopping behaviour. The response from the 
different channel players is diverse. With our staple 
products, overall demand patterns are steady  
and change only over extended time horizons.
Growth
Market research indicates that the European 
macroeconomic climate will not deliver substantial 
growth in our key territories in the foreseeable 
future. Market share of private label versus brands 
is relatively stable, although some markets are 
starting to see retailers favour private label.
Business model
External drivers 7 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report
Manufacturing excellence
‘Manufacturing excellence’ is an investment 
programme targeted at an optimised asset 
configuration supporting our market and growth 
ambitions. Continued investment in existing assets 
will further improve our operational cost and will 
be extended to additional investments, upgrading 
our five ‘Anchor’ sites, Middleton, eper, Estaimpuis, 
Foetz and Strzelce. Our strong asset base creates 
the opportunity to further develop manufacturing 
agreements with other industry players such as 
branders. This will give us a combined cost and 
efficiency leadership. 
Customers
Our scale and reach across all key European markets 
enables McBride to provide customer oriented service 
propositions aligned with channel requirements. 
We intend to have a tailored offering aligned with 
respective channel characteristics, combined with 
supporting customer service levels and agreements 
clear on content and commitment. Public company 
reputation and standards reassures customers of 
long-term, sustainable supplier relationships.
Size to scale
McBride, as the largest player in the European 
market, can leverage its size by delivering scale 
benefits in purchasing, innovation, manufacturing 
excellence, legal know-how and customer 
relationship management. 
People
We focus on the development of our people, 
organisational capabilities and skills. As a 
pan-European employer, McBride has access to 
a wide variety of talent so that whatever we do, 
whatever organisation we build, McBride can deliver 
upon its ambition and promises – with its people 
engaged, developed and positively challenged. 
Innovation
With visibility across all of Europe, our presence 
in selected products and markets, well-resourced 
technical teams and colleagues hungry to offer new 
ideas, McBride can be at the forefront of customer 
innovation. Whether this is in product ideas, supply 
chain improvements, packaging ideas or customer 
contract arrangements, McBride stands out as a 
leader in our industry.

growth ambition
Investment case
Leading market position
In 2015, after a number of years of disappointing 
returns, the Group entered a transformation phase 
with a new management team driving a fresh strategic 
direction. This will optimise McBride’s activities, 
maximising its market-leading position and size 
to deliver scale advantage for value creation and 
development of growth opportunities.
A number of developments in 
McBride’s markets means that 
our scale and geographic spread 
will be ever more a key part of 
market supply and growth. The 
consolidation of retailers in many 
parts of Europe, the emergence 
of discount retailers, increased 
outsourcing activity by brand 
owners and the drive by many 
established retailers to simplify 
their product ranges and supplier 
base all provide opportunities 
for McBride: and our scale will 
allow us to capitalise on these 
growth prospects. 9 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

McBride’s extensive network of 
manufacturing locations and 
assets offers unrivalled capacity 
and capability to both retailers 
for private label and branders for 
outsourced manufacturing. The 
market dynamics offer further 
opportunities that will require 
targeted investments into our 
key sites. These investments, 
aligned with our selective market 
and product offering, will allow 
for a substantial improvement 
in our cost competitiveness and 
operational excellence.
The Group has well-established 
market positions in all of 
Europe’s major economies 
and supplies its products 
to a very wide range of 
customers, including virtually 
all of Europe’s leading retailers. 
Extensive product ranges for 
both Household and Personal 
Care permit our customers 
to source most key products 
from a reliable, reputable 
and long-standing supplier. 
The Group has manufacturing 
and product development 
facilities across Europe. Aligning 
our commercial activity to 
the specific regional market’s 
requirements allows for customer 
focus whilst we continue to 
maximise synergies between 
our operating activities.
As a well-invested manufacturing 
business, McBride has the 
capacity for significant cash 
generation as profits continue to 
improve. In spite of the ambition 
to outspend depreciation in 
the next four to five years, the 
business will generate good cash 
flows to provide the opportunity 
to return funds to shareholders, 
look for additional investment 
options and further reduce 
our borrowings. 10 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Thoughts of  
the CEO
Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to report that we continue to make good 
and steady progress. 
The past year has allowed us to close the ‘Repair’ phase, 
and in February I launched the ‘Prepare’ phase, the 
second element of our strategy, focusing our actions 
to prepare McBride for growth.
As I reflect on the last twelve months, it becomes 
very evident to me how much we have progressed 
the ‘Manufacturing our Future’ strategy and the 
extent we have changed as a result of the ‘Repair’ 
phase execution. 
The first of our three-phased approach of ‘Repair’, 
‘Prepare’ and ‘Grow’ focused on transforming McBride 
to its core capability of manufacturing excellence. 
Following our customer simplification exercise, we have 
been able to re-establish top quality service levels to 
our customers, accelerate our innovation cycle and 
substantially improve on our quality performance. In 
addition, I have been pleased with the agility of our 
teams in adapting and adopting new ways of working 
in their day-to-day practices. All of this has led to an 
appreciation of the ‘New McBride’ with recognition 
in many ways – including numerous customer service 
awards and several recommendations as ‘Best Buy’ in 
consumer magazines across Europe, while also securing 
new business with a number of customers. 
The past year has allowed us 
to close the ‘Repair’ phase, 
focusing our actions to prepare 
McBride for growth
That said, the year has not been without its challenges. 
The consequences of the UK referendum have been 
diverse and have had to be closely monitored and 
managed. European markets have shown slightly 
negative growth, particularly in the Household category, 
resulting in an intensification of competitive price and 
volume behaviours. We have experienced rising raw 
material costs in several of our product streams across 
our markets, many of which have had to be absorbed 
by the business.
In addition, rising inflation, especially in the UK, 
has created a reduction in household disposable 
income resulting in more conservative spending on 
non-essential household items.
In line with the average market trends and as projected, 
we reported a 5.9% drop in sales at constant currency. 
In spite of these challenges, due to the continued 
diligence of our teams to control cost and execute 
efficiency improvements we have delivered on our 
projected profitability and continue to strengthen 
our balance sheet. This clearly demonstrates that our 
strategy is strengthening our ability to deal with the 
volatility of our markets.
In June, our announcement regarding the successful 
refinancing of the Company closed the final key action 
that we had set ourselves during our ‘Repair’ phase. 
This was a significant key milestone that completed 
all of the diligent transformation work that has been 
implemented in the past 18 months. 
Now, the ‘Prepare’ phase is a period of bridging 
from where McBride was and to where we aspire to 
be – moving the Company from ‘Repair’ to ‘Grow.’ 
It comprises four objectives that will enable us to build 
the foundations to sustain our ambitions: first, our 
fundamental commercial growth aspirations, second, 
the supporting asset base and related investment 
plans, third, the organisational structure and skills to 
deliver this overall ambition, and finally, the resolution 
of our underperforming business. All of the projects 
supporting these four objectives have been launched. 
In May, I reviewed progress on the key elements of 
the ‘Prepare’ phase with the wider management 
group within the business. They have an ongoing 
communication objective that is two-fold: first, to 
ensure that they and their teams clearly understand the 
key elements of our ‘Prepare’ phase and second, that 
their teams are clear on what their role is in support 
of executing this phase. We still have a lot to do, but 
the foundations we have built are very solid, and the 
progress we are making is very encouraging. Our teams 
are energised and focused – moving forward with 
confidence and trust in the future of McBride.
I sincerely hope that you too share our trust. 
With best regards,
Rik De Vos

Investing 
for growth
The ‘Prepare’ phase is a period of bridging from where McBride 
was and to where we aspire to be – moving the Company from 
‘Repair’ to ‘Grow.’
Earlier this year we confirmed that the bulk of our 
first ‘Repair’ phase of the ‘Manufacturing our Future’ 
strategy had concluded, and in June we completed 
the final two actions, namely the implementation of a 
tax strategy review and the successful refinancing of 
the Group. 
Our ‘Prepare’ phase encompasses four objectives:
This signalled our transition to the second phase – 
the ‘Prepare’ phase of our strategy and to launch the 
significant projects that are crucial to delivering this 
phase, and preparing us for growth.

Our strategy
The Commercial Strategy 
An in-depth market analysis has been 
undertaken and tested against our product and 
technology platforms. This has allowed us to 
identify and prioritise areas of growth, either 
as a result of their specific market dynamics, or 
due to our existing or future technology and/or 
cost leadership. 
Three sources of growth have been identified:
Organic market share – we have defined those 
product categories where we can outgrow 
the market providing we offer the technology, 
cost position and capacity required to supply 
varying channels and geographic markets:
• we have a strong position in certain 
categories such as auto dishwash and 
laundry capsules, which are showing growth 
above market average and where our cost, 
technology and capacity leadership allows 
us to accelerate our growth even further;
• categories where growth is in line with 
market averages but our existing or future 
cost position will allow us to outgrow the 
market. These include areas such as wash up 
liquids and fabric conditioner; and
• we manufacture in certain categories, such 
as bleach or scouring creams, which provide 
no market growth potential as these are 
fully commoditised, but our strong product 
position and market presence allow us 
to gain market share through focused 
market actions.
Channel development – our market approach 
will be to develop further the different 
channels to market. We distinguish these 
as Traditional Retail, Limited Assortment 
Discounters and Contract Manufacturing, 
with online platforms starting to develop and 
gain momentum. Although we observe some 
convergence between the different supply 
models, we still need to optimise our product 
offering and supply chain capabilities to serve 
these different channels. 
Acquisitions – the third element in our growth 
strategy is acquisition opportunities. Since 
we have now moved out of the ‘Repair’ 
phase and established clarity around our 
growth platforms, we have identified the key 
requirements which will drive any acquisition 
consideration and decision. We are now 
actively considering a number of potential 
opportunities.
The Asset Strategy 
To deliver our ‘Grow’ ambitions, it is crucial that 
we align our asset footprint and production 
capabilities to the commercial ambition in two 
key areas:
• an alignment of our future technology needs 
and the associated capacity required to 
meet the identified market opportunities; 
and
• the optimisation of our asset configuration 
based on expected geographical needs and 
developments.
This work has been completed with related 
investment planning and supporting work 
programmes now established. To date, the 
results of which have led to the optimisation 
and finalisation of the first phase investments 
in Middleton and Estaimpuis see case study 
on page 15, together with a full upgrade of our 
facilities in Strelzce see case study on page 16.
The investments in all three sites are 
intentionally aligned to identified market 
opportunities, namely liquids in Middleton, 
capsules in Estaimpuis and servicing the 
discounter opportunities in Germany and 
Eastern Europe. Additionally a workstream 
to further optimise our warehousing and 
distribution network is also under way. 
During the past financial year, the Group 
approved capital projects totalling 
approximately £30 million, on track with our 
plans to invest £100 million over a four-year 
period, indicating our investment plans are 
now in full flow.
Additionally, we have made investments to 
strengthen our R&D capability, specifically 
within packaging, to support our underlying 
intention to establish leading packaging 
development and design see case study 
on page 17.

Our strategy
The Organisational Strategy 
Integral to our success will be the 
organisation’s ability to manage and deliver 
upon the different programmes of work. In the 
past year, McBride has invested substantially in 
the strengthening of the organisation together 
with the HR processes to ensure the long-term 
sustainability of our organisational capabilities. 
The HR function has been strengthened with 
the necessary talent and experience to lead 
mid to long-term strategic recruitment, people 
development plans, and talent and leadership 
development programmes.
These programmes will support all functional 
areas of the business, however, given the 
importance of project management skills 
and leadership to deliver the ‘Prepare’ phase 
programmes, the Commercial, Operations 
and Finance areas of the business have 
been prioritised.
Addressing Underperforming 
Businesses 
The prior poor financial results of our Asia 
business was addressed 18 months ago and 
we continue to see an improvement in the 
performance of this business. We reported 
strong growth last year and substantial 
improvements in profitability. The outlook 
shows promising positive developments as 
a result of strong continued growth see case 
study on page 19.
The improvement plans for our Personal Care 
and Aerosols business have now been finalised 
and we reported that the leadership team have 
started implementation. Actions in the year 
include the start of category and customer 
exits, a more standalone organisation and a 
focus on contract manufacturing opportunities. 
In a difficult business environment, the team 
has been able to defend its position but the 
challenge of strong competitive pressures and 
raw material developments means the business 
had a difficult year. Further actions have now 
been identified to address these challenges. 
In parallel, we reported a third-party offer 
to acquire our Aerosols business. Whilst this 
initiative is no longer active, disposal of some 
elements of these business activities may still 
be considered.

Grow
The overall market dynamics in our industry, 
specifically the trends in Household and Private Label, 
are driven primarily by a combination of factors, 
including uncertain growth prospects, price and 
raw material pressures and intensifying regulatory 
demands on some of our products. These trends are 
not new, but their effects are driving every factor in 
the retail value chain to rethink and redesign their key 
service offering to ensure continued business activity 
and success.
The fundamental outputs of our programmes in the 
‘Repair’ and ‘Prepare’ phases have and will permit 
McBride to reposition itself to deliver to different 
customer expectations through its growing cost 
leadership, driving size into scale advantages and the 
right business model flexibility. 
In the last 18 months, we have substantially upgraded 
our customer service levels, innovation cycle and 
overall quality of our products. The recognition of this 
by our customers has led us to gain new business.
This is especially visible in the retail and discount 
channels where we can combine our improved 
cost efficiency with the ability to integrate other 
cross-functional improvement initiatives for customers, 
taking the relationship beyond the purely transactional. 
We notice however that there are regional differences 
in the speed of response towards our proposition, 
with progress in the UK the most advanced. In other 
regions we might expect that through short-term, 
tactical purchasing behaviours, some business might 
be threatened, ignoring the fundamental benefits we 
are able to offer.
We have made further progress in our Contract 
Manufacturing offering. The Contract Manufacturing 
organisation is now fully in place, and closer 
relationships with key customers are being established 
see case study on page 18.
It remains apparent that overall there is an 
increasing interest from brand owners to outsource 
manufacturing of their products. Time required to 
finalise such deals has proven to be longer than 
originally anticipated, due to the fact in a number 
of cases the transfer of production involves partial 
or complete closures of production entities. 
The establishment of our organic growth opportunities 
has enabled us to decipher and articulate our 
requirements for growth from M&A activity. 
Appropriate strategic acquisitions, both as bolt-on 
opportunities to strengthen our platform and market 
position but also to rationalise uncompetitive capacity 
will be key drivers in our acquisition strategy. 15 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Case study
The growth of the laundry capsule market continues, 
and requires different formats of capsule – mono 
and dual, and different packaging options – tubs 
and doypack. In addition, the changing regulatory 
landscape makes the challenge of meeting customers’ 
needs ever greater. McBride is meeting this challenge 
through a focused approach of reorganisation, 
investment and efficiency improvement.
Reorganisation
This year we decided to consolidate our liquid capsule 
manufacturing from two locations manufacturing sites 
to one, in Estaimpuis, Belgium. This has driven two 
key benefits: 
First, in supply – previously capacity was split across 
two manufacturing locations, which restricted 
the flexibility of having capacity available of the 
required format in the right location. By combining 
factory machinery into one site we have improved 
our flexibility and responsiveness across different 
capsule formats. 
Second, we have combined the manufacturing site 
with our research and development (R&D) expertise to 
create a Centre of Excellence for the category, serving 
the whole of McBride in the development of packaging 
and formulations.
Investment
McBride made a decision to invest significantly in 
this category to support strong market growth with 
additional capacity – either with brand new production 
lines or from increased automation of existing lines. 
In developing our products to be safer for children, 
McBride is a pioneer in developing packaging with 
Child Impeding Closures (CIC) which meet the criteria 
stipulated by industry bodies. McBride will continue 
to invest further to develop and manufacture new 
generations of capsules.
Efficiency improvement
The bespoke nature of assets involved in the 
manufacture of liquid capsules means that the 
decision to switch on new capacity cannot be done 
instantaneously. To complement the investment 
strategy, work has been undertaken to drive efficiencies 
to sustainably develop increased capacity for 
short-term customers’ demands. Through a focused 
operational excellence team, driving initiatives the 
output of liquid capsules has increased by 30%. 
With growth in this category projected to remain 
strong, the work that the Estaimpuis team has 
undertaken is positive and the aspiration to achieve 
further efficiency gains continues.
By adopting a steadfast approach of reorganisation, 
investment and efficiency improvement, McBride has 
been able to deliver sustained capacity increases 
and flexibility to deliver the formats that the market 
demands now and is expected to require in the future.

Strzelce
A major turnaround
The Strzelce site in Poland was an under-invested, 
inadequately designed facility acquired some years 
ago. An inherited legacy of shared Household and 
Personal Care facilities, high product complexity, 
inefficient layout and relatively weak productivity 
meant the site was ill-prepared to meet both 
today’s demands and the increasing expectations 
of our customers. 
A major turnaround project was necessary 
to transform the site and enable it to play an 
effective role in the ‘Prepare’ and ‘Grow’ phases 
of McBride’s future.
The challenge
To identify and deliver a plan to completely overhaul 
the site infrastructure, facilities and staff structures 
over a nine-month period, whilst all the time 
maintaining consistent output and customer service 
levels with minimal disruption. 
This project was the biggest factory rehabilitation 
McBride identified in its ‘Repair’ strategy, requiring 
the creation of a focused project and technical team 
to support the existing site management in execution 
of the plans.
The solution
The creation of a clear strategic vision for the site, 
aligned to corporate strategy, incorporating best 
practice from both inside and outside the Group. 
The project team focused on improving Strzelce’s core 
competence; its Household Products area. It designed a 
new simplified and more efficient factory flow, allowing 
a step change to be achieved in productivity, quality 
and, most importantly, the safe working environment 
for staff. The solution also created extra space, which 
has granted greater on-site storage, reduced external 
warehousing and lower working capital needs.
The investment
An investment of £3.5 million in new blow mould 
facilities, IT systems and reconfiguring our filling lines 
and site access points. New management and staffing 
structures were introduced – accompanied by ongoing 
training and development plans. 
The benefit
Future annual savings from this project, together with 
its contribution to our ‘customer choices’ simplification 
programme, exceed £3 million. We have realised a step 
change in efficiency, with 20% fewer staff delivering the 
same Household volumes as before. 
Furthermore, we now have a sustainable base from 
which the key Central and Eastern European markets 
can be serviced by a high quality, cost effective and 
reliable supply facility. 
The outcome
The realisation of a vision for a ‘fit for the future’ 
facility in Strzelce that can contribute fully to McBride’s 
growth strategy.  17 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Case study
Packaging design has an ever-increasing impact and 
relevance for both the cost and the attractiveness 
of our products. Consumers often decide within the 
first few seconds as to whether the product on offer 
looks attractive, different and reliable through the 
bottle design and impression. For cost considerations, 
packaging design has an impact on the performance, 
weight, stability and time to market efficiency 
of finished products. Increasingly producers and 
customers prefer not to rely only on past experience 
– McBride can now offer a more scientific approach 
with performance modelling to maximise quality 
and performance.
Towards the end of 2016 our R&D packaging team 
engaged in a complete transformation by investing in 
a packaging laboratory fully equipped with computer 
modelling and simulation, 3D printing capability and 
advanced stability testing. 
This has enabled a new way of working for our 
Packaging department. The 3D printing capability allows 
us to study a new bottle design offering differentiated 
options with our operational capabilities in mind, by 
simulating packaging performance and confirming 
decisions before any prototyping or testing on our 
main production lines takes place. 
This new way of working reduces development time, 
and optimises aesthetics, costs and performance, 
ultimately adding real value to our customers.

Contract manufacturing
Major growth opportunity 
McBride has been an active contract manufacturing 
supplier for many years, although the scale of this 
activity within the Company was limited through 
historical choices.
In recent years, brand owners have shown an 
increasing propensity to outsource some of their 
manufacturing requirements. While this phenomenon 
has a number of underlying reasons, the demand 
and search for increased manufacturing capability 
and capacity by brand owners has intensified. 
In this context, McBride has been identified as 
an increasingly important third-party contract 
manufacturer and in response has taken the decision 
to make strategic investments in support this growth 
opportunity. Several characteristics make us well 
placed to exploit this opportunity: the scale of our 
manufacturing capability, our geographic reach, 
and our manufacturing assets. These characteristics 
enable us to produce a substantial range of product 
categories and showcase our technological expertise. 
These attributes are augmented further by our 
financial strength that enables us to support additional 
expansion initiatives from contract manufacturing 
customers. McBride’s strategic ambition is to be the 
preferred external supply solution partner to brand 
owners, supported by the right relationships and 
supply performance. 
As an example, in the laundry capsule category, 
McBride is offering a leading brand owner access to 
its next generation innovation for these products. We 
are their exclusive external supply solution partner for 
this technology in Europe. There is a clear advantage 
for the brand owner in having priority access to 
capacity – giving them a speed to market advantage 
and the avoidance of significant capex investments 
in this capital-intensive technology. McBride, as a 
key leader in this technology brings scale, expertise 
and safe solutions ahead of legislation significantly 
reducing the risk for the brander. In return, McBride 
has been rewarded with a longer-term commitment 
with a minimum revenue stream providing visibility 
and stability within the wider McBride business.
In other categories, during the past year we have 
signed several, albeit small, contracts with brand 
owners, on the back of our value proposition, and see 
a very satisfactory relationship between both parties. 
These include business activities in Western Europe, 
Eastern Europe, South Europe and India.
It should be recognised, however, that the 
decision-making process by branders to transfer 
strategic parts of their manufacturing capability to third 
parties can take longer than decisions made by retailers 
and in many cases longer than we have previously seen. 
More recent discussions on contract manufacturing 
have been initiated on the back of the discontinuation 
or even closure of brand owner manufacturing capacity.  19 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Australia
Global reach, industry-leading performance 
The key to success in the development and launch of 
new, successful products is an intimate co-operation 
with the customers’ product and marketing teams. 
Well-designed and desirable products bring enhanced 
sales for our customers, which benefits McBride’s 
revenues and strengthens the relationships between 
the customer and McBride to further progress projects 
that provide mutual benefit. In cases where our 
customers aim to drive growth through geographical 
entry or expansion into more remote areas, McBride’s 
extensive product development support is even more 
highly valued. 
McBride worked in close partnership with the Category 
Buying Director of a major retailer in Australia, to 
develop an auto dishwash product brief for our global 
R&D team, based in Europe. The work focused on 
attaining industry-leading performance across all 
stain sets that were relevant to the Australian market. 
In addition, work was performed on designing the 
appropriate supply chain ensuring seamless supply 
of products over this distance.
As a starting point, McBride tested all existing auto 
dishwash products on the Australian market to 
determine the benchmark performance standards 
to be exceeded, and targets were determined under 
mutual agreement. 
A new product was developed by our R&D with 
external tests proving that the overall performance 
of our new product was indeed market leading. 
With this product, we proceeded to work with the 
Category Buying Director to maximise the design and 
artwork to communicate the superb performance 
clearly to consumers. In addition, we collaboratively 
designed a new shelf-ready case for the products to be 
merchandised on store shelves. Subsequently, the new 
product was launched during 2016.
Outcome
The new market-leading formulation had an immediate 
positive impact, with the customer’s sales in this 
category growing quickly to a level significantly higher 
than their overall market share in Australia. This result 
was recognition of the product’s appeal, both in its 
industry-leading performance and in its value, being 
the lowest price per tablet in Australia.
This success was further reinforced when the product 
won the Choice ‘Product of the Year’ Award for the 
Dishwasher Tablet category in Australia for two years 
running in 2016 and 2017. 20 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

‘Manufacturing our Future’ strategy
‘Manufacturing our Future’ defines a clear roadmap to restore McBride 
to its competence of manufacturing and operational excellence.
This time last year, the Group reported it had completed 
the exercise to reduce the levels of complexity in 
our customer and product portfolio (our “customer 
choices” project), the impact of which would reduce 
revenues on an annualised basis by approximately 
£20.0 million. This initiative commenced in the second 
half year of the previous financial year such that in the 
twelve months to 30 June 2017, the project lowered 
revenues by £16 million, equating to approximately 
2.1% of the year-on-year reduction in Group sales 
(at constant currency). 
Excluding “customer choices”, overall volumes were 
lower by a further 2.8% across the Group as some 
of our markets became increasingly competitive. 
The Group remained disciplined in its approach to 
margin management ensuring its sales mix provides 
a solid platform for future profitable growth. Price 
pressure remained a feature in the year with 0.7% 
of the year-on-year revenue decline a result of lower 
item prices. 
Full year adjusted operating profit was £41.5 million 
(2016: £36.2m) with adjusted operating profit margin 
increasing to 5.9% (2016: 5.3%), showing good progress 
towards our 7.5% ambition. Based on full year adjusted 
operating profit return on capital employed ratio 
(ROCE) improved to 27.7% (2016: 23.4%) firmly within 
our 25%-30% ambition. 
On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit 
improved by 0.2% or £0.1 million. When adjusting for the 
impact of various hedging activities underlying adjusted 
operating profit improved by £3.5 million or 8.5%.
In the year to June 2017, raw material prices increased 
by approximately 2.2%. Of this, 1.2% was driven by 
foreign exchange and the impact of weaker Sterling and 
a strong US Dollar. The Group was favourably hedged 
for approximately 65% of the foreign exchange impact 
through the year.

Group operating results
Full year Group revenues of £705.2 million were 
£24.3 million (3.6%) higher than the revenues reported 
for the prior year, aided by the translation effect of a 
strong Euro. On a constant currency basis, sales were 
lower by £44.5 million (5.9%), with Household sales 
lower by 5.8% and Personal Care & Aerosols (PCA) 
lower by 6.3%.

These cost increases, both pricing and currency, were 
more impactful in the second half year. Underlying raw 
material prices have steadied in recent months however 
the outlook is for some further increases, including the 
impact of weaker Sterling. 
Supply chain and overhead efficiency initiatives enabled 
by our ‘Manufacturing our Future’ strategy underpinned 
our financial results and more than offset the loss of 
margin from reduced revenues and raw material price. 
Our focus on delivering scale advantage through 
manufacturing and cost leadership delivered supply 
chain saving initiatives of £10.9 million while overhead 
saving initiatives, some of which were announced 
in previous years, delivered a further £9.8 million in 
the year. 
The usual lower second half sales run rate combined 
with the raw material cost and currency impact 
mentioned above, led to a weaker second half profit 
performance when compared to our first six months 
of the year. 
Full year operating profit increased by £6.9 million 
to £39.8 million (2016: £32.9m). This includes an 
exceptional charge of £1.0 million (2016: £2.4m) 
primarily due to the restructuring of our Poland factory 
(£0.9m) and additional charges in relation to our 
ongoing Italian factory legal case (£0.2m).
Cash management in the year was strong with cash 
generated from operations before exceptional items 
of £63.3 million (2016: £52.5m). Capital expenditure 
cash flow increased during the year to £17.7 million 
(2016: £12.8m) as our capital plans gain momentum 
and we continue with our expected £100 million capital 
expenditure objective over four years.
Exceptional items amounted to £14.0 million 
(2016: £2.4m), the cash impact of which was 
£13.2 million (2016: £4.2m) primarily reflecting the debt 
refinancing of the Group and the restructuring of our 
Poland factory. The £13.0 million relating to refinancing 
was matched by a £11.3 million inflow in working capital 
from settlement of associated forward derivatives.
Net cash flow before payments to shareholders was 
£27.8 million (2016: £19.7m). Cash payments made to 
shareholders during the year amounted to £6.6 million 
(2016: £5.8m). Consequently, year end net debt 
decreased to £75.7 million (2016: £90.9m) comprising 
a strong net cash flow of £21.2 million reduced by 
£6.0 million of translation impact as a result of the 
weaker Sterling exchange rates on Euro and US Dollar 
denominated borrowings.
The Group’s balance sheet remains robust with net 
assets of £64.2 million (2016: £69.1m). Gearing improved 
further to 50% (2016: 59%) and the debt cover ratio fell 
to 1.2x (2016: 1:7x).
Segmental performance
In line with prior year-end reporting, we continue to 
separately manage the Group’s Household and PCA 
activities, and our segmental reporting reflects this.
Corporate costs, which include the costs associated 
with the Board and the Executive Leadership Team, 
governance and listed company costs and certain 
central functions (mostly associated with financial 
disciplines such as treasury), are reported separately 
to Household and PCA.
Household
The Household activities are managed by four regional 
teams, ensuring key organisational responsibility within 
our management structure. Whilst revenues for the four 
regions are split, trading profits are only measured and 
reported at the total segment level.
Reported revenues increased by 3.9% to £555.7 million 
(2016: £535.0m) but at constant currency revenues 
were lower by 5.8%. Of this sales decrease, £11.5 million 
related to the in-year effect of our “customer choices” 
project and £16.9 million due to a reduction in 
underlying volumes. Additionally, £4.7 million of the 
decline year-on-year was due to customer pricing.
In the UK, revenue of £155.4 million compared to 
revenue of £164.9 million in 2016, a decline of 5.8%. 
Approximately £4.6 million of this lost revenue resulted 
from our “customer choices” project. Additional 
decreases were seen as a number of UK retailers 
delisted some secondary brands as they reduced their 
SKU ranges offered to consumers. This secondary brand 
delisting now better places the UK business to take 
advantage of the resulting higher profile of our private 
label range in stores.
The UK business imports materials used for 
manufacturing from the EU, for which the Group 
has been hedged at rates consistent with prior year 
averages in the first half year of the 2017 financial year. 
In the second half, the UK business, along with our 
competitors, faced imported inflation.
In the North region, overall sales were impacted by a 
very competitive market, particularly in France. Volume 
decline of 3.8% during the year was in part due to the 
“customer choices” project of 0.8%, in addition to price 
deflation of 1.8% driven by an increasingly competitive 
environment. 
Our South region reported underlying flat sales at 
constant currency. Our Iberia business continues to 
show significant improvement with volumes up 2.6% 
on prior year following new business wins at the end 
of last financial year. Within Italy, revenue is down 
primarily driven by the impact from our “customer 
choices” project.
The East region, covering Germany, Poland and other 
East European countries, saw volumes down on prior 
year by 5.6%, of which 2.1% was due to “customer 
choices”. Germany has seen an increasingly competitive 
environment and in Poland, sales were weaker as key 
retailers shifted their business models towards higher 
proportions of branded SKUs in store.
Headline profits in Household increased 17.8% (6.6% at 
constant currency). In spite of lower revenues, further 
positive progress on margins and costs resulted in 
trading profit margins in this segment rising from 
8.0% to 9.1%. 23 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report
Personal Care & Aerosols (PCA) 
The PCA division comprises the Personal Care liquids, 
Skincare and Aerosols businesses of McBride’s European 
operations and also the activities of McBride in Asia.
On a reported basis, revenues for this division grew 
by 2.5% to £149.5 million (2016: £145.9m). At constant 
currency, revenues were lower by 6.3% of which 
£4.5 million of this decrease related to the effect of 
our “customer choices” project in the year. Within this 
segment revenues were significantly higher in Asia, up 
12.7% at constant currency. Our European businesses 
saw volumes lower by 7.9% overall at constant currency 
with the main markets for these products, UK and 
France, continuing to see private label volumes under 
pressure from branders and high levels of in-store 
promotional activity. 
Overall reported profitability for this segment reduced 
by £3.4 million to a loss of £0.7 million (2016: profit 
£2.7m). At constant currency, profitability reduced by 
£4.1 million reflecting the volume challenges during the 
year within our European business and increasing price 
pressures on raw materials.
In Asia, the local teams have successfully turned a 
break-even operation to one that now makes underlying 
profit margins close to the Group average.
In its half year results on 22 February 2017, the Group 
said it had received a number of approaches from 
external parties expressing interest in acquiring the 
Group’s Aerosols business, which has production 
facilities in the UK and France. Following several months 
of discussions, negotiations regarding a potential sale of 
the business have been halted and at this time Aerosols 
is to be retained within the wider PCA business.
Group refinancing exercise
As previously announced in June 2017, the Group 
secured replacement banking facilities from a panel of 
international banks and using these increased facilities 
repaid its US Private Placement Notes (USPP). These 
actions will lower the cost of the Group’s debt financing 
from the financial year starting on 1 July 2017 by 
approximately £2.0 million per year.
The €140 million multi-currency revolving credit facility 
(RCF) has been increased to a five-year €175 million 
facility with a maturity of June 2022. 
Features of the replacement facilities include:
• a €175 million RCF of which €70 million is drawn at 
30 June 2017, providing the Group with significant 
committed funding headroom;
• a 5bps reduction in both margin and 
non-utilisation fees;
• the addition of further borrowing entities and 
currencies, increasing flexibility going forward; and
• a €75 million uncommitted accordion feature will 
provide additional facilities for potential future 
acquisitions in support of the ‘Grow’ phase of 
our strategy.
The $50 million 5.51% 2020 USPP and $40 million 
5.38% 2022 USPP were repaid in full by drawing on 
the increased RCF. Under the terms of the USPP 
arrangements, the Group paid a ‘make-whole’ payment 
to existing USPP note-holders of £9.5 million. At the 
same time the Group terminated the Euro/Dollar 
cross-currency interest rate swaps relating to the 
existing USPP notes which had a mark-to-market 
on close of £11.3 million in favour of the Group.
The Group’s overall ongoing average cost of debt, after 
the repayment of the USPP, has reduced by approximately 
310bps to 150bps. The total exceptional finance charge 
associated with this transaction was £13.0 million.  24 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Other financial information
Exceptional items
Exceptional items of £14.0 million were recorded during 
the year (2016: £2.4m). The charge was made up 
primarily of the following items: 
• exceptional finance charges of £13.0 million incurred 
as part of the refinancing of the Group;
• during the year the Group’s Italian business lost 
a long-running legal case surrounding costs of 
reparation to a property vacated by the Group in 2011 
for which an additional £0.2 million of costs has been 
accrued; and 
• the business reorganised its Poland site with 
significant investment and upgrades to focus on 
Household activities. The non-capital costs of this 
now completed project in the year were £0.9 million.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs in the year were £20.6 million 
(2016: £7.1m) with the increase mainly due to 
exceptional costs incurred (£13.0m) as part of the 
debt refinancing of the Group. Underlying costs were 
£7.6 million, the rise due to the effect of weak Sterling 
on Euro denominated interest costs.
Profit before tax and tax rate
Reported profit before taxation was £19.2 million 
(2016: £25.8m) with adjusted profit before taxation 
totalling £34.6 million (2016: £29.4m). The tax charge 
on adjusted profit before taxation for the year of 
£10.7 million (2016: £9.2m) represents a 31% (2016: 31%) 
effective tax rate.
Earnings per share
On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share (EPS) 
increased by 18.0% to 13.1 pence (2016: 11.1p) with basic 
EPS at 4.9 pence (2016: 9.3p). 
Payments to shareholders
In line with the policy on payments to shareholders 
implemented in September 2015, the Group expects to 
distribute adjusted earnings to shareholders based on a 
dividend cover range of 2x-3x, progressive with earnings 
of the Group, taking into account funding availability. 
Following the interim payment of 1.4 pence declared 
in February 2017, the Board recommends a final 
payment of 2.9 pence (2016: 2.4p) to shareholders and 
it is intended this will be issued using the Company’s 
B Share scheme.
Covenants
The Group’s funding arrangements are subject to 
covenants, representations and warranties that are 
customary for unsecured borrowing facilities, including 
two financial covenants: Debt Cover (the ratio of net 
debt to EBITDA) may not exceed 3:1 and Interest Cover 
(the ratio of EBITDA to net interest) may not be less 
than 4:1. For the purpose of these calculations, net debt 
excludes amounts drawn under the invoice discounting 
facilities. The Group remains comfortably within 
these covenants. 
These covenants remain unchanged under the new 
banking facilities completed in June 2017.
Pensions
During the year the Group commissioned a review 
of the IAS 19 assumptions used in determining the 
closing liability of the Robert McBride Pension Fund 
(‘the Fund’), specifically focusing on demographic 
assumptions. A medically underwritten mortality study 
was carried to identify the current health of a sample 
group of Fund members, assessed via a written health 
questionnaire and a telephone interview with trained 
medical staff. This study was targeted towards members 
with the most significant liabilities in the Fund.
The output was interpreted by underwriters and then 
analysed alongside the results from the postcode 
analysis used in the prior year. This was translated into 
mortality assumptions for use in calculating the IAS 19 
scheme liabilities. 
The study reduced assumptions concerning average life 
expectancies of Fund Members and as such an actuarial 
gain of £3.1 million is recorded in the movement of 
defined benefit obligations for the year. Overall the 
pension deficit for the UK scheme increased in the year 
to £40.0 million from £31.1 million at the end of the 
previous year primarily due to the effects of an increase 
in the future inflation assumptions and a decrease in the 
discount rate. 
The Group also has other unfunded post-employment 
benefit obligations outside the UK that amounted to 
£2.2 million (2016: £1.8m). 
Current trading and outlook
Trading in the first few months of the new financial 
year has been satisfactory and in line with the Board’s 
expectations for the full year. We are maintaining our 
focus on cost and efficiency initiatives to mitigate 
the impact of any current pressures on revenue. 
We anticipate financial performance weighted towards 
the second half of the year as increases in revenues 
from our ‘Grow’ strategy begin to benefit the business.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Through a refocused risk management approach the Group’s 
capability to assess risks is continually improving, such that 
our strategic, significant and emerging risks are identified and 
managed effectively.
Identification, management and mitigation of risk and 
uncertainty across the Group is an essential part of the 
ability to deliver our strategy.
The Group’s risk management process has been 
refreshed, with a cross-functional working group of 
senior managers, providing a focused understanding 
and view on the key risks which have a potential impact 
on delivering the Group’s strategy. Further detail can 
be found within the Corporate governance section on 
pages 41 and 42.
The Board has identified those risks which are deemed 
principal to its business due to their potential severity 
and link to the Group’s strategy, markets and operations. 
There have been no material changes since 2016, but a 
decision was taken to separate consumer and customer 
trends into a standalone risk to reflect the Group’s 
progression towards the growth phase of its strategy. 
This is not intended to be an exhaustive list. Additional 
risks not presently known to management, or risks 
currently deemed to be less material, may also have 
potential to cause an adverse impact on our business.

Going concern statement
The Group’s business activities, together with the 
factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, are set out in the Strategic 
report. The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Executive review on pages 20 to 24. 
In addition, note 21 to the financial statements includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to credit and 
liquidity risks.
The Group meets its funding requirements through 
internal cash generation and bank credit facilities, 
most of which are committed until June 2022. 
At 30 June 2017, committed undrawn facilities 
amounted to £105.7 million. The Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, show that the Group 
will be able to operate comfortably within its current 
bank facilities. The Group has a relatively conservative 
level of debt to earnings.
As a result, the Directors believe that the Group is 
well placed to manage its business risks successfully 
despite the current uncertain economic outlook. After 
making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Viability statement
In accordance with the requirements the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’), the Directors have 
performed a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. The Board has determined that a three-year 
period to 30 June 2020 constitutes an appropriate 
period over which to provide its viability statement.
In assessing the Group’s viability the Directors have 
considered the current financial position of the Group 
and its principal risks and uncertainties as described 
on pages 26 to 28. The analysis considers severe but 
plausible downside scenarios incorporating the principal 
risks from a financial and operational perspective, 
with the resulting impact on key metrics, such as debt 
headroom and covenants considered. The alternative 
scenarios assume sensitivity around exchange rates 
and interest rates, along with significant reductions in 
revenue, margins and cash flow over the three-year 
period. In all cases the business model remained 
robust, funding capacity sufficient and covenants fully 
complied with. The Group’s global footprint, product 
diversification and access to external financing all 
provide resilience against these factors and the other 
principal risks that the Group is exposed to.
After conducting their viability review, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
period of their assessment to 30 June 2020.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, the Board 
has taken into consideration these principal risks and uncertainties when 
determining whether to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
and when assessing the prospects of the Group when preparing its 
viability statement. 29 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Working together to reduce waste
We train and motivate our colleagues to work in a 
sustainable manner and encourage the sharing of 
experience and practice across all locations to apply 
internal best practice across the Group. Examples 
during the year include:
• our Barrow site has undertaken a number of waste 
initiatives, including on-line recycling and grinder 
systems, which has led to the elimination of laundry 
tablets being sent to landfill; and
• at our eper plant, the simple idea of replacing 
staples with velcro on our boxes of blow moulded 
bottles not only reduced the safety risk, but also led 
to increased longevity of the boxes equivalent to a 
95-tonne waste reduction in cardboard per year.

Social
Employee support
A key principle to our business success is creating 
a culture whereby all colleagues across the Group 
are recognised as a valuable asset and supported 
to become fully engaged, aligned and achieve their 
full potential.
Our SMART Growth HR strategy recognises that each 
phase of our ‘Manufacturing our Future’ strategy 
requires different styles, skills and experiences. 
Our recruitment, talent management and training and 
development programmes ensure the Group maintains 
a large pool of talent to deliver its strategic objectives.
Diversity
We recognise and value all forms of diversity in our 
employees and endeavour to promote diversity in our 
workplace to enhance the success of our business.
Animal testing
Our animal testing policy ensures we do 
not test products on animals, nor request 
testing of products or ingredients by any 
supplier or third party.
Microplastics
Microplastics are small pieces of plastic material 
typically under 5mm in size and originate from a 
variety of different sources.
We used small plastic beads in some of our Personal 
Care products, however, acknowledging the 
environmental effects of these beads, particularly 
on marine life, we recognised that we could provide 
consumers with products that delivered a similar 
exfoliating performance without the need to use 
plastic. Since 2015 we have phased out all small 
plastic beads from all our Personal Care products 
using suitable alternatives ensuring an equivalent 
high-quality performance.
Our responsibilities
We are fully aware of our quality and safety 
responsibilities to our customers and to consumers 
who use our products. We also take environmental 
responsibilities seriously, and where possible, work 
with customers and accredited ecological bodies to 
reduce potential environmental impact.

We take the issue of human rights seriously and 
continue to strengthen our policies and management 
systems in this area. Our employee policies are set 
locally to comply with local law within the overall 
Group framework and we monitor the employment 
practices of our supply chain.
We carry out third-party ethical audits which are 
run under the Sedex System wherever possible or, 
alternatively, under a specific retailer’s own system. 
All conform with the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) 
and our sites are independently audited at a frequency 
determined by risk. We maintain full data disclosure 
under the Sedex System for all sites regardless of 
audit frequency.
Our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 
(available on our website www.mcbride.com) enshrines

modern slavery in our supply chain.

Community
 
McBride is pleased to operate a further education 
grant scheme. Colleagues’ children who undertake 
a university course or apprenticeship are offered an 
award to support their education.
In 2016/17, McBride awarded 122 grants in Continental 
Europe and 31 in the UK, amounting to £23,243 
towards further education. 
 
 
McBride fully supports efforts of colleagues who 
participate in wellbeing activities related to our 
Company theme. Each year the trustees will decide 
on the theme that will be supported. For 2017/18, 
the theme is Cancer Research, together with further 
charity events the Company chooses to support 
through local initiatives. 
McBride Belgium strives for improved wellbeing as 
a way to motivate its workforce to maintain their 
physical condition. 
On 2 July 2017, twelve Estaimpuis colleagues accepted 
the challenge to undertake a 6 or 12km run in Zulte, 
Belgium and to raise money for Think Pink. 
Think Pink raises breast cancer awareness and finances 
scientific research to help fight the most widespread 
cancer among women.
With ideal weather conditions to cope with this 
challenge, each colleague made it to the finish and 
contributed to the very first McBride donation to 
Think Pink.
And what’s more… McBride won the prize for the most 
sporty company in the ‘Dwars door Zulte’ running race 
for the second time in a row! 
While major successes against poverty are won 
globally, social divergence is growing in western 
economies. Governments are reducing support for 
local charities through several austerity measures. 
At McBride we have made the conscious decision to 
increase our contribution to charity through several 
means in order to help those who are in need in 
our society.
Charitable Trust
Some years ago, McBride established a Charitable Trust 
with the underlying aim of providing financial support 
to colleague’s children during their study. We have 
now extended both the financial reach and the support 
objectives of the trust through new statutes. The new 
statutes define the criteria for all initiatives to be 
subject to the Charitable Trust support and a new 
Trustees’ Board has been established.
During 2017/18 the Charitable Trust  
will focus on three areas:
Community and society
Objective: ensuring that McBride’s products  
and operations benefit local communities

In 2017/18, we will focus our efforts on supporting 
children who are homeless, in nurseries or orphanages 
through In Kind Direct.
Donations in kind
McBride continues its ongoing support of 
In Kind Direct through providing donations 
of stock materials and through additional 
direct financial contributions. In Kind Direct 
redistributes surplus or obsolete stock to 
UK charities. The organisation reaches a wide range 
of charities and our products are of practical help to 
many organisations helping communities across the UK. 
In the period July 2016 to June 2017 we made three 
stock donations which benefited 1,476 voluntary and 
community organisations. The stock donated amounted 
to 97 pallets of product, with a total estimated retail 
value of £116,000, in addition to a direct financial 
contribution of £25,000. McBride made its first 
donation of goods in 2010 and since then has donated 
a total of £640,000 in estimated retail value.
Here is just one example of where we have touched 
people’s lives through our donations:
Community Gateway Association, Preston
Community Gateway Association (CGA) is a housing 
association with community at its core. It manages 
around 6,200 homes in Preston, Lancashire.
CGA delivers a wide range of support and activities 
for its tenants and works with a number of partners 
to meet the diverse range of needs faced by the 
community. Some of the services offered include job 
clubs, benefit and debt advice, and vocational training 
for young people.
In addition to these services, the team also helps 
tenants who are in crisis by giving them food and 
goods packages.
McBride donated a range of products, including items 
such as shower gel, washing up liquid and handwash, 
which the charity redistributed among service users.
“ Many of our tenants struggle to find the 
funds for food, let alone for more expensive 
products such as toiletries, household 
cleaning items and clothing. With the help 
of In Kind Direct, we have been able to assist 
many tenants with these basic needs.”

Chairman’s introduction
Dear Shareholder
I reported last year that work undertaken under the 
guidance of the Executive Directors on the business 
transformation strategy has started to deliver 
benefits for the Group, for our colleagues and for our 
shareholders. This year, I am pleased to report that the 
strategy continues to be developed as we move into the 
‘Prepare’ and ‘Grow’ phases to ensure that sustainable 
value growth can be delivered to all stakeholders.
Both I and the Non‑Executive Directors are fully 
supportive of the strategic direction being taken by the 
Group. This is reported in our Strategic report on pages 
1 to 33 and more information about Board activities 
in general is shown on page 41 of this Corporate 
governance section.
Corporate governance
The following Corporate governance report serves to 
demonstrate that a robust governance framework is 
in place to support the Group’s strategy. We explain 
our approach to the main governance principles of 
Leadership, Effectiveness, Accountability, proactive 
Engagement with shareholders and application of 
transparent Remuneration policies and share the work 
of our sub‑committees.
Change of Company Secretary
Carole Barnet, who has been Group Company 
Secretary since 2010 and with the Group since 1981, 
has advised the Board of her intention to retire. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to express my 
appreciation for her service to the Group and to wish 
her a relaxing retirement. It is expected that Carole will 
stand down from the position during January 2018. 
An announcement concerning Carole’s replacement will 
be made in due course.
Code compliance
As a Board, we remain committed to maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance and we endorse 
the provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2016 (‘the Code’).
During the year, we have assessed our level of 
compliance with the Code and the Board confirms that 
throughout the year the Company has continued to 
comply with all of the Code’s provisions, in so far as 
they apply to a FTSE SmallCap company.
We have an effective Board and sub‑committee 
structure, underpinned by solid operating principles, 
policies and controls and we continue to exercise 
our duties in compliance with all relevant legislation, 
regulation and guidance.
Board responsibility and future strategic direction 
The Board acknowledges its collective responsibility for 
overseeing the success of the Group by demonstrating 
strong leadership, setting the Group’s strategy and 
business model, reviewing management performance 
and ensuring the necessary resources are in place. 
The output from this year’s Board evaluation exercise 
evidenced that this has been successful during the year 
under review.

Executive Leadership Team (ELT)
Leadership and responsibilities
We recognise the importance of establishing the right 
culture and communicating this message throughout 
the organisation. It is important that we as the Board 
provide strong and effective leadership, constructive 
challenge and, along with the Executive Leadership 
Team (ELT), accept collective accountability for the 
long‑term sustainable success of the Group. In so doing, 
we will continue to drive and deliver our strategy in the 
best interests of all our stakeholders.
Board sub-committees
Certain activities of the Board are delegated to 
various sub‑committees (Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination). Each sub‑committee is chaired by a 
member of the Board which, in turn, enables the 
Non‑Executive Directors to take active roles in 
influencing and challenging the work, performance and 
recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer, the 
ELT and other senior management.
Each sub‑committee has been established under its 
own Terms of Reference which set out its authority, 
composition, activities and duties. The Terms of 
Reference are reviewed and updated as necessary to 
ensure ongoing compliance with the provisions of the 
Code and other best practice guidelines. They were last 
reviewed in June 2017.
Operation of the Board
Board papers are prepared and issued at least one week 
prior to each Board meeting to enable Directors to give 
due consideration to all matters. Directors are able to 
take independent professional advice, if necessary, at 
the Company’s expense.
The Board holds at least six meetings a year at 
bi‑monthly intervals. Additional meetings are held as 
necessary. From time to time, the Board authorises the 
establishment of a sub‑committee to consider and, if 
thought fit, approve certain items of business. On such 
occasions input is sought from all Directors before the 
business is considered. 
A strong feature of the Board’s effectiveness in 
delivering the strategy is our inclusive and open 
style of management and a free flow of information 
between the Executive and Non‑Executive Directors. 
The size of our Board encourages individuals to discuss 
matters openly and freely and to make a personal 
contribution through the exercise of their personal skills 
and experience. No single Director is dominant in the 
decision‑making process.
All Directors communicate with each other on a regular 
basis and contact with senior management within the 
Group is sought and encouraged. 
At least one formal and several informal Non‑Executive 
Director meetings have also been held during the 
year without the Executive Directors being present, 
and the Senior Independent Director and the 
Non‑Executive Directors have met without the presence 
of the Chairman as part of the Board performance 
evaluation exercise.

Responsibilities
The role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and clearly differentiated. No one individual has 
unfettered powers of decision making.
John Coleman, as Chairman, is primarily responsible for:
• overall leadership and governance of the Board, ensuring it operates effectively in terms of agenda setting, 
information management, induction, development and performance evaluation;
• promoting a healthy culture of challenge and debate at Board and sub‑committee meetings; 
• fostering effective relationships and open communication between the Executive and Non‑Executive Directors; 
• ensuring both Board and shareholder meetings are properly conducted and that the views of shareholders 
are communicated to the Board; and 
• promoting effective decision making.
Rik De Vos, as Chief Executive Officer, is primarily responsible for: 
• effective leadership and development of the executive management and operational running of the Group;
• developing and implementing the Group’s business model and strategy;
• effectively communicating the Group’s strategy and performance; and 
• building positive relationships by engaging appropriately with all internal and external stakeholders.
Steve Hannam, as Senior Independent Director, is primarily responsible for:
• providing a sounding board for the Chairman and acting as an intermediary between other Directors when 
necessary;
• evaluating the performance of the Chairman along with the Non‑Executive Directors; and 
• being an available communication channel for shareholders, where contact through the Chairman or 
Executive Directors is not appropriate.
The key responsibilities of the Non-Executive Directors are:
• developing and agreeing the Group’s business model and strategy with the Executive Directors;
• scrutinising and challenging the performance of the Company and the Executive Directors;
• providing support and advice to the Executive Directors;
• overseeing the Company’s risks and internal controls;
• approving remuneration and succession planning for Board Directors and other senior executives; and
• monitoring and enhancing the Company’s corporate governance and compliance activities.
Non-Executive Directors
All the Non‑Executive Directors have been appointed 
for their specific areas of knowledge and expertise, are 
independent of management and exercise their duties 
in good faith based on judgements informed by their 
professional and personal experience. This ensures that 
we can debate matters constructively in relation to 
both the development of strategy and assessment of 
performance against the objectives set by the Board. 
During the year, each Director confirmed that they 
had no relationship or circumstance that could affect 
their judgement and the Board has satisfied itself that 
there is no compromise to the independence of those 
Directors who have appointments with external entities. 
We believe that the balance between non‑executive 
and executive representation encourages healthy 
independent challenge to the Executive Directors 
and to senior management.
Operational management of the Group
The management of the Group’s business activities 
is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer, who is 
ultimately responsible for establishing objectives 
and monitoring executive actions and for the 
overall performance of the business. The day‑to‑day 
management of the business is delegated via the 
various ELT members to senior management on 
a structured functional basis. Health, safety and 
environmental and quality matters are delegated to 
the Chief Operating Officer and social and community 
matters are delegated to the Chief HR Officer.
Whilst the Board takes overall responsibility for 
approving Group policies, including those relating to 
social responsibility, business ethics, health, safety, 
environmental matters and anti‑bribery and corruption, 
their implementation is delegated to the Chief Executive 
Officer and cascaded throughout the organisation via 
the ELT and the various functional teams. Copies of our 
policies are available on the Group’s website at  
www.mcbride.co.uk. 40 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance report

Succession planning
During the year the Group’s succession planning 
approach has continued to evolve. This has included 
evaluation of the roles at ELT level and their direct 
reports to identify key talent and future leadership 
potential. A specific Leadership Programme has been 
developed for high potential employees and this will 
be rolled out over the course of the next financial year. 
The outputs and proposals are overseen by the Board. 
Conflicts of Interest
Our procedure for capturing Directors’ interests can 
be found in the Other statutory information section 
on page 63.
Board evaluation
As in previous years, the Board evaluation exercise was 
designed and led by the Company Secretary, working 
closely with the Chairman of the Board. A questionnaire 
was developed to evaluate the effectiveness and skill 
sets of the individual Directors, as well as the Board as a 
whole. A top‑line evaluation of the operation of each of 
the sub‑committees of the Board was also covered. 
The Non‑Executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, undertook a review of the 
performance of the Chairman. This concluded that the 
Chairman has an open, facilitating leadership style; 
demonstrates independence and objectivity; and shows 
persistence in understanding the business. 
The evaluation exercise identified a number of positive 
areas including greater exposure of the Board during 
the year to members of the ELT and other senior 
managers and more proactive involvement and 
interaction of the Board in the strategic development 
plans for the business. Although the Board and 
sub‑committees are working well, areas highlighted 
for improvement included the need for even deeper 
focus on developing talent and succession planning 
and more frequent tabling of post investment reviews. 
These matters will continue to be addressed during the 
2017/18 financial year.
Following completion of the exercise, the Chairman 
met with individual respondents to discuss the findings.
We last undertook an externally facilitated evaluation 
of the performance of the Board, its members and 
its sub‑committees in the 2011/12 financial year. Since 
then, the composition of the Board has changed with 
the appointment of the new Executive Directors and 
a new Chairman. Furthermore, as a constituent of the 
FTSE SmallCap, the Board did not deem it necessary 
for an external evaluation to be undertaken this year. 
This will be considered further during the course of 
the 2017/18 financial year.
Effectiveness
Board composition
At 30 June 2017, the Board comprised six members: 
the Chairman, two Executive Directors and three 
Non‑Executive Directors.
Director election and re-elections
We are satisfied that all the Directors standing for 
re‑election perform effectively and demonstrate 
commitment to their roles. This has been demonstrated 
during the year by the willingness of the Directors to 
attend additional informal meetings including strategy 
conferences as well as from the general support 
they have given to the Executive Directors and other 
senior management of the Group. When applicable, 
any changes to the commitments of any Director are 
considered in advance by the Board to ensure they are 
still able to fulfil their duties satisfactorily.
Although the Articles of Association (Articles) 
require the Directors to submit themselves for 
re‑election at every third Annual General Meeting 
(AGM), all eligible Directors have agreed to submit 
themselves for annual re‑election. 
Accordingly, John Coleman, Rik De Vos, Chris Smith, 
Steve Hannam, Neil Harrington and Sandra Turner 
will retire at the 2017 AGM and offer themselves 
for re‑election.
The biographies for each Director, set out on pages 
36 and 37, illustrate the range of skills and experience 
they offer to the Company. Voting at the 2016 AGM 
demonstrated continued support for all Directors who 
held office at that time.
Induction, development and support
On appointment, all new Directors undergo formal and 
in‑depth induction programmes to provide them with an 
appropriate understanding of the business. This involves 
site visits, face‑to‑face meetings with senior executives 
and provision of access to key documents relating to 
the new appointee’s role. External training may also be 
provided by independent legal advisers.
We recognise the importance of ongoing training and 
development to ensure Directors have the skills and 
knowledge to discharge their duties effectively. This can 
take the form of briefing papers and/or presentations 
on strategic as well as on regulatory/legislative 
developments and other topics of specific relevance to 
ensure that the Directors continually update their skills, 
knowledge and familiarity with the Group’s business 
and the markets in which we operate. Additionally, all 
Directors are entitled to undertake external training 
relevant to their particular duties. 
All Directors have access to the Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and that the Company complies with all 
applicable rules, regulations and obligations governing 
its operations. 41 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report
Accountability
Business risk
The Board recognises its responsibility for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management procedures during the year. 
This responsibility is delegated to the ELT to consider 
and reassess the effectiveness of the existing controls 
and to identify whether any new risks have arisen as a 
result of any control weaknesses. Further information 
about these processes and procedures and how their 
effectiveness has been assessed are reported in the 
Audit Committee report on page 45.
The Board considers that the Group operates 
a risk‑aware culture which facilitates the early 
identification of problems and issues, so that 
appropriate action is taken in a timely and proactive 
way to minimise the impact on the business.
The Group’s risks are managed through various 
activities including:
• business risk reviews;
• major project and investment reviews;
• specific functional and strategic risk mapping;
• year‑end control self assessment questionnaires 
supporting internal control procedures, with a 
quarterly follow‑up process to review outstanding 
control actions; and 
• site audits by various internal stakeholders, including 
other assurance providers (such as Quality and HSE).
The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing risks faced by 
the Group. This process has been in place for the year 
under review and also up to the date of approval of this 
Annual Report. Such systems are designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve 
business objectives and can therefore only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Internal controls 
Key control procedures undertaken by the Group during 
the year include:
• regular updates to the Board on the Group’s financial 
performance and position against targets;
• monthly consolidated management accounts 
reviewed by the ELT;
• a comprehensive annual budgeting process 
ultimately approved by the Board;
• ongoing monitoring of the Group’s cash and 
debt position with monthly reviews of working 
capital balances;
• authorisation and control procedures in place for 
capital expenditure and other major projects with 
post completion reviews to highlight issues and 
improve future performance and delivery;
• monthly reporting on commercial, operational, 
financial and non‑financial KPIs with performance 
discussed at both functional and Group level; and
• regular meetings and site visits with insurance and 
risk advisers to discuss risk assessments, safety 
audits, and performance against agreed objectives.

Group Risk Management
The Risk Council monitors the identification and 
assessment of risks and makes recommendations to 
the ELT for appropriate mitigation strategies in line 
with the Group’s set risk appetite. More information is 
provided on page 46 in the Audit Committee report.
Reporting to the ELT, the Risk Council acts as a 
focal point for the evaluation of strategic, significant 
operational and emerging risks faced by the Group in 
pursuit of its objectives, and provides support for the 
embedding of the risk management framework through 
improved risk awareness and the consideration of risk in 
key decision making at all levels.
The Risk Council meets between three and four times a 
year and reports to the ELT. Its Terms of Reference have 
been ratified by the Audit Committee.
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function provides independent 
assurance to the ELT and the Board on the strength 
and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
framework and is responsible for overseeing internal 
control processes for the Group.

Investor relations
Relations with shareholders
We place considerable importance on maintaining 
effective and balanced dialogue with all shareholders 
to discuss the Company’s strategy and other associated 
objectives. 
The Executive Directors continue to pro‑actively engage 
with both existing and potential shareholders with the 
purpose of understanding their appetite to invest in the 
Company. In addition, they deliver formal presentations 
of full year and half‑year results with face to face 
meetings with analysts, brokers and fund managers to 
promote a better understanding of the business and its 
strategic plans.
The Board is kept informed of investors’ views through 
the distribution and regular discussion of analysts’ and 
brokers’ briefings and through summaries of investor 
opinion feedback. The Chairman, Senior Independent 
Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee are 
available to discuss governance and strategy with major 
shareholders and are prepared to contact individual 
shareholders should any specific areas of concern or 
enquiry be raised. 
All the Directors attend the AGM and are available 
to answer questions. The proxy votes cast in relation 
to all resolutions, including details of votes withheld, 
are disclosed during the meeting and the results 
made available on our website and announced via the 
Regulatory News Service.

Audit Committee report
On behalf of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to 
present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 
30 June 2017.
Effectiveness of the Audit Committee
The Board is satisfied that Committee members are 
sufficiently competent in financial matters, in addition 
to having a wide range of business experience both within 
the sector and elsewhere. As Committee Chair, I have 
relevant financial experience and up‑to‑date knowledge 
of financial matters, being a member of the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants and the current Chief Finance 
Officer of Cath Kidston Limited. I was previously Group 
Finance Director at Mothercare plc for seven years.
Committee meetings may be attended by the Board 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Finance Officer 
and Head of Internal Audit by invitation. Support is 
provided by the Company Secretary. The Company’s 
external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), 
also attend meetings by invitation. During the year, 
PwC attended four meetings.
Independent meetings were also held regularly between 
the Committee members and the external auditor, in the 
absence of the Executive Directors. The Chairman of the 
Committee also had regular meetings with the Head of 
Internal Audit.
Effectiveness of the external auditor
The Audit Committee has primary responsibility 
for making recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment, re‑appointment and removal of the 
external auditor as submitted to shareholders for 
their approval at the Company’s AGM.
During the year, the Committee has monitored the scope, 
results and cost effectiveness of the audit and overall 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor:
The Committee and the Board remain satisfied with 
the level of independence, objectivity, expertise, fees, 
resources and general effectiveness of PwC and, 
accordingly, recommends that a resolution for the 
re‑appointment of PwC as external auditor for the 
Company should be proposed at the forthcoming 
AGM in October 2017.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that 
the financial statements present a fair, 
balanced and understandable view of 
the Group’s position.

• to monitor the integrity of the financial and 
regulatory reporting process of the Group;
• to review the Group’s accounting policies, financial 
reporting standards and disclosure practices and

Auditor objectivity and independence
Committee review 
and auditor assurance
The Committee has undertaken its annual assessment of the external auditor. This included their own 
evaluation of the reports and services received, such as the scope, strategy and outcome of the interim 
and year end audits. 
The Committee has sought assurance from the external auditor of their compliance with applicable ethical 
guidance and, in addition, has taken account of the appropriate independence and objectivity guidelines. 
The Committee considers the risk of PwC withdrawing from the market as remote since they are one of the 
top four accounting firms in the UK.
The Committee has considered and approved the terms of engagement and fees of the external auditor 
for the year ended 30 June 2017. Fees payable by the Group to PwC totalled £0.5 million (2016: £0.4m) 
in respect of audit services. There were no contingent fee arrangements with PwC.
Audit tenure The Committee considered its external audit services, taking into account the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2016 and Statutory Audit Services Order 2014. A full tender for the appointment of the external 
audit firm took place in 2011, as a result of which PwC was appointed as external auditor with effect from 
November 2011. The Committee is of the current view that it is more effective to align the tender of the 
external auditor with rotation of the incumbent’s lead partner.
Non‑audit fees
The Company maintains a detailed policy on the engagement of external auditor for non‑audit services, 
designed to preserve their independence when performing the statutory audit. To avoid any conflict of 
interest, types of non‑audit work are categorised as those for which:
• the auditor can be engaged without referral to the Committee;
• for which a case‑by‑case decision is necessary; and
• from which the external auditor is excluded.
In accordance with this policy, other providers are considered for non‑audit work and such work is awarded 
on the basis of service and cost. This policy is regularly reviewed and a copy is available from the Group’s 
website at www.mcbride.co.uk.
Fees payable by the Group to PwC totalled £277k (2016: £123k) in respect of non‑audit services, equating 
to 55% of audit fees received by PwC during the same period (2016: 30%).
Accounting and reporting issues
The Committee received regular reports on the Group’s 
trading performance, as well as progress on both 
the interim and full year financial statements. Papers 
and other regular updates from both management 
and the external auditor have also been provided to 
assist the Committee in assessing whether suitable 
accounting policies have been adopted and appropriate 
judgements made by management. 
The significant areas of judgement undertaken 
during the 2016/17 financial year are set out below. 
The Committee is satisfied that the presentation of the 
financial statements is appropriate and in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policies.
Supported by the external auditor’s reports and 
findings, the Committee concluded that there were 
no major concerns, that there was no evidence of 
systematic control weaknesses and that the overall 
control environment was acceptable for a group of 
McBride’s size and nature.
Assurance and internal control environment
The Board recognises the delivery of the Group’s 
strategic plans will only be achieved within an 
established system of risk management and 
internal controls framework, which will ensure that 
the transformational change and growth realised is 
supported by an embedded risk management culture.
The Committee is delegated the responsibility for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s systems 
of internal control, including all material financial, 
operational and compliance controls, as well as risk 
management systems and key corporate policies.
The Committee receives regular reporting from 
management and the conclusion continues to 
be that a generally robust and effective control 
environment exists. No failings or weaknesses have been 
identified which had a material effect on the Company’s 
financial performance. 
Recommendations arising from the external auditor’s 
internal controls report are reviewed and actions 
agreed to implement enhanced policies and processes. 46 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Audit Committee report
continued
Internal controls
The Internal Audit function serves to provide assurances to the Committee that relevant controls and actions are in place. The Committee 
actively engages the Internal Audit function to understand and consider the extent to which the internal control environment can be 
improved. Information on specific key control procedures undertaken by the Group can be found on page 41.
At the start of each financial year, the Committee reviews and agrees the Internal Audit Plan, confirming its alignment with the Group’s 
strategic priorities, risk management outputs and compliance control monitoring. The Audit Plan remains flexible to address new and 
emerging risks throughout the year. 
The Committee continues to be satisfied that the Internal Audit function has sufficient resource and provides an important and effective role. 
Risk management
During the year the Group Risk Management framework was refreshed and a cross‑functional working group (Risk Council) 
was established to maintain and oversee its implementation across the business. The Committee has ratified the Risk Council’s 
Terms of Reference and is provided with regular updates of matters the Risk Council has considered. 
On behalf of the Board, the Committee considered specifically those risks and uncertainties facing the business which should be 
classified as significant and sought comfort from management on the mitigating factors being used. The current principal risks and 
uncertainties effecting the Group can be found on pages 26 to 28.
Cybersecurity
During the year PwC conducted a cybersecurity exercise and review to identify further opportunities for improvements to the Group’s 
security and controls environment. All recommendations made as part of this review were agreed to be implemented and the Committee 
continues to monitor their implementation.
Corporate policies
The Committee undertook its annual review of corporate policies on anti‑bribery and corruption and whistleblowing. The Committee 
continues to believe that appropriate key policies are in place to ensure reasonable steps have been taken to prevent fraud and to allow 
any improprieties to be reported. Copies of the policies are available from the Group’s website at www.mcbride.co.uk.
Fair, balanced and understandable
Having given due and full consideration to all the 
matters referred to above, the Committee is satisfied 
that the financial statements present a fair, balanced 
and understandable view and provides shareholders 
with the necessary information to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, strategy and business model, 
and has undertaken to report accordingly to the Board.

Matters considered  Actions
Impairment reviews
Management’s judgement on the need (or otherwise) to take impairment charges for goodwill or fixed 
assets at certain sites was reviewed, taking into account the trading performance of and the prospects for 
each location. Recommendations were discussed and agreed with the external auditor. Refer to note 13 to 
the financial statements.
Tax and treasury matters The Committee considered and approved the Group’s tax policies and reviewed opportunities to improve 
the Group legal structure to ensure efficient access to subsidiary distributable reserves and compliance with 
global transfer pricing.
In accordance with the terms of the Group’s debt facilities, the Committee continued to monitor compliance 
with all relevant covenants to ensure the Group could continue to have sufficient funding capacity to deliver 
its strategy. The Committee also reviewed the Group’s refinancing and debt funding strategy and policies on 
currency and interest rate hedging transactions.
Recognition and 
measurement of 
customer rebate 
agreements and internal 
stock provisions
The Committee examined the procedures and controls in place to ensure the reporting, monitoring and 
accounting for both customer rebate and internal stock provision elements of the Group’s accounting 
policies was effectively managed and recognised in the Group’s financial statements.
Going concern status 
and longer‑term 
viability statements
In‑depth reviews of the Group’s going concern status were carried out by the Committee both at the 
half and full year period ends. Detailed papers setting out all the relevant considerations were tabled by 
management and discussed by the Committee together with the external auditor.
The Committee also considered the modelling and assessments undertaken by management relating to the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.

On behalf of the Nomination Committee I am pleased to 
present the Nomination Committee report for the year 
ended 30 June 2017.
Key actions and decisions taken during 2016/17: 
• considering the contributions made by the individual 
Directors prior to recommending their re‑election 
at the AGM, taking account of the outputs from 
the internal Board Performance Evaluation exercise 
carried out during the year; and
• considering the re‑appointment of the Senior 
Independent Director.
No Committee member participated in any discussion 
relating to their personal position.
Diversity
The Committee recognises the recommendations 
regarding Board diversity and acknowledges that 
gender diversity is a key element to broaden the 
contribution made to Board deliberations. However, 
as the Board is small, comprising only six members, 
we continue to believe that quotas are not appropriate. 
We also accept that there are many other aspects to 
diversity, including professional and industry‑specific 
experience, understanding of geographical markets 
and different cultures, all of which can also be an aid 
to the Board’s effectiveness. Board appointments 
will ultimately continue to be made based on merit 
and calibre.
We have had at least one female Non‑Executive Director 
since 2003 and we continue to ensure that potential 
female candidates are included in the search for new 
Board appointments. Furthermore, three members of 
the ELT are females. This team also includes a number 
of nationalities: British, Belgian and French.

Remuneration report
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased 
to present the Remuneration report for the year ended 
30 June 2017.
This Remuneration report has been prepared in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium‑sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 and is split into three 
sections: the annual statement; Remuneration Policy 
report; and Annual Report on Remuneration.
At this year’s AGM in October 2017, there will be an 
advisory vote on the Annual Report on Remuneration, 
which details the application of the Company’s current 
Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the 
2014 AGM. In line with the relevant regulations this 
current Remuneration Policy expires at the 2017 AGM. 
Over the past twelve months, the Committee has 
undertaken an extensive review of the current 
Remuneration Policy taking close account of our 
business strategy as well as current and emerging 
market practice and expectations of institutional 
investors. In assessing the effectiveness and overall 
levels of remuneration, the Committee took account 
of a number of reference points, both internal and 
external. Independent advice has also been sought, 
as appropriate, from New Bridge Street (NBS), the 
Committee’s independent advisers. 
Remuneration Policy continuing  
alignment with shareholders
Following this review the Committee has concluded 
that the current Executive Director remuneration 
arrangements and structure works well and remains 
fit‑for‑purpose. It is simple and consistent, with pay 
outcomes dependent upon performance linked to our 
business strategy. It ensures a significant proportion of pay 
is delivered in shares to provide alignment with investors.
However, in the light of the strengthening of the 
business (the share price having moved from its recent 
lowest of 75 pence in December 2014 to 187 pence as 
at 30 June 2017 increasing the market capitalisation 
We remain committed to implementing 
a Remuneration Policy which retains high 
calibre Executive Directors and senior 
managers by rewarding their successful 
contribution to delivering the Company’s 
strategy and thus aligning with longer‑term 
interests of shareholders.
Main duties:
• to review the ongoing appropriateness and  
relevance of the Remuneration Policy;
• to apply formal and transparent procedures 
regarding executive remuneration packages;
• to consider and make recommendations to the 
Board on remuneration issues for the Executive 
Directors and other senior executives, taking into 
account the interests of relevant stakeholders; and
• to review the implementation and operation of any 
Company share option schemes, bonus schemes 
and Long‑ Term Incentive Plans (LTIP).
Attendance at meetings year ended 30 June 2017
The Board is satisfied all members are independent Non‑Executive 
Directors, with the exception of John Coleman who satisfied the 
independence condition on his appointment as Non‑Executive  
Director in 2016.

of the Group by approximately £204 million) and very 
strong performance of our Executive Directors, the 
Committee believes that the total target compensation 
of the Executive Directors has fallen considerably 
below the level that it should now be if they are to 
be appropriately rewarded and incentivised going 
forwards. The Committee is also mindful of the 
continuing evolution of executive remuneration best 
practice and believes that within this context the 
proposed revised approach and Remuneration Policy 
will strengthen the alignment between Executive 
Directors and shareholders and ensure that McBride 
is able to retain (and if necessary recruit) the talent 
needed as the business continues to perform 
successfully and grow. 
As part of the policy review we consulted with major 
shareholders and had support on the proposals below 
from shareholders representing over 50% of share capital.
The main revisions to the Remuneration Policy, or the 
way it is implemented, are proposed as follows: 
• Executive Director base salary increases equating 
to 15% for the Chief Executive Officer (new annual 
salary £460,000) and 17.6% for the Chief Finance 
Officer (new annual salary £294,000), with increases 
backdated to 1 January 2017. The Committee is 
mindful of increasing remuneration in the current 
political and economic environment. However, 
under their leadership the Company has performed 
extremely well, with neither Executive Director 
having had a salary increase since joining at the 
beginning of 2015. The Committee also believes 
that both Executive Directors are fundamental to 
the Company’s continuing development and future 
growth and that the salary increases bring them to 
market competitive levels. It is not expected that 
there would be any further material increase to either 
Executive Directors’ salary during the life of the 
proposed Remuneration Policy;
• the proposed increases to the LTIP annual grant 
limits (Chief Executive Officer 125% of salary and 
Chief Finance Officer 110% of salary), together with 
the introduction of a two year post‑ vesting holding 
period, reflects the Committee’s belief that the 
revised award levels ensure that the Remuneration 
Policy is fit‑for‑purpose for the next policy cycle 
(being appropriate for a company the size and 
complexity of McBride) and ensures that both 
Executive Directors are appropriately incentivised 
to deliver success and drive the business forward 
and are appropriately rewarded for delivering 
long‑term value; 
• as part of the review the performance measures and 
target setting process of the annual bonus and LTIP 
were also reviewed. The Committee believes that the 
current measures (TSR and EPS) remain appropriate 
and no changes are proposed. However, the 
Committee will take into consideration the increased 
award level in setting targets for the year ahead 
and will ensure that the targets for both the annual 
bonus and LTIP will be even more stretching than in 
previous years; and
• changes to shareholding guidelines, increasing an 
expected Executive Director holding of 200% of 
salary, together with a twelve‑month post‑cessation 
of employment holding period for shares equating 
to 100% of salary, maintains the Company at the 
forefront of developing best practice in this area 
and reinforces alignment with shareholders over 
the longer term.
Key actions considered in 2016/17
As well as the Remuneration Policy review undertaken, 
other key actions and decisions taken during 2016/17 
which the Committee has considered include:
• in September 2016 the Committee agreed to the 
granting of LTIP awards for the year 2016/17 to 
Rik De Vos and Chris Smith. Details of these awards 
can be found on page 59;
• for the 2016/17 annual bonus the Committee 
determined the Group financial target had been met. 
Personal objectives for both Executive Directors had 
been achieved in full, giving a total 70.77% payout of 
the maximum annual bonus available to both Executive 
Directors. Further details can be found on page 58;
• the LTIP awards granted in February 2015 
were measured for the three‑year period up to 
30 June 2017 against the agreed EPS and TSR 
performance conditions. The Committee determined 
that all performance conditions had been achieved 
in full and therefore 100% of the awards would vest 
in February 2018. Further details can be found on 
page 59;
• subject to shareholder approval of the new 
Remuneration Policy, the Committee reviewed 
performance targets and objectives in relation to the 
Executive Director 2017/18 Annual bonus and LTIP 
awards and determined they would continue to be 
based on similar measures used in the previous year. 
Further details can be found on page 57; and
• the Committee determined that members of the 
ELT and other selected senior executives would 
become participants in the Group’s LTIP scheme, 
subject to the same performance targets as the 
Executive Directors.
Recommendation
We remain committed to implementing a Remuneration 
Policy which retains high calibre Executive Directors 
and senior managers by rewarding their successful 
contribution to delivering the Company’s strategy and 
thus aligning with longer‑term interests of shareholders. 
We continue to value the support and feedback 
provided by shareholders, including the vote given for 
our Remuneration Policy and approach at our 2016 AGM 
of 92%. I trust I can count on your continued support.

Remuneration Policy report
This report provides details of the proposed 
Remuneration Policy for the Executive and 
Non‑Executive Directors, which is being put 
to shareholder vote at the October 2017 AGM. 
Changes from the previously approved Policy 
in 2014 are highlighted.
Remuneration Policy principles
The Group’s approach for all employees, including 
executives, is to set remuneration that takes account of 
market practice, economic conditions, the performance 
of the Group and of teams or individuals, recognising 
any collective agreements that may apply as well as any 
legal or regulatory requirements in jurisdictions where it 
operates. Our Remuneration Policy (‘the Policy’) aims to 
attract, motivate and retain suitably able employees.
The basic principles that guide our Remuneration Policy 
for executives, including the Executive Directors, are 
as follows:
Remuneration  
principle  Component
Remuneration links to 
business strategy and 
long‑term investor 
interests
• Both short and long‑term rewards are linked to performance and Company strategy to maximise 
long‑term shareholder value.
• The Policy provides an appropriate balance between fixed remuneration, short‑term bonus and 
long‑term incentives.
• Executives are encouraged to build and maintain a targeted shareholding as this represents the best way 
to align their interests with those of shareholders.
Fair reward to 
individuals for 
successful contribution 
made to the business
• The annual bonus targets are split between Company financial performance and personal objectives 
which align with key business objectives in a given year.
• Long‑term incentives are targeted against metrics which align with shareholder interests.
• Environmental, safety, sustainability, social and governance issues are taken into account.
Performance targets 
are appropriate and 
sufficiently demanding
• Performance conditions for the variable elements of executive pay are set independently by the 
Committee at the outset of each year and assessed by the Committee, both quantitatively and 
qualitatively, at the end of each performance period.
The personal objectives 
reward in annual 
bonus plans for senior 
executives are specific 
and are reviewed by 
the Committee to 
ensure they adequately 
reflect the business 
objectives of the Group 
and are only paid on 
measurable success.
• Whilst the Committee does not consult with employees specifically on its policy for Executive Director 
remuneration, general pay and employment conditions across the Group (including salary increases and 
benefits) are taken into account when setting executive remuneration. The Committee is kept informed 
of such matters via regular interaction with the Group’s HR function.
• The Committee consults with the Chief Executive Officer and pays due regard to his recommendations 
for other senior executives. Individual Directors are not involved in decisions concerning their own 
remuneration.
• The Committee is committed to keeping its Policy under regular review, taking into account changes 
in the competitive environment, remuneration practices and guidelines set by the key institutional 
shareholder bodies. The Committee has and will continue to take into account the views and 
feedback of its major shareholders to ensure the Remuneration Policy reflects as far as practicable 
prevailing sentiment. 51 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Future Policy table
The following table summarises the main elements of our Remuneration Policy for Directors.
Element: Executive Director base salary
Purpose and link  
to strategy
• To ensure the Group is able to recruit and retain high‑calibre executives.
Operation • Salaries are set by the Committee taking into account individual experience, performance, skills and 
responsibilities, prevailing market conditions (by reference to companies of a similar size and complexity 
and other companies in the same industry) and internal relativities.
• Salaries are paid monthly in arrears by bank transfer and are normally reviewed annually with any 
changes effective from January.
Maximum • Details of current salaries of the Executive Directors are detailed on page 57. 
• Salaries are reviewed annually and may be increased each year. Increases will generally be in line with 
those awarded to the Group’s workforce, as well as reflective of the overall financial performance of  
the Group.
• Increases beyond this may be awarded in limited circumstances, such as where there is a change in 
responsibility, experience or a significant change in the scale of the role and/or size, value and/or 
complexity of the Group.
Performance measures —
Change from 2014

continued
Element: annual bonus
Purpose and link  
to strategy
• The purpose of the annual bonus is to incentivise delivery of the Group’s financial and non‑financial 
objectives and to ensure that Executive Directors and senior executives are fairly rewarded for their 
contribution to the success of the Group.
Operation • Performance conditions are set independently by the Committee at the start of each year.
• Performance criteria include the financial targets of the Group as agreed by the Board and specific 
annual targets based on clear and measurable objectives that underpin, and are key to achievement of 
the Group’s strategy.
• Personal objectives are reviewed by the Committee to ensure they contribute to the strategic aims of 
the Group.
• To further align the interests of Directors with shareholders, a portion of the bonus is paid in deferred 
shares. Shares awarded under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DBP) vest after three years and 
are normally only payable if the Director remains employed by the Group at the end of that period. 
The deferred shares awarded are held by an Employee Benefit Trust until vesting.
• A ‘dividend equivalent’ provision is also available on the DBP shares at the discretion of the Committee 
enabling dividend or dividend equivalent payments to be paid, in cash or shares, on any shares that vest.
• Both the cash and deferred share elements of the annual bonus are subject to clawback in the event 
of a material misstatement of the financial results, serious misconduct by a participant or other 
defined reasons.
Maximum • 100% of base salary.
Performance measures • A bonus of 80% of salary is based against a sliding scale of challenging and stretching financial 
performance targets, of which the first 50% of salary is payable in cash and the remaining 30% of salary 
in deferred shares under the DBP. A bonus of up to 20% of salary, which is payable in cash, is based on 
the achievement of specific and measurable personal targets. Irrespective of achievement against the 
personal targets, no bonus is payable unless a minimum level of financial performance is achieved.
• The Committee retains the ability in exceptional circumstances to adjust the targets and/or set different 
measures and alter weightings for the annual bonus if events occur, such as a material divestment of a 
Group business, which cause it to determine they are no longer appropriate and a change is required to 
ensure that they achieve their original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Change from 2014 
Remuneration Policy
• No change.
Element: LTIP
Purpose and link  
to strategy
• The objectives of the LTIP are to align the long‑term interests of shareholders and management and 
reward achievement of long‑term, stretching targets.
• Awards are made to Executive Directors and to senior executives who have a significant influence over 
the Group’s ability to meet its strategic objectives. Whilst it is not a requirement of the LTIP, senior 
executives are encouraged to use the scheme to increase their share ownership in the Company.
Operation • Annual awards are granted, subject to individual performance and Committee discretion. The awards 
vest after three years subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of challenging performance 
conditions. A two‑ year post‑ vesting holding period applies to all shares (less any required to be sold to 
cover withholding tax) that vest.
• LTIP awards are subject to clawback in the event of a material misstatement of the financial results, 
serious misconduct by a participant or other defined reasons.
• A ‘dividend equivalent’ provision is also available at the discretion of the Committee enabling dividend 
equivalent payments to be paid, in cash or shares, on any shares that vest under the LTIP.
• The Committee will operate the LTIP according to its respective rules and in accordance with the Listing 
Rules and HMRC rules, where relevant.  53 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Element: LTIP continued
Operation

• The Committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice in regard to the operation and 
administration of the LTIP, including the option to provide different types of awards; settling any vesting 
awards in cash; when dealing with a change of control (e.g. the timing of testing performance conditions) 
or restructuring of the Group; determination of a good/bad leaver based on the rules of each plan and 
the appropriate treatment chosen; and adjustments in certain circumstances, such as rights issues, 
corporate restructuring, events and special dividends.
Maximum • 125% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 110% of salary for the Chief Finance Officer in any 
financial year. The Committee reviews the quantum of awards annually to ensure they are in line with 
market levels and appropriate given the performance of the individual and the Company.
• Actual award levels to Executive Directors are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Performance measures • Vesting of awards would normally be based on:
• the Company’s Total Shareholder Return performance measured over no less than three years against 
a peer group of companies selected by the Committee as at the start of the performance period; and
• key financial measures of performance (such as but not limited to, Earnings Per Share) selected by 
the Committee over a period of no less than three financial years.
• Targets are set by the Committee for each award on a sliding scale basis. No more than 25% of awards 
will vest for threshold performance, with full vesting taking place for equalling or exceeding maximum 
performance conditions. 
• Different performance measures and/or weightings may be used for future awards to help drive the 
strategy of the business.
• EPS is a measure of the Company’s overall financial success and TSR provides an external assessment 
of the Company’s performance against comparable companies on the Stock Exchange. It also aligns the 
rewards received by executives with the returns received by shareholders.
• Details of the performance conditions applied to awards granted in the year under review and for the 
awards to be granted in the forthcoming year are set out on pages 59 and 57 respectively.
• The Committee retains the ability in exceptional circumstances to adjust the targets and/or set different 
measures and alter weightings for the LTIP if events occur, such as a material divestment of a Group 
business, which cause it to determine they are no longer appropriate and a change is required to ensure 
that they achieve their original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Change from 2014 
Remuneration Policy
• Maximum annual awards limit has increased from 100% of salary to 125% of salary for the CEO and 110% 
for the CFO.
• The Committee’s flexibility to increase the annual limit up to 150% of salary in relevant circumstances 
has been removed.
• Introduction of a two‑year holding period post vesting for awards granted from September 2017 onwards.
Element: Non‑Executive Director fees
Purpose and link  
to strategy
• To ensure the Group is able to attract and retain experienced and skilled Non‑Executive Directors able to 
advise and assist with establishing and monitoring the strategic objectives of the Company.
Operation • The remuneration of the Chairman and the Non‑Executive Directors is payable in cash fees. They are 
not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive schemes. Their services do not qualify for pension 
or other benefits. Fees are paid monthly and reasonable expenses are reimbursed where appropriate. 
Tax may be reimbursed if these expenses are determined to be a taxable benefit.
• Fee levels are determined by the full Board with reference to those paid by other companies of similar 
size and complexity, and to reflect the amount of time they are expected to devote to the Group’s 
activities during the year. A supplementary fee is also paid to Committee Chairs and to the Senior 
Independent Director to reflect their additional responsibilities.
Maximum • Details of the current fees for the Chairman and Non‑Executive Directors are set out on page 57. 
Under the Company’s current Articles of Association, the aggregate annual sum for Non‑Executive 
Director fees cannot exceed £400,000 p.a. The Company does not intend to seek shareholder 
approval for any increase to this maximum in the short to medium term.
Performance measures • No element of the Chairman’s or Non‑Executive Directors’ fees is performance related.

Element: share ownership guidelines
Purpose and link  
to strategy
• Both the Executive and Non‑Executive Directors and other senior executives are encouraged to build and 
maintain a shareholding in the Company as this represents the best way to align their interests with those 
of shareholders. Levels are set in relation to earnings and according to the post held in the Company.
Operation • The expectation is that executives will build up to these levels over a period of time, through retaining 
shares received under the Company’s incentive arrangements and/or purchased in their own right.
• The Executive Directors are also required to maintain a shareholding worth up to 100% of their salary for 
a minimum of twelve months after cessation of employment.
Maximum • There is no maximum; however target levels are set at 200% of salary for Executive Directors, 33% of 
annual fees for Non‑Executive Directors and 50% of salary for other senior executives.

• Executive Director shareholding target levels increased from 150% to 200% of salary.
• Introduction of requirement of Executive Directors to maintain shareholding of 100% of salary for the 
twelve months post‑cessation of employment.
Element: recruitment remuneration
Purpose and link  
to strategy
• To ensure the Group is able to recruit and retain high‑calibre Executive and Non‑Executive Directors.
Operation • New Director remuneration arrangements will be based upon and within the limits of the various 
elements as set out on pages 51 and 53. 
In addition:
• Executive Director buy‑out payments may be made in exceptional circumstances; typically when these 
are considered to be in the best interests of the Company to facilitate the buy‑out of value forfeited on 
joining the Company. These payments would typically be in the form of an enhanced LTIP award under 
the rules and maximums permitted under the Company’s LTIP rules at that time or, if required, using 
Listing Rule 9.4.2. Such payment would take account of remuneration being relinquished, including the 
nature and time horizons attached to such remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions. 
In exceptional circumstances, payments could be made in the form of a cash payment or Restricted 
Share Award. When in the form of a cash payment, this would normally be subject to clawback in certain 
situations, in line with other elements under the Company’s Remuneration Policy. Shareholders will be 
informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
• Relocation packages, generally consisting of out‑of‑pocket expenses, together with any additional costs 
solely attributable to the relocation may be offered in situations deemed essential in order to carry out 
the relevant role successfully. Any package will be designed to ensure the new recruit becomes effective 
in their role as soon as possible, with minimal distractions from any relocation.
• In respect of internal promotions, any remuneration commitments made before such promotion (whether 
or not they would fall within the principles of the Company’s current Remuneration Policy) may form 
part of that Director’s remuneration package, with the expectation that any such commitments would be 
phased out over time.
Maximum • It is intended that the value of any element of normal remuneration will generally be on the same basis 
as the existing Directors (pro‑rated where appropriate dependent on time of joining the Company) 
and elements such as buy‑out payments being no higher than the expected value of the forfeited 
arrangements.

Element: Executive Director compensation on loss of office
Purpose and link  
to strategy
On termination of an Executive Director’s service contract, the Committee will seek to provide the minimum 
compensation applicable to the individual’s employment contract.
Operation • Executive Director service contracts will stipulate the Company’s compensation commitments to be 
honoured in an early termination event. Any commitments will be within the principles of the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy.
• Directors’ service contracts confirm that the Company may terminate the contract with immediate effect 
by making a payment equal to base salary for any unexpired period of notice. The Company also has 
the option to pay notice month by month that would reduce or cease if the departing Director obtained 
other employment.
• There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for additional 
compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy 
or otherwise) that may occur in the event of a takeover bid. It is also the Company’s policy not to 
include liquidated damages clauses in service contracts, unless there is a clear explainable benefit for 
the Company in doing so. None of the Executive Director service contracts contain any such liquidated 
damages provision.
• Statutory redundancy payments will be made as appropriate.
• Costs attributable to outplacement and/or legal fees associated with the termination of an Executive 
Director’s service contract (including the settlement of any claims brought against the Company, such as 
under unfair dismissal) may be paid by the Company where appropriate.
• In circumstances in which a leaving Director may be entitled to pursue a legal claim, the Company may 
negotiate settlement terms if it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company and, with the 
approval of the Committee on the remuneration elements therein, enter into a settlement agreement.
Maximum • Any compensation arrangements will not be beyond those stipulated in the Directors’ service contracts 
and will normally be limited to base salary, benefit and pension elements. Dependent upon the 
circumstances (and subject to the Committee’s discretion) as shown below, a Director’s performance 
related remuneration elements may also be included.
Normal exit
(termination for reasons 
of resignation or 
dismissal).
Good leaver
(termination for reasons of 
death, ill health, retirement, 
redundancy, or at the discretion 
of the Committee).
Change of control
(excludes a reorganisation or 
reconstruction where ownership does not 
materially change).
Annual bonus No entitlement for year 
of exit. Payments in 
earlier years may be 
subject to clawback in 
certain circumstances.
Pro‑rated (based upon timing 
and performance) for year 
of exit. Any DBP awards (at 
Committee discretion) vest at 
either normal vesting date or on 
cessation of employment.
Extent to which performance requirements 
are satisfied in year determines level of 
annual bonus. Any unvested DBP awards 
will vest on date of the relevant event.
LTIP Unvested awards lapse. 
Vested awards may be 
subject to clawback in 
certain circumstances.
Unvested awards pro‑rated 
based upon rules of LTIP plan 
(at Committee discretion) and 
vest on either normal vesting 
date or cessation of employment.
Unvested awards are pro‑rated based upon 
rules of LTIP plan (at Committee discretion) 
and vest on the date of the relevant event.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Application of the Remuneration Policy for the 2017/18 financial year
The table below sets out how the Remuneration Policy being put to shareholders at the forthcoming 2017 AGM will 
be applied for the 2017/18 financial year.
Element Application of policy for 2017 /18 Explanation
Executive Director 
base salary
The base salary for Rik De Vos, Chief Executive 
Officer, increased to £460,000 (2016/17: £400,000; 
15% increase). 
The base salary for Chris Smith, Chief Finance 
Officer increased to £294,000 (2016/17: £250,000; 
17.6% increase).
The salaries of all employees are subject to an 
annual review in January 2017. Neither Executive 
has had a salary increase since joining McBride, 
despite their and the Group’s strong performance. 
The Committee believes that both Executives are 
fundamental to McBride’s continuing development 
and future growth. The salary increases proposed 
would bring them to market competitive levels. 
The majority of shareholders, when consulted, 
were supportive of the increases. It is not expected 
that there will be any further material increase 
to their salaries during the life of the proposed 
Remuneration Policy being put to shareholders.
Benefits and pension Both the Executive Directors will continue to receive 
the Company’s standard benefits package. 
Both Rik De Vos and Chris Smith receive a cash sum 
in lieu of a pension contribution at 20% of annual 
base salary.
The current benefits are considered to be 
appropriate.
Annual bonus The structure and operation of the annual bonus 
scheme will continue in line with the previous 
financial year. The maximum bonus opportunity 
for the Executive Directors continues to be 100% 
of salary: 80% of the award will be subject to a 
sliding scale of challenging operating profit targets 
and 20% will be subject to specific measurable 
personal targets.
The Committee considers that the forward‑looking 
targets are commercially sensitive and has, 
therefore, chosen not to disclose them in advance. 
Details of the targets will be set out retrospectively 
in next year’s Remuneration report. However, the 
targets are considered to be demanding in the 
context of the Company’s circumstances.
LTIP The LTIP awards to be granted in 2017/18 will 
continue to be subject to EPS and relative TSR 
performance conditions. The intended Executive 
Director grant level for the LTIP is 125% of salary for 
the Chief Executive Officer and 110% of salary for 
the Chief Finance Officer.
The TSR schedule and comparator group is based 
upon the FTSE SmallCap Ex. Investment Companies 
Index with 25% of this element of the award vesting 
for median performance; with full vesting for upper 
quartile performance. EPS targets continue to align 
to the Company’s three‑year business targets and 
our plans for EPS growth. Awards subject to the 
EPS condition will lapse unless the Company’s EPS 
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) (adjusted 
to exclude the effects of amortisation of intangible 
assets and exceptional items) is at least 8%, at which 
level 20% of this element will vest. For performance 
above this level, awards will vest on a rising scale, 
with full vesting only if EPS CAGR reaches 17%.
TSR provides an external assessment of the 
Company’s performance against its competitors. 
It also aligns the rewards received by executives 
with the returns received by shareholders.
The EPS performance measure has been selected 
as it is one of the KPIs used in the business 
and is a measure well understood by the senior 
executives. It is also something which they can 
influence directly. 
Non‑Executive 
Director fees
The fee policy for the Chairman and Non‑Executive 
Directors is as follows: 
• base Chairman fee: £150,000 (no change);
• base Non‑Executive Director fee: £45,000  
(2016/17: £40,000);
• Chair of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees: £7,000 (additional fee) 
(2016/17: £4,000); and
• Senior Independent Director: £7,000 
(additional fee) (2016/17: £4,000).
Non‑Executive Director fees were reviewed in 
June 2017, the previous review of fees being 
July 2009. 58 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

ended on 30 June 2017), using the three‑month average share price to 30 June 2017.
Pension (audited)
The Company agreed with Rik De Vos to pay his contractual pension entitlement (equivalent to 20% of annual base 
salary) of which 16% was a contribution to a defined contribution pension scheme and 84% as a cash sum in lieu 
of a pension contribution. For the latter cash contribution, Rik De Vos has confirmed in writing that this payment 
relieves the Company of any liability for pension provision for this proportion on his behalf. In 2016/17 Rik De Vos 
received £13,332 Company contributions into a defined contribution pension scheme as well as £72,668 cash sum 
in lieu of pension contribution. 
In accordance with his service contract, the Company paid Chris Smith a cash sum in lieu of a pension contribution 
at 20% of annual base salary. Chris Smith has a contracted agreement that this payment relieves the Company of 
any liability for pension provision on his behalf.
Annual bonus (audited)
For the 2016/17 financial year, the maximum bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors was 100% of salary. 80% 
of bonus was based upon financial performance and 20% for performance against demanding specific measurable 
personal targets.

(1) Awards were granted on the basis of 100% of salary. The face value of the awards are Rik De Vos: £400,000 and Chris Smith: £250,000. Threshold 
vesting under the TSR condition would be 25% of that part of the award (12.5% of the total award). Threshold vesting under the EPS condition 
would be 20% of that part of the award (10% of the total award).
(2) The LTIP awards granted on 19 February 2015 are based on performance over the 3 years to 30 June 2017. The Committee reviewed the related 
performance conditions (as detailed in the tables below) and determined that the Company had achieved upper quartile performance in relation to 
the TSR element and 35.2% p.a. growth in relation to the EPS element giving a total vesting of 100%. These shares will vest on the third anniversary 
of the date of grant, being 20 February 2018.
The performance conditions attaching to awards under the LTIP are:
a. 50% of the awards are subject to a TSR performance condition measured against the FTSE SmallCap Ex. 
Investment Companies Index as the comparator group. If the Company’s TSR performance is lower than the 
median of the comparator group, awards subject to the TSR condition will lapse. 
The TSR measure is based upon the average of three months’ share prices immediately preceding the relevant 
performance date and is independently calculated for the Committee.

income statement on page 72 and a discussion of the 
Group’s financial performance and progress are set out

Payments to shareholders
The Company intends that, for the foreseeable future, 
all payments to shareholders will be made by the 
issue of non‑cumulative redeemable preference shares 
(‘B Shares’). 
Subject to shareholder approval to renew the B Share 
scheme at the AGM, the Board is recommending the 
allotment of 29 B Shares (equivalent to 2.9 pence) per 
ordinary share held (2016: 2.4p), giving a total allotment 
for the year of 43 B Shares (equivalent to 4.3 pence) per 
ordinary share (2016: 3.6p). Further details of payments 
to shareholders are shown in note 12 to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 90.
Directors and their interests
The Directors who held office during the year were 
John Coleman, Rik De Vos, Chris Smith, Steve Hannam, 
Neil Harrington and Sandra Turner. Their biographical 
details appear on page 36 and 37.
Information on the Directors’ remuneration and service 
contracts is given in the Remuneration report on pages 
48 to 62.
The beneficial interests of the Directors in the share 
capital of the Company are shown in the Remuneration 
report on page 60.
In line with the Companies Act 2006 and the Company’s 
Articles of Association the Company has a strict process 
in place to manage conflicts of interest. A Director who 
becomes aware that they or their connected persons 
have an interest in an existing or proposed transaction 
with the Company is required to declare that interest at 
a meeting of the Board. Such disclosures are recorded 
and compliance reviewed at each meeting. Under the 
power granted by the Company’s Articles, the Board is 
authorised to approve such conflicts where appropriate.
Directors and their powers
The Articles give power to the Board to appoint 
Directors, but also require Directors to retire and submit 
themselves for election at the first AGM following 
their appointment. Specific information regarding the 
re‑election of Directors is contained in the Corporate 
governance section on page 40.
The Articles place a general prohibition on a Director 
voting in respect of any contract or arrangement in 
which they have a material interest other than by virtue 
of their interest in shares in the Company. 
The Board may exercise all the powers of the Company 
subject to the provisions of relevant statutes and the 
Articles. A copy of the Articles is available from the 
Group’s website at www.mcbride.co.uk.
Indemnification of Directors
The Company has granted an indemnity to the Directors 
in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office. 
In respect of those liabilities for which Directors may not 
be indemnified, the Company maintained a directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance policy throughout 
the period. 
Although their defence costs may be met, neither the 
Company’s indemnity nor the insurance policy provides 
cover in the event that the Director is proved to have 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company is 
also permitted to advance costs to Directors for their 
defence in investigations or legal actions.
Related party transactions
Except for Directors’ service contracts, the Company 
did not have any material transactions or transactions 
of an unusual nature with, and did not make loans to, 
related parties in the periods in which any Director, is 
or was, materially interested.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital are shown in 
note 26 to the consolidated financial statements on 
pages 106 and 107.
The ordinary shares of the Company carry equal 
rights to dividends, voting and return of capital on the 
winding up of the Company. There are no restrictions 
on the transfer of securities in the Company (other than 
following service of a notice under section 793 of the 
Act) and there are no restrictions on any voting rights 
or deadlines, other than those prescribed by law, nor 
is the Company aware of any arrangements between 
holders of its shares which may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights.  64 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Other statutory information
continued
Share capital continued
Participants in employee share schemes have no voting 
or other rights in respect of the shares subject to those 
awards until the allocations are exercised, at which time 
the shares rank pari passu in all respects with shares 
already in issue. No such schemes have any rights with 
regard to control of the Company.
The holders of B Shares have equal rights to a 
preferential dividend and return of capital on the 
winding up of the Company, and are entitled to redeem 
such B Shares if the Directors believe it is appropriate. 
They are not entitled to attend, speak or vote at general 
meetings, except on a resolution relating to the winding 
up of the Company. The B Shares are not admitted to 
the Official List nor are they traded on the London Stock 
Exchange or any other recognised trading exchange.
Share repurchases
At the 2016 AGM, shareholder approval was granted 
to allow the Company to repurchase up to 18,221,000 
ordinary shares. The existing authority will expire on 
the date of the 2017 AGM, when the Directors will be 
seeking authority from shareholders to buy back shares 
which will be cancelled or may be held as treasury 
shares for the purpose of meeting obligations under 
LTIP and employee share schemes.
At the beginning of the financial year, the Company held 
630,992 ordinary shares as treasury shares and during 
the financial year no ordinary shares were repurchased. 
At the end of the year, 630,992 shares were held as 
treasury shares.
Substantial shareholdings
The Company had been notified of the following 
interests amounting to 3% or more of its issued share 
capital as at the end of the financial year and at 
25 August 2017 (being the last practical date prior 
to the date of this report).
Significant agreements/takeovers directive
There are a number of agreements that take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Group 
such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements 
and employee share schemes. Other than bank loan 
agreements, none of these are deemed to be significant 
in terms of their potential impact on the business of the 
Group as a whole in the event of a change of control.
Employees
The Group employed an average of 4,100 people during 
the year ended 30 June 2017. 
We are committed to involving employees and we 
consider that good communication at, and across all 
levels of the business helps to achieve this. All sites have 
regular briefings which are designed to keep colleagues 
informed of, amongst other things, the financial 
and economic factors that affect the Company’s 
performance and the Chief Executive Officer publishes 
regular announcements which update employees of 
progress against key priorities and projects.
We are keen to engage our employees by providing an 
open environment where they can contribute their own 
ideas and challenge those of others. Employees are 
encouraged to embrace teamwork and align personal 
development with the strategy of the business. Eligible 
employees participate in performance‑related bonus 
schemes and some senior management participate in 
an LTIP.
The Board recognises the importance of developing 
internal talent across its global workforce. It is our 
policy to ensure equal opportunity for all employees 
and we have an equal opportunities and diversity policy 
in place which is monitored through the HR function. 
It is a key objective to ensure that successful candidates 
for appointment and promotion are selected taking 
account of individual ability, skills and competencies 
without regard to age, gender, race, religion, disability 
or sexual orientation.

Statement of Directors’  
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union 
and parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101, ‘Reduced disclosure framework’, 
and applicable law). Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group and parent Company for 
that period. In preparing the financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed for the Group 
financial statements and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been followed 
for the Company financial statements, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and parent Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Group and parent Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and parent Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and parent Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the parent Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group and parent 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are 
listed in corporate governance report confirm that, to 
the best of their knowledge:
• the parent Company financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, 
‘Reduced disclosure framework’, and applicable law), 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Company;
• the Group financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by 
the European Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and
• the Executive review includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group and parent Company, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces. 
In the case of each Director in office at the date the 
Directors’ report is approved:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Group and parent 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Group and parent Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information. 67 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Report on the audit of the group financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, McBride plc’s group financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s 
affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of its profit and cash flows 
for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within 
the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 (the “Annual 
Report”), which comprise: 
• Consolidated income statement for the year ended 
30 June 2017, 
• Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 
the year ended 30 June 2017, 
• Consolidated balance sheet at 30 June 2017, 
• Consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended 
30 June 2017, 
• Reconciliation of net cash flow to movement in net debt 
for the year ended 30 June 2017, 
• Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year 
ended 30 June 2017; and 
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the 
Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable 
law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further 
described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements section of our report. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applicable to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that 
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the group.
Other than those disclosed in the Directors’ Report, we 
have provided no non-audit services to the group in the 
period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall group materiality £3 million (2016: £3 million). 
• The above is based on circa 0.5% of total revenues.
• We conducted our audit work in three key locations: 
UK, France and Belgium, which covered elements across 
the UK, France, Belgium and Germany.
• The territories where we conducted audit work, together 
with audit work performed at shared service centres and 
Group level, accounted for 75% of the group’s revenue.
• Fraud in revenue recognition (including trade allowances 
and discounts).
• Refinancing.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where 
the directors made subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that 
are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal 
controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the current period 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identified by our audit.  69 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Fraud in revenue recognition  
(including trade allowances and discounts)
ISAs (UK) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition because of the pressure management may 
feel to achieve the planned results.
In the consumer products industry, rebate agreements with 
customers (typically retailers) are common. We identified this 
as an area where possible fraud in revenue recognition could 
occur, particularly in relation to the accruals at the year-end 
which had not been settled in cash. Whilst rebates are 
relatively small in the context of McBride’s revenue, they are 
inherently complex, non-standardised and require judgement 
to interpret contractual arrangements.
We agreed rebates recognised to supporting evidence, 
agreements and underlying data to check they were 
appropriately calculated and accounted for. We focused on 
the period in which the rebate was recorded and in particular 
the appropriateness of the accrual at the year end.
We also wrote to a sample of customers to confirm the rebate 
payable as at the balance sheet date, as well as assessing the 
utilisation of the opening accrual along with any releases to 
the profit and loss account in the year.
Furthermore we used computer assisted auditing techniques 
in order to test revenue and tested a selection of journals 
which impacted revenue. 
No significant issues were identified from this audit work.
Refinancing
The group undertook a significant refinancing exercise in 
the year, resulting in the settlement of $90m of private 
debt and associated hedges, as well as the refinancing of 
a revolving credit facility. This resulted in an exceptional 
item within financing costs. We identified this is a particular 
risk due to the magnitude of the exceptional item, required 
accounting and presentation in accordance with IAS 39, 
along with the complexity due to the debt forming part 
of the Group-wide hedging strategy and settlement of 
derivative financial instruments.
We have reviewed agreements in relation to both the old 
and new revolving facilities in order to ensure that they 
have been accounted for correctly and within the terms of 
the agreement.
Transactions in relation to the refinancing have been traced 
through the financial statements, including those in relation to 
derivatives, with the support of Treasury specialists in order to 
ensure that they have been appropriately accounted for in line 
with the requirements of IAS39.
No significant issues were identified from this audit work. 
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we 
performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on 
the financial statements as a whole, taking into account 
the structure of the group, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which it operates.
The Group is a European provider of private label 
household and personal care products. It has production 
capability in 10 countries plus a sales office in Australia.
The Group is structured in three segments – household, 
personal care and corporate. The Group financial 
statements are a consolidation of all reporting units within 
these segments comprising the Group’s operating business 
and centralised functions. In establishing the overall 
approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of 
work that needed to be performed at the reporting units 
by us, as the Group engagement team, or component 
auditors operating under our instruction. Where the work 
was performed by component auditors, we determined the 
level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work 
at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as 
a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as 
a whole.
We conducted our audit work in three key locations: UK, 
France and Belgium, which covered elements across the 
UK, France, Belgium and Germany. We performed specific 
audit work over accounts receivable in Italy.
The territories where we conducted audit work, together 
with audit work performed at shared service centre 
and Group level, accounted for 75% of total revenues as 
disclosed within the consolidated income statement.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application 
of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the 
individual financial statement line items and disclosures and 
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole 
as follows:
Overall group materiality £3 million (2016: £3 million).
How we determined it Circa 0.5% of total revenues as 
disclosed within the consolidated income statement.
Rationale for benchmark applied Consistent with last year, 
we applied this benchmark as we believe that revenue is the 
most relevant measure of recurring performance.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we 
allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across 
components was between £1.5 million and £2.7 million.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
£0.15 million (2016: £0.15 million) as well as misstatements 
below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting 
for qualitative reasons. 70 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything 
material to add or draw attention to in respect of the 
directors’ statement in the financial statements about 
whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements and the directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date 
of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement 
relating to Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information 
in the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 other than the 
financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material 
inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required 
to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a 
material misstatement of the financial statements or a 
material misstatement of the other information. If, based 
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered 
whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our 
work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies 
Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report 
certain opinions and matters as described below (required 
by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 
is consistent with the financial statements and has 
been prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group 
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
Corporate Governance Statement
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate 
Governance Statement (page 34 to 66) about internal 
controls and risk management systems in relation to 
financial reporting processes in compliance with rules 
7.2.5 and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules sourcebook of the FCA (“DTR”) is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group 
and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in this 
information. (CA06)
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate 
Governance Statement (page 34 to 66) with respect to 
the parent company’s corporate governance code and 
practices and about its administrative, management and 
supervisory bodies and their committees complies with 
rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the DTR. (CA06)
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility 
to report if a corporate governance statement has not been 
prepared by the parent company. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the 
group and of the principal risks that would threaten 
the solvency or liquidity of the group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention 
to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 26 of the Annual 
Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe 
those risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated. 71 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report
• The directors’ explanation on page 28 of the Annual 
Report as to how they have assessed the prospects 
of the group, over what period they have done so and 
why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review 
of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group 
and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of 
the group. Our review was substantially less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries 
and considering the directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in 
alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether 
the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the group its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility 
to report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 66, that 
they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to 
be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for the members to assess the 
group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
of the group obtained in the course of performing 
our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 44 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to 
the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the parent 
company’s compliance with the Code does not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the 
Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by 
the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements  
and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the  
financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 66, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
in accordance with the applicable framework and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
directors are also responsible for such internal control as 
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate 
the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the  
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the parent company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2017
1. Basis of preparation
Description of business
McBride plc (‘the Company’) is a company incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Company’s 
ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The registered office of the Company is Middleton Way, 
Middleton, Manchester M24 4DP. 
The Company and its subsidiaries (together, ‘the Group’) 
is Europe’s leading provider of Private Label, Household 
and Personal Care products. The Company develops and 
manufactures products for the majority of retailers and 
major brand owners throughout the UK, Europe and Asia.
Segmental reporting
Financial information is presented to the Board by product 
category for the purposes of allocating resources within 
the Group and assessing the performance of the Group’s 
businesses. It is considered that Household products 
have different market characteristics to Personal Care & 
Aerosols in terms of volumes, market share and production 
requirements. Accordingly, the Group’s operating segments 
are determined by product category.
The Board uses adjusted operating profit to measure 
the profitability of the Group’s businesses. Adjusted 
operating profit is, therefore, the measure of segment profit 
presented in the Group’s segment disclosures. Adjusted 
operating profit represents operating profit before specific 
items that are considered to hinder comparison of the 
trading performance of the Group’s businesses either 
period-on-period or with other businesses. During the 
periods under review, the items excluded from operating 
profit in arriving at adjusted operating profit were the 
amortisation of intangibles assets and exceptional items.
Segment information is presented in note 4.
Accounting period
The Group’s annual financial statements are drawn up to 
30 June. These financial statements cover the year ended 
30 June 2017 (‘2017’) with comparative amounts for the 
year ended 30 June 2016 (‘2016’).
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements on pages 72 to 108 
have been prepared on the going concern basis in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union, 
IFRS Interpretations Committee and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention, modified 
in respect of the revaluation to fair value of contingent 
consideration, financial assets and liabilities (derivative 
financial instruments) at fair value through profit or loss 
and assets held for sale.
The Group’s principal accounting policies are set out in 
note 2.
Going concern
For the reasons set out on page 28, the Directors have 
adopted the going concern basis in preparing the Company 
and the Group financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
(i) Background
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors 
are required to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of its assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from those 
estimates and affect the Group’s results in future years. 
The Directors consider the following to be the key 
accounting judgements and estimates made in preparing 
these financial statements that, if not borne out in practice, 
may affect the Group’s results during the next financial year.
(ii) Revenue
Revenue is stated after deduction of rebates and discounts 
given or expected to be given, which vary according to 
contractual arrangements with individual customers. 
Accrual is made at the time of sale for the estimated 
rebates or discounts payable, based on, amongst other 
things, expected sales to the customer during the period to 
which the rebate or discount relates, historical experience 
and market information. 
The type of rebates and discounts given by the 
Group include:
• volume related rebates for achieving sales targets within 
a set period; and
• promotional, marketing and other allowances to support 
specific promotional pricing discounts, in-store displays 
and cost reimbursement.
At 30 June 2017, the carrying amount of accruals relating 
to rebates and discounts amounted to £4.4 million 
(2016: £4.7m). Rebates equate to less than 2% of revenue. 
There is an element of judgement applied to the level of 
future achieved sales within volume-related rebates.
(iii) Impairment of long-lived assets
Impairment testing requires management to estimate 
the recoverable amount of an asset or group of assets. 
Recoverable amount represents the higher of value in use 
and fair value less costs to sell.
Value in use represents the net present value of the cash 
flows expected to arise from an asset or group of assets 
and its calculation requires management to estimate those 
cash flows and to apply a suitable discount rate to them.
Cash flows are estimated by applying assumptions to 
budget sales, production costs and overheads over a 
five-year forecast period and by applying a perpetuity 
growth rate to the forecast cash flow in the fifth year.
Cash flows are discounted using a discount rate based on 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for 
risks specific to the asset or group of assets. The weighted 
average cost of capital is affected by estimates of interest 
rates, equity returns and market and country-related risks.
At 30 June 2017, the carrying amount of long-lived assets 
was £21.7 million (2016: £20.0m). If cash flow or discount 
rate assumptions were to change, further impairment losses 
may be recognised in the next financial year.
The sensitivity of the carrying amount of goodwill in 
relation to business is presented in note 13. 78 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 30 June 2017
1. Basis of preparation continued
Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued
(iv) Contingent consideration 
Contingent consideration payable in a business 
combination is generally remeasured at each balance sheet 
date and the change in its carrying amount recognised in 
profit or loss. Contingent consideration payable is typically 
dependent on performance conditions related to the 
future revenue or profitability of the acquired business. 
Considerable judgement is required in assessing the likely 
future performance of the acquired business against such 
performance conditions.
At 30 June 2017, the Group recognised contingent 
consideration payable of £2.9 million (2016: £2.3m) 
as described in note 3.
(v) Pensions and other post employment benefits
Under IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’, the cost of defined 
benefit schemes is determined based on actuarial 
valuations that are carried out annually at the balance sheet 
date. Actuarial valuations are dependent on assumptions 
about the future that are made by the Directors on 
the advice of independent qualified actuaries. If actual 
experience differs from these assumptions, there could be a 
material change in the amounts recognised by the Group in 
respect of defined benefit schemes in the next financial year.
At 30 June 2017, the present value of defined benefit 
obligations was £158.1 million (2016: £147.0m). It was 
calculated using a number of assumptions, including 
future CPI rate changes, increases to pension benefits and 
mortality rates. The present value of the benefit obligation 
is calculated by discounting the benefit obligation using 
market yields on high-quality corporate bonds at the 
balance sheet date.
At 30 June 2017, the fair value of the scheme assets was 
£115.9 million (2016: £114.1m). The scheme assets consist 
largely of securities and managed funds whose values 
are subject to fluctuation in response to changes in 
market conditions.
Changes in the actuarial assumptions underlying the 
benefit obligation, changes in the discount rate applicable 
to the benefit obligation and effects of differences 
between the expected and actual return on the scheme’s 
assets are classified as actuarial gains and losses and are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. During 2017, 
the Group recognised a net actuarial loss of £11.0 million 
(2016: £2.6m). 
An analysis of the assumptions that will be used by the 
Directors to determine the cost of the defined benefit 
scheme that will be recognised in profit or loss in the next 
financial year and the sensitivity of the benefit obligation to 
key assumptions is presented in note 23.
(vi) Provisions
Provision is made for liabilities of uncertain timing or 
amount where management considers that the Group has a 
present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that payment will be made to settle the liability and the 
payment can be measured reliably. 
At 30 June 2017, the Group held provisions amounting to 
£4.7 million (2016: £6.4m), which principally represented 
reorganisation and restructuring costs. Adjustment to the 
amounts recognised would arise if it becomes necessary 
to revise the assumptions and estimates on which the 
provisions are based, if circumstances change such that 
contingent liabilities must be recognised or if management 
becomes aware of obligations that are currently unknown. 
(vii) Taxation
The Group operates in a number of tax jurisdictions. 
The Directors are required to exercise significant judgement 
in determining the Group’s provision for income taxes.
Estimation is required of taxable profit in order to 
determine the Group’s current tax liability and judgement 
is required in situations where the Group’s tax position is 
uncertain and may be subject to review and challenge by 
the tax authorities. 
Estimation is also required of temporary differences 
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and 
their tax base. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences but, where there exist 
deductible temporary differences, judgement is required as 
to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based 
on the availability of future taxable profits. At 30 June 2017, 
the Group recognised deferred tax assets of £12.0 million 
(2016: £9.3m), including £1.9 million (2016: £2.1m) in respect 
of tax losses and tax credits. Deferred tax assets amounting 
to £3.7 million (2016: £6.0m) were not recognised in 
respect of tax losses and tax credits carried forward. It is 
possible that the deferred tax assets actually recoverable 
may differ from the amounts recognised if actual taxable 
profits differ from estimates.
At 30 June 2017, deferred tax liabilities were not recognised 
on retained profits of foreign subsidiaries because the 
Group is able to control the remittance of those profits to 
the UK and it is probable that they will not be remitted in 
the foreseeable future. Income tax may be payable on those 
profits if circumstances change and their remittance to the 
UK can no longer be controlled by the Group or they are 
actually remitted to the UK.
Use of adjusted measures
Adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per 
share exclude specific items that are considered to hinder 
comparison of the trading performance of the Group’s 
businesses either year-on-year or with other businesses and 
are used for internal performance analysis and in relation 
to employee incentive arrangements. The Directors present 
these measures in the financial statements in order to assist 
investors in their assessment of the trading performance of 
the Group. 
During the periods under review, the items excluded from 
operating profit in arriving at adjusted operating profit were 
the amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items.
Exceptional items are excluded from adjusted operating 
profit because they are not considered to be representative 
of the trading performance of the Group’s businesses 
during the period.
Adjusted earnings per share is based on the Group’s profit 
for the year adjusted for the items excluded from operating 
profit in arriving at adjusted operating profit, the unwinding 
of the discount on contingent consideration arising on 
business combinations, unwind of discount on provisions 
and the tax relating to those items.
‘Adjusted operating profit’ and ‘adjusted earnings per 
share’ are not defined under IFRS and, therefore, these 
measures as defined by the Group may not be comparable 
with similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
The Directors do not regard these measures as a substitute 
for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and 
presented in accordance with IFRS. 79 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2. Principal accounting policies
Accounting standards adopted during the year
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those 
of the annual financial statements for the year ended 
30 June 2016, except for:
• Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions 
(Amendments to IAS 19); and
• Annual Improvements Projects 2012.
All of the above changes to accounting policies had no 
financial effect on the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2017. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results, 
cash flows and assets and liabilities of the Company and 
its subsidiaries. Details of the Company’s subsidiaries at 
30 June 2017 are set out on pages 120 and 121.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or 
indirectly, by the Company where control is the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so 
as to obtain benefits from its activities. Control generally 
exists where the Group owns a shareholding that gives it 
more than one half of the voting rights in the entity.
A non-controlling interest in a subsidiary represents 
the share of the net assets of the subsidiary that are 
attributable to the equity interests in the subsidiary that 
are not owned by the Group. Non-controlling interests are 
presented in the balance sheet within equity, separately 
from equity attributable to owners of the Company. 
In situations where the Group is contractually committed 
to purchase those equity shares in a subsidiary that it does 
not already own, a non-controlling interest in the subsidiary 
is recognised only to the extent that the risks and rewards 
of ownership are considered to remain with the minority 
shareholders.
The Group’s results, cash flows and assets and liabilities 
include those of each of its subsidiaries from the date 
on which the Company obtains control until such time 
as the Company loses control. Intra-Group balances 
and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses 
arising from intra-Group transactions, are eliminated on 
consolidation. Consistent accounting policies are adopted 
across the Group.
Business combinations
A business combination is a transaction or other event in 
which the Group obtains control of one or more businesses.
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. 
Goodwill arising in a business combination represents the 
excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the 
amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired 
business and, in a business combination achieved in 
stages, the fair value at the acquisition date of the Group’s 
previously held equity interest, over the net total of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business 
at the acquisition date. If the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of the acquired business exceed the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the business and the fair value at 
the acquisition date of any previously held equity interest, 
the excess is recognised as a gain in profit or loss.
Consideration transferred in a business combination 
represents the sum of the fair values at the acquisition 
date of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and 
equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for 
control over the acquired business. 
Acquisition-related costs are charged to profit or loss in the 
period in which they are incurred. 
Changes in the amount of contingent consideration payable 
that result from events after the acquisition date, such as 
meeting a revenue or profit target, are not measurement 
period adjustments and are, therefore, recognised in profit 
or loss. 
Any non-controlling interest in the acquired business is 
measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interest’s proportionate share of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities of the business.
Changes in the Group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary 
that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for 
within equity. 
If the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it derecognises 
the assets and liabilities and related equity components of 
the subsidiary and measures any investment retained in the 
former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control 
is lost. Any gain or loss on a loss of control is recognised in 
profit or loss.
Foreign currency translation
At entity level, transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into the entity’s functional currency at the 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Currency translation differences arising 
at entity level are recognised in profit or loss.
The Group’s presentation and functional currency 
is Sterling.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are 
translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate for 
the period and their assets and liabilities are translated 
into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Currency translation differences arising on 
consolidation are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and taken to the currency translation reserve.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss 
on disposal recognised in profit or loss is determined after 
taking into account the cumulative currency translation 
differences arising on consolidation of the operation 
subsequent to the adoption of IFRS.
In the cash flow statement, the cash flows of foreign 
operations are translated into Sterling at the average 
exchange rate for the period. 80 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 30 June 2017
2. Principal accounting policies continued
Revenue 
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the invoiced 
amount, net of sales rebates, discounts, value added tax 
and other sales taxes. 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for the sale of goods.
Revenue is recognised on the transfer of the risks and 
rewards of ownership, which generally coincides with the 
delivery of the goods to the customer. 
Accruals for sales rebates and discounts are established at 
the time of sale based on management’s best estimate of 
the amounts payable under the contractual arrangements 
with the customer.
Interest income is accrued using the effective 
interest method.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are items that are material either 
individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate and which, 
due to their nature or the infrequency of the events giving 
rise to them, are presented separately to assist users of the 
financial statements in assessing the trading performance 
of the Group’s businesses either year-on-year or with 
other businesses.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction 
of a manufacturing or distribution facility are capitalised as 
part of the cost of the facility if, at the outset of construction, 
the facility was expected to take a substantial period of 
time to get ready for its intended use.
Costs attributable to the arrangement of term borrowing 
facilities are amortised over the life of those facilities.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss 
in the period in which they are incurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as 
an intangible asset and is allocated to the cash generating 
unit (CGU) or group of CGUs that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the acquisition.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment 
annually and whenever there are events or changes in 
circumstances that indicate that its carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. 
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised 
impairment losses.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.
(i) Assets acquired in business combinations
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination 
is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from 
the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal 
rights. An acquired intangible asset with a definite useful 
life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its 
fair value at the date of acquisition to profit or loss over its 
expected useful life as follows:
Patents, brands and trade marks — up to three years 
Customer relationships — up to five years
(ii) Product development costs
All research expenditure is charged to profit or loss in the 
period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to profit or loss in 
the period in which it is incurred, unless it relates to the 
development of a new or significantly improved product 
or process whose technical and commercial feasibility is 
proven at the time of development.
(iii) Computer software
Computer software and software licences are recognised as 
intangible assets measured at cost and are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which are 
in the range three to five years. 
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part 
of the computer software product include the software 
development employee costs.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and any recognised 
impairment losses.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and 
the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not 
depreciated. Otherwise, property, plant and equipment is 
depreciated on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, 
less any residual value, to profit or loss over the expected 
useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold buildings — 50 years 
Leasehold building — length of the lease 
Plant and equipment — three to ten years
Property, plant and equipment acquired in a business 
combination is depreciated on a straight-line basis so as 
to charge its fair value at the date of acquisition, less any 
residual value, to profit or loss over the remaining expected 
useful life of the asset.
Leased assets
Leases that confer rights and obligations similar to those 
that attach to owned assets are classified as finance leases. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets 
within property, plant and equipment, initially measured 
at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the 
present value of the minimum lease payments, and a 
corresponding liability is recognised. Subsequently, the 
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the expected 
useful life of the asset or term of the lease. At inception of 
the lease, the lease payments are apportioned between 
an interest element and a capital element so as to achieve 
a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding 
liability. Thereafter, the interest element is recognised as an 
expense in profit or loss while the capital element is applied 
to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease payments, and any incentives receivable, 
are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
Goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may 
not be recoverable. Additionally, goodwill is subject to 
an annual impairment test whether or not there are any 
indicators of impairment. 81 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report
An asset is impaired to the extent that its carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the 
higher of the asset’s value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell. An asset’s value in use represents the present value 
of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the 
continued use of the asset. Fair value less costs to sell is the 
amount obtainable from the sale of the asset in an arm’s 
length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, 
less the costs of disposal.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount 
is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs. 
An asset’s CGU is the smallest group of assets that includes 
the asset and generates cash inflows that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
groups of assets. Goodwill does not generate cash flows 
independently of other assets and is, therefore, tested for 
impairment at the level of the CGU or group of CGUs to 
which it is allocated.
Value in use is based on estimates of pre-tax cash flows 
discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risks 
specific to the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Where necessary, impairment of non-financial assets other 
than goodwill is recognised before goodwill is tested for 
impairment. When goodwill is tested for impairment and 
the carrying amount of the CGU or group of CGUs to 
which it is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
impairment is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of the goodwill and then to the other non-financial assets 
belonging to the CGU or group of CGUs pro-rata on the 
basis of their respective carrying amounts.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. 
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for assets 
other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount, but only to the extent that the carrying amount 
of the asset does not exceed its carrying amount had 
no impairment been recognised in previous periods. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill 
cannot be reversed.
Assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if it is 
expected that their carrying amount will be recovered 
by sale rather than through continuing use. For this to be 
the case, the asset must be available for immediate sale 
in its current condition and the sale must be expected to 
be completed within twelve months. An extension of the 
period required to complete the sale does not preclude 
the asset from continuing to be classified as held for sale, 
provided the delay was for reasons beyond the Group’s 
control and management remains committed to its plan to 
sell the asset. 
An asset that is classified as held for sale is measured at the 
lower of its carrying amount when classified as held for sale 
and fair value less costs to sell.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value with due allowance for any excess, obsolete or 
slow-moving items. Cost represents the expenditure 
incurred in bringing each product to its present location 
and condition. The cost of raw materials is measured on a 
first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The cost of finished goods 
and work in progress comprises the cost of raw materials, 
direct labour and other direct costs, together with related 
production overheads based on normal operating capacity. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less 
estimated costs of completion and estimated selling and 
distribution costs. 
Financial instruments
(i) Trade receivables
Trade receivables represent the invoiced amount of 
sales of goods to customers for which payment has not 
been received (fair value), less an allowance for doubtful 
accounts that is estimated based on factors such as the 
period outstanding, the payment history of the customer, 
the current economic environment and other information. 
(ii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits 
available on demand and other short-term, highly liquid 
investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months 
or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are presented 
as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of 
offset with cash balances.
For cash flow purposes, cash and cash equivalents include 
bank overdrafts where right of set off exists.
(iii) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost.
(iv) Bank and other loans
Bank and other loans are initially recognised at fair value, 
net of directly attributable transaction costs, if any, and 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method. 
(v) Net debt
Net debt comprises cash and cash equivalents, overdraft, 
bank and other loans and finance lease liabilities.
(vi) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally 
forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps, to 
reduce its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate 
movements. The Group does not hold or issue derivatives 
for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets 
and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance 
sheet date. Changes in their fair values are recognised in 
profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments are, therefore, 
likely to cause volatility in profit or loss in situations 
where the hedged item is not recognised in the financial 
statements or is recognised but its carrying amount is 
not adjusted to reflect fair value changes arising from 
the hedged risk, or is so adjusted but that adjustment is 
not recognised in profit or loss. Provided the conditions 
specified by IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement’ are met, hedge accounting may be used to 
mitigate this volatility in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments are classified as current 
assets or liabilities unless they are in a designated 
hedging relationship and the hedge item is classified 
as a non-current asset or liability.
Derivative financial instruments that are not in a designated 
hedging relationship are classified as held for trading.  82 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2. Principal accounting policies continued
Financial instruments continued
(vii) Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount 
reported in the balance sheet where there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Hedge accounting
For a hedging relationship to qualify for hedge accounting, 
it must be documented on inception together with the 
Group’s risk management objective and strategy for 
initiating the hedge, and it must both be expected to be 
highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or 
fair value attributed to the hedged risk and actually be 
highly effective in doing so.
When hedge accounting is used, the hedging relationship 
is classified as a cash flow hedge, a net investment hedge 
or a fair value hedge.
(i) Cash flow hedge
Hedging relationships are classified as cash flow hedges 
where the hedging instrument hedges exposure to 
variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a 
particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability 
(such as interest payments on variable rate debt), a highly 
probable forecast transaction (such as forecast revenue) or 
a firm commitment that could affect profit or loss.
Where a hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow 
hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, the change 
in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in 
other comprehensive income rather than in profit or loss. 
When the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, 
when a forecast sale that is hedged takes place), the 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive 
income is transferred to profit or loss. When a forecast 
transaction that has been hedged results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory), the 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive 
income is transferred from equity as an adjustment to the 
cost of the asset.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a 
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time 
remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast 
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in equity is immediately transferred to the 
income statement.
(ii) Net investment hedge
A net investment hedge is the hedge of the currency 
exposure on the retranslation of the Group’s net investment 
in a foreign operation. 
Net investment hedges are accounted for similarly to cash 
flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of the hedging 
instrument are, to the extent that the hedge is effective, 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
In the event that the foreign operation is disposed of, the 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive 
income is transferred to profit or loss and included in the 
gain or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.
(iii) Fair value hedge
Hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges 
where the hedging instrument hedges the exposure to 
changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability that 
is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit 
or loss.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value 
hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability 
is adjusted by the change in its fair value attributable to 
the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised 
in profit or loss where, to the extent that the hedge is 
effective, it offsets the change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefits principally comprise pension 
benefits provided to employees in the UK and Continental 
Europe. The Group operates both defined benefit and 
defined contribution pension schemes.
(i) Defined contribution schemes
Under a defined contribution pension scheme, the Group 
makes fixed contributions to a separate pension fund. 
The amount of pension that the employee will receive 
on retirement is dependent entirely on the investment 
performance of the fund and the Group has no obligation 
with regard to the future pension values received 
by employees. 
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised 
in profit or loss in the period in which they fall due.
(ii) Defined benefit schemes
Under a defined benefit pension scheme, the amount of 
pension that an employee will receive on retirement is 
fixed based on factors such as pensionable salary, years of 
service and age on retirement. In most cases, the schemes 
are funded by contributions from the Group and the 
participating employees. The Group is obliged to make 
additional contributions if the fund has insufficient assets 
to meet its obligation to pay accrued pension benefits. 
Actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes 
are carried out annually at the balance sheet date by 
independent qualified actuaries. Scheme assets are 
measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. 
Benefit obligations are measured on an actuarial basis using 
the projected unit credit method and are discounted using 
the market yields on high-quality corporate bonds at the 
balance sheet date. The defined benefit liability or asset 
recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference 
between the present value of the benefit obligations and 
the fair value of the scheme assets. Where a scheme is in 
surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the present value 
of any amounts that the Group expects to recover by way 
of refunds or a reduction in future contributions. 
Defined benefit schemes are recognised in profit or loss 
by way of the service cost and the net interest cost on the 
benefit obligation. The service cost represents the increase 
in the present value of the benefit obligation relating to 
additional years of service accrued during the period, 
less employee contributions.
Gains or losses on curtailments or settlements are 
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the 
curtailment or settlement occurs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. 83 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report
Share-based payments
The Group operates share schemes under which it grants 
equity-settled and cash-settled awards over ordinary shares 
in the Company to certain of its employees. The Group 
recognises a compensation expense that is based on the 
fair value of the awards measured using the Black-Scholes 
option pricing formula or the Monte Carlo valuation model. 
For equity-settled awards, the fair value reflects market 
performance conditions and all non-vesting conditions. 
Fair value is determined at the grant date and is not 
subsequently remeasured unless the relevant conditions 
are modified. Adjustments are made to the compensation 
expense to reflect actual and expected forfeitures due 
to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market 
performance conditions. For cash-settled awards, the 
fair value reflects all the conditions on which the award 
is made and is remeasured at each reporting date and 
at the settlement date. 
Generally, the compensation expense is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. For 
equity-settled awards a corresponding credit is recognised 
in equity while for cash-settled awards a corresponding 
liability to settle is recognised in the balance sheet. 
In the event of the cancellation of an equity-settled award, 
whether by the Group or by a participating employee, the 
compensation expense that would have been recognised 
over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Provisions
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount 
and is generally recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that a payment will be required to settle the 
obligation and the payment can be estimated reliably. 
Provision is made for restructuring costs when a detailed 
formal plan for the restructuring has been determined 
and the plan has been communicated to the parties 
that may be affected by it. Gains from the expected 
disposal of assets are not taken into account in measuring 
restructuring provisions and provision is not made for 
future operating losses.
Provisions are discounted where the effect of the time value 
of money is material.
Taxation
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in 
respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period. Taxable 
profit differs from accounting profit because it excludes 
income or expenses that are recognised in the period for 
accounting purposes but are either not taxable or not 
deductible for tax purposes or are taxable or deductible 
in earlier or subsequent periods. Current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amount of an asset or 
liability and its tax base used in calculating taxable profit. 
Deferred tax is accounted for using the liability method, 
whereby deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for 
all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available in the foreseeable future against 
which the deductible temporary differences may be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction other than a business 
combination that affects neither accounting profit nor 
taxable profit.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising 
on investments in foreign subsidiaries, except where the 
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that it will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or 
substantively enacted tax rates that are expected to 
apply when the asset is recovered or the liability is settled. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when there 
is a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and 
management intends to settle on a net basis. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate 
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
the same taxable entity.
Current tax and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss 
unless it relates to an item that is recognised in the same 
or a different period outside profit or loss, in which case 
it too is recognised outside profit or loss, either in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Payments to shareholders
Subject to shareholder approval at each Annual General 
Meeting (AGM), it is the Company’s intention that, for 
the foreseeable future, all payments to shareholders will 
be made by the issue of non-cumulative redeemable 
preference shares (B Shares). B Shares issued but not 
redeemed are classified as current liabilities. 
Own shares
Own shares represent the Company’s ordinary shares that 
are held by the Company in treasury or by a sponsored 
ESOP trust in relation to the Group’s employee share 
schemes. When own shares are acquired, the cost of 
purchase in the market is deducted from equity. Gains or 
losses on the subsequent transfer or sale of own shares 
are also recognised in equity.
Accounting standards issued but not yet adopted
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the 
following new standards and interpretations that are not 
yet effective and will provide a fuller assessment of the 
potential impact in future years. 
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ (effective 1 January 2018, 
EU endorsed 22 November 2016);
• IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ 
(effective 1 January 2018, EU endorsed 
22 September 2016); and
• IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ (effective 1 January 2019, not yet 
endorsed by EU). 
The standards and interpretations addressed above will be 
applied for the purpose of the Group financial statements 
from the date they become effective. 84 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

4. Segment information
Background
Financial information is presented to the Board by product category for the purposes of allocating resources within the 
Group and assessing the performance of the Group’s businesses. It is considered that Household products have different 
market characteristics to Personal Care & Aerosols in terms of volumes, market share and production requirements. 
Accordingly, the Group’s operating segments are determined by product category. 
The Board uses adjusted operating profit to measure the profitability of the Group’s businesses. Adjusted operating profit 
is, therefore, the measure of segment profit presented in the Group’s segment disclosures. Adjusted operating profit 
represents operating profit before specific items that are considered by the Board to hinder comparison of the trading 
performance of the Group’s businesses either year-on-year or with other businesses. During the years under review, the 
items excluded from operating profit in arriving at adjusted operating profit were the amortisation of intangibles assets 
and exceptional items.

During the year, the Group reorganised its Poland site with significant investment and upgrades to focus on Household 
activities. The costs of this in the year were £0.9 million.
Exceptional finance charges of £13.0 million were incurred as part of the refinancing of the Group (see note 21).
Exceptional provisions were made in the prior financial years with regard to the UK restructuring project and the creation 
of a functional structure with centralised support services. Work is now complete on both projects resulting in the release 
of an unused provision of £0.2 million and a £0.1 million charge respectively.
In late June 2016, the Group’s Italian business lost a long-running legal case surrounding costs of reparation to a property 
vacated by the Group in 2011. The Group is currently following an appeal and an additional £0.2 million of costs have been 
charged in relation to this matter.
In the prior year, the following costs were charged:
• £2.2 million of costs in relation to the rationalisation of our customer base down to 25% of our previous 
customer portfolio;
• £1.2 million for the settlement of a legal case surrounding costs of reparation to a property vacated by the Group 
in 2011; 
• release of £0.3 million and £0.7 million of unused provisions relating the UK restructuring project and the creation of a 
functional structure with centralised support services; and 
• £1.7 million increase to the contingent consideration provision in relation to a prior year acquisition. This charge was 
materially offset by a reversal of the impairment charges previously made in relation to the acquisition. 86 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

10. Taxation continued
Reconciliation to UK statutory tax rate continued
Taxation is provided at current rates on the profits earned for the year. 
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas affiliates are expected to result in additional taxes, these amounts 
have been provided for. No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of timing differences associated with the 
unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these 
companies. Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and/or UK taxation (after allowing for double tax relief) 
if distributed as dividends. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries 
and associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately £1.3 million at 30 June 
2017 (2016: £4.5m).
The main rate of UK corporation tax was reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017. The Group’s effective 
UK corporation tax rate for the year was, therefore, 19.75% (2016: 20.0%).
Factors affecting future tax charges
The Finance Act 2016 which was published on 15 September 2016 includes legislation reducing the main rate of UK 
corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets
At 30 June 2017, the Group had unused tax losses of £11.9 million (2016: £13.5m) available for offset against future 
profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £4.8 million (2016: £6.0m) of these losses due to the 
unpredictability of future profit streams. The majority of these tax losses arise in tax jurisdictions where they do not expire. 
However, tax losses of £1.0 million expire between now and 2022.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the remaining surplus ACT of £2.9 million (2016: £2.9m) due to 
uncertainty as to future ACT capacity.
11. Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company 
by the weighted average number of the Company’s ordinary shares in issue during the financial year. The weighted 
average number of the Company’s ordinary shares in issue excludes 0.7 million shares (2016: 0.6m shares), being the 
weighted average number of own shares held during the year in relation to employee share schemes.

Weighted average number of ordinary shares for calculating diluted earnings per share (million) b 182.9  182.6
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue assuming 
the conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
During the year, the Company had equity-settled LTIP awards with a nil exercise price that are potentially dilutive 
ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings per share measures are calculated based on profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company

12. Payments to shareholders
Payments to ordinary shareholders are made by way of the issue of B Shares in place of income distributions. Ordinary 
shareholders are able to redeem any number of the B Shares issued to them for cash. Any B Shares that they retain attract 
a dividend of 75% of LIBOR on the 0.1 pence nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis.
Payments to ordinary shareholders made or proposed in respect of the year were as follows:

Impairment tests carried out during the year
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the level of the CGUs to which it is allocated. In each of the tests carried out 
during 2017, the recoverable amount of the CGUs concerned was measured on a value in use basis.
Value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the CGU to 
which the goodwill is allocated. Management based its cash flow estimates on the Group’s budget for the 2018 financial 
year. Cash flows in the following four years were forecast by applying assumptions to budget sales, production costs 
and overheads. Aggregate cash flows beyond the fifth year were estimated by applying a perpetuity growth rate to the 
forecast cash flow in the fifth year that was based on long-term growth rates for the CGU’s products in its end markets.
Management estimates sales growth for each CGU based on forecasts of the future volume of the end markets for the 
CGU’s products. CGUs to which significant goodwill is allocated supply the Household powder market and the Household 
liquid market in the UK. The UK Household liquids market is forecast to be flat. 
Management estimates the cost of material inputs and other direct and indirect costs based on current prices and 
market expectations of future price changes. Beyond the budget period, unless there are reasons to suggest otherwise, 
management assumes that future changes in material input prices are reflected in the price of the Group’s products. 
General cost inflation is based on market expectations of future inflation rates.
Discount rates applied to the cash flow projections were determined using a capital asset pricing model and reflected 
current market interest rates, relevant equity and size risk premiums and the risks specific to the CGU concerned. 
Pre-tax discount rates used in calculating the value in use of those CGUs to which significant amounts of goodwill are 
allocated were as follows: Household 10% (2016: 11%); PCA 10% (2016: 11%).
Having performed the annual impairment tests, no impairment has been recognised for the year ended 30 June 2017 
(30 June 2016: £nil). As part of forming this conclusion a sensitivity analysis has been performed which focused on 
the change required in key assumptions (long term growth, future cash flows and discount rate), both individually and 
collectively, to give rise to an impairment, with the conclusion that no reasonable possible changes in key assumptions 
would cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets to be less than the carrying value.

In the above tables, the financial assets and financial liabilities held by the Group are categorised according to the basis on 
which they are measured. Financial assets and liabilities that are held at fair value are further categorised according to the 
degree to which the principal inputs used in determining their fair value represent observable market data as follows:
• Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2 – inputs other than Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (prices) or indirectly 
(derived from prices); and
• Level 3 – inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Derivative financial instruments comprise the foreign currency derivatives, non-deliverable commodity derivatives 
and interest rate derivatives that are held by the Group in designated hedging relationships. Foreign currency forward 
contracts are measured by reference to prevailing forward exchange rates. Commodity forward contracts are measured by 
difference to prevailing market prices. Foreign currency options are measured using a variant of the Monte Carlo valuation 
model. Interest rate swaps and caps are measured by discounting the related cash flows using yield curves derived from 
prevailing market interest rates.
Contingent consideration is measured at fair value based upon management’s estimates of the future sales and 
profitability of the acquired business. Details are presented in note 3.
Cash and cash equivalents and bank and other loans largely attract floating interest rates. Accordingly, management 
considers that their carrying amount approximates to fair value. 97 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report
Finance lease obligations attract fixed interest rates that are implicit in the lease rentals and their fair value has been 
assessed relative to prevailing market interest rates.
There were no transfers between levels during the period and no changes in valuation techniques. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group’s cash balances are managed such that there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one bank or 
other financial institution. Management monitors closely the credit quality of the institutions with which it holds deposits. 
Similar considerations are given to the Group’s portfolio of derivative financial instruments.
Before accepting a new customer, management assesses the customer’s credit quality and establishes a credit limit. 
Credit quality is assessed using data maintained by reputable credit rating agencies, by the checking of references 
included in credit applications and, where they are available, by reviewing the customer’s recent financial statements. 
Credit limits are subject to multiple levels of authorisation and are reviewed on a regular basis. Credit insurance is 
employed where it is considered to be cost effective. At 30 June 2017, the majority of trade receivables were due from 
major retailers in the UK and Europe.
At 30 June 2017, the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows (there was no significant concentration of 
credit risk):

Total          160.9 171.2
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its 
financial liabilities.
The Group’s borrowing facilities are monitored against forecast requirements and timely action is taken to put in place, 
renew or replace credit lines. 
The Group has an unsecured €175 million revolving credit facility that is committed until June 2022. At 30 June 2017, the 
amount undrawn on the facility was €105 million (2016: €120m). The Group is subject to covenants, representations and 
warranties which are typical for unsecured borrowing facilities, including two financial covenants. Debt cover (the ratio 
of net debt to EBITDA) may not exceed 3:1 and interest cover (the ratio of EBITDA to net interest) may not be less than 4:1.
For the purpose of these calculations, net debt excludes amounts drawn under the invoice discounting facilities and 
net interest comprises interest payments and receipts on net debt. The Group remains comfortably within these 
covenants. Any future non-compliance with the covenants could, if not waived, constitute an event of default and may, 
in certain circumstances, lead to an acceleration of the maturity of borrowings drawn down and an inability to access 
committed facilities.
In June 2017, the Group secured replacement banking facilities from a panel of international banks and using these 
increased facilities repaid its US Private Placement Notes (USPP). These actions will lower the cost of the Group’s debt 
financing from the financial year starting on 1 July 2017 by approximately £2.0 million per year.
The €140 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (RCF) has been increased to a five-year €175 million facility with a 
maturity of June 2022. 
The $50 million 5.51% 2020 USPP and $40 million 5.38% 2022 USPP were repaid in full by drawing on the increased RCF.
The Group has a number of facilities whereby it can borrow against certain of its trade receivables. In the UK, the Group 
has a £25 million facility that was renewed in November 2016 and is committed until February 2018. In France and Belgium, 
the Group has an aggregate €30 million facility, which has a rolling notice period of six months for the French part and 
three months for the Belgian part. Under these arrangements, the Group transfers trade receivables to the providers of the 
facilities at a discount to the face value of the underlying invoices. The Group can borrow from the provider of the relevant 
facility up to the lower of the facility limit and the discounted value of the receivables transferred. The Group does not 
derecognise the receivables transferred because it continues to be exposed to the credit risk associated with them. 98 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of, or future cash flows associated with, a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate borrowings, which it has mitigated using interest rate 
derivatives. The revolving credit facility drawings were hedged using interest rate caps in 2016 with additional interest rate 
swaps and caps in place for 2017 and beyond. 
After taking into account the Group’s currency and interest rate hedging activities, the currency and interest rate profile of 
the Group’s interest-bearing financial assets and financial liabilities was as follows:

Total    (63.9) (13.0) 1.2 (75.7) (82.4) (10.4) 1.9 (90.9)
Interest payable on bank overdrafts and floating rate loans is based on base rates and short-term interbank rates 
(predominantly LIBOR, EURIBOR and some EONIA). At 30 June 2017, the weighted average interest rate payable on bank 
and other loans was 1.5% (2016: 4.6%). At 30 June 2017, the weighted average interest rate receivable on cash and cash 
equivalents was 0.1% (2016: 0.1%).
At 30 June 2017, the Group held interest rate caps with a notional principal amount of €30 million, which cap the 
maximum rate payable but allows the rate to float below this maximum. The Group also held interest rate swaps with a 
notional principal amount of €20 million which exchanges the interest exposure from a floating interest rate to a fixed 
interest rate. The fair value of the instruments is negligible at 30 June 2017.
Interest rate derivatives held by the Group at 30 June 2017 were as follows:
           Notional Fixed or 
           principal capped rate 
          Nature of amount payable 
Maturity         contract €m %
June 2018         Cap 10.0 1.600
June 2018         Cap 10.0 0.250
June 2019         Cap 10.0 0.250
June 2020         Swap 10.0 0.210
June 2021         Swap 10.0 0.365
All interest rate derivatives held by the Group are indexed to three-month EURIBOR.
Fixed or capped interest rates shown in the above table do not include the margin over market interest rates payable on 
the Group’s borrowings.
On the assumption that a change in market interest rates would be applied to the interest rate exposures that were in existence 
at the balance sheet date and that designated cash flow hedges are 100% effective, an increase/decrease of 100 basis points in 
market interest rates would have decreased/increased the Group’s profit before tax by £0.4 million (2016: £0.2m).
Foreign currency risk
Transaction risk
Foreign currency transaction risk arises on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
of the entity that enters into the transaction. While the magnitude of these exposures is relatively low, the Group’s policy is to 
hedge committed transactions in full and to hedge a proportion of highly probable forecast transactions on a twelve-month 
rolling basis. Foreign currency transaction risk also arises on financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
and Group policy also allows for these exposures to be hedged using forward currency contracts.
At 30 June 2017, the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts (net purchases) that are held 
to hedge the Group’s transaction exposures was £30.6 million (2016: £48.3m). For accounting purposes, the Group has 
designated the foreign currency contracts as cash flow hedges. At 30 June 2017, the fair value of the contracts was 
£0.8 million (2016: £2.4m). During 2017, a gain of £1.6 million (2016: gain of £3.7m) was recognised in other comprehensive 
income and a gain of £3.0 million (2016: gain of £0.2m) was transferred from the cash flow reserve to the income 
statement in respect of these contracts. 100 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Foreign currency risk continued
Translation risk
Foreign currency translation risk arises on consolidation in relation to the translation into Sterling of the results and net 
assets of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries. The Group’s policy is to hedge a substantial proportion of overseas net assets 
using a combination of foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency swaps. The Group hedges part of the currency 
exposure on translating the results of its foreign subsidiaries into Sterling using average rate options. This exposure 
is also mitigated by the natural hedge provided by the interest payable on the Group’s foreign currency borrowings. 
At 30 June 2017, the fair value of the average rate options was a loss of £0.3 million (2016: £0.9m).
At 30 June 2017, the Group had designated as net investment hedges £61.6 million (2016: £54.1m) of its Euro-denominated 
borrowings and three-month rolling foreign currency forward contracts with a notional principal amount of £66.6 million 
(2016: £33.6m). During 2017, a loss of £7.8 million (2016: loss of £10.4m) was recognised in other comprehensive income 
in relation to the net investment hedges. At 30 June 2017, the fair value of the net investment hedges was a loss of 
£0.2 million (2016: £0.1m).

control of the Company.
22. Capital and net debt
The Group’s capital comprises total equity and net debt.
The Directors manage the Group’s capital to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Directors aim to maintain an efficient capital structure with a 
relatively conservative level of debt-to-equity gearing so as to ensure continued access to a broad range of financing 
sources in order to provide sufficient flexibility to pursue commercial opportunities as they arise.

Overview
The Group provides a number of post employment benefit arrangements. In the UK, the Group operates a defined benefit 
pension scheme and defined contribution pension schemes. Elsewhere in Europe, the Group has a number of smaller 
unfunded post employment benefit arrangements that are structured to accord with local conditions and practices in 
the countries concerned. 
At 30 June 2017, the Group’s post-employment benefit obligations outside the UK amounted to £2.2 million (2016: £1.8m). 
Post-employment benefits had the following effect on the Group’s results and financial position:

UK Defined Benefit Pension Scheme
(i) Background
In the UK, the Robert McBride Pension Fund (‘the Fund’) provides pension benefits based on the final pensionable salary 
and period of qualifying service of the participating employees. Following consultation with staff and the UK Fund’s 
Trustee, the UK Defined Benefit Fund was closed to future service accrual from 29 February 2016. Staff affected by this 
change were offered a new defined contribution scheme from that date. The closure of this Fund was one of the key 
actions in the ‘Repair’ phase to limit the growth of fund liabilities, reducing the risks and uncertainty over future cash 
costs associated with providing an active Defined Benefit Pension Scheme.
The Fund is administered and managed by Robert McBride Pension Fund Trustees Limited (‘the Trustee’), in accordance 
with the terms of a governing Trust Deed and relevant legislation. Regular assessments of the Fund’s benefit obligations 
are carried out by an independent actuary on behalf of the Trustee and long-term contribution rates are agreed between 
the Trustee and the Company on the basis of the actuary’s recommendations. Following the last triennial valuation at 
31 March 2015, the Company and Trustee agreed a new deficit reduction plan based on the scheme funding deficit of 
£44.2 million. The deficit cash funding requirement of £3.0 million per annum took effect from 31 March 2015.
(ii) Assumptions and sensitivities
For accounting purposes, the Fund’s benefit obligation has been calculated based on data gathered for the 2015 triennial 
actuarial valuation and by applying assumptions made by the Company on the advice of an independent actuary in 
accordance with IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’, which differ in certain respects from the assumptions made by the Trustee 
for the purpose of the actuarial valuation.
The principal assumptions used in calculating the benefit obligation at the end of the year were as follows:
           2017 2016
Discount rate          2.65% 3.05%
Inflation rate:  
 Retail Prices Index (RPI)         3.15% 2.95%
 Consumer Prices Index (CPI)        2.15% 1.95%
Revaluation of deferred pensions (in excess of GMP)  
 Accrued before 6 April 2009        2.15% 1.95%
 Accrued on or after 6 April 2009        2.15% 1.95%
Increase in pensions in payment (in excess of GMP)  
 Accrued before 1 April 2011        3.01% 2.91%
 Accrued on or after 1 April 2011        2.06% 2.14%
From 29 February 2016 the UK Defined Benefit Fund was closed to future service accrual. Prior to closure, future 
increases to pensionable salaries were limited to the rate of growth in the CPI up to 2.0%. The closure resulted in neither 
a curtailment gain nor loss in the financial statements.
During the year the Group commissioned a review of the IAS 19 assumptions used in determining the closing liability of 
the Robert McBride Pension Fund, specifically focusing on demographic assumptions. A medically underwritten study 
was carried out to identify the current health of a sample group of Fund members, assessed via written questionnaire 
and a telephone interview with trained medical staff. The study was targeted towards members with the most significant 
liabilities in the Fund.
The output was interpreted by underwriters and then analysed alongside the results from the postcode analysis used in 
the prior year. This was translated into mortality assumptions for use in calculating the IAS 19 scheme liabilities. 
The study of current mortality gives a rating of 107% of the standard Self-Administered Pension Scheme (SAPS) S2 tables 
used for the IAS 19 disclosure (previously this assumption had been set in line with 108% of the “00 series” (PCxA00) 
tables). The future mortality improvement model has been updated to reflect the most recent Continuous Mortality 
Investigation (CMI) 2016 projections with an allowance for long-term rates of improvement of 1.00% p.a. for males and 
for females (previously this assumption had been CMI 2015 with a long-term rate of improvement of 0.75% p.a. for males 
and females). The 2016 CMI model introduces a new smoothing parameter for which we have adopted the default value 
of 7.5. These assumptions are equivalent to a life expectancy at 65 of 21.4 years (30 June 2016: 21.9 years) for males and 
23.2 years (30 June 2016: 24.1 years) for females.  103 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

 Male          22.5 22.8
 Female          24.5 25.6
At 30 June 2017, the sensitivity of the benefit obligation to changes in the principal assumptions was as follows (assuming 
in each case that the other assumptions are unchanged):
    Change in assumption Increase in assumption Decrease in assumption
Discount rate     +/- 0.1% Decrease by £2.9m Increase by £2.9m
Inflation rate     +/- 0.1% Increase by £2.5m Decrease by £2.5m 
Life expectancy     +/- 1 year Increase by £7.4m Decrease by £7.4m
(iii) Fund’s assets
The Fund’s assets are held separately from those of the Group and are managed by professional investment managers on 
behalf of the Trustee.
During the year the Trustee conducted an investment strategy review. The transition to the revised strategy was completed 
in February 2017 and is reflected in the table below. 
The Trustee maintains a significant portfolio of return-seeking assets that are expected to produce returns in excess of 
the yield on UK government bonds. The Fund’s return-seeking assets continue to be predominantly held within managed 
funds that are designed to achieve equity-like returns over the long term but with significantly less volatility than would be 
experienced if the Fund had invested directly in equities.
The Fund holds no investment in securities issued by, nor any property used by, McBride plc or any of its subsidiaries.
The fair value and expected return on the Fund’s assets at the end of the year was as follows:
           2017 2016 
           £m £m
Diversified growth          34.6 66.7

Cash          0.9 0.6
Total          115.9 114.1
 
(1) The liability-driven investment fund at 2017 provides a combination of growth and matching returns.
All of the Fund’s assets are held in pooled funds. They are classified as Level 2 instruments, as they are not quoted on any 
stock exchange, although their value is directly related to the value of the underlying holdings.
The expected return on the Fund’s assets must be set to be in line with the discount rate used to value the Fund’s 
liabilities. This equates to an expected return over the year of £3.4 million (2016: £4.0m).
The actual return on the Fund’s assets during the year was £6.0 million (2016: £10.1m). 104 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

24. Employee share schemes
Share awards
The Group operates a performance-based Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for the Executive Directors and certain other 
senior executives. Awards made under the LTIP vest provided the participant remains in the Group’s employment during 
the three-year vesting period and the Group achieves relative total shareholder return (TSR) and earnings per share (EPS) 
targets. Up to 50% of each award vests dependent on the TSR of the Company’s ordinary shares compared with the TSR 
of the FTSE SmallCap Ex. Investment Companies Index (a market condition). Up to 50% of each award vests dependent on 
the growth in the Group’s EPS (a vesting condition).
Vested awards are settled either in the form of the Company’s ordinary shares (equity-settled) or by the payment of cash 
equivalent to the market value of the Company’s ordinary shares on the vesting date (cash-settled). 
Further information on the LTIP is set out in the remuneration report.
Movements in LTIP awards outstanding were as follows:

Unvested at 30 June    1,243,724 3,813,005 872,296 3,001,187
 
Awards made under the LTIP have a £nil exercise price.
During 2017, £0.5 million of cash LTIP awards vested (2016: £nil) and no equity-settled settled LTIP awards vested in 2017 
or 2016.
At 30 June 2017, the liability recognised in relation to cash-settled awards was £3.1 million (2016: £1.6m). 
At the grant date, the weighted average fair value of LTIP awards granted during the year was 139.0 pence (2016: 104.5p). 
Fair value was measured using a variant of the Monte Carlo valuation model based on the following assumptions:
         September September February October  
         2016  2015 2015 2014 
         issue issue issue issue

Expected life of LTIP awards       3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years
 
Expected volatility was determined based on weekly observations of the Company’s share price and the FTSE SmallCap 
Ex. Investment Companies Index over the three-year period immediately preceding the grant date.
Compensation expense recognised in profit or loss in relation to employee share schemes was as follows:

Deferred Annual Bonus Plan 
The Group has in force a Deferred Annual Bonus Plan for main Executive Directors. The shares awarded under the 
plan vest after three years and are normally only payable if the Director remains employed by the Group at the end of 
that period. 
The total expense included in operating profit in relation to the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan was £0.1 million (2016: £nil). 106 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

29. Post balance sheet events
On 4 September 2017, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of the entire share capital of Danlind a/s, a supplier 
of auto dishwash and laundry products, based in Denmark. Danlind provides McBride with access to accelerated growth 
in the key strategic category of auto dishwash tablets, through its well-invested capacity, technology platform and high 
quality product range. Danlind has a significant range of retail and contract customers along with a well-established 
position in the Nordic region and in the commercial laundry and dishwash markets. Danlind will enable McBride to gain 
entry into growth segments where it is currently under-represented. Additionally, Danlind’s strong position in Ecolabel 
products can be developed further through McBride’s extensive European reach. 
Danlind operates from three manufacturing sites in Denmark, and has approximately 250 employees. For the year ended 
31 December 2016, Danlind reported revenues of £58.4 million, EBITDA of £1.6 million, a loss before tax of £1.3 million, and 
had gross assets of £48.0 million as at 31 December 2016. For its financial year ending 31 December 2017, on a standalone 
basis, Danlind is currently expected to generate c.£2.5 million of EBITDA. 
McBride expects to realise significant commercial, technical and operational improvement synergies from the acquisition. 
The acquisition is expected to be immediately earnings enhancing for the Group. Post-tax return on invested capital is 
expected to meet cost of capital in the third full year of ownership.
Consideration of £10.8 million will be payable to the shareholder of Danlind, Lind Holdings ApS, and c.£28 million of 
net debt in Danlind will be assumed by McBride at completion. The acquisition will be funded from McBride’s existing 
banking facilities.
The acquisition, which is subject to customary regulatory and closing conditions, is expected to complete in early 
October 2017.
On completion, Danlind, the management team and its employees will form part of the Household products segment. 
30. Contingent liabilities
There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to 
result in a material liability to the Group. The Group recognises provisions for liabilities when it is more likely than not that 
a settlement will be required and the value of such a payment can be reliably estimated.
31. Exchange rates
The principal exchange rates used to translate the results, assets and liabilities and cash flows of the Group’s foreign

Report”), which comprise: 
• Company balance sheet at 30 June 2017, 
• Company statement of changes in equity for the year 
ended 30 June 2017; and 
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the  
Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable 
law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further 
described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements section of our report. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes 
the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applicable to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that 
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the group or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in the Directors’ Report, we 
have provided no non-audit services to the group and its 
subsidiaries in the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall company materiality £1.5 million (2016: £1.5 million)
• The above is based on 1% of total assets as disclosed 
within the company balance sheet.
• We conducted our audit work in the UK.
• The scope was tailored by taking into account the 
accounting and control processes and the industry 
in which the company operates.
• Refinancing.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where 
the directors made subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that 
are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal 
controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the current period 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Refinancing
The group undertook a significant refinancing exercise in 
the year, resulting in the settlement of $90m of private 
debt and associated hedges, as well as the refinancing of 
a revolving credit facility. This resulted in an exceptional 
item within financing costs. We identified this is a particular 
risk due to the magnitude of the exceptional item, required 
accounting and presentation in accordance with IAS 39, 
along with the complexity due to the debt forming part 
of the Group-wide hedging strategy and settlement of 
derivative financial instruments.
We have reviewed agreements in relation to both the old 
and new revolving facilities in order to ensure that they 
have been accounted for correctly and within the terms of 
the agreement.
Transactions in relation to the refinancing have been traced 
through the financial statements, including those in relation to 
derivatives, with the support of Treasury specialists in order to 
ensure that they have been appropriately accounted for in line 
with the requirements of IAS39.
No significant issues were identified from this audit work. 110 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Our audit approach continued
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we 
performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on 
the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the 
structure of the parent company, the accounting processes 
and controls, and the industry in which it operates. 
We conducted our audit work in the UK.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application 
of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the 
individual financial statement line items and disclosures and 
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole 
as follows:
Overall materiality £1.5 million (2016: £1.5 million).
How we determined it 1% of total assets as disclosed within 
the company balance sheet.
Rationale for benchmark applied Consistent with last year, 
we applied this benchmark as we believe that total assets 
are the most relevant measure of recurring performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
£0.15 million (2016: £0.15 million) as well as misstatements 
below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting 
for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything 
material to add or draw attention to in respect of the 
directors’ statement in the financial statements about 
whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements and the directors’ identification of any material 
uncertainties to the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern over a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement 
relating to Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information 
in the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 other than the 
financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material 
inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required 
to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a 
material misstatement of the financial statements or a 
material misstatement of the other information. If, based 
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered 
whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our 
work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies 
Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report 
certain opinions and matters as described below (required 
by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 
is consistent with the financial statements and has been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
(CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the parent 
company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06) 111 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Strategic report
Corporate Governance Statement
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate 
Governance Statement (page 34 to 66) about internal 
controls and risk management systems in relation to 
financial reporting processes in compliance with rules 7.2.5 
and 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules sourcebook of the FCA (“DTR”) is consistent with the 
financial statements and has been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the parent 
company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in this 
information. (CA06)
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate 
Governance Statement (page 34 to 66) with respect to 
the parent company’s corporate governance code and 
practices and about its administrative, management and 
supervisory bodies and their committees complies with 
rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the DTR. (CA06)
We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility 
to report if a corporate governance statement has not been 
prepared by the parent company. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the 
parent company and of the principal risks that 
would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the 
parent company
We have nothing material to add or draw attention 
to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 26 of the Annual 
Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the parent company, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe 
those risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 28 of the Annual 
Report as to how they have assessed the prospects 
of the parent company, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the parent company will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of 
the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the parent company 
and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of 
the parent company. Our review was substantially less 
in scope than an audit and only consisted of making 
inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in 
alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether 
the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the parent company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility 
to report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 66, that 
they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to 
be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for the members to assess the 
parent company’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the parent company obtained in the 
course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 44 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to 
the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the parent 
company’s compliance with the Code does not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the 
Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by 
the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements  
and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the 
financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 66, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
in accordance with the applicable framework and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The 
directors are also responsible for such internal control as 
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the  
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditors’ report. 112 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Notes to the Company financial statements
for the year ended 30 June 2017
1. Principal accounting policies
Description of business
McBride plc (‘the Company’) is the ultimate parent 
Company of a group of companies that together is Europe’s 
leading provider of Private Label Household and Personal 
Care products. The Company develops and manufactures 
products for the majority of retailers and major brand 
owners throughout the UK, Europe and Asia.
Basis of preparation
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) and Financial Reporting 
Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101). 
FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for 
a ‘qualifying entity’ as defined in the standard which 
addresses the financial reporting requirements and 
disclosure exemptions in the individual financial 
statements of qualifying entities that otherwise apply the 
recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
EU-adopted IFRS.
These financial statements of the Company prepared in 
accordance with FRS 101. 
FRS 101 sets out amendments to EU-adopted IFRS that 
are necessary to achieve compliance with the Act and 
related Regulations. 
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken 
advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under 
that standard in relation to business combinations, 
financial instruments, capital management, presentation 
of comparative information in respect of certain assets, 
presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not 
yet effective, impairment of assets and related party 
transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures 
are given in the consolidated financial statements of 
McBride plc. 
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption 
available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 
and not presented an income statement or a statement of 
comprehensive income for the Company alone. A summary 
of the Company’s significant accounting policies is set 
out below.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or 
indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of the entity 
so as to obtain benefit from its activities. Investments in 
subsidiaries represent interests in subsidiaries that are 
directly owned by the Company and are stated at cost 
less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
Financial instruments
(i) Bank and other loans
Bank and other loans are initially measured at fair value, 
net of any directly attributable transaction costs, and 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to 
hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest 
rate risks arising from operating, financing and investing 
activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative 
financial instruments for trading purpose; however if 
derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they 
are accounted for as such.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated 
at fair value. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement are 
immediately recognised in the Company income statement. 
Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition 
of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the 
hedge relationship and the items being hedged. In order 
to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required 
to document from inception, the relationship between the 
item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Company is also required to document and 
demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the 
hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that 
the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This 
effectiveness testing is performed at each reporting date to 
ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of more 
than one year from the balance sheet date are disclosed as 
non-current.
The Company has entered into a number of financial 
derivative contracts and each is discussed in turn.
The Company enters into forward foreign exchange 
contracts to mitigate the exchange risk for certain 
foreign currency receivables. At 30 June 2017, the 
outstanding contracts all mature within twelve months 
(2016: twelve months) of the year end. The Company 
is committed to sell CZK, PLN, EUR and receive a fixed 
EUR and Sterling amounts. 
The Company also enters into foreign exchange options 
contracts to mitigate the GBP:EUR exchange risk for 
currency sales. At 30 June 2017, the outstanding contracts 
all mature within twelve months (2016: twelve months) of 
the year end. These contracts are measured at fair value 
with movements reflected in the income statement. 
The Company also enters into interest rate swap contracts 
to mitigate against the floating interest rates on revolving 
credit facility debt. At 30 June 2017, of the five outstanding 
contracts, two mature within twelve months of the year 
end with the remaining three maturing more than twelve 
months after the year end. 
The contracts are all measured at fair value, which 
is determined using valuation techniques that utilise 
observable inputs. The key assumptions used in valuing 
derivatives are the exchange rates for GBP:EUR, GBP:CZK, 
GBP:PLN, and EUR:PLN as well as EUR interest rates. 116 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the Company financial statements continued
for the year ended 30 June 2017
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Foreign currency translation
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. 
Currency translation differences are recognised in the 
income statement.
Leases
Leases that confer rights and obligations similar to those 
that attach to owned assets are classified as finance leases. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are charged to the profit and 
loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Lease incentives are credited to the profit and loss account 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term or, if the initial 
rent is above the prevailing market rent, over the shorter 
of the lease term and the period to the first rent review 
from which it is expected that the prevailing market rent 
will be payable.
Share-based payments
The Company operates incentive share schemes under 
which it grants equity-settled and cash-settled awards 
over its own ordinary shares to certain employees of its 
subsidiaries. The Company recognises a capital contribution 
to the subsidiaries concerned that is based on the fair value 
of the awards measured using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing formula or the Monte Carlo valuation model. 
For equity-settled awards, the fair value reflects market 
performance conditions and all non-vesting conditions. 
Fair value is determined at the grant date and is not 
subsequently remeasured unless the relevant conditions 
are modified. Adjustments are made to the compensation 
expense to reflect actual and expected forfeitures due 
to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market 
performance conditions. For cash settled awards, the 
fair value reflects all the conditions on which the award 
is made and is remeasured at each reporting date and at 
the settlement date. 
Generally, the capital contribution is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
For equity-settled awards a corresponding credit is 
recognised directly in reserves while for cash-settled 
awards a corresponding liability to settle is recognised 
in the balance sheet. 
Taxation
Current tax is the amount of tax payable in respect of the 
taxable profit or loss for the period. Taxable profit differs 
from accounting profit because it excludes income or 
expenses that are recognised in the period for accounting 
purposes but are either not taxable or not deductible for 
tax purposes or are taxable or not deductible in earlier or 
subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences 
between the recognition of items of income or expenses for 
accounting purposes and their recognition for tax purposes. 
A deferred tax asset in respect of a deductible temporary 
difference or a carried forward tax loss is recognised 
only to the extent that it is considered more likely than 
not that sufficient taxable profits will be available against 
which the reversing temporary difference or the tax loss 
can be deducted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
not discounted.
Current and deferred tax is measured using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
Provisions
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount and 
is recognised when the Company has a present obligation 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that payment will 
be made to settle the obligation and the payment can be 
estimated reliably.
Provision is made for restructuring costs when a detailed 
formal plan for the restructuring has been determined 
and that plan has started to be implemented or has been 
announced to the parties that may be affected by it.
Provisions are discounted where the effect of the time 
value of money is material.
Guarantees
From time to time, the Company provides guarantees 
to third parties in respect of the indebtedness of its 
subsidiaries. The Directors consider these guarantees to 
be insurance arrangements and, therefore, the Company 
recognises a liability in respect of such guarantees only in 
the event that it becomes probable that the guarantee will 
be called upon and the Company will be required to make a 
payment to the third party.
Payments to shareholders
Subject to shareholder approval at each AGM, it is the 
Company’s intention that, for the foreseeable future, all 
payments to shareholders will be made by the issue of 
non-cumulative redeemable preference shares (‘B Shares’). 
B Shares issued but not redeemed are classified as 
current liabilities.
Own shares
Own shares represent the Company’s ordinary shares that 
are held by the Company in treasury or by a sponsored 
ESOP trust to employee share schemes. When own 
shares are acquired, the cost of purchase in the market is 
deducted from the profit and loss account reserve. Gains 
and losses on the subsequent transfer or sale of own shares 
are recognised directly in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement
A cash flow statement is not presented in these financial 
statements on the grounds that the Company’s cash flows 
are included in the consolidated financial statements of the 
Company and its subsidiaries.
Critical accounting policies
The Company has a number of forward exchange contracts 
and interest rate swaps. Changes in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument are, to the extent that the hedge is 
effective, recognised in other comprehensive income. 117 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Payments to shareholders
On 24 March 2011 shareholders approved a proposal for the 
implementation of a B Share scheme as a mechanism for 
making payments to shareholders. This involves the issue of 
non-cumulative redeemable preference shares (B Shares) 
in place of income distributions. Shareholders are able to 
redeem any number of their B Shares for cash. B Shares 
that are retained attract a dividend of 75% of LIBOR 
on the 0.1 pence nominal value of each share, paid on a 
twice-yearly basis.
Shareholders may choose to have payments made directly 
into their bank or building society account. Confirmation 
of payment is contained in a payment advice which is 
posted to shareholders’ registered addresses at the time 
of payment. This payment advice should be kept safely for 
future reference.
Shareholders who wish to benefit from this service 
should complete the relevant section of the election form 
accompanying the Notice of Annual General Meeting. 
Alternatively, the required documentation can be obtained 
by contacting the Company’s registrar using one of the 
methods outlined below.
Shareholder queries
Shareholders who change address, lose their share 
certificates, wish to amalgamate multiple shareholdings 
to avoid receiving duplicate documentation, want to have 
payments paid directly into their bank account or otherwise 
have a query or require information relating to their 
shareholding should contact the Company’s registrar. 
This can be done by writing to Capita Asset Services, 
The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham BR3 4TU. 
Alternatively, shareholders can contact Capita Asset 
Services on 0871 664 0300 (calls cost 12 pence per 
minute plus network extras; lines are open 9.00am to 
5.30pm Monday to Friday), or on +44 371 644 0300 
if calling from overseas, or email their enquiry 
to shareholderenquiries@capita.co.uk, indicating they are 
a McBride shareholder.
Shareholders are also able to access and amend details 
of their shareholding (such as address and distribution 
payment instructions), via the registrar’s website at  
www.signalshares.com. If you have not previously 
registered to use this facility you will need your investor 
code, which can be found on your proxy card, or on any 
share certificate issued by Capita Asset Services.
Electronic communications
Shareholders are able to register to receive communications 
from McBride electronically. This service enables shareholders 
to tailor their communication requirements to their needs. 
McBride is encouraging shareholders to use this service to 
elect to receive all communications electronically which 
enables more secure and prompt communication and 
allows shareholders to:
• receive electronic notification via email and the 
internet of the publication and availability of statutory 
documents such as financial results, including annual and 
interim reports;
• access details of their individual shareholding quickly 
and securely online;
• amend their details (such as address or bank details);
• choose the way payments are received; and
• submit proxy voting instructions for shareholder 
meetings including the AGM.
It also enables shareholders to contribute directly to 
reducing McBride’s costs and environmental impact 
through saving paper, mailing and transportation and 
reducing unnecessary waste.
You can register directly by visiting www.signalshares.com 
and following the online instructions. Alternatively, you 
can access the service via the investor relations section of 
McBride’s website at www.mcbride.co.uk. 124 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Online shareholder services
McBride provides a number of services online  
in the investor relations section of its website at  
www.mcbride.co.uk, where shareholders and other 
interested parties may:
• view and/or download annual and interim reports;
• check current or historic share prices (there is an historic 
share price download facility);
• check the amounts and dates of historic payments to 
shareholders;
• use interactive tools to calculate the value of 
shareholdings and chart McBride ordinary share price 
changes against indices; and
• register to receive email alerts regarding press releases, 
including regulatory news announcements, Annual 
Reports and Company presentations.
ShareGift
McBride supports ShareGift, the share donation charity 
(registered charity number 1052686). ShareGift was set up 
so that shareholders who have only a very small number of 
shares which might be considered uneconomic to sell are 
able to dispose of them by donating them for the benefit 
of UK charities. Donated shares are aggregated and sold by 
ShareGift, the proceeds being passed on to a wide range of 
UK charities. Donating shares to charity gives rise neither 
to a gain nor a loss for UK capital gains purposes and UK 
taxpayers may also be able to claim income tax relief on the 
value of the donation.
Further information about donating shares to ShareGift is 
available either from its website at www.sharegift.org, by 
writing to ShareGift at 17 Carlton House Terrace, London 
SW1Y 5AH or by contacting them on +44 (0)20 7930 3737.
Even if the share certificate has been lost or destroyed, the 
gift can be completed. The service is generally free, however, 
there may be an indemnity charge for a lost or destroyed 
share certificate where the value of the shares exceeds £100.

Unsolicited mail
The Company is obliged by law to make its share register 
publicly available should a request be received. As a 
consequence, shareholders may receive unsolicited mail 
from organisations that use it as a mailing list. Shareholders 
wishing to limit the amount of such mail should either

Warning to shareholders – boiler room scams
Each year in the UK shareholders lose money due to 
investment fraud. Investment scams are becoming ever 
more sophisticated – designed to look like genuine 
investments, they are increasingly difficult to spot.
Protect yourself
1. Reject cold calls
2. Check the firm on the FS register at  
www.fca.org.uk/register
3. Get impartial advice
REMEMBER, if it sounds too good to be true, 
it probably is!
Report a scam
If you suspect you have been approached by fraudsters 
please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at 
www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can find out more about 
investment scams. You can also call the FCA Consumer 
Helpline on 0800 111 6768. If you have lost money to 
investment fraud, you should report it to Action Fraud on 
0300 123 2040 or online at www.actionfraud.police.uk.

Cautionary statement This Annual Report has been 
prepared for the shareholders of McBride plc, as a body, 
and no other persons. Its purpose is to assist shareholders 
of the Company to assess the strategies adopted by the 
Group, the potential for those strategies to succeed and for 
no other purpose. The Company, its Directors, employees, 
agents or advisers do not accept or assume responsibility 
to any other person to whom this document is shown or 
into whose hands it may come and any such responsibility 
or liability is expressly disclaimed.
This Annual Report contains certain forward-looking 
statements that are subject to risk factors associated 
with, amongst other things, the economic and business 
circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries, 
sectors and markets in which the Group operates. It is 
believed that the expectations reflected in these statements 
are reasonable but they may be affected by a wide range 
of variables which could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those currently anticipated. 
No assurances can be given that the forward-looking 
statements in this strategic report will be realised. The 
forward-looking statements reflect the knowledge and 
information available at the date of preparation of this 
Strategic report and the Company undertakes no obligation 
to update these forward-looking statements. Nothing in this 
Report should be constituted as a profit forecast.
Strategic and Directors’ reports The strategic report and 
the corporate governance and financial statements form a 
Directors’ report. Both the Directors’ report and strategic 
report have been drawn up and presented in accordance 
with English company law and the liabilities of the 
Directors in connection with those reports shall be subject 
to the limitations and restrictions provided by such law. 
In particular, the Directors would be liable to the Company 
(but not to any third party) if the strategic report and/or 
Directors’ report contain errors as a result of recklessness 
or knowing misstatement or dishonest concealment of a 
material fact, but would not otherwise be liable.
