Chairman’s statement
Another very successful year
Ken Archer
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present this Annual Financial Report 2017 which 
records another very successful year for the Group.
All financial targets were met or exceeded following the continuing 
successful deployment of the Clareti platform across a variety 
of financial services sectors globally. The Group has achieved notable 
sales success in North America following its sales and marketing 
investment in the region.
This result stems from the effectiveness of the Group’s ongoing 
investment in its core product for transaction data management 
and its successful implementation on behalf of our clients.
Overview
Gresham continued to build upon the previously stated strategic 
objectives (see Strategy, page 12) and I am delighted with our 26% 
top-line growth with total revenues for the Group rising to £21.7m. 
Importantly, we have continued to secure new, high-margin recurring 
Clareti revenues, which has resulted in Clareti annualised recurring 
revenues closing at £5.7m (up 24% over 2016) and associated growth 
in underlying profitability yielding an adjusted EBITDA for the Group 
of £5.1m (up 34% over 2016). 
Our clients have been operating in a challenging market environment 
characterised by geo-political and legislative uncertainties as well as 
increased (and increasing) regulatory demands. These factors have 
given rise to client operating cost pressures, which have a constraining 
effect on IT investment. At the same time, these pressures drive demand 
for more effective IT solutions to improve internal efficiency. A critical 
factor in the efficient management and reporting of client processed 
transactions is the accuracy of the data received by, and contained within, 
these transaction flows. Clareti offers clients a strategic platform to 
address these challenges by better management of data, automation 
of transaction reconciliation and exception management thereby 
increasing efficiency of processing, improved risk management and 
compliant reporting. The increasing volume of transactions is a 
demand driver for our core solution Clareti Transaction Control (“CTC”). 
As mentioned earlier, the Group has made substantial progress in 
expanding the adoption of Clareti solutions globally. The important 
North America market contributed 39% of new Clareti sales in 2017 
following investment in the direct sales team. The North America market 
has the potential for much higher growth and the Board continues to 
support the ongoing investments in direct sales, in addition to forming 
strategic alliances to further expand distribution capacity.
2017 has been a very successful 
year for the Group, which of course 
is made up of a great many team 
and individual successes. This is 
a testament to the hard work, 
expertise and professionalism 
of the Gresham team. Gresham Technologies plc
Annual Financial Report 2017 05
Strategic Report
Ongoing investments
The Board continues to believe there is a very significant market 
opportunity for data integrity and control solutions and that ongoing 
investment in key strategic areas is essential. Accordingly, the Company 
is making further investments in sales, marketing and implementation 
resources, in order to capitalise on the market opportunity and 
accelerate Clareti growth.
As noted above, regulatory reporting demands on our clients are 
increasing both in number and complexity. Technology will increasingly 
be used to respond to these demands and we believe our Clareti platform 
is well suited as a data framework for regulatory control. We are already 
working with several clients to develop our offerings and would expect 
strong sales demand to follow.
Board changes
In May 2017 , Andy Balchin joined the Board as Independent 
Non-Executive Director and chair of the audit committee. Andy Balchin is 
currently Chief Financial Officer of the cyber division of RUAG Holding AG, 
a major Swiss organisation, which acquired Clearswift, a provider of 
cyber security solutions, in January 2017 , where he was CFO, and brings 
significant financial experience in high-growth software companies. He 
replaced Chris Errington who left the Board after serving previously as 
CFO and CEO.
We welcome Tom Mullan to the Board as Chief Financial Officer, 
and we look forward to working with him as we continue the successful 
development of the Company. He replaces Rob Grubb who has made 
an outstanding contribution to the Group’s development over the last 
nine years and who leaves with our very best wishes.
Shareholder value
Our share price has continued to experience a degree of volatility in 
the year which is common for the small cap market, but it is pleasing to 
note that the overall upward trend persists. Earnings per share increased 
to 6.5 pence on an adjusted and diluted basis (2016: 4.7 pence). 
In light of the Company’s increasing profitability and strong cash 
reserves, I am pleased to confirm that the Company will be commencing 
the payment of a progressive dividend. In respect of financial year 2017 , 
the Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.5 pence per share for 
shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The Gresham organisation and its employees are fully aligned to growing 
profitable revenue from Clareti sales globally. I remain confident that 
our investments in sales, marketing and client success provide the 
platform to deliver shareholder value from our ongoing investments.
In summary
With our continued investment in the Clareti portfolio and sales and 
marketing expansion, I anticipate further improvement in our market 
position as we respond to the growing demand for transparency and 
integrity over risk and financial data processing. 2017 has been a very 
successful year for the Group, which of course is made up of a great 
many team and individual successes. This is a testament to the hard 
work, expertise and professionalism of the Gresham team. I would like 
to thank the management and staff for their continued support and 
resolve to achieve success in our pursuit of market leadership in 
real-time transaction control and enterprise data integrity.

CEO’s statement
With Clareti sales now 
generating more than half of all 
Group sales and with the Group 
now generating surplus cash for 
the first time in many years, we 
are confident our strategy is on 
track and certain about our 
ability to deliver sustainable 
long-term profitable growth 
for our shareholders.
Strong, profitable growth
Ian Manocha
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to report another year of strong, profitable growth for the 
Group, driven by the continued success of the Clareti business.
In 2017 , Clareti revenue growth was underpinned by high quality new 
customer wins in UK, Western Europe, the United States and Canada. 
It is pleasing to see wins in all our target geographic markets, particularly 
in North America and in continental Europe, following recent investments 
into local sales offices. New customer wins were represented across 
our targeted industry segments including asset managers, hedge funds, 
sell side banks and brokerages, insurance broking, and our second 
win into the energy and commodities sector. A total of 15 new clients 
were won and, with growth from existing accounts during the year, 
high levels of customer retention, and the addition of annuities acquired 
with C24, we exited the year with a strong base of recurring revenues.
With the addition of related consulting and managed services, the 
Clareti business now accounts for more than half of all Group revenues 
and our dependency on legacy revenues continues to reduce.
Our Australian business saw a strong year of revenue growth with 
a deepening relationship with one of the region’s leading banks.  
Our legacy business remained stable during the year with some 
changes in the mix as we proactively manage the portfolio to  
optimise returns.
During the year, we also strengthened our organisation with the 
addition of many excellent new hires. We have appointed regional 
sales leaders in both North America and in Europe, and have hired 
additional staff in direct sales, partner sales and pre-sales. We have 
brought our first full-time HR leader into the business, and we have 
scaled up resources in key technical disciplines such as software 
development, project management and consulting. The continued 
investment in sales and marketing, product and delivery resources, 
has been achieved whilst maintaining margins and improving earnings.
Financial year 2017 reflects yet another strong performance from a 
motivated global team and a further year of excellent progress for the 
Group, which is transforming into one of the UK’s most exciting listed 
financial technology companies. Gresham Technologies plc
Annual Financial Report 2017 07
Strategic Report
Outlook
We started 2018 with the Clareti annuity stream up 24% year-on-year 
and, in the first quarter of 2018 so far, we have signed a further insurance 
broking business for CTC, a Clareti Adapter sale and several professional 
services engagements for delivery of software contracts won in late 2017 .
We will continue to focus our direct sales effort in the UK, Europe and 
North America and we are building partner relationships with major 
system integrators and consulting houses. In Asia Pacific, we will 
continue to expand our work directly with key accounts in Australia 
and Singapore, and we will look to resellers to provide a channel into 
other local markets.
CTC is expected to drive the majority of new wins, with Clareti-as-a-Service 
providing incremental hosting and managed service revenues. 
Clareti Analytics and Clareti Adapters are expected to provide upsell 
opportunity and we also expect to see revenue growing within the 
installed base. We will look for opportunity to broaden the appeal 
of our Clareti ARM offering with new capabilities.
The Group’s legacy portfolio of licences and sub-contracting is 
expected to decline in 2018, although we remain confident that 
our legacy business will be sustained for the medium term.
With Clareti sales now generating more than half of all Group sales 
and with the Group now generating surplus cash for the first time in 
many years, we are confident our strategy is on track and certain 
about our ability to deliver sustainable long-term profitable growth 
for our shareholders.
Thank you for your ongoing support.
Ian Manocha
Chief Executive

Strategy and opportunity
Our goal is to be recognised as a leading global provider of enterprise 
financial technology and deliver sustained profitable growth for the 
Group and long-term value for shareholders.
From a starting point as a newcomer and disruptive challenger in the 
matching and reconciliation space just a few years ago, Gresham is now 
regarded as the emerging champion and we are routinely included in 
vendor selections for new requirements as well as replacements. The core 
use case for Clareti Transaction Control continues to be that of addressing 
larger scale reconciliation and transaction data quality problems in 
financial markets and we intend to capitalise on this opportunity over 
the next few years.
We also see a broader market opportunity for our modern technology 
and we aim to establish Clareti within the financial industry as a “de-facto” 
standard platform for firms with complex data processing challenges 
who need to improve integrity and evidence control across their entire 
business. Regulatory drivers are increasingly behind this requirement 
and it was pleasing to see three RegTech deals signed in 2017 .
In addition to our work in capital markets, the Clareti platform has 
found use cases in corporate banking and payments, securing white 
label and OEM agreements for CTC, Clareti ARM and Clareti 24. The 
transformation underway in transaction banking and industry initiatives 
such as open banking and faster payments is creating opportunities for 
more agile technologies and more innovative FinTech partnerships.
Finally, in the commercial real estate market, we see a longer-term 
opportunity to build on the Clareti Loan Control joint venture 
established at the end of 2016 now that the core product development 
work is substantially complete.
With a core business in next-generation reconciliation technology, a 
closely aligned business in regulatory solutions and complementary 
revenue streams in corporate banking and commercial lending 
solutions, the Group now has four engines to drive future growth. 
Thinking about the business in this way also provides a framework in 
which to consider future acquisitions and to optimise our use of 
capital. Ultimately, it is our intention to build a high-margin, recurring 
revenue business of substantial scale based on licence subscriptions 
and cloud services stemming from our investment into the Clareti 
platform and our deep knowledge of financial markets. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY
Our technology is built on robust, modern 
architecture using an agile methodology, 
and we have built a reputation for consistently 
delivering innovative solutions using the 
latest technologies. Our development 
ethos and commitment to innovation 
provides competitive differentiation.

CLARETI
Clareti is a purpose-built, highly flexible 
and fully scalable platform for enterprise 
data integrity and control. Using Clareti, we 
have built a number of individual applications 
designed to address specific industry 
problems, providing enhanced value and 
greater marketability. The flexibility and 
scalability of Clareti also enables financial 
institutions to achieve long-term operational 
efficiencies. These characteristics give Clareti 
a competitive advantage over legacy vendors, 
whose systems are typically batch-based 
and incapable of adapting to today’s range 
of data processing requirements without 
time-consuming and costly implementations. 
INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPMENT
Gresham invests significantly in product 
development, which is delivered from our 
Innovation Labs in Bristol. We adopt an agile 
development strategy and we operate a 
continuous programme of enhancements. 
This provides competitive differentiation, 
promotes deep and loyal relationships and 
ensures customer success over the long 
term. Wherever possible, new applications 
are developed in partnership with fee paying 
early adopters, and our Innovation Labs are 
designed precisely for such collaboration. 
We also develop chargeable upgrades to the 
platform to drive growth in existing accounts.
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS
Our global team of sales professionals sells directly to customers in our chosen 
geographies, principally the UK, Europe and North America. In addition, 
our bank and technology partners provide indirect sales channels and new 
opportunities. We are developing a global alliances network with like-minded 
firms to build global distribution channels and enhance our addressable 
market. Our sales activities are supported by a global marketing team 
based primarily in London, UK. 
Our strengths Our business
Our business model is to earn high-margin, recurring revenues by providing innovative 
software solutions to financial institutions in the field of data integrity and control

Management 9%
–  Hedge Fund 6%
–  I n s u r anc e 5%
–  O t h e r 24% CHARGING MODEL
Gresham’s preferred charging model is to 
licence Clareti applications on a subscription 
basis, combining licensing and support and 
maintenance. This model generates higher 
levels of recurring revenue for the Group, 
which enhances long-term profitable growth 
and provides a platform for sound investment 
decisions. In some cases, a traditional fixed-term 
licence model is agreed. Software licences 
are typically limited by scope of use and 
volume limitations, aligning charges with the 
value being received by the customer, and 
providing opportunity for additional fees 
for higher usage or new use cases.
DEPLOYMENT
Our customer success team is made up of 
experienced professional services consultants 
and specialist support technicians. The team 
operates as a global function, which enables us 
to make optimal use of resources and expertise 
from all locations. Consulting is typically 
charged on a time and materials basis or 
at a fixed fee for a fixed scope of works. 
We provide bank-grade 24/7 support from 
our global hubs using a centralised service 
infrastructure. As well as supporting traditional 
on-premise deployment, our offering includes 
a fully hosted Clareti service, which enhances 
the value proposition and generates higher 
recurring revenues for Gresham.
BUSINESS PLATFORM
Our operations are underpinned by a global business platform and 
robust business processes, designed to enable and scale for rapid organic 
and inorganic growth whilst avoiding unnecessary administrative overheads. 
All of our global business functions are managed centrally from our headquarters 
in London, UK, including sales, marketing, professional services and customer 
support. Corporate and business support functions are also provided centrally 
via Group-wide IT systems.
Creating value Our business
Our execution of the business model 
is generating profitable growth and 
building long-term shareholder value in 
line with Group strategy and no material 
business model changes are expected 
for the foreseeable future.
FOR INVESTORS
The model is designed to build long-term 
shareholder value. The Company has 
delivered significant capital growth over 
the last five years. In addition, cash generation 
is increasing and the Company is now 
commencing a progressive dividend.

Strategic Report
Our development philosophy of delighting customers through delivering 
innovative technology and services underpins all our product advances. 
We aim to be the best and we have moved from challenger to champion 
in many of the markets the Clareti platform serves. We foster a culture 
of co-innovation with our customers and partners and, throughout 2017 , 
this was epitomised through the many customer workshops held at our 
flagship Innovation Labs in Bristol, UK.
The Clareti platform goes through continuous change as we embrace 
innovation in the wider technology industry and respond to the complex 
functionality demands of our customers. The platform is functionally 
rich, very stable and highly scalable. We have demonstrated through 
many customer implementations our ability to respond quickly and 
confidently to changing market requirements, competitive pressures 
and new opportunities. The C24 technology assets are now embedded 
deeply into the platform and play a pivotal role in many implementations.
CTC processes billions of transactions annually across the customer 
base and we estimate that Clareti technology is used by over one 
thousand end users as an essential component of the day to day controls 
environment. Our vision of providing truly exceptional capabilities to 
make sense of vast volumes of fast moving, complex data has been 
realised in these customers.
Clareti-as-a-Service (“CaaS”) is a stable offering and has delivered 
significant total cost of ownership reduction for our customers who have 
opted to deploy in Gresham’s cloud. Our investments in the platform 
continue and we focus on new capabilities that provide benefit for both 
our CaaS and on-premise customers. All our new developments, whether 
for CaaS or on-premise, are designed to be “cloud ready” and many 
are “cloud native” .
The Clareti portfolio continues to expand and, in 2017 , we delivered 
new releases of Clareti ARM, Clareti Loan Control, Clareti Analytics and 
Clareti 24 Integration Objects against an innovation and market-driven 
agenda. We have a long track record of working with partner banks 
on innovation in cash management capabilities and we expect this to 
continue in 2018 with new capabilities to enhance Gresham’s addressable 
market at the major transaction banks. Regulations such as MiFID II, OATS, 
CAT and H4 are all proving to be difficult for the financial services industry 
to respond to and we are adding new platform capabilities as part of our 
general enterprise data management solution to enable customers 
to address these regulatory challenges.
Leading edge solutions
Clareti solutions are designed and developed at our Innovation Labs in Bristol, UK. 
We exploit the latest advances in technology to build leading edge solutions.
INNOVATION IN ACTION
Financial Control
A major Asset Manager (“AM”) had outsourced many of its 
financial controls to a third-party service provider. That service 
provider is utilizing a legacy controls infrastructure that is 
not only costly but fails to deliver against current day demands. 
The AM has now on-boarded CTC for a wide range of 
controls, including nostro reconciliations. CTC has enabled 
the reduction of costs compared to the third party but is 
also providing real-time accurate and complete control 
across their operations.
INNOVATION IN ACTION
RegTech
At a tier 1 North American bank the regulatory demands 
of OATS, H4 and MIFID I and II reporting obligations was a 
major cause of the compliance director’s sleepless nights. 
Producing a report of the bank’s trading activity was 
easy but producing a report that is known to be timely, 
accurate and complete proved to be very difficult. 
CTC was implemented 
to provide a database of 
verifiably timely, accurate 
and complete trading 
and position information 
that allows the bank to 
comply with its ongoing 
regulatory obligations.

There is a growing addressable market for flexible and scalable technology that can

Regulatory drivers
The aftermath of the global financial crisis continues to drive the prevailing 
regulatory landscape in all of our core markets. Regulations such as 
MiFID II, OATS, CAT and H4 include complex data processing and 
control requirements, with the very real risk of regulatory fines and 
reputational damage in the event of breaches. 
The scale of the data volumes involved, the complexities of the 
regulations and the ongoing globalisation of financial services are 
increasing the regulatory burden and cost of compliance. This is 
driving financial institutions to invest in modern and flexible RegTech 
solutions to ensure compliance can be reliably achieved with respect 
to current regulations and potential future regulations alike. 
Clareti’s inherent data management capabilities and scalability have 
enabled us to win three RegTech deals in the year and we expect to 
win further RegTech deals as we add regulatory specific capabilities 
to the platform. We are also seeing opportunities to collaborate with 
clients or consulting firms to build out the platform’s capabilities for 
specific regulatory use cases. 
Geographies
In North America, we are seeing strong market demand for our 
Clareti solutions and our investments in 2018 are aligned to this 
market opportunity. The main drivers we see include modernisation 
and cost reduction requirements, regulatory compliance and the need 
to address new financial products. North America represents our single 
largest addressable market and we are achieving good returns from 
our investments in 2016 and 2017 . Six out of our 15 new CTC clients 
won in 2017 are USA or Canada based, with Clareti revenues from 
North America contributing 39% out of all Clareti revenues in the year. 
The UK remains a core market and we have built a strong and loyal list 
of well-served customers. Around half of our Clareti customers 
are based in the UK, a number of which are regular visitors to our 
Innovation Labs in Bristol, UK or participants at our industry events. 
Market demand drivers are similar to those driving demand in 
North America. Our view is that the UK Senior Managers’ Regime has 
resulted in more extensive approval processes as data compliance 
attracts greater attention from the relevant senior decision-makers.
In Europe, we believe financial institutions are often under-served by 
existing legacy vendors and we see significant opportunity to capitalise 
on this. We won three new CTC clients in Europe in the year including 
the important win in the Nordics announced in December 2017 . We 
continue to track Brexit developments closely and are ready to react to 
potential of threats to our business (in particular to our emerging European 
business) arising from prevailing uncertainties or unfavourable trading 
conditions. However , whilst our Clareti business remains weighted towards 
the UK and North America as it currently is, we do not foresee any material 
adverse impact from any of the realistic outcomes of Brexit negotiations.
In Asia Pacific, we continue to see opportunity in the key financial hubs 
in Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia, but our current resources in this 
region remain limited. Consequently, our focus remains deepening 
our engagements with existing clients, building alliances with 
distribution partners and targeting specific opportunities as they arise.
The scale of the data volumes involved, the complexities 
of the regulations and the ongoing globalisation of 
financial services are increasing the regulatory burden 
and cost of compliance.

Route to long-term success
Our vision is to give financial institutions and their customers confidence in their data 
and certainty in their transaction processing. Our strategic plan is designed to drive 
profitable growth and create long-term shareholder value.
Our Clareti software sales grew to 
£8.2m (up 74%), with gross margins 
continuing to exceed 90%. 
We won 15 new CTC software 
contracts in the year, contributing 
to our closing Clareti annualised 
recurring revenue of £5.7m (up 24%).
Our Clareti business performed 
strongly (up 48% to £11.1m), including 
an excellent contribution from our 
North America operations following 
investments in the region.
The acquisition of C24 Technologies 
in October 2016 was successfully 
integrated and is delivering the 
expected returns.
We have continued to focus our 
marketing activities and messaging on 
enterprise data integrity requirements.
We moved up seven places to 36th in 
the Chartis Global RiskTech100 2018 
and were named Best Innovative 
Technology Provider at the HFM 
European Technology Awards 2017 .
Winning new Clareti software sales with 
significant recurring revenues attached 
remains our priority, and we are directing 
our efforts and investing in new sales 
and distribution capacity to enable this.
We are also developing strategies to 
build recurring services revenues.
We will increase our sales and 
distribution capacity, particularly 
in North America, in order to target 
accelerated Clareti growth. This will be 
supported with new marketing initiatives. 
We will continue to actively pursue 
appropriate acquisition opportunities 
for growth.
We will develop our marketing strategy, 
brand management and communications 
programmes globally, supported by 
the appointment of a Chief Marketing 
Officer and other marketing investments. 
We will improve on our position in the 
Global RiskTech100 register and seek 
other independent third party attestations.

Strategic Report
Our aim is to recognise and address the key risks and uncertainties 
facing Gresham at all levels of our business.
Risk management
There are a number of risk factors that could adversely affect the Group’s 
execution of its strategic plan and, more generally , the Group’s operations, 
business model, financial results, future performance, solvency, or the 
value or liquidity of its equities. The Board is committed to addressing 
these risks by implementing systems for effective risk management and 
internal control. A report on the Board’s review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems can be found in 
the audit committee’s report on page 33.
The Board has performed a robust assessment of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that could threaten Gresham’s business, business 
model, strategies, financial results, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity. The items listed in the table below represent the known 
principal risks and uncertainties, but the table does not list all known 
or potential risks and uncertainties exhaustively. Where possible, 
mitigation steps are taken to safeguard against materialised risks.
FAILURE TO WIN NEW 
CLARETI BUSINESS IN 
LINE WITH PLAN
Central to our strategic growth 
plan is winning new Clareti business. 
Failure to do so would directly impact 
our achievement of overall objectives 
or lengthen the period taken to achieve 
them. Specifically, failure to win new 
Clareti contracts early enough in the year 
would jeopardise our ability to deliver 
the implementations and recognise the 
associated revenues in the year.
CHANGE IN RISK
MITIGATION
I 
Stable
We continue to see strong market 
demand for Clareti solutions, but the 
risks associated with timing, type, 
mix and quantum of revenues remain 
unchanged as these factors are largely 
driven by the customers’ requirements 
and budgeting processes. We are 
growing sales capacity, but return 
on investment takes time due to long 
and unpredictable sales cycles.
We are investing significantly in Clareti 
sales, marketing and distribution capacity 
to build greater pipeline, win new Clareti 
revenues faster and achieve annual 
growth targets. We are concentrating 
new sales investments in the UK and the 
US, where we see the greatest opportunity. 
We continue to expand the Clareti offering 
to extend market reach. Investment 
decisions are reviewed at least quarterly.

ACCELERATED DECLINE IN 
NON-CLARETI REVENUES
We are investing in product development 
and operational requirements to support 
Clareti-led growth. Strategic investments 
such as acquisitions present opportunity 
for accelerated growth. Failing to achieve 
meaningful returns on investments would 
hinder the Group’s strategic growth plan 
and potentially jeopardise the Group’s 
position in the market and its prospects.
Issues or failures with our software 
products or services could lead to 
failed implementations, project delays, 
cost overruns, data loss, security issues, 
customer dissatisfaction, early termination, 
service level breaches and contractual 
claims, all of which could adversely 
impact the Group’s revenues, earnings 
and reputation.
Non-Clareti revenues provide 
a strong contribution to revenues, 
earnings, and cashflow and are key to 
short-term financial success and ongoing 
investments in Clareti. We have planned for 
the gradual decline of non-Clareti revenues 
but an unexpected or accelerated decline 
could have an immediate and significant 
impact on financial KPIs.
CHANGE IN RISK CHANGE IN RISK CHANGE IN RISK
MITIGATION MITIGATION MITIGATION
I 
Stable
Building out a portfolio of Clareti 
products increases the risk of product 
development activities, sales execution 
and market demand becoming misaligned. 
In addition, pursuing acquisitions and 
other strategic investments for inorganic 
growth are inherently speculative to a 
greater or lesser extent, and can be costly 
and time-consuming for management. 
L 
Increasing risk
The risks of servicing financial 
institutions remain substantial. 
We are undertaking increasingly complex 
and challenging projects due to the 
increasing number and varied nature 
of the projects. Risks are generally greater 
with new clients in the early phases of 
projects. Formal RFP processes remain 
the norm, which provide clarity as to 
requirements and expectations.
I 
Stable
Declining revenues from non-Clareti 
solutions continue to offset Clareti 
growth. The long-term decline of 
non-Clareti revenues is expected to 
continue to eventual run-off and the 
rate of decline is determined by outside 
factors. The decline of non-Clareti 
revenues is gradually becoming less 
material to Group performance given 
the growth in Clareti revenues.
The management team has 
been strengthened and centralised 
further, which provides greater 
control and efficiency to operations. 
Strong communication lines between 
the relevant stakeholders are ensured 
through regular formal meetings and 
monthly reporting. The Board reviews 
and challenges all strategic investments.
Gresham mitigates inherent product 
and service risks through robust quality 
assurance and project governance 
processes. Project risks are mitigated by 
implementing strong project management 
processes (including regular meetings, 
change control and reporting), to ensure 
timelines, costs and requirements are 
agreed and managed throughout.
Mitigation against short-term impact 
is provided through the natural spread 
of non-Clareti products, geographies 
and customers. Our forecasts prudently 
allow for attrition in non-Clareti revenues 
based on historical performance and 
customer plans, where known. Gresham Technologies plc

PEOPLE RISKS IP , DATA AND CYBER RISKS
The Group is generally exposed to 
economic, trade and market risk factors, 
such as global or localised economic 
downturn, changing international trade 
relationships, foreign exchange 
fluctuations, consolidation or insolvency 
of existing or prospective customers or 
competitor products, all of which could 
significantly threaten Gresham’s 
performance and prospects.
A loss or material issue with key members 
of staff could cause material disruption and 
a skills shortage. Competitor poaching 
could result in intellectual property 
leakage. Staff misconduct, negligence 
or fraud could cause Gresham significant 
reputational damage and potential 
financial loss.
A significant IP loss, third party IP 
challenge, data loss, security breach or

Gresham’s ability to do business, 
particularly in the short term, and could 
result in significant financial loss.

The ongoing Brexit developments and 
the US policy statements on international 
trade continue to create uncertainty 
regarding future trading arrangements 
between the UK and both Europe and the 
USA respectively. As a result, Gresham may 
experience volatile market conditions in 
those geographies. Other risks in this 
category are generally considered to 
be stable. 
I 
Stable
People risks are currently considered 
to be stable. Rapid growth presents 
opportunities for personal development 
for key staff and engages the workforce 
generally. New senior hires have been 
added throughout the business (including 
HR, sales and marketing) which mitigates 
certain key person risks. 
I 
Stable
There have been no specific issues arising 
and our view is that these risks are stable 
and manageable. However , it is recognised 
that certain risks in this category may 
increase where IP is inherited through 
strategic acquisition. 
Gresham is monitoring political 
developments and will seek to 
mitigate emerging risks where possible. 
Gresham’s high-margin recurring revenues 
provide a level of protection against 
volatile economic or market conditions. 
Gresham’s policy of ongoing product 
development helps Gresham to maintain 
its competitive advantage.
Key staff are identified through 
talent assessments and retention plans 
are implemented, including through 
long-term incentives aligned to shareholder 
interests. Security and access control 
systems, internal governance processes 
and compliance procedures are in place 
to mitigate conduct risks.
We implement information security 
processes covering internal and client 
facing IT systems. These processes are 
overseen by Gresham’s information 
security committee, which reports 
formally to the Board at least every 
six months.

15 new CTC customers
Introduction
The Group delivered another strong performance in 2017 , once again 
underpinned by strong organic revenue growth from Clareti solutions. 
We won 15 new CTC customers and grew licence revenues from our 
existing Clareti base. In addition, during the year we successfully 
integrated the C24 Technologies business and grew the acquired annuity 
base. As a result, annualised recurring revenue from Clareti has grown 
24% year on year. We now have more than 80 Clareti customers across 
financial services and global markets. In addition, many corporates are 
using Clareti technology in their business every day via our bank white 
labelling partners. 
In 2016 and through 2017 , we invested in new sales resources to focus 
on continental European sales and to expand our initial footprint in the 
United States. We now have experienced new business sales teams in 
the UK and Europe and in the US and it was pleasing to see strong 
success in those geographies.
UK and Europe 
2017 started strongly for our new European office with an important 
new customer win, a regional bank in central Europe. The initial 
deployments are in support of the bank’s treasury function and 
capital markets business covering foreign exchange, over-the-counter 
trading, exchange traded derivatives and inter-company transactions. 
Our European team also signed the Swiss subsidiary of a major Russian 
bank and finished the year with an important contract with a major 
bank in the Nordics to implement a strategic data integrity and control 
framework in its wholesale banking operations. All three contracts will 
see the deployment of CTC to replace local processes, legacy systems 
and user developed applications, with Clareti Adapters being used to 
integrate complex financial messaging data flows. All three clients 
selected CTC following robust tender processes where Gresham was 
pitched head-to-head with incumbents and other competitors. 
Our UK team also had a positive year winning an important project with 
a large global asset manager to replace a legacy vendor reconciliation 
system. In common with many of our customer contracts, we also agreed 
a framework for licence growth over time as more use cases are identified 
across their business. We also won two further UK-based hedge fund 
clients during the year and our recent recognition for being the 
“Most Innovative Technology Firm” in hedge funds by HFM in both 
their European and US awards is further evidence that our offering for 
alternative investment managers is particularly strong. Winning repeatable 
business in targeted industry niches is important for us to scale efficiently 
and it was pleasing to secure our second win in the energy and 
commodities market. 
North America
During 2017 , we were pleased to see the rewards coming through 
from our investment into the North American market and we continue 
to be positive about the market drivers and longer-term opportunity. 
In the US and Canada, financial firms need to transparently prove 
the integrity of the data that drives their regulatory reporting and risk 
management processes and the Clareti platform is ideally suited 
to these complex use cases.
One of Canada’s largest banks selected CTC to provide assurance of 
their regulatory reporting of collateral across all markets and all asset 
classes. The system will also be extended to replace existing manually 
intensive reconciliation and control processes in their securities division. 
This customer is also deploying Clareti Analytics to provide deeper 
management insight into their data control operations. 
In the second half of the year, the US capital markets division of one 
of Asia’s largest financial services firms selected CTC to replace manual 
intensive data integrity checks and enable senior management to certify 
and be accountable for the quality of trading related data as it moves 
throughout the organisation.
A global sell-side bank selected the Clareti platform to support the 
implementation of a modern global regulatory control framework and 
prove the integrity of regulatory data and associated reporting processes. 
The initial implementation is within the customer’s US capital markets 
business with the potential for deployment across other jurisdictions 
in the future. 
Whilst regulatory use cases have been behind many of our new 
North America sales, there is ongoing demand for traditional 
reconciliation systems and the US market in particular is heavily 
dominated by inflexible old vendor systems. 
In a relative short period, North America has grown to represent 
25% of Clareti ARR and is also now pulling through demand for 
implementation services. 
Asia Pacific
Our Asia Pacific focus in 2017 was primarily to develop our major accounts 
in this region. Our relationship with Australia and New Zealand Banking 
Group (“ANZ”) continues to grow and become increasingly strategic. 
Our long-standing relationship with ANZ was initiated in 2011 when 
Gresham was selected to build a bank-to-corporate receivable 
matching service for use by ANZ’s institutional corporates, as a result 
of which ANZ became an early adopter of CTC.  Gresham Technologies plc
Annual Financial Report 2017 20
Strategic Report
Operational review continued
Asia Pacific continued
In 2014, ANZ deployed CTC in its global markets business to enhance 
its pre and post trade controls. During 2017 , we helped ANZ expand 
its portfolio of corporate cash management offerings with an 
innovative solution that brings the power of the Clareti platform to its 
mid-market business customers. This is an excellent example of an 
established bank partnering with an agile FinTech provider to deliver 
solutions rapidly. The relationship continues to deliver a steady beat-rate 
of professional service revenues, a growing Clareti subscription and 
further opportunities for 2018 and beyond.
In addition to our major account management activities, we were 
pleased to sign a further project licence with one of Australia’s leading 
wealth management groups to use CTC to support a multi-year 
systems migration programme.
Partnering and alliances
We believe partners will increasingly drive incremental business 
and we invested during 2017 to build a global programme which we 
intend to scale in 2018.
Our long-standing white label agreements with two global banks 
in accounts receivables management continue to deliver a steadily 
growing recurring revenue stream. Our first US Clareti partner, a major 
financial services organisation which selected CTC as a white labelled 
offering in 2014 to upsell its asset management clients, won a third 
and fourth end customer in the US during the year. 
The success of Clareti technology in the main financial markets has 
also come to the attention of the systems integrators and consulting 
firms. During the year, we signed multiple partner agreements with 
firms to introduce and/or implement our solutions and have run boot 
camp training and are building accreditation programmes. One major 
systems integrator has now delivered two successful projects and 
is embarking on its third.
In December, a leading provider of capital markets data, trade 
matching and regulatory reporting services to the global securities 
market, selected CTC to deliver a new regulatory service to its clients, 
for which a marketing launch is being planned. In 2018 we will continue 
to scale up our introducer, delivery partner and white label partnerships, 
and we will also intend to develop a reseller channel into the key 
Asian financial markets for CTC and C24.
Customer success and delivery
We aim to provide our customers with a differentiated experience 
compared to the long-established enterprise software players and 
have been scaling up our global delivery and customer support 
operation in line with business growth.
Our consulting operations work closely with the sales function to 
ensure that we secure rapid implementation success and reference 
ability across the customer base and to ensure that consulting is 
profitable on a standalone basis. Throughout 2017 , we typically had 
around a dozen implementation projects and several pre-sale proofs 
of concept underway at any given point in time. 
We offer customers a cloud or on-premise deployment option, 
although the majority still select to run their systems in-house. This 
flexibility means that we continue to win business against cloud-only 
SAAS competitors. During the year, one of our existing US hedge fund 
clients chose to upgrade their subscription and move to a fully managed 
Clareti-as-a-Service (CaaS) cloud deployment and one of our larger 
insurance customers went live on CaaS delivering a very strong ROI 
back to the business.
In light of our success in North America, we are now investing into 
local delivery resources through secondments and full time staff as 
well as partnerships. 
Clareti product and innovation
During 2017 , our Innovation Labs in Bristol hosted many client 
and prospect visits. Our ongoing commitment to innovation, our 
collaborative approach to working with customers, and our agile, 
high quality, software development processes are seen to be strong 
aspects of our overall value proposition in the market.
Clareti Transaction Control continues to be our flagship offering and 
is widely regarded as the best enterprise solution on the market. Its 
modern architecture and innovative features means we fare very well 
with prospects running formal evaluations and robust tender processes. 
During 2017 , we delivered enhancements to the “on-boarding” data 
ingestion capability as well as improvements to ease of use and ease 
of maintenance. We have been building more sophisticated exception 
management capabilities and developing the platform’s use of automation, 
natural language processing and machine learning technology.
During 2017 , the C24 technology acquired in late 2016 was integrated 
into the Clareti platform and has been sold and deployed multiple times 
as part of new CTC projects in the form of Clareti Adapters, alongside 
several standalone sales. The C24 technology is delivering the expected 
benefits and provides competitive differentiation with prospects with 
significant and/or complex message transformation requirements.
In the first part of the year, we launched Clareti Analytics as an enhanced 
reporting and data visualisation capability for management. This has 
proved to be a strong sales differentiator and a key part of several deals 
in the second half of the year. We have also secured two up-sells into 
the existing CTC installed base.
Our joint venture with Mount Street Loan Solutions LLP , one of 
Europe’s leading commercial real estate servicers, to develop Clareti 
Loan Control (“CLC”) has now delivered a market ready offering, and 
whilst no incremental sales were achieved in 2017 , there is potential 
for additional revenues as Mount Street increases its usage of CLC and, 
more widely, we believe that there is a significant market opportunity 
to sell CLC into financial institutions.
Other business
The Clareti business is now larger than the Group’s entire legacy 
licensing and services portfolio and our dependency on these various 
older businesses is now much reduced. Nevertheless, we continue to 
manage the portfolio carefully to optimise our returns. In 2017 , our legacy 
portfolio performed broadly in line with our business plan. The Gresham 
owned EDT and VME software businesses remained relatively stable 
throughout the year and operated at high margins. Our third party 
software partner business was partially exited, which was planned for, 
and resulted in a lower contracted baseline. This reduction was offset 
by an increase in our lower margin contracting business in Australia.

In the year ending 31 December 2017 (“FY2017”) our Clareti business 
grew 48% to become more than half of our business on all revenue 
measures, and became break-even and cash generative as a standalone 
business. This achievement, coupled with the ongoing stability of our 
existing cash-strong, non-Clareti businesses which were up 4% year on 
year, meant we recorded strong year-on-year increases across all 
Group revenue, earnings and cash metrics. 
In the last three years, we have achieved compound annual growth 
rates (“CAGR”) of 19% in Group revenues, 59% in adjusted earnings 
per share (adjusted and fully diluted) and become free-cashflow 
generative as our investments in Clareti are being realised and generate 
higher margin revenues which continue to grow strongly.
Earnings per share is calculated as fully diluted and adjusted to add back 
share-based payment charges, exceptional items and amortisation from 
acquired intangible assets.
Free-cashflow is calculated as cash inflow arising from operating 
activities (excluding working capital impact) less net cashflows associated 
with acquiring and disposing of tangible and intangible fixed assets.
In FY2017 Clareti grew 48%

Revenues continued
Clareti Solutions
The Clareti business recorded another strong year of growth with Clareti 
revenues rising £3.6m (48%) to £11.1m following the increases of 42% in 
FY2016 and 51% in FY2015 as the benefits of our previous investments 
in product, sales & marketing, delivery and associated infrastructure 
provide a strong return on investment. Clareti revenues now exceed 
the Group’s revenues from all other products and service lines combined. 
We continue to plan and invest for similar levels of growth in the financial 
year 2018 and beyond.
The Group continues with its strategic aim to focus revenue opportunities 
on annuity-based models to increase recurring revenue and visibility 
of future revenues that are either contracted or generally expected to 
renew on an annual basis. We made strong progress against this aim, 
with recognised Clareti recurring revenues increasing £2.4m (83%) 
to £5.3m in FY2017 compared to the previous period. Excluding the 
C24 acquisition in October 2016, this increase year on year was £1.5m 
(58%). Our annualised recurring Clareti revenues at 31 December 2017 
totalled £5.7m, up £1.1m (24%) compared to 31 December 2016 due 
to the addition of annuity revenues from customer wins in the year and 
existing customers’ increased usage. 
Non-recurring Clareti software revenues (initial licence fees) were 
up 61% in FY2017 as we were able to deliver more and larger deals 
from our enlarged sales team and marketing investments. The Group 
has continued with the policy adopted in the prior year of granting 
fixed-term licence grants (typically three to five years) rather than perpetual 
licences for customers for whom subscription licensing is not appropriate. 
This has opened up charging for additional future periods of use for 
these customers beyond the fixed licence term of the contract with the 
first of these additional chargeable periods beginning in 2020. To date, 
we have achieved initial licence fees under term agreements totalling £4.0m 
that we anticipate will repeat from 2020 onwards either as repeat upfront 
fees or additional annuity revenues of an equivalent £0.9m per annum; 
this is in addition to our stated annualised recurring revenue as at 
31 December 2017 which incorporates annually recurring revenues only. 
Clareti services revenues were up by 4% and £0.1m to £2.9m, continuing 
the high levels of realisation and utilisation seen in the prior year as our 
services resources provided new and existing customers with consulting 
services to enable and increase Clareti use within their organisations. 
Other Solutions
The Group’s Other Solutions grew by £0.9m (9%) to £10.6m in FY2017 
although within this software revenues saw a decline and services a sharp 
increase as the shape of the portfolio changed markedly year on year.
Non-Clareti software revenues from partners are down £0.9m (23%) 
to £3.1m as one of our legacy partner relationships exited as planned 
in FY2017 . This arrangement had a net contribution of 50%. 
Non-Clareti software revenues from our other legacy products decreased 
as planned, as customers moved off from ageing platforms to newer 
technologies. This level of attrition is planned to persist as these 
technology shifts continue although the longevity of these very old 
legacy products continues to surpass our expectations. 
Non-Clareti services are mostly (~90%) in respect of tactical contracting 
services provided to a strategically important Australian banking partner 
that generate a direct net contribution to the Group of approximately 
13%. Whilst these contracting services are difficult to forecast, we 
anticipate these low-margin revenues with this strategically important 
partner will continue for the foreseeable future.
Earnings
Operating performance is analysed excluding exceptional items, share option charges and amortisation from acquired intangible assets, which is 
consistent with the way in which the Board reviews the financial results of the Group.
2017 2016 Variance %
Gross margin £m 18.4 14.2 4.2 30%
Gross margin % 85 83 2 2%
Adjusted EBITDA KPI £m 5.1 3.8 1.3 34%
Adjusted EBITDA KPI % 24 22 2 9%
Statutory profit after tax £m 3.8 2.6 1.2 46%
Adjusted Diluted EPS KPI pence 6.5 4.7 1.8 38%
The Group’s gross margin rose to 85% in FY2017 from the 83% in FY2016, driven in whole by the additional contribution from increased Clareti revenue.
Our gross margin continues to be affected by the split of contracting service revenues that are provided by third party contractors (which is recorded 
in cost of sales) and individuals we bring on our payroll as fixed-term employees (which is recorded in administration costs). Excluding the impact 
of the differences of these split in contractor and staff costs year on year, our gross margin still rose by 2% to 75% in FY2017 from 73% in FY2016.
The Group delivered another strong increase in earnings with adjusted EBITDA rising by 34% and £1.3m to £5.1m, as the increased gross margin 
delivered by higher Clareti revenues was in part offset by planned investments throughout the Group’s operations and, in particular, in sales and 
marketing expenditure in both EMEA and North America. 
We also saw less development cost capitalised and a larger amortisation charge as planned which is a sign of our emerging product portfolio 
and a trend we anticipate will continue. The net impact of development capitalisation and amortisation to the Group Income Statement in FY2017 
was £2.2m (FY2016: £2.9m).
The vast majority (95% plus) of our Group’s spend on staff, buildings and overheads continues to be in respect of our Clareti business. Gresham Technologies plc
Annual Financial Report 2017 23
Strategic Report
Exceptional items
During the year the Group incurred exceptional costs completing the integration of C24 Technologies Limited; exceptional legal costs associated 
with the establishment of our joint venture and all-staff incentive scheme; and exceptional recruitment costs associated with the recruitment of a new 
CFO. These costs totalled £149,000 and are offset by exceptional income arising from the fair value adjustment of the C24 contingent consideration 
of £59,000, resulting in a net exceptional charge of £90,000 (2016: £275,000).
Taxation
For the year ended 31 December 2017 , the Group has recorded a net tax credit of £0.7m (2016: £0.4m) which, as in prior years, is primarily as a 
result of research and development enhanced relief available for our UK development activities, offset with taxation payable both in the UK and 
overseas in respect of our reselling and servicing operations. The Group did not surrender losses for R&D tax credit cash refund and losses have 
instead been directly utilised at full value against current and future UK taxable profits as was the case last year.

Bank deposits 0.2 — 0.2 n/a
The Group’s financial position remained strong at 31 December 2017 
with cash of £8.5m and no debt (2016: £7 .2m and no debt). This increase 
in cash was due to £2.2m arising from operations less capital expenditure 
(2016: £0.5m) as the Group’s increasing Clareti revenues and earnings 
were offset by a lower capital expenditure amount as we spent less 
on development due to releasing temporary development resources 
engaged in FY2016, and less development spend has been capitalised 
as certain parts of our Clareti portfolio begin to mature. Working capital 
remained stable, as large prior year working capital differences reversed in 
FY2017 but were offset by further cash inflows from new customers wins.
The net operating and capital expenditure cash inflow is offset by 
£0.7m payable as part of the October 2016 C24 acquisition (2016: inflow 
of £0.4m being consideration payable net of the associated placing).
With increasing Clareti sales from the growing annuity base and new 
customer wins, coupled with tight cost control of planned investments, 
we expect the cash generation capacity of the business to continue and 
are looking at opportunities to best utilise the excess cash we have, 
either through bank deposits or to support our M&A ambitions.
Financial outlook
The Group continues to deliver consistent year-on-year Clareti growth 
as our planned investments in product, sales and marketing, delivery 
and associated infrastructure over the previous prior seven years are 
yielding a strong return.
Our non-Clareti parts of our business that have provided good quality, 
stable cashflow to invest in Clareti during the previous seven years are 
decreasing as customers are moving to newer or alternative solutions as 
planned. Whilst we anticipate these revenues will decline in the long 
term, there remains nothing to suggest these will drop off significantly 
in the short term beyond the planned partner exit that occurred in FY2017 . 
These revenues as a portfolio continue to exceed our expectations despite 
our strategic focus on Clareti.
Overall our Clareti growth is significant compared to the rate of decline 
in our legacy business and as a combined Group we are achieving higher 
revenues, higher margins and earnings and strong cash generation 
as Clareti and its portfolio of applications continues to grow and the 
non-Clareti elements of our business become less material. We aim to 
continue this program of expansion and have planned investments for 
FY2018 and beyond across all aspects of our Group to drive growth 
but remain cognisant of the need to generate incremental earnings 
and cash generation to remain an exciting proposition for investors, 
customers, staff and partners.

have been implemented as a result of this.
Our aim is to be a highly valued, engaging and responsible employer 
across the Group, where people are encouraged to excel. We benchmark 
ourselves against the best companies in our sector and we challenge 
ourselves to be an awesome place to work.
We know that people are key to our collective expertise and our growth

We seek to foster a culture of innovation and empowerment where 
talent, enterprise and collaboration is recognised and rewarded.
Attracting, retaining and developing our talent
We implement Group-wide strategies designed to attract, retain

CHARITY
We work with charities to responsibly recycle our old, used IT equipment. 
One of these charities is Jamie’s Computers which refurbishes the 
equipment and uses it to provide work experience and hands-on 
training to hard-to-reach groups. Its aim is to help improve skills 
and increase employability. Anything that cannot be reused is recycled 
responsibly and all equipment is data destructed and certificated. 
Each quarter we donate £1 to three local charities for each support call 
made into our customer support centres. These three charities are chosen 
by ballot by our global teams and often have a personal connection 
with employees. We are pleased to have been able to support 
charities such as BeyondBlue, an Australian charity offering support and 
raising awareness of mental health, and SMART , a North American charity 
started by a doctor whose son suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, 
known personally by one of our team.
As a company that uses the power 
of technology to improve the way 
organisations operate, we are 
committed to supporting, developing 
and helping to educate the future 
workforce about this sector.
We are proud to be Business Class 
members of The Prince’s Responsible Business Network, 
through our partnership with Business In The Community 
(“BITC”). Initiatives and activities include:
 • Working with computer science teachers to help their development 
and understanding of real-work application of IT through 1-2-1 coaching 
and workplace visits.
 • T eacher workshops supported by our employees to help to 
embed sector employability skills into the curriculum.
 • Developing young people’s employability skills through 
Dragons’ Den type activities.
 • Raising awareness of career pathways in our sector through 
delivering “get into the sector” programmes in school and 
raising awareness of the career pathways
 • Mentoring programmes for girls undertaking their Computer 
Science GCSE.
We also proudly sponsor OCRFC – a youth rugby team in London 
that coaches and mentors disadvantaged young men. We share much 
of our ethos with that of a rugby team – doing the hard yards, respect, 
discipline, teamwork and enjoying the game.
Our hiring model is based 
on creating an agile, highly 
motivated and collaborative 
international workforce.
Graduate and apprenticeship programme
Our early in career entry programmes are one of the ways that we 
attract promising new colleagues into the business. Our graduate 
programmes within our professional services and development 
teams have been running for several years with minimal attrition. 
Within our IT support function, we have been successfully supporting 
IT apprentices. In 2017 , we introduced an industrial placement 
programme which has proved successful and we are looking to 
expand this further during 2018.
Engaging with our people
Employees are invited to attend regular meetings within individual 
segments throughout the Group, in addition to regular Group-wide 
communications. Performance appraisals happen formally at mid and 
full year, but we encourage ongoing dialogue throughout the year to 
ensure that employees are getting sufficient support from the Group 
(including training needs) in order to be successful in their roles.
We believe that it is very important to achieve high levels of trust 
between individuals within the Group as this promotes high levels 
of staff engagement and helps to ensure that the working environment 
is pleasant, healthy and sustainable. Gresham Technologies plc

ENVIRONMENT
Policy statement
Whilst the nature of our activities is such that the Group does not 
have a significant impact on the environment relative to other industries, 
we recognise that we have a duty to manage our business affairs and 
operations in a sustainable and responsible manner. This includes 
minimising the impact of our activities on the environment and to 
supporting environmental initiatives relevant to our industry. To achieve 
this, Gresham’s environmental strategy consists of the following:
 • minimising waste;
 • minimising toxic emissions;
 • actively promoting recycling in all of its locations;
 • meet or exceed all applicable environmental legislation that 
relates to Gresham;
 • support, adopt and/or promote industry initiatives designed to 
address environmental issues specific to Gresham’ s sector;
 • where practical, seeking to purchase products that uphold industry 
leading environmental standards rather than ones that do not; and
 • encouraging the adoption of similar principles by its suppliers.
Sustainability continued
Carbon emissions 
This section includes Gresham’s mandatory reporting of greenhouse 
gas emissions pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 (“Regulations”).
Gresham’s reporting year is the same as its fiscal year, being the year 
ended 31 December 2017 . This greenhouse gas reporting year has 
been established to align with our financial reporting year.
Gresham reports emissions data using an operational control 
approach to define organisational boundary, which meets the 
definitional requirements of the Regulations in respect of those 
emissions for which it is responsible. Gresham has reported on all 
material emission sources which it deems itself to be responsible for. 
These sources align with Gresham’s operational control and financial 
control boundaries. Gresham does not have responsibility for any 
emission sources that are beyond the boundary of Gresham’s 
operational control. For example, business travel other than by car 
(including, for example, commercial flights or railways) and fully 
managed offices are not within Gresham’s operational control and, 
therefore, are not considered to be its responsibility.
The methodology used to calculate Gresham’s emissions is based 
on the “Environmental Reporting Guidelines: including mandatory 
greenhouse gas emissions reporting guidance” (June 2013) issued 
by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“Defra”). 
Gresham has also utilised Defra’s 2016 conversion factors within 
the reporting methodology.
As regards global greenhouse gas emissions data, for the year ended 
31 December 2017:

Emissions data has been reported for Gresham’s operations in Australia 
and the UK, with locations in Malaysia, North America and Singapore 
considered not material to the scope of this reporting. 
In order to express Gresham’s annual emissions in relation to a quantifiable 
factor associated with the Group’s activities, the Directors have used 
revenue as Gresham’s intensity ratio as this is the most relevant indication 
of its growth and provides for the best comparative measure over time.
We recognise that we have a duty 
to manage our business affairs 
and operations in a sustainable 
and responsible manner. Gresham Technologies plc

ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES
We are committed to corporate sustainability and to an ethical and 
principled approach of doing business.
Human rights
This includes recognising and supporting the protection of human rights 
around the world. Gresham is guided by internationally proclaimed 
fundamental principles such as those set out in the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Gresham’s key principles in 
relation to human rights are guided by the Ten Principles of the UN 
Global Compact.
Modern slavery
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human 
rights. We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and we 
are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business 
dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective 
systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place 
anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains. 
We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own 
business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout 
our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the 
Modern Slavery Act 2015. We expect the same high standards from all 
of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners, and wherever 
possible as part of our contracting processes, we include specific 
prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labour, 
or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children, and 
we expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same 
high standards.
Anti-corruption and bribery
The Company is committed to applying the highest standards of ethical 
conduct and integrity to its business activities in the UK and overseas. 
The Company does not tolerate any form of bribery, whether direct or 
indirect, by, or of, its employees, officers, agents or consultants or any 
persons or companies acting for it or on its behalf. The Directors and 
senior management are committed to implementing and enforcing 
effective systems throughout the Company to prevent, monitor and 
eliminate bribery, in accordance with its obligations under the Bribery 
Act 2010 and equivalent legislation overseas.
Equal opportunity
The Company is an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to 
ensuring that our workplaces are free from unlawful or unfair discrimination 
in accordance with applicable legislation. This includes upholding the 
following principles:
 • recruitment and employment decisions are made on the basis of fair 
and objective criteria;
 • person and job specifications are limited to those requirements which 
are necessary for the effective performance of the job. Specifically , full 
consideration is given to applications for employment from disabled 
persons where the candidate’s particular aptitudes and abilities are 
consistent with adequately meeting the requirements of the job;
 • interviews are conducted on an objective basis; personal or home 
commitments will not form the basis of employment decisions except 
where necessary and relevant; and
 • all employees have a right to equality of opportunity . Opportunities are 
available to disabled employees for training, career development 
and promotion. Where existing employees become disabled, it is 
the Group’ s policy to provide continuing employment wherever 
practicable in the same or an alternative position and to provide 
appropriate training to achieve this aim.

environment for sustainable and robust debate. In the year, the Board 
has constructively and proactively challenged management on Group 
strategies, proposals, operating performance and key decisions, as 
part of its ongoing work to assess and safeguard the position and 
prospects of the Group. 
Key risks and uncertainties affecting the business are regularly assessed 
and updated. The Board challenges management to ensure appropriate 
risk mitigation measures are in place. The Board has completed a full, 
specific review of the Group’s key risks and uncertainties (see page 16), 
in light of the new and emerging risks or uncertainties arising from the 
Group’s strategic growth plans and the wider economic, political and 
market conditions. 
Once again, the composition of the Board has seen further changes, 
with Mr A Balchin replacing Mr C Errington and Non-Executive Director 
and chair of the audit committee, and Mr T Mullan replacing Mr R Grubb 
as Chief Financial Officer as of 13 March 2018. These appointments have 
been overseen and recommended by the nomination committee and, 
whilst I am pleased with the current balance of skills, experience and 
independence on the Board, we will continue to keep this under 
review as the Group and its needs evolve.
The current composition of the Board demonstrates our further 
progress towards achieving full compliance with the Corporate 
Governance Code, with a majority of our Non-Executive Directors 
satisfying the criteria for independence.
As regards remuneration, we have made progress in the year in 
establishing the all-staff Deferred Share Bonus Plan 2017 , which 
should prove to be a significant milestone in our bid to attract, retain 
and engage talented staff in our sector, which is highly competitive. 
For Executives, the remuneration committee intends to review the 
remuneration policy and incentivisation arrangements in the course 
of 2018 to ensure that our structures are appropriately aligned with 
long-term shareholder objectives and in line with remuneration 
industry guidelines. Further details will be provided to shareholders 
in due course. 
Finally, the Board continues to engage with shareholders and welcomes 
ongoing dialogue throughout the year, as well as through the formal 
shareholder events, which include the capital markets day and the 
Annual General Meeting. The Board has reviewed its communications 
policy for 2018, as it does at least annually, and has taken account of 
shareholder feedback throughout the year and the changing 
regulatory requirements. 
As always, I welcome shareholder attendance and participation at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Corporate Governance
Statement of corporate governance
This statement explains how the Company has applied the main and supporting principles of corporate governance and describes the Company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, as published in April 2016 by the Financial Reporting Council and available 
at www.frc.org.uk. All references to the Company are in respect of the statutory entity Gresham Technologies plc, which is the ultimate parent 
undertaking of the Gresham Group of companies.
Statement by the Directors on compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company has complied with the relevant provisions (Provisions) set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (Code) throughout the 
year with the exception of the matters referred to below:
Provisions Exceptions and explanations
B1.2: the board should include at least two independent 
non-executive directors.
B2.1: the nomination committee should include a majority 
of independent non-executive directors.
C1.3: the audit committee should include at least two 
independent non-executive directors. 
D2.1: the remuneration committee should include at least 
two independent non-executive directors.
Prior to Mr A Balchin’s appointment in May 2017 , the Company did not comply 
with these Provisions as it only had one independent Non-Executive Director, 
namely Ms I Joss.
Mr K Archer is not considered to be independent as a result of his participation in the 
Group’s share option scheme in December 2010 (see below), and Mr C Errington 
(resigned May 2017) was not considered to be independent due to previously being 
Chief Executive and having a paid role with Kestrel Partners LLP , a significant shareholder. 
The Company has complied with these Provisions since Mr A Balchin’s appointment 
in May 2017 to the Board as independent Non-Executive Director and to each of 
the audit committee (as chairman), the nomination committee (as member) and the 
remuneration committee (as member).
D1.3: remuneration for non-executive directors should not 
include share options.
Mr K Archer was granted share options under the Group’s share option scheme 
established in December 2010. Details of Directors’ interests in options are set out 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. The Group’s Share Option Scheme 2010 
was approved following consultation with significant shareholders. The grant to 
Mr K Archer was considered to be necessary in light of the circumstances at that 
time. No further grants to Non-Executive Directors are planned.
The Board and its committees
Board composition
The Board is currently comprised of the Non-Executive Chairman, 
two Executive Directors and two Non-Executive Directors.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are distinct, set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for 
the effectiveness of the Board and ensuring communication with 
shareholders, and the Chief Executive is accountable for the 
management of the Group.
Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and assist in 
the development of strategy. They scrutinise the performance 
of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and 
monitor the reporting of performance. 
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, Ms I Joss, is available 
to shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman or Chief Executive has failed to resolve or for which 
such contact is inappropriate.
The Company Secretary is Mr J Cathie who was appointed to the 
role on 21 March 2014. Mr J Cathie is not a Director of the Company. 
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
for the Board as a whole.
Operation of the Board
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management 
of the Group. A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the financial statements is set out on page 48 and a viability 
statement and a statement on going concern are given on page 45.
The Board normally meets once a month and has a formal schedule 
of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. These include 
strategic planning, business acquisitions and disposals, authorisation 
of major capital expenditure and material unusual contractual 
arrangements, setting policies for the conduct of business and 
approval of budgets and financial statements. Other matters are 
delegated to the Executive Directors, supported by policies for 
reporting to the Board. Presentations are made to the main Board at 
each monthly Board meeting by the Executive Directors and also on 
regular occasions by operational management.
The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for ensuring that 
Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations 
are complied with and for advising the Board, through the Chairman, 
on corporate governance matters. The Company maintains appropriate 
insurance cover in respect of legal action against the Company’s 
Directors and the Company Secretary, but no cover exists in the event 
that the Director is found to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
The Non-Executive Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are 
able to meet without Executives present prior to each Board meeting. 
The agenda and relevant briefing papers for each Board meeting are 
distributed by the Company Secretary, usually a week in advance of 
each Board meeting.
Where Directors have concerns which cannot be resolved about the 
running of the Company or a proposed action, these concerns are 
recorded in Board minutes. On resignation, a Non-Executive Director 
is required to provide a written statement to the Chairman for circulation 
to the Board if there are any such concerns. Gresham Technologies plc
Annual Financial Report 2017 31
Corporate Governance
The Board has formed certain committees, namely an audit committee, a remuneration committee and a nomination committee, to deal with the 
specific aspects of the Group’s affairs. Each of the committees is governed by terms of reference available on the Company’s website. Details of the 
committees’ constituent members and the roles, responsibilities and activities of each of the committees are described in more detail in the individual 
committee reports commencing page 33.

Induction, training and performance evaluation
Induction and training
New Directors receive a thorough and tailored induction on their 
appointment to the Board covering the activities of the Group and its 
key business and financial risks, the terms of reference of the Board 
and its committees and the latest financial information about the 
Group. A full induction programme was provided for Mr A Balchin, 
who joined the Board on 15 May 2017 . 
The Chairman ensures that Directors update their skills, knowledge 
and familiarity with the Group required to fulfil their roles on the Board 
and committees. Ongoing training is provided as necessary and includes 
updates from the Company Secretary on changes to the Listing Rules, 
requirements under the Companies Act and other regulatory matters. 
Directors may consult with the Company Secretary at any time on 
matters related to their role on the Board. All Directors have access to 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense where 
they judge it necessary to discharge their duties, with requests for such 
advice being authorised by the Chairman or the Company Secretary.
Evaluation of the Board’s performance
The Board has undertaken a formal review encompassing the performance 
of the Board as a whole, its committees and each Director. In performing 
these reviews, criteria that are taken into account include the ability of the 
Director to take the perspective of creating shareholder value; to contribute 
to the development of strategy and identification of risks; to provide 
clarity of direction to management; to be a source of wise counsel; to 
bring a broad perspective to discussions and an understanding of key 
issues; to commit the time required to fulfil the role; and to listen to 
and respect the ideas of fellow Directors and management.
The Chairman has formally reviewed the performance of Ms I Joss 
and Mr A Balchin and satisfied himself that their performance continues 
to be effective and that they continue to demonstrate commitment to 
the role. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is responsible 
for, and has undertaken, the performance evaluation of the Chairman, 
taking into account the views of the other Directors and the criteria 
above, and is satisfied that his performance continues to be effective 
and that he continues to demonstrate commitment to the role.
Retirement and re-election
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM 
immediately following their appointment and thereafter are subject 
to re-election at intervals of no more than three years, or annually for 
any Non-Executive Director who has served for more than nine years. 
All Non-Executive Directors are appointed for fixed terms in line with 
corporate governance requirements.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Board as a whole is responsible for ensuring that a dialogue is 
maintained with shareholders based on the mutual understanding 
of objectives.
Members of the Board meet with major shareholders on a regular 
basis, including presentations after the Company’s announcement 
of the year-end results and at the half year. 
The Board is kept informed of the views of shareholders at each Board 
meeting through a report from the Chief Executive together with formal 
feedback on shareholders’ views gathered and supplied by the Company’s 
advisers. The views of private and smaller shareholders, typically arising 
from the AGM or from direct contact with the Company, are also 
communicated to the Board on a regular basis.
Ms I Joss, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, 
and Mr K Archer, the Non-Executive Chairman, are available to 
shareholders if they have concerns where contact through the 
normal channel of Chief Executive has failed to resolve or for which 
such contact is inappropriate.
Constructive use of the AGM
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with private and institutional 
investors and welcomes their participation. All members of the Board 
attended the Company’s last AGM, and the Chairman aims to ensure 
that all members of the Board will be available at the forthcoming AGM.
Details of resolutions to be proposed at the AGM can be found in 
the Notice of the Meeting. A separate resolution is proposed for each 
substantially separate issue including a separate resolution relating 
to the Annual Financial Report 2017 . Gresham Technologies plc

Corporate Governance
Statement of corporate governance continued
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
The Board is responsible for presenting a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position and prospects, extending to 
Interim Reports and other price-sensitive public reports and reports 
to regulators as well as to information required to be presented by 
statutory requirements. A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities 
is set out on page 48.
Management and specialists within the Group’s finance department 
are responsible for ensuring the appropriate maintenance of financial 
records and processes that ensure all financial information is relevant, 
reliable, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, and 
distributed both internally and externally in a timely manner. A review 
of the consolidation and financial statements is completed by management 
to ensure that the financial position and results of the Group are 
appropriately reported. All financial information published by the 
Group is subject to the approval of the audit committee.
Going concern
The Directors are required to report that the business is a going 
concern, with supporting assumptions and qualifications as necessary. 
The Directors have concluded that the business is a going concern as 
further explained in the Directors’ Report on page 45.
Viability statement pursuant to Provision C2.2 of the Code
The Directors confirm that they have assessed the prospects of the Group 
over a three-year period commencing 1 January 2018 and that they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for that period. 
The Directors have selected a period of three years as they consider 
this to be a reasonable and appropriate duration on which to make the 
assessment, based on the following factors: the Group operates rolling 
financial projections which extend for the current and up to two subsequent 
financial years; and the Directors’ evaluation of the forward-looking 
order book for Clareti revenues, with Clareti contracts typically being 
signed for three-year minimum contract terms, balanced against the 
likely attrition rate of non-Clareti revenues. 
In making this statement, the Directors have considered the Group’s 
current position and the potential impact of the principal risks and 
uncertainties described on page 16 on the Group’s business model 
(including, without limitation, the potential impact of Brexit, which is 
also discussed on page 11), future performance, solvency or liquidity, 
taking account of severe but reasonable scenarios and the effectiveness 
of any mitigating actions, and have performed stress test analyses 
based on likely outcomes.
Control environment
The Group operates within a control framework developed 
and strengthened over a number of years and communicated 
as appropriate by a series of written procedures. These lay down 
accounting policies and financial control procedures, in addition 
to controls of a more operational nature. The key procedures that 
the Directors have established with a view to providing internal 
control are as follows:
 • the establishment of the organisation structure and the delegated 
responsibilities of operational management;
 • the definition of authorisation limits, including matters reserved for 
the Board;
 • regular site visits by the Executive Directors, with the results reported 
to Board meetings;
 • the establishment of detailed operational plans and financial budgets 
for each financial year;
 • maintenance of a risk register which is reviewed and updated at 
every Board meeting;
 • review of regular, detailed monthly management reporting provided 
for every Board meeting which encompasses both review of operational 
activities and entries arising on consolidation;
 • reporting and monitoring performance against budgets 
and rolling forecasts;
 • the security of physical property and of computer information; and
 • detailed due diligence on all acquisitions. Gresham Technologies plc

Audit committee report
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the report of the audit committee for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 . 
I was appointed independent Non-Executive Director in May 2017 
and took over as chairman of the committee from Mr C Errington in the 
same month. I am a Chartered Accountant with many years’ experience 
working in finance, particularly software technology companies. Our 
committee comprises three members, two of whom are independent 
Non-Executive Directors, namely myself and Ms I Joss. Mr K Archer also 
continues to serve as a committee member. 
Collectively, the committee has recent and relevant financial experience, 
as well as operational skills and experience. The Board considers that 
the committee has experience relevant to the sector in which we operate, 
as well as operational skills and that I have recent and relevant financial 
experience including competence in accounting. I am satisfied that 
the committee has appropriately discharged its duties in the year in 
accordance with its terms of reference, which are reviewed annually 
and are available at www.greshamtech.com/investors. 
In the performance of its duties the committee held three meetings 
in the year. In order for the committee to properly discharge its role, 
it is critical that we have the opportunity to openly discuss with 
management any matter which falls within our remit and probe and 
challenge where necessary. The Chief Executive, the Chief Financial 
Officer and the Company Secretary attend all our meetings by invitation,
and other senior managers are invited to attend to provide technical 
or business information as necessary. In addition, our meetings are 
attended by the lead audit partner from the external auditor and other 
representatives. Their attendance is important as it gives us the opportunity 
to seek their independent and objective views on matters which they 
encounter during their audit. At least once a year, we meet separately 
with the external auditor to discuss matters without executive 
management being present. On a more frequent basis, I meet with the 
Chief Financial Officer and other senior management. This means any 
issues or concerns can be raised at an early stage allowing me to ensure 
that sufficient time is devoted to them at the subsequent committee 
meeting. There is an open and constructive communication between 
the committee, management and external auditor.
Looking ahead, a new Chief Financial Officer, Mr T Mullan, has just 
been appointed, a role of significant importance to this committee. 
We will work closely with him to help ensure an effective and successful 
induction to the business. We will also continue to play a key role in 
monitoring the integrity of the Group’s published financial information, 
assessing the effectiveness of its internal controls and risk management 
processes, and ensure that our external auditor, BDO LLP , delivers a 
high quality effective audit.
Responsibilities
Our principal role is to assist the Board in performing its responsibilities 
in relation to financial reporting, internal controls and risk management 
and in maintaining an appropriate relationship with our external auditor. 
The work of the committee in discharging its responsibilities includes:
 • monitoring the integrity of the reported financial statements of the 
Group, and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s 
financial performance, and reviewing significant financial issues 
and judgements contained in them;
 • reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls and reviewing 
the Group’ s internal control and risk management systems;
 • reviewing the Group’s speak up (whistle-blowing) arrangements;
 • reviewing the need for a separate internal audit function;
 • making recommendations to the Board, for it to put to shareholders 
for their approval in general meeting, in relation to the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the external auditor and to approve 
the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditor;
 • ensuring an appropriate relationship with the external auditor to 
include the reviewing and monitoring of its independence and 
objectivity, and the effectiveness of the audit process, based on 
a sound plan to ensure it delivers a high quality effective audit;
 • developing and implementing policy on engagement of the external 
auditor to supply non-audit services, taking into account relevant 
ethical guidance regarding the provision of non-audit services by 
the external audit firm; and 
 • reporting to the Board, identifying any matters for which it considers 
that action or improvement is needed and making recommendations 
as to the steps to be taken.

Significant judgements in relation to financial statements 
Set out below are what the committee considers to be the most significant accounting areas which required the exercise of judgement or a high 
degree of estimation during the year, together with details of how these were addressed. These are all considered to be recurring issues.
Significant issue and explanation Work undertaken by the committee in forming an opinion
Capitalised development costs
Development costs are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 
Intangible Assets, and costs that meet the qualifying criteria are 
capitalised and systematically amortised over the useful economic life 
of the intangible asset. Determining whether development costs qualify 
for capitalisation as intangible assets requires judgement, including 
estimates of the technical and commercial viability of the asset created, 
and its applicable useful economic life. These estimates are continually 
reviewed and updated by management based on past experience 
and reviews of competitor products available in the market.
The committee has reviewed reports from management identifying 
the development costs capitalised, the technical and commercial 
feasibility of the product being produced and whether further costs 
continue to fulfil the required IAS 38 criteria. The committee’s review 
encompasses direct discussion with executive and operational 
management, in addition to reviewing monthly formal reporting to 
the Board on development and associated sales and implementation 
activity. The treatment of development costs is an area of focus for the 
external auditor who reported its findings to us. We concluded that 
management’s key assumptions, judgements, estimates and 
disclosures were reasonable and appropriate.
Revenue and profit recognition
Revenue and the associated profit are recognised from sale of software 
licences, rendering of services, subscriptions and maintenance and 
solution sales. Whilst in most cases performance obligations clearly 
follow the commercial and contractual arrangement agreed with the 
customer, in some cases the revenue streams are combined within an 
overall commercial arrangement. Such bundling requires judgement 
to assess performance obligations associated with each revenue 
stream and further judgement as to when and how such performance 
obligations have been discharged in order to recognise the associated 
revenue. The estimation of the stage of completion, along with the 
unbundling of multi-element solution sales, represents a risk of 
incorrect revenue recognition.
The committee has reviewed management’s descriptions and 
status reports on material new deals and on delivery work-in-progress 
through the year, both through direct discussion and formal month-end 
reporting to the Board. The committee has furthermore considered 
management’s assessments made on percentage of completion of 
material work-in-progress, and other judgements such as bundling or 
unbundling of revenue streams, and the resulting impact on revenue 
and profit recognition. Revenue recognition is an area of focus for 
the external auditor who reported its findings to us. We considered 
whether the accounting treatment for revenue and profit recognition 
was in accordance with agreed methodology and concurred with 
management’s opinion that it was.
Impairment reviews
The Group is required to perform impairment reviews of goodwill 
annually at the reporting date, and in addition performs impairment 
reviews of capitalised development costs to identify any intangible 
assets that have a carrying value that is in excess of its recoverable 
value. Determining the recoverability of an intangible asset requires 
judgement in both the methodology applied and the key variables 
within that methodology. Where it is determined an intangible asset 
is impaired, its carrying value will be reduced to its recoverable 
value with the difference recorded as an impairment charge in 
the income statement.
The committee has considered management’s assessments of 
value in use of cash-generating units of intangible assets (principally 
the goodwill and capitalised development costs) at the reporting date. 
This included specifically considering and subsequently approving 
business plans prepared by management supporting the future 
performance expectations used in the calculation of the value in use. 
Impairments reviews were also an area of focus for the external auditor 
who reported its findings to us. We concluded that management’s 
key assumptions were reasonable. Gresham Technologies plc
Annual Financial Report 2017 35
Corporate Governance
Risk management and internal control systems
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound risk management 
and internal control system to safeguard shareholders’ investment 
and the Company’s assets. The Directors acknowledge their ultimate 
responsibility for ensuring that the Group has in place a system of controls, 
financial and otherwise, and for risk management, that are appropriate 
to the business environment in which it operates and the risks to which 
it is exposed and for monitoring those systems.
The Board and committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control systems during the year. This review 
covered all material controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls.
The Group’s risk management and internal control systems are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure of business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The Board continues to discuss 
with management further enhancements in financial and other controls 
commensurate with the growth of the Group. In addition, steps are 
continuing to be taken to further embed internal control and risk 
management processes into the operations of the business and to 
deal with areas of improvement which come to management’s and 
the Board’s attention.
An embedded ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the principal risks faced by the Group has been in place throughout 
the year and is regularly reviewed by the Board. It remains in place up 
to the date of the approval of the financial statements. 
Speak up (whistle-blowing) arrangements
The committee has reviewed arrangements by which staff of the 
Group may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting or other matters and concluded that 
they remain appropriate.
Internal audit function
During the year, the committee considered the need for a separate 
internal audit function and its impact on the external audit and concluded 
that, based on the size of the Group, a separate internal audit function 
is not necessary at this stage of the Group’s maturity. The need for an 
internal audit function is reviewed at least annually.
External auditor
The committee reviews and makes recommendations with regard to the 
appointment of the external auditor. In making these recommendations, 
the committee considers auditor effectiveness and independence, 
partner rotation and any other factors which may impact the external 
auditor’s appointment.
The last audit tender process undertaken by the committee was performed 
in 2010, resulting in the appointment of BDO LLP as external auditor for 
the year ended 31 December 2010. BDO LLP has continued as external 
auditor for every year since then, including in respect of this Annual 
Financial Report 2017 . The external audit partner was last rotated in 2015.
In considering the effectiveness of the external auditor, the committee 
discussed and approved the scope of and the fees for the external audit 
plan and reviewed the external auditor’s approach to the external audit, 
its assessment of the significant risks in the Group’s financial statements 
and materiality levels, and its associated work. In addition, the committee 
considered the commercial experience and expertise of the auditor, 
particularly in the Group’s industry sector; the fulfilment of the agreed 
audit plan and any variations from this plan; and the robustness of the 
external auditor in its handling of key accounting and audit judgements.
In relation to independence, the committee reviews and controls the 
manner in which non-audit services are awarded to the external auditor 
on at least an annual basis. All significant non-audit work, and any work 
of a non-compliance consultancy nature, commissioned from the external 
auditor requires audit committee approval. In the year, non-audit fees 
represented 23% of the total fees paid to the external auditor, compared 
to 25% in the prior year.
The committee is satisfied with the effectiveness and independence of the 
external auditor, and a resolution to reappoint BDO LLP as the Group’s 
auditor will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Nomination committee report
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the report of the nomination committee 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 . 
The committee consists of me as chairman, and Ms I Joss and Mr A Balchin 
as members. In the performance of its duties, the committee held one 
meeting in the year which, at the committee’s invitation, was attended 
by the Chief Executive, Mr I Manocha. 
The principal activities of the nomination committee in the year 
were leading the recruitment process and ultimately recommending 
the appointment of Mr T Mullan as incoming Chief Financial Officer. 
The process included a merit-based assessment based on objective 
criteria having regard to the Group’s current and future requirements. 
The Company engaged Warren Partners as independent search consultants 
to identify suitable candidates and assist with the recruitment process. 
Mr T Mullan’s appointment was unanimously recommended to the 
Board by all members of the committee and the Chief Executive. 
The Board’s policy is to ensure that all appointments are merit-based 
and based on objective criteria, giving all due regard to equality of 
opportunity, and to promote inclusion and diversity. The Board notes 
that achieving diversity in the technology sector is challenging, having 
regard to the available pool of individuals with the right skills, experience 
and talent. Given the relatively small size of the Board and the Group, 
the committee does not currently set any measurable objectives for 
implementing a diversity policy but it acknowledges the role of the 
Board in promoting diversity, including gender diversity, throughout 
the Group. Currently there is one female member of the Board, 
representing 20% of Board membership.
In relation to succession planning, the nomination committee 
keeps under review, and takes appropriate action to ensure, orderly 
succession for appointments to the Board and to senior management, 
so as to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience within 
the Group and on the Board. As regards Non-Executive Directors, the 
committee considers, amongst other factors, their other significant outside 
commitments prior to making recommendations, which is designed to 
ensure that they have sufficient time to meet what is expected of them, 
and keeps any changes to these commitments under review.
I am satisfied that the committee has appropriately discharged 
its duties in the year in accordance with its terms of reference. 
Terms of reference are reviewed annually and are available at

Corporate Governance
Remuneration report
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 . 
The committee consists of me as chair, and Mr K Archer and Mr A Balchin 
as members. The committee met twice in the year. Each of these 
meetings was attended, at the committee’s invitation, by the 
Executive Directors, except that they were not present in any 
discussions affecting their own remuneration.
For 2017 , the committee has continued to operate a simple remuneration 
structure made up of basic salary, performance-related bonuses, share 
options, benefits and pensions. As previously, a significant proportion 
of executive remuneration is based on performance, designed to align 
executive pay with shareholder interests. In this respect, the committee 
has assessed the performance of Executive Directors for the year reported, 
set performance targets for the following financial period and made 
recommendations to the Board on the overall package for Executive 
Directors (including the new Chief Financial Officer). 
Details of Executive Director performance-related pay awards in respect 
of 2017 and how they were calculated are set out in the following pages. 
As regards increases for 2018, the committee has assessed that Chief 
Executive basic pay should increase by 2.4% in line with other Group 
employees. The remuneration package for Mr T Mullan, the incoming 
Chief Financial Officer, has been assessed based on market conditions 
and in consultation with recruitment advisers. The committee believes 
that the overall CFO remuneration is competitive relative to other similar 
companies, and no more than is necessary. 
The all-staff Deferred Share Bonus Plan 2017 was adopted in 
December 2017 . This represents an important milestone for the 
Group in its endeavours to attract and retain talented staff in a 
competitive sector, promote high levels of employee engagement 
and align staff incentives with long-term shareholder interests.
Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan 2017 . Further, the Share Option Schemes 2010 are 
now substantially consumed. At this important stage of the Group’s 
development, the committee believes that it is necessary and appropriate 
to initiate a comprehensive review of its existing executive remuneration 
structures in light of current market conditions. To this end, the committee 
will be engaging independent remuneration consultants in the course 
of 2018 to advise the committee with regard to executive pay (including 
benchmarking and variable pay considerations) and to formulate proposals 
regarding a new, long-term incentive framework for executives. The 
committee is fully committed to aligning executive remuneration with 
the Group’s long-term success, whilst ensuring that executive pay is 
appropriate for a company of our shape and size and remains in line 
with prevailing industry remuneration guidelines. I look forward to 
consulting with key stakeholders in due course.
I am satisfied that the committee has appropriately discharged 
its duties in the year in accordance with its terms of reference. 
Terms of reference are reviewed annually and are available at  
www.greshamtech.com/investors.
I encourage you to read the Directors’ Remuneration report on the 
following pages.

Corporate Governance
Remuneration report continued
This report complies with the requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
as amended in 2013, the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (April 2016) and the Listing Rules.
The report is in two sections: 
 • the Directors’ remuneration policy as approved at the AGM held in May 2017, which sets out the Company’s current policy on remuneration 
for Executive and Non-Executive Directors; and
 • the Directors’ Remuneration Report. This section sets out details of how the remuneration policy was implemented for the year ended 
31 December 2017 and how the Company intends for the policy to apply for the year ended 31 December 2018.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the forthcoming AGM. 
Directors’ remuneration policy
Remuneration policy table
The table below sets out the Directors’ remuneration policy as approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. No changes to the policy are being 
proposed at the 2018 AGM.
The committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office, notwithstanding that they are not in line 
with the policy set out below, where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming 
a Director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” includes the committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to 
an award over shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted.
Element of remuneration Link to Group strategy Operation Framework
Base salary Supports the recruitment and 
retention of Executive Directors 
of the calibre required to deliver 
the Group’s strategy.
Base salary is paid monthly 
and reviewed annually, with 
any increases applying 
from 1 April.
Base salary and reviews are assessed on both Group 
and individual performance, and, in the case of new 
Directors, their prior experience and skills. Consideration is 
also given to pay increases for other employees in the Group 
and to comparable pay for similar roles at similar companies. 
Where appropriate, the committee will engage external 
remuneration consultants for benchmarking. 
Pension Supports the recruitment and 
retention of Executive Directors 
of the calibre required to deliver 
the Group’s strategy.
Pension contributions 
are made by the Company 
to a defined contribution 
scheme operated by a 
third party provider. 
Pension contributions are matched by the Company 
up to a maximum of 5% of base salary, in line with other 
employees in the Group. In exceptional circumstances, 
such as recruitment of new Directors, the committee has 
discretion to authorise higher Company contributions 
up to a maximum of 10% of base salary in total.
Benefits Supports the recruitment and 
retention of Executive Directors 
of the calibre required to deliver 
the Group’s strategy.
Benefits principally 
comprise private 
healthcare and death 
in service insurance. 
Premiums are paid by the Company to an external broker 
to arrange cover, in line with other Group employees. 
These benefits are standard for all Group employees 
and are not assessed against performance.
Annual bonus Rewards and incentivises 
the Executive Directors for 
achievement of strategic 
objectives as measured 
by KPIs.
The committee sets 
annual performance 
targets, linked to strategic 
objectives. Bonus payments 
in respect of a year are made 
in April, or later if any 
element is deferred.
Annual targets are set predominantly, or even exclusively, 
in relation to financial measures, so as to maintain a link 
between shareholder value and bonus payments. 
The committee has final discretion in determining the 
value of the bonus payment based on its assessment 
of performance against the set targets and as a whole. 
The committee has discretion to defer up to 50% of the 
annual bonus, which may be adjusted or forfeited if 
specified conditions are not achieved.
The maximum bonus payable in respect of a year is 100% 
of basic salary.
Share option plan Directly aligns financial 
incentives with returns to 
shareholders. Financial reward 
is created through the creation 
of shareholder value.
The committee has 
discretion to make option 
grants to Executive Directors 
and other staff, subject to 
the scheme rules, and to 
determine appropriate 
performance conditions.
The share option plans are subject to rules and limits 
approved by shareholders in general meeting. Options 
are granted at an exercise price of not less than 110% of 
the mid-market price of ordinary shares on the day prior 
to the date of grant. All options are subject to a minimum 
three-year vesting period, and any exercise is subject to 
satisfaction of the specified performance conditions, 
which the committee assesses. Gresham Technologies plc

Director fees
Supports the recruitment 
and retention of individuals 
of the calibre required to 
constitute an effective Board 
and contribute to the Company’s 
long-term success. 
Fees for Non-Executive 
Directors are set by the 
Board (excluding 
Non-Executive Directors).
Fees are paid monthly.
A basic fee is set for normal duties, commensurate 
with fees paid for similar roles in other similar companies, 
taking account of the time commitment, responsibilities, 
and committee position(s). Supplementary fees are paid 
for any additional duties at fixed day rates. Non-Executive 
Directors are not eligible for pensions, incentives, bonus 
or any similar payments other than normal out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred on behalf of the business. Compensation 
for loss of office is not payable to Non-Executive Directors.
Remuneration scenarios
Executive pay under the above policy is wholly contractually based and represents 100% of maximum remuneration.
The following graphs compare all elements of Executive Director pay in respect of 2017 , and proposed for 2018, incorporating the following scenarios:
 • the minimum remuneration receivable (minimum);
 • the remuneration receivable if the Director performs in line with the Company’s expectation (expected); and
 • the maximum remuneration ordinarily receivable (maximum), inclusive of an annual bonus of up to 100% of salary.
The Executive Directors are Mr I Manocha (Chief Executive), Mr R Grubb (Chief Financial Officer until 13 March 2018) and Mr T Mullan 
(Chief Financial Officer from 13 March 2018). Details for Mr R Grubb relate to the period ending 31 March 2018, being his last day of employment 
with the Group. Details for Mr T Mullan relate to the period commencing 1 March 2018, being his first day of employment with the Group.
For each scenario, the first graph illustrates these amounts in Pounds Sterling, and the second graph shows the proportion each element is of total 
pay for the individuals shown expressed as a percentage. On each graph, “BIK” means benefits in kind.

Remuneration policy considerations
Recruitment
The Company’s nomination committee is responsible for leading the 
process for Board appointments and making recommendations to the 
Board. Refer to the report of the nomination committee for details.
Loss of office payments
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive Directors with 
regard to compensation in the event of loss of office. The remuneration 
committee considers the circumstances of individual cases of early 
termination and only in exceptional circumstances would the committee 
recommend compensation payments in excess of the Company’s 
contractual obligations.
Wider staff employment conditions
The remuneration committee considers pay and employment conditions 
for other Senior Executives and staff members of the Group when 
designing and setting executive remuneration. Underpinning all pay 
is an intention to be fair to all staff of the Group, taking into account 
the individual’s seniority and local market practices.
Consultation with shareholders
The remuneration committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue 
with shareholders and seeks the views of significant shareholders when 
any major changes are being made to remuneration arrangements. 
The committee takes into account the views of significant shareholders 
when formulating and implementing the policy.
Consultation with employees
The Board and the remuneration committee did not consult with employees 
when formulating and implementing the policy.
Service contracts and letters of appointment
It is the Company’s policy to offer Executive Directors service 
contracts terminable with a maximum of twelve months’ rolling 
notice from either side. 
None of the Non-Executive Directors have a service contract. 
Appointments are for three-year terms, which may be renewed 
by mutual agreement, subject always to termination by either 
party at any time on three months’ notice.
Policy on Director shareholdings
The Company has no policy on Director shareholdings.

Remuneration for Mr T Mullan
Mr T Mullan joined the Group on 1 March 2018 and will join the Board 
as Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer on 13 March 2018. 
Mr T Mullan’s basic salary will be £160,000 per annum and will be 
entitled to participate in the executive bonus scheme determined 
by the remuneration committee for the current year. He is expected 
to be granted 200,000 share options in the Company upon joining the 
Board pursuant to the Option Schemes 2010. He will also be entitled 
to receive pension contributions as well as non-cash benefits comprising 
the provision of private healthcare and death in service insurance. 
Mr T Mullan’s remuneration entitlements accord with the terms of 
the Directors’ remuneration policy set out above. 
Service contracts
Mr I Manocha has a service agreement dated 15 February 2015, 
which is terminable by twelve months’ rolling notice from either side. 
Mr R Grubb has a service agreement dated 18 May 2011, which is 
terminable by six months’ rolling notice from either side. Mr R Grubb 
has served notice to terminate his directorship and employment 
effective 13 March 2018 and 31 March 2018 respectively. Mr T Mullan’s 
service agreement is dated 5 February 2018 and is terminable by 
six months’ rolling notice from either side.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has a letter of appointment. 
Appointments are for three-year terms, which may be renewed by 
mutual agreement, subject always to termination by either party at 
any time on three months’ notice.
All Director service contracts and letters of appointment are available 
for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office, 
Aldermary House, 10–15 Queen Street, London EC4N 1TX.
The link between pay and performance
The key variable element of Directors’ and senior managers’ pay is the 
award of share options and payments of performance-based annual 
bonuses. All Director and senior manager performance that directly 
creates shareholder value will in turn directly increase the value of 
individuals’ share option awards and annual bonus payments awarded.
Information regarding performance-related pay conditions in 2017
The following information is provided in relation to performance-related 
pay conditions for Executive Directors that applied in respect of financial 
year 2017 .
Executive Director annual bonus awards for 2017 were assessed by 
the committee based on predetermined annual performance targets 
linked to Group objectives and individual performance objectives. 
The primary Group financial objective was to achieve adjusted EBITDA 
of £5.2m, which would deliver an on-target bonus of 8% of base salary, 
subject to upwards or downwards adjustments to be determined by 
the remuneration committee based on other Group financial results 
(including Group revenue targets) and achievement of individual objectives. 
Notwithstanding that adjusted EBITDA was marginally (2%) behind the 
£5.2m target, the committee set final bonus awards at 8% of base 
salary in light of overall Group and individual performance.
The share options granted to Mr I Manocha in June 2015 are subject to 
a minimum three-year vesting period, such that exercise is not possible 
until 1 June 2018 at the earliest. The exercise of these share options is 
also subject to a performance condition requiring the number of direct 
CTC customers at the date of exercise to be equal to or greater than 40. 
This condition was achieved during 2017 , as determined by the 
remuneration committee. Mr R Grubb does not hold any share options.
Payments for loss of office (audited information)
No payments for loss of office were made during the year ended 
31 December 2017 (2016: £nil). Gresham Technologies plc

Statement of remuneration policy in the following year
The remuneration policy currently applicable for the year commencing 
1 January 2018 is set out above. The committee intends to carry out an 
independent review of the remuneration policy during 2018 and, subject 
to appropriate consultation, may propose changes to the remuneration 
policy, which may include the introduction of a new long-term incentive 
plan for Executive Directors. Unless any such proposals are approved 
by shareholders in general meeting, there will be no significant changes 
in the way the remuneration policy will be implemented in 2018 compared 
to how it was implemented for the reported year.
Statement in respect of remuneration resolutions at the last AGM
At the last AGM, held on 4 May 2017 , the following resolutions were 
moved:

Consideration of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The committee is responsible for considering and setting remuneration 
for all Executive Directors and the Chairman appointed by the Company, 
including pension rights and provision for compensation payments. 
In April 2017 , Mr R Grubb’s base salary was increased by 14% to 
£140,000, which included a one-off non-inflationary adjustment, which 
the committee considered to be appropriate and no more than necessary 
having regard to market conditions. Mr I Manocha’s base salary was 
increased by 2% in April 2017 , in line with Group employees. Details 
of performance-related pay awards for Mr I Manocha and Mr R Grubb 
are set out above.
The committee considered and made recommendations to the 
Board regarding remuneration arrangements for Mr T Mullan as 
incoming Chief Financial Officer. This included consideration of market 
conditions and the need for appropriate incentivisation to secure the 
necessary skills and talent, whilst recognising the importance to exercise 
pay restraint. The committee considers that the overall remuneration 
awarded to Mr T Mullan is appropriate and fair, and not more than 
is necessary. Details of Mr T Mullan’s remuneration are set out above.
The committee also recommends and monitors the level and 
structure of remuneration for senior management. The remuneration 
of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the executive members of 
the Board, within limits set in the Articles of Association. The remuneration 
committee consults with the Chief Executive concerning the remuneration 
of other Executive Directors. Where appropriate, the committee seeks 
independent advice from remuneration consultants and also consults 
with the remainder of the Board.
External advisers
The Group did not appoint any advisers to the remuneration committee 
in the current or in the previous financial year.

corporate governance beginning on page 30 forms part of the 
Directors’ Report.
Directors and officers
The Directors who served on the Board during the year are set out on 
page 28 (aside from Mr C Errington who resigned with effect from 
31 May 2017), all of whom served throughout the year with the exception 
of Mr A Balchin who was appointed on 15 May 2017 and Mr T Mullan

Company Secretary throughout the year.
Results and dividends
The Group profit for the year, after taxation, attributable to 
equity shareholders amounted to £3,801,000 (2016: £2,605,000). 
A final dividend of 0.5 pence per ordinary share (2016: nil) has been 
recommended by the Directors. There has been no interim dividend 
(2016: nil). 
If approved by the passing of a resolution at the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting, it is intended to pay the final dividend on 24 May 2018 to 
all shareholders on the register at close of business on 13 April 2018. 
The ex-dividend date will be 12 April 2018. 
The profit for the year has been transferred to reserves.
Going concern and viability statement
The Group has sufficient financial resources together with good 
relationships with a number of customers and suppliers across different 
geographic areas and industries. The Group has access to a strong 
underlying cashflow arising from long-established maintenance 
businesses with long-standing blue-chip customers and strong growth 
prospects being realised with its flagship solution, CTC, and its other 
Clareti solutions.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Financial 
Report 2017 .
Refer to page 45 for the viability statement required pursuant to 
Provision C2.2 of the Code.
Post balance sheet events
There were no post balance sheet events.
Significant relationships
In 2017 , the Group had one customer relationship considered to be 
individually significant to the Group. This relates to APAC operations 
and generates a mix of revenues from the Group’s cash management 
solution, from Clareti, and from other strategic non-recurring revenues. 
Revenues from this customer relationship individually exceeded 10% of 
the Group’s revenue in 2017 . In the opinion of the Directors, the Group 
does not have any other individually significant relationships.
Directors and their interests
The Directors at 31 December 2017 and their connected persons’ 
interests in the share capital of the Company (all beneficially held, 
other than with respect to options to acquire ordinary shares which are 
detailed in the analysis of options included in the Directors’

Directors’ liabilities
The Company has granted an indemnity to one or more of its Directors 
against liability in respect of proceedings brought by third parties, subject 
to the conditions set out in section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Such qualifying third party indemnity provision remains in force as at 
the date of approving the Directors’ Report. Directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance with an indemnity limit of £10m has been purchased 
in order to minimise the potential impact of proceedings against Directors. Gresham Technologies plc

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Financial Report 
2017 in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law, the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 100 Application of Financial Reporting 
Requirements and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework and applicable law. Under company law, the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company 
and of the profit or loss for the Group and Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 • make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 • state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 • prepare a strategic report, directors’ report and directors’ 
remuneration report which comply with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors consider that the Annual Financial Report 2017 , taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Financial 
Report 2017 is made available on a website. Financial statements are 
published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website 
is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility 
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements 
contained therein.
Directors’ responsibilities pursuant to DTR 4
The Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:
 • the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit and loss of the Group; and
 • the Annual Financial Report 2017 includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the financial 
position of the Group and the Parent Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Gresham Technologies plc 
(the “Parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cashflow, 
the Company Balance Sheet, the Company Statement of Changes in 
Equity and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion the financial statements:
 • give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’ s and of the Parent 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit 
for the year then ended;
 • the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 • the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 • the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Parent Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Parent 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Parent Company and the Parent Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern 
and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information 
in the Annual Report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to 
report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to:
 • the disclosures in the Annual Report set out on page 16 that 
describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
 • the Directors’ confirmation set out on page 16 in the Annual Report 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 • the Directors’ statement set out on page 45 in the financial statements 
about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements 
and the Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the 
Group and the Parent Company’s ability to continue to do so over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements;
 • whether the Directors’ statement relating to going concern required 
under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 • the Directors’ explanation set out on page 32 in the Annual Report 
as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, 
were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters 
included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matters continued
Development costs (Note 2, Note 13)
Description
As detailed in the accounting policies, development 
costs are recognised as an intangible asset if specific 
criteria have been met. Following the evolution 
of the Clareti product suite, development costs are 
now attributed to the different products that the 
Group provides, rather than the Clareti platform 
in general. Upon completion of development, 
the costs are amortised to the consolidated income 
statement over a period ranging from five to 20 years, 
depending on the product to which they pertain. 
There are a number of judgements involved in 
accounting for development expenditure, including 
whether the activities are appropriate for capitalisation 
in accordance with the criteria of the standard, the 
allocation of the development costs to a particular 
Clareti product and the estimated useful economic 
life of each product. The risk also encompasses the 
possibility that the development activities may 
supersede costs previously capitalised. Due to the 
level of judgement, there is considered to be an 
inherent risk of management override.
How we addressed the key audit matter in the audit 
We reviewed the Group’s accounting policy in this area to ensure that it was in accordance 
with International Accounting Standard 38. We agreed a sample of capitalised costs to underlying 
supporting documentation, including timecard entries to corroborate the allocation of cost 
between products, and checked that the five criteria for capitalisation, as required by the 
standard, had been met. This included gaining an understanding of the projects from the 
development team, as well as obtaining evidence of future economic benefits such as customer 
contracts and pipeline opportunities and critically assessing assumptions such as the level 
of non-productive time inherent in the development of each product. Furthermore, we 
specifically reviewed costs capitalised as enhancements to software available for sale, 
ensured that the enhancements did not supersede existing development costs and 
determined whether such enhancements met each of the five criteria for capitalisation 
under the standard. 
In respect of enhancements released to the market during the year, we inspected evidence 
of when the development projects were first available for sale by reference to communication 
with customers and prospective customers, board minutes and market announcements. 
Additionally, for enhancements to established software, we reviewed the nature of the new 
releases, and resultant sales opportunities, to assess whether there was evidence of superseding 
previous development effort. We performed our own calculation of amortisation charges 
based on these dates and compared this with management’s own calculations. We also 
challenged the amortisation rates used by management with reference to the term of sales 
contracts associated with each product and external benchmarking reports of companies 
operating in the sector, together with internal benchmarking based on legacy software. 
Sensitivity analysis was then performed on the amortisation rates.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment risk (Note 2, Note 13, Note 14)
Description
As detailed in the accounting policies, 
goodwill and capitalised development costs 
during development are tested for impairment at 
least annually through comparing the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit, based on a 
value-in-use calculation, to the carrying value. 
Furthermore, once available for use, capitalised 
development costs are tested for impairment where 
an indicator of impairment arises. Management’s 
review found no evidence of impairment in the 
Clareti or other cash generating units, nor indicators 
of impairment in relation to development costs. 
This risk is considered significant due to the level 
of judgement involved and the opportunity 
for management bias within the impairment 
model assumptions.
How we addressed the key audit matter in the audit 
We performed a review of the Group’s goodwill and intangible assets and examined for 
indicators of impairment. We also reviewed impairment reviews prepared by management, 
specifically reviewing the integrity of management’s value in use model and, with the 
assistance of our valuation specialists, we challenged the key inputs, being forecast growth 
rates, operating cash flows and the discount rate. Our audit procedures for the review of 
operating cash flows and forecast growth rates included, amongst others, comparing the 
forecast to recent financial performance and budgets approved by the Board; we used 
market data to independently calculate a discount rate for comparison. Cash flows forecast 
in respect of development projects were assessed for reasonableness against known sales 
pipeline opportunities. We also performed our own sensitivity analysis upon the key 
valuation inputs.

Revenue and profit recognition (Note 2, Note 3)
Description
As detailed in the accounting policies, the Group 
earns revenue from the sale of software licenses, 
rendering of services, subscriptions and maintenance 
and solution sales. Management exercise judgement 
in their assessment of the stage of completion of 
service contracts and the unbundling of multi-element 
solution sales, with reference to the fair value of the 
constituent elements, both of which determine the 
recognition of revenue and profit and so present a 
revenue recognition risk.
How we addressed the key audit matter in the audit 
We reviewed in detail the revenue recognition principles applied to the significant new 
contracts written and performed during the year and ensured that the revenue recognition 
policies were in accordance with the accounting standards and the accounting policy. 
In particular, we checked a sample of solution sales and assessed the appropriateness 
of unbundling revenue into separate components along with the fair value of the consideration 
attributed to each component. We noted one instance during the financial year in which 
Management exercised significant judgement in estimating the fair value of constituent 
elements of a solution, the substance of which were considered to differ from the legal 
form. We assessed this judgement through benchmarking with reference to historic 
contracts executed by the Group and external sources in relation to the sector.
For the licence element of new contracts, particularly those in close proximity to the year 
end, we obtained evidence that the software had been delivered to the customer prior to 
the end of the financial year.
We agreed a sample of sales and, where relevant, underlying time costs to supporting 
contracts and other documentation, including user acceptance evidence, statements 
of works and time records.
Our application of materiality 
Group materiality: £210,000 (2016: £170,000).
Parent Company materiality: £150,000 (2016: £150,000).
Our Group planning materiality for the financial statements, for both 
the current and prior years, has been based upon 1% of anticipated 
consolidated revenue. This determination is based on our view that 
revenue is a key performance measure for the Group and its members 
in assessing financial performance. This was compared to adjusted 
profit before tax – in comparison to which our materiality is 6%. On the 
basis of our risk assessment, together with our assessment of the 
Company’s control environment, our judgement is that performance 
materiality for the financial statements should be 65% of planning 
materiality, namely £136,000 (2016: 75% and £128,000). Our objective 
in adopting this approach is to ensure that total detected and undetected 
audit differences do not exceed our planning materiality of £210,000 
for the financial statements as a whole. Materiality levels used for each 
key component ranged from £81,000 to £160,000 (2016: £90,000 to 
£130,000). Materiality levels have increased in the year to reflect the 
Group’s growth. We agreed with the audit committee that we would 
report to the committee all audit differences in excess of £8,400 
(2016: £7 ,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in 
our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing 
our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. For planning, 
we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, 
including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of 
reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
Importantly, misstatements below this level will not necessarily be 
evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of 
identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their 
occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group audit team, based in the UK, performed full scope audits 
of the key reporting components in the UK and North America, comprising 
63% of revenues and 75% of profit before tax. The audits of the Asia 
Pacific region were performed by component auditors, BDO Australia, 
with the Group’s Australian subsidiary being the significant component 
in this region. Detailed instructions were issued and discussed with the 
component auditors, and these covered the significant risks (including 
the Group risks of material misstatement described above) that should 
be addressed by the audit team. The Group audit team was actively 
involved in directing the audit strategy of the Asia Pacific audit, reviewed 
in detail the findings and considered the impact of these upon the 
Group audit opinion.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or 
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether 
there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the 
other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility 
to specifically address the following items in the other information and 
to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information 
where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:
 • Fair , balanced and understandable (set out on page 48) – the statement 
given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair , balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or Gresham Technologies plc

 • Audit committee reporting (set out on page 33) – the section 
describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
 • Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (set out on page 30) – the parts of the Directors’ 
statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing 
provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with 
Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
 • the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements;
 • the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and 
its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified 
material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 • the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 • certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement 
(set out on page 48), the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part 
of our auditor’s report.
Other matters which we are required to address
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were 
appointed by the Board of Directors on 28 October 2010 to audit 
the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2010 
and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is eight years, covering the years ending 2010 to 2017 .
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we 
remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in 
conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the 
audit committee.

Notes to the financial statements
1.Authorisation of financial statements and statement 
of compliance with IFRSs
Gresham Technologies plc is a public limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares 
are traded as a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The financial statements of Gresham Technologies plc and its 
subsidiaries (the Group) for the year ended 31 December 2017 were 
authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 12 March 2018 and 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was signed on the 
Board’s behalf by Mr I Manocha and Mr R Grubb. 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of 
the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 .
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out below.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 and applied in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies which follow set 
out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 . 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared on a historical 
cost basis, and derivative financial instruments which have been 
measured at fair value.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as 
permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. For the year 
ended 31 December 2017 , the Company recorded a retained profit 
of £683,000 (2016: £665,000).
The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values 
are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000) except when 
otherwise indicated.
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
for assets and liabilities as at the statement of financial position date 
and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. 
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could 
differ from those estimates. We review our estimates and underlying 
assumptions on an ongoing basis, and recognise revisions to accounting 
estimates in the period in which we revise the estimate and in any 
future periods affected. It is considered that all judgements have an 
element of estimation.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the statement of financial position date that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below.
Valuation and asset lives of separately identifiable intangible assets
In determining the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisition, 
management are required to make judgements regarding the timing and 
amount of future cashflows applicable to the businesses being acquired, 
discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Such judgements are 
based on current budgets and forecasts, extrapolated for an appropriate 
period taking into account growth rates and expected changes to 
selling prices and operating costs. Management estimates the 
appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
businesses being acquired.
Capitalised development costs
Development costs are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 
Intangible Assets and costs that meet the qualifying criteria are 
capitalised and systematically amortised over the useful economic 
life of the intangible asset. Determining whether development costs 
qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets requires judgement, 
including estimates of the technical and commercial viability of the 
asset created and its applicable useful economic life. These estimates 
are continually reviewed and updated based on past experience and 
reviews of competitor products available in the market. 
The capitalised development cost is disclosed in note 13 and the 
impairment review performed is disclosed in note 14.
Impairment reviews
The Group performs impairment reviews at the reporting period end 
to identify any intangible assets that have a carrying value that is in 
excess of its recoverable value. Determining the recoverability of an 
intangible asset requires judgement in both the methodology applied 
and the key variables within that methodology. Where it is determined 
that an intangible asset is impaired, its carrying value will be reduced 
to its recoverable value with the difference recorded as an impairment 
charge in the profit and loss account.
The intangible asset impairment reviews are disclosed in note 14.
Revenue and profit recognition
Revenue and the associated profit are recognised from sale of software 
licenses, rendering of services, subscriptions and maintenance and 
solution sales. Whilst in most cases performance obligations clearly 
follow the commercial and contractual arrangement we have agreed 
with the customer, in some cases the revenue streams are combined 
as within an overall commercial arrangement. Such bundling requires 
judgement to assess performance obligations associated with each 
revenue stream and further judgement as to when and how such 
performance obligations have been discharged in order to recognise 
the associated revenue. The estimation of the stage of completion, 
along with the unbundling of multi-element solution sales, represents 
a risk of incorrect revenue recognition.
In considering the unbundling of multi-element solutions, instances 
may arise whereby the substance of the performance obligations 
differs from the legal form of the contract. In such circumstances 
judgement is required to assess the fair value of the constituent 
elements and recognise revenue accordingly.
Revenue recognised in the period is disclosed in note 3, with further 
analysis provided in note 4.
Useful economic life of capitalised development costs
The assessment of the useful economic life of capitalised development 
costs is estimated by management based on past experience and reviews 
of competitor products available in the market. Gresham Technologies plc

2. Accounting policies continued
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions is included based 
on management estimates of the most likely outcome. Those judgements 
include the forecasting of a number of different outcomes against the 
performance targets and estimating a probability and risk of each outcome 
before arriving at a risk weighted value of contingent consideration. 
Further details can be found within note 28 of the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements 
of Gresham Technologies plc and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries) 
drawn up to 31 December each year. 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements 
of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to the reporting date. 
Investees are classified as subsidiaries where the Company has control, 
which is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an investee entity, exposure to 
variable returns from the investee and the ability to use its power to 
affect those variable returns. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business 
combinations using the acquisition method. In the statement of financial 
position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are initially 
recognised at their fair values at acquisition date. The results of acquired 
entities are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income from the date at which control is obtained and are deconsolidated 
from the date control ceases.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional 
currency by applying an approximation of the spot exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional 
currency rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position 
date. All differences are taken to the profit and loss account, in the 
instance where the differences on monetary assets and liabilities form 
part of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations, they are moved 
to the statement of other comprehensive income on consolidation 
and held in a separate component of equity until the disposal of the 
net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Sterling 
at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date. 
Income and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange 
rates for the year. The resulting exchange differences are taken to the 
statement of other comprehensive income and recognised directly to 
a separate component of equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the 
deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular 
foreign operation is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates 
of the initial transactions, on consolidation, all assets and liabilities 
of overseas subsidiaries who report in a different functional currency 
are retranslated using the closing rate.
On transition to IFRSs from 1 January 2004, the exemption available 
under IFRS 1 was taken to start the currency translation reserve at £nil.
Goodwill
Business combinations on or after 1 January 2004 have been accounted 
for under IFRS 3 using the purchase method. Any excess of the cost 
of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value 
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised 
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as goodwill and is 
not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired entity’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the 
cost of the investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the profit and 
loss account. Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 31 December 2003 is 
recorded at its carrying amount under UK GAAP and is not amortised. 
Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities 
is included within the cost of those entities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, 
at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the 
related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at 
geographical segment level or statutory company level as the case 
may be. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment 
loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is 
taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the 
unit, or of an operation within it. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 
31 December 1997 remains set off directly against reserves even if the 
related investment becomes impaired or the business is disposed of.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition 
at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangible 
assets are subject to the same recognition tests as development costs 
and if met, they are capitalised.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic 
lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that 
they may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at 
least at each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life 
or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation 
period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in 
accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets 
with finite lives is recognised in the profit and loss account in the expense 
category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
The Group has capitalised development costs in respect of the Clareti 
platform which has been assessed against the required capitalisation 
criteria and a remaining useful economic life of 15 years reflecting the 
maturity and availability of comparable solutions in our markets. The 
Group has capitalised development costs in respect of individual 
Clareti applications which have been individually assessed against the 
required capitalisation criteria and been individually assigned useful 
economic lives reflecting the maturity and availability of comparable 
applications in our markets. These useful economic lives are assessed 
to be between 5 and 15 years.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are 
measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the profit 
and loss account when the asset is derecognised. Gresham Technologies plc

2. Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets continued
Purchased intangibles with finite lives, including purchased patents, 
know-how, trademarks, licences and distribution rights, are capitalised 
at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
The estimated useful life of these intangible assets ranges between 
two and ten years depending on their nature. Amortisation charges in 
respect of intangible assets are included in administrative expenses.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities over which activities we have joint control, 
under a contractual agreement. The Group financial statements include 
the Group’s share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures. Related party 
transactions with Group joint ventures primarily comprise support and 
maintenance services. The arrangement is a separate legal entity and 
legal ownership and control are equal with all other parties, there are 
no significant judgements required to be made.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure 
on an individual project is recognised as an intangible asset when the 
Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the 
intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, its intention 
to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will 
generate future economic benefits, the availability of resources to 
complete the asset and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure 
during development.
Capitalised product development expenditure is stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Product development 
costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the time the product 
or related enhancement becomes available for use as part of a version 
release issued to customers on a straight-line basis over five to 15 years 
depending on the useful economic life of the asset assessed. During the 
period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration 
given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to 
making the asset capable of operating as intended. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, other 
than freehold land, on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life 
as follows:
 • Fixtures and fittings – over the term of the underlying property lease. 
 • Plant and equipment – over lives ranging between one and ten years 
to write down the assets to their residual value based on current 
prices for an asset of the age the plant and equipment is expected 
to be at the end of its useful life. 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to 
their recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed 
annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset is included in the profit and loss account 
in the period of derecognition.
Leases
Group as a lessee
Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially 
all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
capitalised at the inception of the lease, with a corresponding liability 
being recognised for the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and 
the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are 
apportioned between the reduction of the lease liability and finance 
charges in the profit and loss account so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Assets held under 
finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful 
life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and 
benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases 
and rentals payable are charged in the profit and loss account on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor
Where the Group has spare capacity in offices held under operating 
leases and where the head lease permits, the Group sublets space 
acting in a lessor capacity. The rental income is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term and shown separately from the 
Group’s full obligation under the head operating lease.
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication 
that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an 
estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value 
less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual 
asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the 
carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset 
is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cashflows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate 
valuation model is used incorporating industry standard valuation multiples 
or other available fair value indicators. Impairment losses on continuing 
operations are recognised in the profit and loss account in those expense 
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any 
indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer 
exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. 
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its 
recoverable amount. Impairment charges on goodwill are considered 
permanent and cannot be reversed. That increased amount cannot exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss. After such a reversal the 
depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s 
revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis 
over its remaining useful life. Gresham Technologies plc

2. Accounting policies continued
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the 
effect is material, expected future cashflows are discounted using a 
current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, 
for example under an insurance policy, the reimbursement is recognised 
as a separate asset but only when recovery is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to any provision is presented in the profit and loss account net 
of any reimbursement. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to the 
contracts that give rise to them and are classified as: financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held-to maturity 
investments; or as available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. 
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this 
designation at each financial year end. When financial assets are recognised 
initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, 
in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly 
attributable transaction costs. The Group considers whether a contract 
contains an embedded derivative when the entity first becomes a party 
to it. The embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract 
if it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss and when the 
economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those 
of the host contract. Reassessment only occurs if there is a change 
in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cashflows 
that would otherwise be required.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised 
on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase 
or sell the asset. Regular way transactions require delivery of assets 
within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention 
in the market place. The subsequent measurement of financial assets 
depends on their classification, as follows:
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not 
qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value 
through profit or loss or available-for-sale. Such assets are initially valued 
at fair value and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are 
recognised in the profit and loss account when the loans and receivables 
are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets classified as held for trading and other assets designated 
as such on inception are included in this category. Financial assets are 
classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term. 
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified 
as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging 
instruments or as financial guarantee contracts. Assets are carried in 
the statement of financial position at fair value with gains or losses 
recognised in the profit and loss account.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each statement of financial position date 
whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets carried 
at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured 
as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cashflows (excluding future credit losses that 
have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial 
recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the 
use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in 
administration costs.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss 
decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account to 
the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its 
amortised cost at the reversal date.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their 
original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Where the time 
value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost. 
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group 
will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off 
when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made 
when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency 
or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not 
be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the 
invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use 
of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised when they 
are assessed as irrecoverable.
Amounts recoverable on contracts
Amounts recoverable on contracts represent revenue recognised to 
date less amounts invoiced to clients. Full provision is made for known 
or anticipated project losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cashflow, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected 
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates 
and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of 
financial position date.
R&D tax credits are recognised on an accruals basis and recorded as a 
credit in the taxation line of the Consolidated profit and loss account. Gresham Technologies plc

Financial Statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
2. Accounting policies continued
Income taxes continued
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
 • where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
 • in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled 
and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future; and
 • deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax 
losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability 
is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted 
at the statement of financial position date.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each 
statement of financial position date. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income 
taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits 
the Group to make a single net payment.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income or 
directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to other 
comprehensive income or directly to equity. Otherwise, income tax is 
recognised in the profit and loss account.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the 
contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated 
as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new 
liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts 
together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward 
currency contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised 
at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated by 
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar 
maturity profiles. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value 
is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Pensions
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the 
profit and loss account in the period in which they become payable.
Revenue recognition
Revenue, comprising sales of products and services to third parties, 
is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits 
will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, 
excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes. The following 
criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Software licences
Revenue on software licences is recognised when all of the following 
criteria are met:
 • persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, such as a signed 
contract or purchase order;
 • delivery has occurred and no future elements to be delivered are 
essential to the functionality of the delivered element;
 • the fee is fixed or determinable; and 
 • collectability is probable.
Rendering of services
Revenue and profits from the provision of professional services, 
such as implementation, development, training and consultancy, 
are recognised on a percentage-of-completion basis, as costs incurred 
relate to total costs for the contract, when the outcome of a contract 
can be estimated reliably. Determining whether a contract’s outcome 
can be estimated reliably requires management to exercise 
judgement, whilst calculation of the contract’s profit requires estimates 
of the total contract costs to completion. Cost estimates and 
judgements are continually reviewed and updated as determined 
by events or circumstances.
Subscriptions and maintenance
Revenue from subscription and maintenance services is recognised 
rateably over the period of the contract.
Solution sales
Contracts for the delivery of solutions with multiple elements, 
typically involving software licences, rendering of services, 
subscriptions, maintenance and hardware, are unbundled where 
possible and revenue is recognised based on the accounting policy 
applicable to each constituent part.
Where objective unbundling of a solution is not possible, revenue is 
recognised as that proportion of the total contract value which costs 
incurred to date bear to total expected costs for that contract. Profit is 
recognised on such contracts, if the final outcome can be assessed 
with reasonable certainty, by including in the profit and loss account 
revenue and related costs as contract activity progresses. 
Interest income
Interest income is recognised as finance revenue as interest accrues 
using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial instrument to its net carrying amount.
Rental income
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment properties 
is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Gresham Technologies plc
Annual Financial Report 2017 63
Financial Statements
2. Accounting policies continued
Pre-contract costs/bid costs
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is appointed 
preferred bidder. Preferred bidder status provides sufficient confidence 
that the conclusion of the contract is probable and the outcome can 
be reliably measured and is expected to generate sufficient net cash 
inflows to enable recovery. Pre-contract costs incurred subsequent to 
appointment as preferred bidder are capitalised onto the balance 
sheet under prepayments and accrued income. The prepayment is 
expensed to the profit and loss account in line with the profile of the 
revenue. Costs, which have been expensed, are not subsequently 
reinstated when a contract award is achieved.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted 
and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends 
on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled 
to the award. 
Fair value of awards with a market condition-based performance target 
is determined by an external valuer using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing 
model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares 
of the Company (market conditions).
Fair value of awards with a financial result-based performance target 
is determined by management using the Black Scholes pricing model.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except 
for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which 
are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition 
is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each statement of financial position date before vesting, the cumulative 
expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or 
otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument 
subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described 
above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous 
statement of financial position date is recognised in the profit and 
loss account, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new 
award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost 
based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over 
the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over 
the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value 
of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value 
of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as 
measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised 
if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had 
vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised 
in the profit and loss account for the award is expensed immediately. 
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation 
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair 
value being treated as an expense in the profit and loss account.
The share-based payment expense is recognised as a staff cost and the 
associated credit entry is made against equity. 
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 in 
respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2 only to those 
equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not 
vested before 1 January 2005.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements 
where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the 
financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income 
or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance 
of their nature or amount.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39. The standard is effective for the Group’s first IFRS financial statements for the period beginning on 
1 January 2018 and will impact the classification and measurement of financial instruments and will require certain additional disclosures. Whilst an 
assessment of the new standard is ongoing, the changes to recognition and measurement of financial instruments and changes to hedge accounting 
rules are not currently considered likely to have any major impact on the Group’s current accounting treatment or hedging activities due to the 
simple nature of our financial instruments.
The standard also requires entities to use an expected credit loss model for impairment of financial assets instead of an incurred credit loss model. 
This could be expected to impact the way the group provides for bad and doubtful receivables, however the current expectation is that it is unlikely 
to have a material impact on the overall level of provisions due to the credit worthiness of our customers and procedures and processes carried 
out before billings. There Is no expectation for restatement of any 2017 comparatives within the 2018 Financial Statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for the Group’s first IFRS financial statements for the period beginning on 1 January 2018) 
replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ , IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard introduces a single, five-step revenue recognition 
model that is based upon the principle that revenue is recognised at the point that control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. 
The standard also updates revenue disclosure requirements. 
The Directors have specifically considered the adoption of IFRS 15 on the revenue recognition of the Group’s on-premise software subscription 
contracts, which combine the delivery of software, and support & maintenance services. Under our current policies, we recognise the entire fee 
rateably over the subscription term. 
As part of our review of our future IFRS15 accounting policies, we have considered whether such contracts represent a right to use the software at 
the point of initial delivery (with license revenue recognisable at that point), or access the software over the contracts applicable term (with license 
revenue recognised pro-rata over the term), irrespective of associated cashflows. 
We have concluded these subscription contracts do represent access to the software over the contract term as the fee for the delivery of software 
and support & maintenance services is fully combined and prepaid amounts would be liable to be refunded without distinction in the event Gresham 
was unable to fulfil its remaining contracted performance obligations (whether such obligations relate to software or support & maintenance services). 
We have therefore concluded the fee for the combined delivery of software and support & maintenance services should continue to be recognised 
rateably over the subscription term under IFRS 15. Gresham Technologies plc

2. Accounting policies continued
New standards and interpretations not applied continued
Whilst the full assessment of the new standard is ongoing, the changes are not currently considered likely to have any major impact on the Group’s 
current accounting treatment or disclosure of revenue.
IFRS 16 Leases (effective for the year ending 31 December 2019) will require all leases to be recognised on the balance sheet. The new standard 
brings most leases on-balance sheet for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. IFRS 16 
supersedes IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations. The Group has a number of operating lease arrangements which we have considered below.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of the IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and remaining standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the 
Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application as the Group currently apply similar accounting treatment for a number of the standards 
and with respect to IFRS 9 the Group have minimal financial instruments that would be impacted, and as such do not anticipate any restatement 
of 2017 results.
The adoption of IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 and sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases.
The main effect on the Group is that IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires a lessees to recognise assets and liabilities 
for almost all leases and will therefore result in an increase of total property, plant and equipment and total financial debt of approximately £0.7m. 
All things being equal, under the new standard trading operating profit and reported EBITDA would increase by approximately £0.4m due to the 
replacement of the operating lease expense with amortisation of lease assets. This would partially be offset by an interest charge resulting in an 
insignificant impact on net profit. The Group is currently assessing the precise impact of the standard.
The effective dates stated here are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Group prepares its financial statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having 
been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU endorsement mechanism. In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that 
given in the original standard or interpretation, but the need for endorsement restricts the Group’s discretion to early adopt standards.

(c) Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has tax losses that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose as 
analysed in (e) below. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits 
elsewhere in the Group and they have arisen in subsidiaries that have been loss making for some time.
The tax effect of exchange differences recorded within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is a credit of £6,000 (2016: debit 
of £17 ,000).
(d) Temporary differences associated with Group investments
At 31 December 2017 , there was no recognised deferred tax liability (2016: £nil) for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings 
of certain of the Group’s subsidiaries as the Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the 
foreseeable future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to £nil 
(2016: £nil). Gresham Technologies plc

The main rate of corporation tax for UK companies reduced from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015. Finance Bill 2015, which was substantively enacted 
on 26 October 2015, announced further reductions to the main rate of corporation tax. The rate will reduce to 19% from 1 April 2017 and by a further 
1% to 18% from 1 April 2020. The Finance Act 2016 was approved on 15 September 2016. The Act reduces the main rate of corporation tax to 17% 
from 1 April 2020 (superseding the 18% rate effective from that date introduced in Finance (No.2) Act 2015).
The Group’s recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets in the UK, Australian and US subsidiaries have been shown at the rates in the 
following table, being the substantively enacted rates in these countries.

10. Earnings 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit or loss for the year attributable to owners of the Parent by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to owners of the Parent by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion 
of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares except when such dilutive instruments would reduce the loss per share.
The following reflects the earnings and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

Development costs
Development costs are internally generated and are capitalised at cost. These intangible assets have been assessed as having a finite life and are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of five to 15 years. These assets are tested for impairment where an indicator of impairment 
arises and annually prior to them being made available for use. Development costs have remaining lives between 5 and 15 years.
For the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group has capitalised development costs in respect of individual Clareti applications which have 
been individually assessed against the required capitalisation criteria and been individually assigned useful economic lives reflecting the maturity 
and availability of comparable applications in our markets. These useful economic lives are assessed to be between 5 and 15 years.
No changes have been made to development costs capitalised in prior years in respect of the Clareti platform, which continue to be amortised 
on a systematic basis over the existing useful economic life of 15 years. Gresham Technologies plc

Patents and licences are the third party costs incurred in seeking and obtaining protection for certain of the Group’s products and services. 
These intangible assets have been assessed as having a finite life and are being amortised evenly over their useful economic life, to a maximum 
of ten years. Patents have a remaining life of three years and licences have a remaining life of one to ten years.
Separately identified acquired intangibles 
Separately identified intangibles acquired through business combinations represent software and customer relationships which arose through the 
acquisition of C24 Technologies Ltd in October 2016.
Software is amortised over its useful economical life, which is deemed to be ten years.
Customer relationships acquired in the year are amortised over the useful economical life, which is deemed to be eight years.
Goodwill
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of our Asia Pacific real-time financial solutions business and C24 Technologies Ltd. It is assessed as having an 
indefinite life and is assessed for impairment at least annually. 
14. Impairment of goodwill and intangibles 
Goodwill 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to one individual cash-generating unit (“CGU”), the lowest level at which 
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, for impairment testing.

impairment exists. The following table summarises the net book value of development costs:

Clareti Solutions CGU 14,729 12,555
Clareti Solutions cash-generating unit
The recoverable amount of this CGU has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation. To calculate this, cashflow projections are based 
on financial budgets approved by the Board for 2018, which are extrapolated for five years, and extended beyond five years, which the Board 
considers appropriate given the long-term opportunities that exists in the Asia Pacific, EMEA and North American regions. The discount rate 
applied to cashflow projections is 15% (2016: 15%) and cashflows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate (2016: 2%) 
that is a prudent approximation to the long-term average growth rate for the region in which the CGU operates.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations
Key assumptions are made by management based on past experience taking into account external sources of information around gross margins, 
growth rates and discount rates for similar businesses.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to assumptions around:
 • operating cashflows, based on financial budgets for 2018 approved by the Board;
 • growth rates, based on internally estimated growth rates for the market and the business offerings; and
 • the discount rate, based on the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group. Gresham Technologies plc

14. Impairment of goodwill and intangibles continued 
Development costs (finite life) continued
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
A change in our key assumption in respect to operating cashflows could cause the carrying value of the goodwill or development costs to exceed 
the recoverable amount, resulting in an impairment charge.
We are confident the assumptions in respect of operating cashflows remain appropriate. Where the operating cashflows incorporate products or 
solutions that will be sold in an existing known market, past experience is used as a guide to the level of sales achievable, growth rates and associated 
margins. Where the operating cashflows relate to products or solutions that will be sold into a new or emerging market, past experience with similar 
products or solutions is combined with relevant information from external market sources, such as competitor pricing and discussions with 
potential customers, in arriving at the level of sales achievable, growth rates and associated margins.

The Group’s customers primarily comprise national and international banks, Government bodies and substantial private and public companies. 
As a result, the credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired has been assessed by the Directors to be relatively high, 
taking account of a low historic experience of bad debts and relatively good ageing profiles.

Cash at bank earns interest at both fixed-term rates and floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits are made for varying 
periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective 
short-term deposit rates. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is the same as stated above. 
At 31 December 2017 , the Group had £nil (2016: £nil) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities and £200,000 of bank deposit (2016: £nil). 
The bank deposits mature on 29 March 2018 and have an interest rate of 0.8% per annum.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cashflow, cash and cash equivalents comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits.

21. Financial instruments 
Objectives, policies and strategies
The Group’s objective is to finance the business through management of existing liquidity, focusing on working capital acceleration to cash and 
converting illiquid assets to liquid assets and, ultimately, cash. Investments in intangible fixed assets, property, plant and equipment have been 
made with the benefit of research and development tax credits taken as cash.
The Group’s policy towards using financial instruments is to manage credit, liquidity and currency exposure risk without exposing the Group to 
undue risk or speculation. The policy is kept under review by the Directors according to the Group’s foreign exchange and treasury policy.
Risk management
The risks arising from the Group’s operations and financial instruments are explained below.
Credit management
The Group monitors exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. The risk of financial loss due to a counterparty failure to honour its obligations 
arises principally in relation to transactions where the Group provides solutions and services on deferred terms and where it invests or deposits 
surplus cash.
Group policies are aimed at minimising such losses, and require that deferred terms are granted only to customers who demonstrate an 
appropriate payment history and satisfy creditworthiness procedures. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits 
to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. Solutions and services may be sold on a cash-with-order basis to mitigate 
credit risk. Bad debt insurance is not carried. 
Performance of individual businesses is monitored at both operating unit and Group level allowing the early identification of major risks and 
reducing the likelihood of an unmanaged concentration of credit risk.
Cash investments are only allowed in liquid securities with major financial institutions that satisfy specific criteria. The maximum credit risk exposure 
at the statement of financial position date is represented by the carrying value of financial assets. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk since it has no bank borrowings and interest receivable on cash deposits does not form a 
material part of Group income. Gresham Technologies plc
Annual Financial Report 2017 81
Financial Statements
21. Financial instruments continued
Capital risk
The Group defines its capital as the Group’s total equity and manages capital based on the level of net cash held. Its objective when managing 
capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, to provide an adequate return 
to investors based upon the level of risk undertaken, to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that 
may deliver future benefit to investors and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate risks and unforeseen events.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares or sell assets to provide additional capital.

All current liabilities are expected to fall due within one year of the statement of financial position date at their carrying amount.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s liquidity risk falls within the following major categories:
 • Trade receivables – a significant element of the Group’ s liquidity is tied up in working capital, which primarily comprises trade receivables. 
The settlement risk associated with these assets comprises both credit risk (the risk that the counterparty will not settle at all) and liquidity risk 
(the risk that the counterparty will not settle on time).
 • Property, plant and equipment – a significant element of the Group’s liquidity is tied up in tangible fixed assets. For those assets required in the 
business for day to day operations, the Group considers the use of finance lease arrangements to reduce the amount of liquidity tied up in such 
assets. The Group keeps its investment in fixed assets under review and actively considers converting such assets to more liquid assets.
 • Currency risk – this risk is discussed on page 83.
The Group monitors and controls liquidity through the following key controls:
 • weekly cash and overdue trade receivables are reported to the Executive Board;
 • cash forecasts are maintained;
 • foreign exchange risks are hedged where significant; and
 • credit control is operated locally with Group oversight.
Where appropriate, discounts are offered for early payment by customers and finance lease and deferred payment arrangements are considered 
to retain or improve liquidity. Gresham Technologies plc

Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
 • Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 • Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
 • Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 31 December 2017 the Group held no foreign exchange instrument, in 2016 the Group held three foreign exchange instruments that had 
been measured at fair value using Level 2 techniques. 
Financial liabilities relate to derivative financial instruments which have a negative fair value. Fair value is calculated by reference to current forward 
exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.  Gresham Technologies plc
Annual Financial Report 2017 83
Financial Statements
21. Financial instruments continued
Currency risk
The Group has exposures to the main currency types: US Dollar, Australian Dollar, Malaysian Ringgit, Canadian Dollar and Euro rates in particular.
Currency exposure arises through intra-group loans and trading balances throughout all Group locations. Natural hedging is employed, to the 
extent possible, to minimise net exposures; however, where significant exposures arise outside of intra-group trading, it is Group policy to enter 
into formal hedging arrangements where these can be shown to be effective. 
At 31 December 2017 , the Group had no foreign currency forward contracts (2016: Liability £71,000):
Currency exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the 
operating unit involved. In general, all overseas operating units trade and hold assets and liabilities in their functional currency.
Sensitivities
The following table details the Group’s sensitivities to a change in Sterling exchange rates against the respective foreign currencies. The sensitivities 
represent management’s assessment of the effect on monetary assets of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates, which for 2017 and 2016 
take account of the potential fluctuations seen in the most recent periods. The sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk 
at the year end has been determined based on the assumption that the change is effective throughout the financial year and all other variables 
remain constant. The impact of translating the net assets of foreign operations into Sterling is excluded from the sensitivity analysis. 
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and other components of equity where Sterling weakens against the respective currencies.

The Group has no material exposure to interest rate sensitivities, however, in addition to the year-end risk quantified we remain susceptible to the 
changes on foreign exchange rates on our future currency cash inflows and outflows which although are notable, are mitigated through the use 
of forward exchange contracts from time to time and are not anticipated to materially affect the earnings in the future periods. Gresham Technologies plc

During the year ended 31 December 2017 , share options granted under the 2010 Share Option Schemes were exercised and the Group issued 
707 ,979 (2016: 350,000) ordinary shares accordingly (ranking pari passu with existing shares in issue). See note 23 of the Group financial statements 
for further details.
At 31 December 2017 and 2016 there were outstanding options granted to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. See note 23 for further details.
There are no preference shares in issue (2016: none).
An explanation of the Group’s capital management process and objectives is set out in the discussion of capital management on page 21 in the 
Strategic Report and capital risk disclosures in note 21.
23. Share-based payments 
The following disclosures are in respect of both the Company and the Group.
The grant of all options and awards is made by the remuneration committee and such grants involve equity settlement. In granting executive 
share options the remuneration committee has regard to both the participant’s level of responsibility within the Group and to individual and 
Group performance. 
Share Option Schemes 2010 
The Share Option Schemes 2010 were approved by shareholders on 30 December 2010, with amendments subsequently approved by 
shareholders on May 2012 and February 2015. The schemes consist of:
 • the Gresham T echnologies plc Enterprise Management Incentive Plan 2010;
 • the Gresham T echnologies plc Unapproved Share Option Plan 2010; and
 • the Gresham T echnologies plc Non-Employee Share Option Plan 2010.
As its name implies, the EMI Plan operates as an enterprise management incentive scheme complying with the EMI Code and accordingly being 
entitled to certain beneficial tax treatment.
The Unapproved Plan enables the remuneration committee to grant share options in excess of the limits applicable under the EMI Code and/or to 
employees of the Group who do not qualify for EMI treatment.
The Non-Employee Plan enables the remuneration committee to grant share options to persons whose services are made available to the Group 
without an employment relationship.
The remuneration committee is responsible for administering the Share Option Schemes 2010, and may grant options to acquire ordinary shares 
to any employees and Directors of the Group, and retains discretion to impose exercise performance conditions as appropriate. Options are 
granted free of charge and are non-transferable. 
The exercise price per ordinary share is determined by the remuneration committee but will not be less than 110% of the middle market price for 
the dealing day immediately preceding the date of grant of the relevant option.
Options may normally be exercised only on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to completion of any relevant performance 
criteria, save to the extent that the remuneration committee in its discretion declares any other period for exercise and will lapse on cessation of 
such employment, save again to the extent the remuneration committee in its discretion allows it to remain exercisable for such period following 
the cessation as it may determine.
Exercise is permitted in conjunction with a takeover or similar transaction and in such circumstances the vesting period does not apply. In the 
event of a takeover, an option holder may, by agreement with the acquirer, exchange his options for options over shares in the acquiring Company. 
At 31 December 2017 , 26 participants held awards under this scheme (2016: 29). Gresham Technologies plc

Share Option Schemes 2010 continued
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted by the Share Option Schemes 2010 is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black Scholes 
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. In all cases, the exercise price is at least 110% of the 
market price on the day prior to the date of grant.

Vesting of options is reliant on achievement of any relevant performance conditions set by the remuneration committee, which typically take the 
form of sales-based targets. 
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected 
volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.

Deferred Share Bonus Plan 2017 
On 11 December 2017 , shareholders approved the Group’s plans for a new all-staff long-term incentive scheme. The Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
will operate in conjunction with the annual cash bonus scheme currently operated by the Gresham Group. A percentage of each participating 
employee’s net annual bonus entitlement will continue to be paid in cash with the remaining amount of the bonus being paid to the trustee of a 
newly established employee benefit trust which will have been constituted to acquire existing issued ordinary shares and facilitate the Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan. These bonus-related shares will be beneficially owned by each participant but held by the trustee as its nominee.
At the same time, a corresponding matching award will be made by the Company, entitling the participant to receive, at nil cost, an entitlement to 
further ordinary shares. These awards will vest subject to the following conditions:
 • The related bonus shares being retained for a specified period; 
 • Any relevant performance targets being met; and
 • The participant remaining in employment with the Gresham Group until the end of the specified retention period.
Due to the establishment of the employee benefit trust, which will acquire existing issued ordinary shares, the Deferred Share Bonus Plan will be 
non-dilutive to existing shareholders above the levels permitted by the Investment Association’s remuneration guidelines. The initial trustee of the 
employee benefit trust, which will be appointed in due course, will be a professional trustee company engaged for this purpose and will be 
independent of the Company and the Directors.
The first awards under the new plan are anticipated in early 2019 in respect of the Group’s performance for FY2018. Gresham Technologies plc

The goodwill recognised above is attributable to intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from 
C24 Technologies Limited due to their nature. These items include the expected value of synergies and assembled workforce.
From the date of acquisition, C24 Technologies Limited has contributed £1,466,000 of revenue (2016: £270,000) to the Group and operating 
profits £1,360,000 (2016: £205,000). 
Contingent consideration – C24 Technologies Limited
As part of the share sale and purchase agreement, contingent consideration of £1,136,000 was agreed. This payment is subject to certain transition 
related objectives and forecasted customer contract renewals being achieved. The contingent consideration is payable in two tranches, one on 
the anniversary of the completion £758,000 and the second payable 18 months after completion £378,000.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group settled the first tranche of contingent consideration which resulted in a reduction in contingent 
consideration liability on the balance sheet. The reduction in the fair value paid was due to slightly lower achievement of performance targets, this 
adjustment has been recognised as a gain within the Group exceptional line in the Group Income Statement. An adjustment to the outstanding 
contingent consideration has also been made on the same basis reducing the balance to £356,000.

Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Parent Company financial statements of Gresham Technologies 
plc (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements 
and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
and as required by the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost 
convention as modified for financial instruments that are measured 
at fair value and were approved for issue on 12 March 2018.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as 
permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. For the year 
ended 31 December 2017 , the Company recorded a retained profit of 
£683,000 (2016: profit of £665,000).
Disclosure exemptions adopted
In preparing these financial statements the Company has taken 
advantage of all disclosure exemptions conferred by FRS 101. 
Therefore these financial statements do not include:
 • certain comparative information as otherwise required by 
EU-endorsed IFRSs;
 • certain disclosures regarding the Company’ s capital;
 • a statement of cashflows;
 • the effect of future accounting standards not yet adopted;
 • the disclosure of the remuneration of key management personnel; and
 • disclosure of related party transactions with other wholly owned 
members of the Gresham T echnologies plc Group.
In addition, and in accordance with FRS 101, further disclosure 
exemptions have been adopted because equivalent disclosures are 
included in the consolidated financial statements. These financial 
statements do not include certain disclosures in respect of:
 • share-based payments;
 • business combinations;
 • assets held for sale and discontinued operations;
 • financial instruments (other than certain disclosures required as a 
result of recording financial instruments at fair value);
 • fair value measurement (other than certain disclosures required as a 
result of recording financial instruments at fair value); and
 • impairment of assets.
Investments
Investments are recorded at cost less provision for impairment. 
Financial assets
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets classified as held for trading and other assets designated 
as such on inception are included in this category. Financial assets are 
classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short 
term. Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are 
designated as hedging instruments. Assets are carried in the balance 
sheet at fair value with gains or losses on financial assets at fair value 
through profit or loss recognised in the profit and loss account.
Impairment of financial assets
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial 
asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and 
receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount 
of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cashflows (excluding 
future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial 
asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate 
computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is 
reduced, with the amount of the loss recognised in administration costs.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases 
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after 
the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised in the profit and loss account to the extent that the carrying 
value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Other receivables
Where the time value of money is material, other receivables are carried at 
amortised cost. Provision is made when there is objective evidence that 
the Company will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are 
written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Taxation
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected 
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax 
rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the statement 
of financial position date.
R&D tax credits are recognised on an accruals basis and recorded as a 
credit in the taxation line of the Income Statement.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
 • where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
 • in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled 
and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future; and
 • deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax 
losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability 
is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted 
at the statement of financial position date.

Financial Statements
Notes to the Company financial statements continued
1. Accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
Income taxes continued
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each 
statement of financial position date. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off 
current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income 
taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits 
the Group to make a single net payment.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income 
or directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to 
other comprehensive income or directly to equity. Otherwise, income 
tax is recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at an 
approximation of the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Resulting exchange 
gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
The Company uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce 
exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. Such instruments 
are stated at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value are taken to the profit and loss account in the period.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated by reference 
to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity 
profiles. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive 
and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 101 
from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are wholly 
owned subsidiary undertakings of the Gresham Technologies plc Group.
Leasing commitments
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and 
loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives 
are recognised over the lease term and the period to the next rent review.
Share-based payments – equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by 
reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is 
recognised in the Company financial statements as a capital contribution 
to the subsidiaries for whom the employees perform services, with the 
credit entry being made to reserves, over the vesting period, which 
ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully 
entitled to the award. 
Fair value of awards with a market condition based performance target 
is determined by an external valuer using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing 
model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares 
of the Company (market conditions). Fair value of awards with a financial 
result-based performance target is determined by management using 
the Black Scholes pricing model.
No capital contribution is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not 
the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting 
conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense 
is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement 
or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument 
subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described 
above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous 
balance sheet date is recognised as a capital contribution, with a 
corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new 
award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the 
cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised 
as a capital contribution over the original vesting period. In addition, 
an expense is recognised as a capital contribution over the remainder 
of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, 
based on the difference between the fair value of the original award 
and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date 
of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested 
on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income 
statement for the award is recorded as a capital contribution immediately. 
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation 
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value 
being treated as a capital contribution in the balance sheet.
