Strategic report
easyHotel at a glance
Growing our pipeline I am delighted to report that easyHotel 
has made great progress in implementing 
its strategy for growth. Strong trading 
across both the existing estate and the 
Group’s newly opened hotels has delivered 
increases not only in total systems sales 
but like-for-like revenues as well.
Strategy
We continue to target carefully selected locations 
to build our portfolio of owned and franchised 
hotels, adopting a methodical approach to the 
assessment of individual pipeline opportunities 
and applying strict investment return criteria. 
In addition, a number of initiatives have been 
progressed during the year to optimise the value 
of existing assets including investments to improve 
our revenue management systems and processes 
and our customers’ online booking experience.
The equity capital and bank debt we raised 
last year have enabled us to commit to a strong 
pipeline of new sites. Following recent acquisitions 
those funds are now substantially committed. 
Further refinements to our hotel development 
processes and design standards will deliver a 
lower risk, higher performing model for new 
projects. During the year, two new owned 
hotels have been opened in Birmingham and 
Manchester and both are trading strongly. 
Since the year end, our new owned hotel in 
Liverpool was opened on 1 November 2017 
and further projects are in progress in Newcastle, 
Barcelona, Leeds, Sheffield, Ipswich, Oxford and 
Cardiff. This significant increase in our owned 
estate, together with new franchised hotels 
opened in Brussels, Amsterdam Arena and 
Amsterdam Zaandam (and with others on 
the way), is providing an ever more solid 
foundation for our strengthening brand.
The benefit of our “new look” room design is 
evidenced by the above-budget performance 
we are seeing from our newly launched hotels 
which continue to exceed our own expectations. 
A programme to refresh two of three legacy owned 
assets (Croydon and Glasgow) will be completed 
within the coming months and we expect to see 
a similar positive impact on the revenues of those 
hotels. In addition, we have plans to upgrade 
our London Old Street 92-room hotel and, 
subject to planning consent, exploit the value 
of the remainder of the building through 
development of office accommodation.
Dividend
An interim dividend of 0.1 1p per ordinary share 
was paid on 30 June 2017 . The Board is now 
pleased to recommend to shareholders the 
payment of a final dividend of 0.22p per share 
on the basis of our enlarged share capital. Subject 
to shareholder approval at our forthcoming AGM, 
this dividend will be paid on 15 February 2018 to 
shareholders on the register on 19 January 2018.
Board and management team
The Board would like to thank everyone in 
easyHotel’s team for their part in delivering 
another successful year for the business. 
In particular, the Company has benefited 
from continuity within our skilled executive 
team. Chief Executive Officer, Guy Parsons, 
and Chief Financial Officer, Marc Vieilledent, 
bring a wealth of sector experience, hard 
work and commitment that enable us to 
make considerable progress. We are very 
fortunate to have Scott Christie’s wise and 
pragmatic contribution as Non-Executive 
Director and Chairman of our Audit and 
Remuneration Committees.
Outlook
Whilst the wider macroeconomic uncertainty 
continues to impact consumer confidence, 
we believe easyHotel is well positioned. 
The refinements that have been introduced 
to the business over the course of the last year 
are further strengthening our brand and ensuring 
that the easyHotel offering is one that can 
support delivery of the Board’s ambitious 
long-term strategy for growth.

Continued focus Summary
• Strong trading across existing hotels
• Continued outperformance 
against our competitive set 
• Excellent progress achieved

Strategy 
I am delighted to be leading this ambitious 
business at such an exciting time in its history.
2016/17 was a significant year for easyHotel 
with excellent progress achieved across all 
areas of the business. Impressive like-for-like 
sales growth was delivered, underpinned by the 
smooth implementation of our new booking 
engine and yield management system across 
the entire easyHotel network. We opened five 
new hotels during the year in our new stylish 
brand format, all of which have traded strongly 
from opening. The increase in sales and new 
openings, together with our focus on reducing 
costs, improving efficiencies and maximising 
the returns from our investments, have produced 
a significant growth in our underlying profits.
Our pipeline of new hotels is accelerating. 
The successful equity fundraise in October 2016 
is enabling us to develop and open more owned 
hotels and such investment in the brand and 
estate should in turn encourage more franchisees 
to join the brand. 
With the experienced team we now have in place, 
continued high levels of staff engagement and 
improving customer satisfaction, we are in an 
excellent position to expand the easyHotel brand 
and deliver improving returns for our shareholders. 
Trading review 
Total system sales grew by 39.2% to £29.7m 
with Company revenues increasing by 39.7% 
to £8.4m. This was achieved through like-for-like 
owned and franchised hotel sales growth of 
9.8% as well as the opening of new owned 
hotels in Birmingham and Manchester, and 
franchised hotels in Brussels, Amsterdam Arena 
and Amsterdam Zaandam. Occupancy for 
all owned and franchised hotels was 79.7% 
(2016: 76.2%). The five hotels opened in the 
new brand style have all traded very strongly 
since opening, with a combined occupancy 
in excess of 85%. We will continue to monitor 
their progress closely and the impact on the 
time taken for new hotels to reach maturity in 
future. Our strong sales performance led to 
a 48.3% increase in adjusted EBITDA to 
£2.30m (2016: £1.55m). 
Owned hotels 
Our owned hotels continued to win market 
share with revenue growing by 13.7% on a 
like-for-like basis. The new booking engine 
and revenue management system rollout, 
together with selling an allocation of rooms 
via selected online travel agencies (OTAs), 
resulted in our owned hotels significantly 
outperforming their competitive set (as measured 
by STR) throughout the year. As previously 
announced, the Board plans to retain a 92-room 
hotel at Old Street and is applying for planning 
permission to add additional floors to the building 
for use as office accommodation which should 
maximise value from this freehold property. 
We have started a £1.5m refurbishment of our 
other two legacy owned assets in Croydon and 
Glasgow, to improve the quality of the hotels 
and to bring them into line with our new brand 
look. We expect their refurbishment to be revenue 
enhancing during the current financial year.
Franchise partners
Like-for-like revenue at our franchised hotels 
increased by 8.6% during the financial year, 
with total currency adjusted sales increasing 
by 32.2%. The hotels in Continental Europe 
performed particularly strongly. Dubai, Luton 
and Heathrow were refurbished during the 
year and we are discussing refurbishment 
plans with a number of other franchisees 
to introduce the new brand look and feel. 
There were 20 franchised hotels operating 
in our network at 30 September 2017 . 
Market outlook 
The UK hotel market performed strongly in 
201 7 with Sterling’s weakness (versus the US Dollar 
and Euro) resulting in an increase in staycations 
and inbound tourism. London’s RevPAR growth 
was particularly strong during the first half of 
the year and, encouragingly, regional RevPAR 
has also improved. The European hotel market 
continued to perform strongly during the financial 
year. Growth in Europe is still being predominantly 
driven by occupancy, which suggests a healthy 
supply and demand balance and scope for 
further rate increases.
The Board remains confident that despite any 
uncertainties surrounding the current Brexit 
negotiations, the easyHotel brand will continue 
to outperform its hotel sector as consumers 
seek out the best value for money.
Development review 
Development of owned hotels 
We have a growing pipeline of hotels under 
development. Barcelona and Ipswich, both 
acquired last year, will open in mid-2018.
During the year and post year end, we secured 
a further five new hotel sites in aggregate which 
are listed below: 
 • Lands Lane, Leeds, acquired under a 250-year 
ground lease. The 93-room hotel will open in 
mid-2018. 
 • High Street, Sheffield, acquired on a freehold 
basis. The 131-room hotel will open in 
mid-2018. 
 • Oxford, a 25-year lease, subject to planning 
permission. The 180-room hotel should open 
during the next financial year. 
 • Central Cardiff, acquired on a freehold basis, 
subject to planning permission. The 120-room 
hotel will open in 2019. 
 • Tune hotel in Newcastle – we agreed to take 
over a 25-year lease of a 104-room hotel, 
opening as an easyHotel this month. 
Recently opened hotels, with our new and 
improved design, are performing better than 
their original business case, whilst industry wide 
construction cost inflation has generally added 
to our owned hotel project costs. On aggregate 
these projects are still expected to deliver an 
unlevered return on capital employed (ROCE) 
of 12–13%.
4 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Transforming our business
Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s review Together with leased hotel projects, 
considered on a limited and specific basis 
where the acquisition of a suitable freehold 
site is not currently available or does not meet 
our investment return targets, and our new 
franchised hotels, which are delivering more 
fees than initially anticipated, we expect to 
deliver a 15% unlevered blended ROCE 
at Group level.
We have 921 owned rooms under development 
and following the successful £38m (gross) 
equity placing in October 2016, and the £12m 
refinancing of an existing bank facility, the Group’s 
asset-backed balance sheet remains strong but 
with our current development pipeline we are 
only able to finance one further owned hotel. 
We continue to see a good number of attractive 
potential development opportunities to further 
accelerate the Group’s growth. Consequently, the 
Board is considering its financing options, which 
may include new equity and debt, to fund 
these opportunities.
Development of franchised hotels
There are 1,798 franchised rooms currently 
under development. The 101-room hotel in 
Lisbon, the 100-room hotel in Bernkastel-Kues, 
the 81-room hotel in Belfast, the 87-room hotel 
in The Hague – Scheveningen, the 75-room 
hotel in Maastricht and the 54-room hotel 
in Reading will all open in 2018. We also 
announced the development of hotels in 
Bur Dubai (300 rooms), Istanbul (300 rooms), 
Iran (500 rooms) and Sri Lanka (200 rooms) 
beyond 2018. These hotel openings will enhance 
our position as the super budget hotel brand of 
scale, in the UK, Europe and the Middle East.
Pipeline
In addition to the 2,719 owned and franchised 
rooms we currently have under development, 
we have extended our pipeline during the year, 
with over 2,300 owned and leased rooms under 
negotiation, including c.1,000 owned and leased 
rooms approved by the Board, as well as a further 
c.1,300 franchised rooms under negotiation. 
This confirms our strategic analysis that there 
is the potential in the UK and Europe for a total 
of 12,000 owned and leased rooms and for a 
total of 15,000 franchised rooms. The potential 
for franchised development outside the UK 
and Europe is yet to be fully assessed; however, 
recent franchised activity and enquiries in the 
Middle East, Africa and Asia have indicated 
that there is strong demand for the easyHotel 
brand outside Europe.
Capability review
It is essential that we continue to build the 
capability of the business, ensuring we have 
the right platform in place to support our 
ambitious growth plans.
Organisation and culture
To grow as a business and succeed on all fronts 
we continue to enhance our organisation and 
culture. We fully recognise and endorse the need 
for dynamic leadership with clear executive 
accountability and a relentless customer focus. 
Having appointed a new senior team last year, 
to ensure that we have the right breadth of talent 
in place to deliver our growth plans going forward, 
our focus this year has been on ensuring that all 
our team members feel valued and recognised 
and have the opportunity and support to reach 
their full potential. 
With such an exciting future, it is perhaps not 
surprising that our staff engagement score was 
82% during the year. At the year end the Group 
employed 50 staff (2016: 45). 
Brand strength
easyHotel’s core strength is our ability to 
leverage the recognised and trusted “easy” 
brand. We know that improving customer 
recommendation is a priority for our future 
success and finding out what our customers think 
is central to our business. Our operations teams 
focus on customer feedback via social media 
sites in general, and TripAdvisor in particular, 
and our hotels are ranked against a competitive 
set on a monthly basis. The Group TripAdvisor 
score at the year end was 3.5 (2016: 3.3). 
This relentless focus on customer feedback is 
already paying off and will remain an integral 
part of the way we do things in the future.
Technology 
Although we are now selling a controlled 
number of rooms via OTAs, we remain focused 
on driving sales via our own website. Our new 
booking engine will allow us to launch a new 
website and mobile app and introduce automated 
check-in kiosks, to improve every stage of the 
customer journey online and at our hotels. 
Our marketing campaigns will be further 
refined to maximise the traffic to our website 
and improve the return on our marketing 
investment. With a new revenue management 
system in place, we will be in an excellent 
position to make further improvements to our 
customers’ web journey, as well as introduce a 
more dynamic pricing strategy to further drive 
RevPAR growth. By offering our customers a 
good night’s sleep at a super price and a quick 
and easy way to make a booking, we believe 
that we will attract new customers and 
encourage significant repeat visits.
Our values 
At easyHotel we believe that it’s not just what 
we do, but how we do it. We believe in providing 
our teams an opportunity to build a great career, 
in providing our customers with a truly super 
budget stay and giving our shareholders a 
great return on their investment.
I want to take this opportunity to thank every 
employee across the Group and our business 
partners for making easyHotel as good as it is. 
I’m confident that, together, we can continue to 
deliver on our strategic objectives in the months 
and years ahead.
Guy Parsons
Chief Executive Officer
5 December 2017
5 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Our Board believes we have the right strategy in place to achieve our long term growth targets.
Our business model:
 
Customer understanding
 • Budget hotels are chosen 
because of location and price – 
consumers choose them because 
they’re close to where they 
need to be.
 • Customer needs are 
relatively simple: a great 
bed, well-trained, friendly staff 
and well-designed rooms.
 • A brand that is easy and simple 
to do business with.
 
A market opportunity
 • The significant independent 
sector is in structural decline.
 • The branded budget sector 
has grown faster than any other 
sector in the UK hotel industry for 
the last 30 years, and is forecast 
to continue doing so.
 • easyHotel can steal market share 
from other operators, creating a 
medium-term opportunity to open 
8,000 owned rooms and 4,000 
franchised rooms in the UK, 
4,000 owned rooms in Europe 
and 11,000 franchised rooms 
opportunities in Europe.
 • Further opportunities exist in 
Africa, the Far East, Australasia and 
North, South and Central America.
 
Maximising revenues
 • We don’t have restaurants in our 
hotels – we use every available 
space to sell bedrooms.
 • We offer a consistent, good 
quality room at a low price. As a 
result, our occupancies are high.
 • Revenues are maximised via the 
revenue management 
and eCommerce strategy.
 
Delivering shareholder 
returns
• Our operating margins are high. 
We outsource our cleaning to 
specialists and keep our staffing 
levels to a minimum.
• We use a combination of owned 
and franchised hotels. Franchised 
hotels build a brand presence 
without the need for capital 
investment, deliver a high 
incremental margin and increase 
Group ROCE.
• The Group adopts strict 
investment criteria for owned hotel 
development (including leased 
hotels) that will contribute towards 
the Group ROCE target of 15%.
• With a strategy to dispose 
of non-core assets in place, 
maximising the capital available  
to build bedrooms.

Sri Lanka Revenue
Total revenue increased by 39.7% to 
£8.42m (2016: £6.02m), driven by the 
strong performance of our owned hotels, which 
significantly outperformed the market, and the 
opening of new owned and franchised hotels 
during the period.
Total revenue from our owned hotels was up by 
39.7% to £6.60m (2016: £4.73m). Like-for-like 
revenue growth was 13.7%. In our owned estate 
average occupancy was 86.7% (2016: 82.1%) 
and average daily rate (ADR) per room was £41.9 
(2016: £40.0). Revenue from our franchised hotels 
was up by 39.8% to £1.81m (2016: £1.30m), 
including a one-off exit fee of £0.15m relating 
to the Earl’s Court franchisee. Like-for-like growth 
in franchised hotels revenue was 8.6%. Average 
occupancy was 77 .7% (2016: 74.5%) and ADR 
per room was £49.4 (2016: £42.6) in our 
franchised estate. 
the interim dividend of 0.1 1p (2016: 0.1 1p) paid 
on 30 June 2017 . 
Cash flow and balance sheet 
Net cash generated from operations was 
£2.22m (2016: £0.85m). 
Net cash used in investing activities was 
£23.13m (2016: £9.65m), reflecting the costs 
incurred during the year of our owned hotel 
and IT development projects. 
Net cash generated from financing activities 
was £40.57m (2016: £0.27m used in financing 
activities), primarily relating to the completion 
in October 2016 of a £38.0m placing (£36.6m 
after expenses) plus the refinancing of our existing 
£7 .2m bank facility with a new £12.0m facility 
in November 2016 and the arrangement of 
an €8.25m mortgage facility to finance the 
construction of our first owned hotel in Spain 
in January 2017 . 
As at 30 September 2017 , total bank 
borrowings were £12.03m (2016: £7 .20m). 
The Group ended the financial year with net 
assets of £70.18m (2016: £33.21m), of which 
£33.26m comprised cash and cash equivalents 
(2016: £13.66m).
The Group accounts for its assets using the 
historical cost method; however, if our hotel 
portfolio was valued on the open market, the 
Board expects the corresponding value of this 
portfolio to be materially above its current net 
book value, underpinning the strength of the 
Group’s balance sheet.
1,125,000 ordinary shares in the Company 
were held by the Employee Benefit Trust 
(2016: 1,125,000).
Post-balance sheet events 
On 30 October 2017 , the Group announced 
the acquisition of a site in Cardiff to develop a 
new 120-room freehold easyHotel, subject to 
planning permission. On 15 November 2017 , 
the Group announced the takeover of a 25-year 
lease of the 104-room Tune hotel in Newcastle, 
opening as an easyHotel in December 2017 . 
On 16 November 2017 , the Group announced 
a further 162 franchised rooms (two hotels) under 
development in The Hague and Maastricht, to 
open in the second half of 2018.

£0.32m to £1.98m (2016: £1.66m) on the 
back of continued investment in our team to 
deliver our ambitious growth plans.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax (PBT) decreased by 21.1% to 
£0.86m (2016: £1.09m). Despite the increase 
in adjusted EBITDA, the decrease in profit before 
tax was mainly driven by a £0.24m loss related 
to writing down the net book value of the 3rd 
and 4th floors of our Old Street hotel following 
their previously announced closure (2016: £Nil) 
and no capital gain this year, contrary to the 
capital gain on the Liverpool ground floor 
disposal in 2016 for £0.28m.
Other factors driving PBT include:
 • Pre-opening costs increased to £0.22m 
(2016: £0.09m) in the year, following an 
increase in new hotel openings. Depreciation 
and amortisation also increased to £0.83m 
(2016: £0.45m), following the opening of our 
owned hotels and IT investments made. 
 • Share based payments expense of £0.17m 
(2016: £0.16m) was recorded during the year.
 • Other non-recurring net costs incurred (note 5) 
in the year amounted to £0. 1 6m (201 6: £0. 10m).
 • Finance income was £0.27m (2016: £0.25m) 
including interest on cash deposits and foreign 
exchange gains and a finance expense of 
£0.09m (2016: £0.20m) related to interest 
on borrowings incurred during the year, 
net of borrowing costs attributable to the 
construction of new owned hotels capitalised 
as required by IAS 23.
Taxation 
The effective tax charge for the period 
was 25% (2016: 20%). 
Earnings per share and dividend 
The profit for the year was £0.64m 
(2016: £0.88m), with the impact of our 
enlarged share base giving rise to basic 
earnings per share of 0.7p (2016: 1.4p). 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.22p 
per ordinary share, or a total dividend for the 
financial year of 0.33p (2016: 0.33p) including

Change of risk 
during the year Comment
Failure to extend the 
hotel portfolio in line with 
strategic targets and funding 
and returns parameters
Our executive and wider management teams 
have the extensive sector experience needed 
to both identify good opportunities and deliver 
development and franchising initiatives. We 
actively seek to identify potential sites and 
franchisees in the UK, Europe and beyond to 
develop our hotel portfolio. We keep resources 
under review to avoid overstretching the team.
No change in risk Significant pipeline of franchised 
hotels currently in place versus the 
prior year.
Brand reputational damage The Group operates to defined brand standards 
and carries out brand audits to ensure they are 
maintained. Responsibility is clearly defined, within 
both the owned and franchised elements of the 
business, to ensure brand standards are met.
No change in risk
A stylish new brand format has 
been designed, the brand manual 
has been reviewed and updated 
and an active programme of 
monitoring and enforcement 
is in place.
Failure to raise capital 
necessary for future 
development
The Group’s planned rate of growth is dependent 
on continued supply of external capital and 
management continues to work with advisers, 
investors and banks to meet its long-term needs.
No change in risk The increasing strength of 
the brand and business and 
growing track record of delivering 
against targets have enhanced 
our reputation and credibility to 
raise finance; however, external 
factors such as Brexit remain a 
cause for caution.
Brexit increases uncertainty 
in the political or economic 
outlook, adversely impacting 
the business
Budget hotels have outperformed the rest of the 
sector and this trend would be expected to continue 
in a recessionary environment as consumers seek 
better value. A weak Pound would be expected to 
increase staycations and inbound tourism, benefiting 
our predominantly UK based business.
No change in risk Our owned hotels focus in the 
UK has been a benefit in the year 
under review and we continue to 
develop our portfolio in the UK 
and employment initiatives have 
been introduced to fill particularly 
hard-to-recruit-for positions.
Disaster incidents that 
could seriously impact the 
business such as fire, flood 
or terrorist attack
A comprehensive disaster recovery plan with back-up 
processes and facilities to ensure the business can 
continue to operate with minimal disruption is in place. 
This combines with appropriate insurance cover to 
protect the business in the event of a disaster incident.
No change in risk Improved disaster recovery 
measures implemented 
and terrorist insurance 
cover reviewed.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board has primary responsibility for ensuring the Group’s risks are properly 
understood, quantified and appropriately managed, but it looks to the Audit Committee 
to provide assurance on risk management processes and controls. The Audit Committee 
and the Board review the Group’s risk register. The actions proposed and taken by 
management to mitigate risk and to reduce the likelihood and impact of the risks 
faced by the business are considered regularly and are deemed satisfactory. 
The principal risks and uncertainties of the business and how they are managed are 
set out in the table below.

(both during induction and on an ongoing basis), the 
appointment of fire marshals and trained first aiders 
and the maintenance of appropriate accident reporting 
procedures safeguard our staff and guests.

health and safety meetings and an 
increased focus on fire risk have 
been introduced.

and Remuneration Committees.

healthcare businesses.
Scott was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of the Company in June 2014 and chairs 
both the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Board of Directors
The Company currently has four Directors, of whom two are independent Non-Executives.
13 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 The Board is committed to effective corporate 
governance as the basis for delivering long-term 
value growth and is meeting shareholder 
expectations for proper leadership and oversight 
of the business. Accordingly the Board has 
adopted processes which reflect the principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
QCA Corporate Governance Guidelines for 
Smaller Quoted Companies. Not all of the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code are appropriate to easyHotel and 
accordingly the Company does not comply 
fully with the Code, electing instead to adopt 
practices that are proportional and reflect the 
Company’s culture and circumstances, including 
size, complexity and risk. As the business 
continues to develop, those practices will 
evolve and, for this reason, governance 
arrangements are kept under review.
The Board
The Board comprises two Executive Directors 
together with two Non-Executive Directors. 
Our Directors’ biographical details can be found 
on page 13. Both Non-Executive Directors 
are considered to be independent and free 
from any material business or other relationships 
which could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgement.
The Board is responsible for the overall strategy 
of the business and oversight of the Company’s 
performance, risks, financial matters and other 
significant issues. The Company’s strategy is 
summarised on page 6 and elsewhere in the 
Strategic Report.
Supported by the Company Secretary, the 
Board meets monthly and its agendas are set 
to focus on strategy and key decisions and to 
enable proper monitoring and oversight of the 
business to be undertaken. There is a schedule 
of matters which are reserved for the Board 
and documentation in place to clarify the nature 
and extent of delegations. In particular, the 
division of responsibility between the Chairman, 
who is responsible for leading the Board and 
its governance of the Company, and the 
Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible 
for management of the business and delivery 
of the Company’s strategy, is clear.
The Board has formally evaluated its performance 
and effectiveness and, during the year, an action 
plan was developed to address issues identified 
as part of the evaluation process. The overall 
conclusion reached was that, as a unit, the Board 
operates effectively. Under its leadership, the 
business has made significant progress during 
the year and has a clear strategy in place to 
accelerate that growth. A key reason for this 
success has been the Board’s focus on ensuring 
the Company employs the right people and has 
access to the necessary skills and resources to 
deliver its objectives.
Committees
The Board has established an Audit Committee 
comprising the Company’s two Non-Executive 
Directors, which is chaired by Chartered 
Accountant Scott Christie, who has recent and 
relevant financial experience, both as a result 
of his formal qualifications and his roles elsewhere. 
The Committee is responsible for oversight of the 
Company’s financial statements, risk management, 
audit and auditor relationship, and internal 
controls and procedures. The Audit Committee, 
supported by the Company Secretary, plans 
appropriately on an annual basis in order to 
enable it to discharge its duties as set out in its 
terms of reference. A more detailed report from 
the Audit Committee can be found on page 16.
The Board has also established a Remuneration 
Committee to oversee remuneration policy and 
determine the remuneration and benefits of the 
Company’s Executive Directors as well as other 
terms relevant to their appointment. This Committee 
also comprises the Company’s two Non-Executive 
Directors and is chaired by Scott Christie.
Amongst other things, during the year, the 
Committee has taken external advice on the 
Company’s share based incentive plans and 
has made recommendations to the Board to 
ensure that relevant performance targets are 
aligned with the Company’s strategy and are 
sufficiently stretching. Further details of the 
Remuneration Committee’s work and the 
Company’s remuneration arrangements can 
be found on pages 17 to 19. Approval of the 
Remuneration Report will be sought at the 
Company’s AGM.
The Board has chosen not to establish a 
Nomination Committee and instead deals with 
such matters, including succession planning 
and reviewing the balance of the Board, itself.
Shareholder relationships
As well as through formal events such as the 
AGM and the presentation of the annual and 
half-year results, the Board, primarily through the 
Executive Directors, seeks to build a constructive 
and transparent dialogue with the Company’s 
shareholders in order to appreciate better 
shareholders’ views and expectations and 
to enhance investors’ understanding of the 
Company’s strategy and how that strategy 
will be delivered and implemented.
Information on the Company’s investor 
relations website is kept updated and provides 
details of relevant developments, regulatory 
announcements, key forthcoming dates 
and the results of general meetings.
Board attendance
The Directors of the Company are committed to sound governance of the business and they each 
devote sufficient time to ensure this happens. The table below sets out the attendance statistics for 
each Director at Board and, where relevant, Committee meetings held during the financial year.

Governance The Directors are pleased to submit their report 
on easyHotel plc for the financial year ended 
30 September 2017 .
Review of the business
The Group is required to set out a fair review 
of the business and future developments of 
the Group during the financial year ended 
30 September 2017 and the position of the 
Group at the year end. This information can

Post-year-end developments
easyHotel Liverpool opened in November 201 7 
adding a further 78 rooms to the network. 
On 30 October 2017 , the Group announced 
the acquisition of a site in Cardiff to develop 
a new 120-room freehold easyHotel, subject 
to planning permission; this was followed by the 
announcement on 15 November 2017 of the 
takeover of a 25-year lease of the 104-room 
Tune hotel in Newcastle, opening as an easyHotel 
in December 201 7 . Finally, on 16 November 201 7 , 
the Group announced a further 162 rooms 
(two hotels) under development in The Hague 
and Maastricht, to open in the second half 
of 2018.
Dividends
A final dividend of 0.22p per ordinary share 
has been recommended by the Directors for 
the financial year ended 30 September 2017 . 
Subject to approval at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 
15 February 2018 to all shareholders on the 
register on 19 January 2018. This is in addition 
to the interim dividend of 0. 1 1p per share already 
paid, resulting in a total dividend for the year 
of 0.33p per ordinary share.
Charitable and political donations
There were no charitable or political donations 
made during the financial year ended 
30 September 2017 .
Directors’ indemnity provisions
As permitted by the Articles of Association, the 
Directors have the benefit of an indemnity which 
is a qualifying third party indemnity provision as 
defined by s236 of the Companies Act 2006. The 
indemnity was in force throughout the financial 
period and at the date of approval of the financial 
statements. The Group also purchased and 
maintained throughout the financial period 
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
in respect of itself and its Directors.
Auditors
BDO LLP have expressed their willingness to 
continue in office as auditors and a resolution 
to re-appoint BDO LLP will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.

Directors’ report
15 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Audit Committee
The Audit Committee members are Scott Christie, 
who is its Chairman, and Jonathan Lane OBE. 
Scott is a Chartered Accountant who has recent 
and relevant financial experience. 
The Committee is supported by the Company 
Secretary and held three meetings during the 
year ended 30 September 2017 . The Group’s 
external auditors and Executive Directors 
attend the Committee’s meetings by invitation 
and the Committee ensures that the auditors 
also have regular opportunities to speak to the 
Committee in the absence of management.
The Committee’s agendas are planned on an 
annual basis to ensure all the Committee’s duties 
are discharged in a timely manner in accordance 
with its terms of reference. As the Group has no 
separate risk committee, the Audit Committee 
also has responsibility for oversight of the Group’s 
risk management activities and these areas are 
reported on pages 10 and 1 1.
The Audit Committee also reviews arrangements 
for colleagues to report matters of concern in 
confidence and to detect fraud, as well as the 
Group’s ethical and anti-corruption policies.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference, 
which clearly set out its responsibilities and 
procedures, are available on the Group website.
Financial statements
During the year, the Committee reviewed both 
the annual and half-year financial statements. 
The audit plan, including its scope, was discussed 
with the external auditors, as were the findings 
from their audit work. In particular, the auditors’ 
views on the Group’s results and accounting 
policies and the adequacy of financial controls; 
any unadjusted audit differences; post-year-
end events; and management responses and 
materiality judgements were examined and, 
following consideration and discussion, 
were considered satisfactory.
The Audit Committee paid particular 
attention to those risks that were considered 
to be significant, either because of the nature 
of the Company’s activities or because they 
generally apply to all businesses. These risks 
included revenue recognition, management 
override and capitalisation of hotel development 
costs. The Audit Committee satisfied itself, 
through discussion of the audit plan and 
financial controls, that these risks were 
adequately addressed.
Auditor objectivity
The Committee recognises the importance 
of auditor objectivity and independence in 
providing assurance to investors about the 
integrity of the Group’s financial statements. 
The Committee receives information in writing 
from the auditors on their fees (audit and 
non-audit) and the firm’s internal procedures 
to ensure that the independence of the firm, 
including that of its audit staff, audit manager 
and audit partner, is reviewed and properly 
assessed. The Committee has discussed and 
appropriately challenged such issues with the 
audit partner and deemed the responses to 
be satisfactory. 
BDO’s audit partner was rotated in 2016. 
The Committee has considered whether an 
audit re-tender should be recommended to the 
Board but concluded that a recommendation 
at this time for the re-appointment of BDO LLP 
as the Company’s auditors was in the Company’s 
best interests. The Committee will continue to 
keep matters under review.
Audit Committee report
16 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Governance As an AIM company, easyHotel plc is not 
required to comply with Schedule 8 of the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. 
However, the Board is committed to transparency 
of its remuneration arrangements and, accordingly, 
an expanded disclosure has been provided on 
a voluntary basis in order to provide shareholders 
with an overview of our remuneration practices. 
The content of this report is unaudited 
unless stated.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up 
of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors, 
Scott Christie, who chairs the Committee, and 
Jonathan Lane OBE. The Committee reviews 
the performance of the Executive Directors and 
sets the scale and structure of their remuneration 
and the basis of their service agreements with 
due regard to the interests of shareholders and 
to the pay and conditions of other Group staff 
members. The Committee seeks support from 
external advisers as necessary and, during the 
year, Deloitte continued to advise the Committee 
on its review of certain elements of the Group’s 
incentive arrangements. No other services were 
provided by Deloitte to the Group during the year.
The Remuneration Committee also makes 
recommendations to the Board concerning the 
structure of the Group’s bonus and long-term 
incentive schemes, the awards made under 
such plans and the performance conditions 
attached to them. 
During the year ended 30 September 2017 , the 
Committee met six times.
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website.
Remuneration policy
The objective of the Group’s remuneration policy 
is to ensure that the overall remuneration of the 
Executive Directors is aligned with the strategy, 
performance and risk tolerance of the Group, 
whilst preserving an appropriate balance of profit 
delivery and shareholder value. The overall 
arrangements are designed to support the 
delivery of the Company’s long-term 
strategic goals.
The remuneration arrangements for 
Executive Directors consist of basic salary, 
payment in lieu of pension contribution, annual 
performance related bonuses and long-term 
performance share awards. In common with 
other employees, the Executive Directors are 
also entitled to participate in the easyHotel plc 
ShareSave Plan (note 27).
In determining the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee 
seeks to enable the Group to attract, retain and 
motivate Executives of the highest calibre, but 
without paying more than is necessary for this 
purpose. During the year, a 7 .74% basic salary 
increase was awarded to the Chief Financial 
Officer. A 10% increase was awarded to the 
Chief Executive Officer in February 2017 , this 
being the first pay increase awarded to him 
in the 18 months since his appointment.
The Remuneration Committee has worked 
to establish performance related incentives 
that support the delivery of easyHotel’s strategic 
goals, ensuring that individual rewards are 
linked to clear and stretching corporate and 
individual targets. These performance related 
elements of pay, described further on the following 
page, are intended to represent a significant 
proportion of each Executive Director’s 
overall remuneration. 
Annual bonus
The annual bonus payable for 2017 was based 
upon achievement of EBITDA and profit before 
tax targets together with new hotel developments. 
Details of the payments made are provided on 
page 19.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee 
determined that an additional discretionary 
one-off bonus of 33% of basic salary should 
be paid to the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer in April 2017 in 
recognition of the successful £38m placing in 
October 2016 made at a substantial premium 
to prevailing market rates and also their 
contribution to securing the Company’s 
successful bank refinancing at the same time.
When reviewing the basis for annual 
bonus awards for 2018, the Committee has 
determined that, at this stage in the Group’s 
development, an appropriate emphasis for 
the performance measures will be delivery 
of EBITDA and PBT targets and measurable 
development growth in both the owned and 
franchised hotel elements of the Group’s 
portfolio. For on-target performance, 
Executive Directors will be rewarded with a 
cash bonus equivalent to 50% of base salary, 
with a 100% bonus being the maximum payable 
in the event that stretch targets are achieved.
Performance Share Plan
Upon the recommendation of the Committee, 
the Board has previously established the easyHotel 
Performance Share Plan in 2015. This plan 
enables conditional share awards to be 
granted which are subject to achievement of 
performance criteria typically measured over 
a three-year performance period. Awards of 
up to 200% of salary can be granted under 
the plan; however, it is expected that normal 
awards will be capped at 100% of salary.

2017 awards
At the time of the Company’s issue of new capital (completed in October 2016), the Remuneration Committee undertook that, having generated 
momentum in the Company’s development programme, the award under the Performance Share Plan would be subject, predominantly (75% minimum), 
to earnings per share performance targets and that future awards would be subject to shareholder approval.
The performance criteria for the awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2017 were based on performance over the 2017 , 2018 and 2019 
financial years and are summarised in the table below.

It is expected that there will be a further award under the Performance Share Plan in 2017/18 but the Remuneration Committee has not yet 
determined the precise terms that will apply. Details will be disclosed at the time of grant and will be subject to shareholder approval.
Executive Directors’ service contracts
The Executive Directors have service contracts setting out the terms of their employment. In each case, the contract may be terminated on six months’ notice.

19 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
internal control systems and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the systems, taking into account 
the size of the Group and the nature of its activities. 
Such systems are only designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure and will only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Going concern
In considering the going concern basis for preparing 
the financial statements, the Directors have 
considered the Group’s objectives and strategy, 
the risks and uncertainties to achieving the 
objectives, and the review of the business 
performance, all of which are set out in the 
Strategic Report section of this report and 
accounts. The Group’s liquidity and funding 
arrangements are set out in notes 17 and 19 to 
the financial statements. The Directors consider 
that the Group has significant cash and borrowing 
facilities for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
after reviewing the Group’s expenditure 
commitments, current financial projections 
and expected future cash flows, together with 
available cash resources and undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities, the Directors have considered 
that adequate resources exist for the Group to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. On this basis, the Directors continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
annual report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Group and Company for that period. 
The Directors are also required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the rules of the 
London Stock Exchange for companies trading 
securities on AIM. 
In preparing these financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the 
annual report and the financial statements are 
made available on a website. Financial statements 
are published on the Company’s website in 
accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements, which may vary from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Company’s website is the 
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity 
of the financial statements contained therein.

21 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of easyHotel plc (the “parent company”) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 30 September 201 7 
which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated and Company 
statements of financial position, the consolidated and Company cash flow statements and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group and parent company financial statements is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 and of the 
Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the 
Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or 
the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when 
the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
The following matter was identified by us as the most significant assessed risk of material misstatement:
Revenue recognition – deferral of revenue and change in revenue systems
As noted in the Strategic Report the Group has implemented new revenue management systems in the period and this has involved a change in the 
systems and processes used to record revenue data. The accounting policy for revenue recognition is explained in note 2 to the financial statements.
easyHotel or their franchise partners receive cash in advance of the customer stay which results in significant deferred revenue balances. The systems 
in place capture all relevant data including receipts value and stay dates and calculates the appropriate revenue and deferred income balances at each 
reporting date. An error in the underlying data could lead to inappropriate recognition of revenue. The change in revenue systems during the year 
created a heightened risk that data had not been appropriately captured during the transition between systems and increased the risk of revenue 
recognition errors.
To address the risk of data migration issues as a result of the change in system our IT audit specialists reconciled the extracted data sets from the old 
revenue system to the new one, and significant variances were investigated. In addition, we confirmed that all deferred income balances were for stay 
dates after the period end, including reviewing these positions at the point of system migration.
22 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017
Financial statements
Independent auditors’ report
to the members of easyHotel plc Key audit matters continued
Revenue recognition – deferral of revenue and change in revenue systems continued
To address the risk of inappropriate revenue recognition at year end, we reconciled all cash receipts during the year with revenue recognised and the 
corresponding deferred income balance and tested the year end deferred income balance on a sample basis. In addition, we confirmed with franchisees 
the revenue for the year and the corresponding royalties, which supported the period end deferred income balances.
Our application of materiality and overview of the scope of our audit
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality which, together with 
qualitative considerations, help us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement areas 
and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
The Group’s business is in a development stage and recent acquisitions and development of sites have resulted in significant assets which are not yet 
income generating. In these circumstances we assess materiality for the financial statements as a whole to be £520,000 based on 1% of total assets 
excluding long term deposits.
However, we used a lower specific materiality of £121,000 which represents 5% of adjusted EBITDA for the trading related items included within the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income and related balances in the consolidated statement of financial position.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £6,000.
The Group includes one trading subsidiary (easyHotel UK Limited) and an entity which is currently in the process of constructing a hotel (easyHotel 
Spain S.L.U). In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we completed a full scope audit on easyHotel UK Limited and performed desk 
top review procedures and specific audit procedures on easyHotel Spain S.L.U. The Group audit team obtained an understanding of the internal 
control environment related to the financial reporting process and assessed the appropriateness, completeness and accuracy of Group journals 
and other adjustments performed on consolidation.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than 
the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except 
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement 
in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
23 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement as set out in the Directors’ Report, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend 
to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Company statement of changes in equity
for the year ended 30 September 2017 1 Statement of compliance
easyHotel plc (the “Company”), and its wholly owned subsidiaries (easyHotel UK Ltd and easyHotel Spain S.L.U.), is an international owner, developer, 
operator and franchisor of “easyHotel” branded hotels. The Company is a public limited company whose shares are listed on AIM under the ticker 
symbol EZH and is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is 80 Old Street, London EC1V 9AZ.
The consolidated and parent company accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union, taking into account IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
2 Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared based on the historical cost convention. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years 
presented in these accounts, unless otherwise stated.
The Company has taken up its exemption for filing an individual profit and loss account according to section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company’s profit or loss for the financial year has been approved by the Directors in accordance with section 414 (of the Companies Act 2006) 
(total comprehensive income for the year ended 30 September 2017 of £890,203 and total comprehensive income of £1,308,861 for the year ended 
30 September 2016).
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Group generates net profits on an annual basis and has sufficient cash reserves in 
place to continue operating for the foreseeable future. Details on going concern are provided in the Statement of Responsibilities on page 20.
All amounts are presented in Pound Sterling (GBP, £), except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate those of easyHotel plc and its subsidiaries for the years ended 30 September 2016 and 2017 . The financial 
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. On acquisition 
of its subsidiary, easyHotel UK Ltd, merger accounting was the basis of consolidation.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Intragroup balances and transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated accounts.
Investment in subsidiary
easyHotel plc has an investment in easyHotel UK Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary) of £3,825,683 (2016: £3,825,683). This investment is held at cost 
less any reasonable provisions for impairment against the investment, of which there are currently none.
easyHotel UK Ltd has an investment in easyHotel Spain S.L.U. (a wholly owned subsidiary) of £7 ,583,664 (2016: £2,358). This investment is held 
within easyHotel UK Ltd at cost less any reasonable provisions for impairment against the investment, of which there are currently none.
The investment eliminates out for the purpose of the consolidation.
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
The EBT’s assets (other than investments in the Company’s shares), liabilities, income and expenses are included on a line-by-line basis in the 
consolidated financial statements, and its investment in the Company’s shares is deducted from equity in the consolidated statement of financial 
position as if they were treasury shares.
The EBT is not consolidated in the Company’s own financial statements but the Company recognises any transactions between itself and the EBT 
in accordance with the relevant accounting policy.
Foreign currency
The primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates determines its functional currency. The consolidated accounts of easyHotel are 
presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on 
translation are included in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling 
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the transactions were effected.
On consolidation the results of overseas operations are translated into British Pounds at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions 
took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating 
the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the currency translation reserve.

System sales
System sales arises from the sale of goods and the provision of services where these activities give rise to economic benefits received and receivable 
by the Company and its franchisees. System sales is the full amount that the customer pays for our owned and operated hotels, as well as fees in respect 
of franchisee-owned and operated hotels (excluding VAT and similar taxes), including initial sign-on fees paid by franchisees to the Company.
Revenue
Revenue arises from the provision of services where these activities give rise to economic benefits received and receivable by the Company on its own 
account and result in increases in equity. Revenue is the full amount that the customer pays for our owned and operated hotels, plus fees that we charge 
to our franchisees (excluding VAT and similar taxes).
Provided the amount, if applicable, can be measured reliably and it is probable that the Company will receive the consideration, revenue for services 
is recognised as follows:
Owned – primarily derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms and ad hoc utility services sales from owned hotels operated under 
the “easy” brand name. Revenue is recognised when rooms are occupied and ad hoc utility services are provided.
Franchise fees – received in connection with the licence of the Company’s brand name, usually under long-term contracts with the hotel owner. The Company 
charges franchise royalty fees and processing fees as a percentage of room revenue and in some cases receives an upfront fee on the grant of a franchise. 
Revenue is earned and recognised when the customer has occupied the room at the franchisee’s operated hotel accommodation. Upfront fees are 
generally recognised immediately as an initial sign-on income, with portions relating to legal, contractual, marketing or similar items recognised over 
the period from signing to opening. Where upfront fees specifically relate to exclusivity, these fees are recognised over the franchisee exclusivity period.
Consideration received in advance for which the revenue recognition criteria above have not been satisfied are deferred until such time as the revenue 
recognition criteria have been satisfied.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-statutory measure that represents earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation adjusted for pre-opening 
costs related to the development of hotels, organisational restructuring costs, share based payments and other non-recurring items.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised so as to write off their carrying value, less their residual value, on 
a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:
Website and systems development costs – over 5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. Intangible assets are 
reviewed for indicators of impairment where their value is lower than their recoverable value. Any impairment in value is charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost and subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and, where 
appropriate, provision for impairment in value.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all other items of property, plant and equipment so as to write off their carrying value, less their 
residual value, over their expected useful economic lives. It is provided at the following rates:
Building core  –  over 50 years
Building surface finishes  –  over 20 years
Plant and machinery  –  over 8–15 years
Furniture and equipment  –  over 3–5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed for indicators of impairment where their value is greater than their recoverable value. Any impairment in value is charged 
to the statement of comprehensive income.

Financial assets
The Company has not classified any of its financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as available for sale or as held to maturity.
The Company’s accounting policy for loans and receivables is as follows:
The Company’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Company statement of financial 
position. These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise 
principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade receivables) but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary 
asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, cash in transit, restricted cash, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or 
default or significant delay in payment) that the Company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount 
of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the 
impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being 
recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation that the trade receivable will 
not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Financial liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities depending on the purpose for which the liability was acquired. The Group has not classified any of its 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group’s accounting policy for other financial liabilities is as follows:
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Taxation
The current tax is based upon the taxable profit for the period together with adjustments, where necessary, in respect of prior periods. The Group’s 
asset or liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the financial year end date.
Current tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial position 
differs from its tax base.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference 
can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are 
expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when they are paid by 
the Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM).
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief 
operating decision maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.

Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial 
period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for 
their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings, if any, pending their expenditure on qualifying assets, is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised for liabilities of uncertain timing or amounts that have arisen as a result of past transactions and are discounted at a pre-tax 
rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards not yet effective
The following standards, interpretations and amendments have been published but have not been endorsed by the European Union, or are not 
effective for the periods presented and the Group has chosen not to early adopt. All standards listed have to be applied, at the latest, from financial 
years starting on or after 2 October 2015 unless otherwise stated.
No new standards in the year have had a material impact on the financial statements.
• IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (from 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 16: Leases (from 1 January 2019)
• IFRS 14: Regulatory Deferral Accounts (from 1 January 2016)
• IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (from 1 January 2018)
• IFRS 10 (Amendment): Consolidated Financial Statements (from 1 January 2016)
• IFRS 1 1 (Amendment): Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations (from 1 January 2016)
• IFRS 12 (Amendment): Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (from 1 January 2016)
• IAS 1 (Amendment): Presentation of Financial Statements (from 1 January 2016)
• IAS 16 (Amendment): Property, Plant and Equipment (from 1 January 2016)
• IAS 27 (Amendment): Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (from 1 January 2016)
• IAS 28 (Amendment): Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (from 1 January 2016)
• IAS 38 (Amendment): Intangible Assets (from 1 January 2016)
• Annual improvements to IFRS (from 1 January 2016)
The Directors have reviewed the new interpretations and amendments, in particular IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. In particular they have reviewed the 
treatment of certain franchise fees in relation to IFRS 15 and any potential lease arrangements in relation to IFRS 16. The Directors do not anticipate 
that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on easyHotel’s accounts based on the state of operations and 
assets at 30 September 2017 . Certain of these standards and interpretations will, when adopted, require addition to or amendment of disclosures in 
the accounts.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical 
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual 
experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
(a) Impairment of assets
The Group is required to consider assets for impairment where such indicators exist using value in use calculations or fair value estimates. The use of 
these methods may require the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the value in use or fair value.
(b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on the management’s estimates for the period that the 
assets will generate revenue, which, along with their estimated residual values, are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. Changes to 
estimates can result in significant variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 
specific periods. More details including carrying values are included in note 13.
35 easyHotel plc Annual report and accounts 2017 2 Significant accounting policies continued
Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
(c) Taxation
The Group is subject to income tax and significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of 
business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, the Group recognises tax liabilities 
based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognised when the Group believes that certain positions 
are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate 
for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates 
and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgements about future events. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different 
to the amounts recorded, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.
3 Financial instruments – risk management
The Group and the Company are exposed through their operations to the following financial risks:
• credit risk;
• interest rate risk;
• foreign exchange risk; and
• liquidity risk.
In common with all other businesses, the Group and the Company are exposed to risks that arise from their use of financial instruments. This note 
describes the Group and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further 
quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantial changes in the Group and the Company’s exposure to financial instrument risks, their objectives, policies and 
processes for managing those risks, or the methods used to measure them from previous periods, unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group and the Company, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
• trade and other receivables;
• cash and cash equivalents;
• trade and other payables; and
• loans and borrowings.
A summary of the financial instruments held by category is provided below:

General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group and the Company’s financial instrument risk management objectives and 
policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective 
implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function. The Board receives reports from the Group’s finance function through 
which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and 
flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group and the Company if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. On the basis that customers primarily prepay for hotel occupancy, and after carefully reviewing the financial performance 
and forecasts of counterparties to financial instruments as well as holding security over their trading accounts, the Group and the Company’s 
exposure to credit risk from trade and other receivables is considered insignificant.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only 
independently rated parties with minimum rating “A” are accepted.
The Group and the Company do not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk.
The maximum amount of credit risk exposure is reflected in the carrying amount of financial assets held at the year end, excluding cash and cash 
equivalents, of £1,1 14,531 (2016: £20,941).
Market risk
Market risk arises from the Group and the Company’s use of interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that 
the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk) or foreign exchange 
rates (currency risk).
The Company has no fair value and cash flow interest rate risk to disclose.
Interest rate risk
The Group is partially funded through bank borrowings. During the financial year, the Group completed the refinancing of its existing £7 ,200,000 
bank facility with a new five-year facility. The full £12,000,000 available was drawn down in November 2016. Following the first four quarterly repayments 
of £90,000 each, the outstanding balance at 30 September 2017 was £1 1,640,000. Any amount borrowed bears interest at 2.5% above LIBOR.
In addition, the Group arranged an €8,250,000 Euro-denominated mortgage facility to finance the construction of its new hotel in Barcelona. As at 
30 September 2017 , the balance drawn down was €715,372. Any amount borrowed bears interest at 2.25% above one-year EURIBOR.
A 50-basis-point increase in the interest rates would, all other variables kept constant, have decreased the profit before tax by £57 ,482 for the year 
ended 30 September 2017 , while a 50-basis-point decrease would have increased profit before tax by the same amount. 
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has franchisees located outside the UK whose functional currency is not the same as the functional 
currency of the Group, and the Group takes bookings on their behalf in foreign currencies. The Group maintains bank accounts in these currencies 
to provide a natural hedge.
Foreign exchange risk also arises when the Group enters into transactions denominated in a currency other than its functional currency. The volume 
of such transactions is not considered sufficient to warrant hedging the risk exposure. 
The Group’s policy is, where possible, to settle liabilities denominated in foreign currency (primarily the Euro) with the cash generated from its own 
operations in that currency.

Trade and other payables 93,008 — 24,692 — 117,700
Total financial liabilities 93,008 — 24,692 — 117,700
The effect of a 10% strengthening of the Pound Sterling at the reporting date on the foreign-denominated financial instruments carried at that date 
would, all variables held constant, have resulted in a decrease in total comprehensive income for the period and a decrease in net assets of £37 ,050 
(2016: £20,290). A 10% weakening in the exchange rate would, on the same basis, have increased total comprehensive income and net assets by 
£37 ,050 (2016: £20,290).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group and the Company’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on their 
debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group and the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting their financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group and the Company’s policy is to ensure that they will always have sufficient cash to allow them to meet their liabilities when they become 
due. To achieve this aim, the Group and the Company finance their operations through a mix of equity and borrowings. The Group and the Company’s 
objective is to provide funding for future growth and achieve a balance between continuity and flexibility through their bank facilities and intergroup 
loans. The Group has a £12,000,000 Sterling bank facility in place, which has been fully drawn, and an €8,250,000 Euro facility, of which €715,372 
has been drawn.
The Board receives cash flow projections on a regular basis as well as information regarding cash balances. At the end of the financial year, these 
projections indicated that the Group and the Company expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet their obligations under all reasonably 
expected circumstances.

Capital disclosures
The Group and the Company monitor capital which comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium and retained earnings). 
The Group and the Company’s objectives when maintaining capital are: 
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders; and 
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group and the Company set the amount of capital they require in proportion to risk. The Group and the Company manage their capital structure 
and make adjustments to it in light of the changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Group and the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, 
issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

7 Segment information
The Group has two main reportable segments:
• Owned properties – This division is involved in hotel operations carried out in the Group’s owned hotels and properties. 
• Franchising – This division involves the Group’s franchised hotel operations, in connection with the licence of the Group’s brand name.
Factors that management used to identify the Group’s reportable segments
These segments are considered on the basis of different products and services. They are managed separately because each business requires 
different management strategies and poses different business risks.
Measurement of operating segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
The Group evaluates performance on the basis of adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-statutory measure described in note 2.
Segment assets exclude tax assets. Segment liabilities exclude tax liabilities. Even though loans and borrowings arise from finance activities rather than 
operating activities, they are allocated to the segments based on relevant factors (e.g. funding requirements). Details are provided in the reconciliation 
from segment assets and liabilities to the Group position.
