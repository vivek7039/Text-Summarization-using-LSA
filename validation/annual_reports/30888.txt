our business
Results overview
In my first year as Chairman of Spectris, it is pleasing to see  
the Group deliver a 6% increase in constant currency, organic  
(like-for-like, ‘LFL’
1
) sales, driving an 8% LFL increase in adjusted 
operating profit. Reported sales increased 13% in 2017 to  
£1,525.6 million and reported operating profit increased to  
£182.4 million resulting in operating margins of 12.0%  
on a reported basis and 14.7% on an adjusted basis. Cash 
conversion
2
 was 75% of our adjusted operating profit following  
a material step-up in growth capex in our Test and Measurement 
division. Adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’) increased by 14% to 
145.1p with reported basic EPS at 197.0p. 
The Group continues to make good progress on the delivery of its 
strategy and during the year, we made a number of changes to our 
portfolio, including bolt-on acquisitions and a divestment. Following 
these transactions, the Group’s financial position is robust, with net 
debt at £50.5 million at the year end.
The Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 37.5 pence per 
share which, combined with the interim dividend of 19.0 pence, 
gives a total of 56.5 pence per share for the year, an increase of 
9%. This is consistent with our policy of making progressive 
dividend payments based upon affordability and sustainability.  
The dividend will be paid on 29 June 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 25 May 2018. The ex-dividend 
date is 24 May 2018.
Following the sale of Microscan in October 2017, post-tax cash 
proceeds of approximately £91.9 million have been received.  
The Board has, therefore, approved a share buy-back programme 
of £100 million to take place during 2018 and into 2019. The 
Group has considerable financial flexibility and will continue to 
target acquisitions in support of its strategy. 
Clear strategic direction
As a leading supplier of productivity-enhancing instrumentation  
and controls, we provide a combination of highly-specialised 
measuring instruments, software and services for some of the most  
technically-demanding industrial applications. We aim to enhance 
our profitable growth by providing our customers with key insights 
alongside our instruments and, to this end, we are progressively 
adding further software and analytical capabilities and test services 
to our product offerings. This will be focused on key industries and 
will provide customers with insights and solutions focused on their 
specific business needs. These competencies will be added to our 
operating companies by organic investment, software and services 
acquisitions and the deployment of data capture and connectivity 
technology as part of our digital strategy. We will be well placed to 
offer the information and insights to enhance the productivity and 
regulatory compliance of our customers.
 
Our Group has historically focused on the benefits gained from a 
decentralised operating model, but to better serve our customers, 
we have started to evolve our operating model to increase the 
co-ordination between companies across key business functions 
and to leverage our scale. In support of this transformation, our 
Project Uplift programme is now in progress to optimise efficiency 
and effectiveness both within and also across our operating 
companies. In turn, by increasing efficiency and reducing 
complexity, we will free up the resources that will accelerate 
the implementation of our strategic ambition.
Our people 
Integral to the success of Spectris are the skills, experience and 
technical know-how of our employees. As we move forward with 
the delivery of our strategy, it is inevitable that the way in which 
we work together will evolve. I thank all our employees for both the 
contribution during the year and also for their support in driving the 
business forward. 
To ensure the delivery of our strategic objectives, we have 
made a number of key appointments to lead the more significant  
Group-wide initiatives. In particular, appointments have been 
made to deliver a new digital platform, key account management, 
lean initiatives, human resources management and improved supply 
chain management. These will all help to develop best practice  
and, in combination with a talent management programme,  
will ensure we have both the right skills and capabilities in 
place across the Group. 
In remembrance
Dr John Hughes CBE 
In June 2017, Dr John 
Hughes, the former Group 
Chairman, sadly passed 
away. John joined the Board 
as a Non-executive Director 
in June 2007 and became 
Non-executive Chairman of Spectris in May 2008. During  
his tenure, John played a pivotal role in the Company’s 
development. He made a significant contribution to the 
Group’s strategic progress, offering great insight, intellect 
and robust challenge. The Board is deeply grateful for his 
commitment to the role and to the legacy that his leadership 
has left in terms of the Company’s clear strategic direction.
Chairman’s Statement
2 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Alongside this, our ethics and values are central to Spectris, guiding 
our decision-making and ensuring that we always comply with the 
highest standards. Our Code of Business Ethics is fundamental to 
the effective and responsible management of the business and 
for the delivery of shareholder value over the long term and I am 
pleased to see such a strong commitment to this across the Group.
Board update
I am delighted to have joined your Board as Non-executive 
Chairman in May 2017. Since joining the Board, I have visited the 
majority of our operating companies and have seen an open and 
transparent culture with a strong set of values that are in evidence 
across the Group. There is a clear sense of ‘doing the right thing’ 
and the discussion and debate at all levels of the Group is 
engaging, constructive and appropriately challenging.
During the year, we made two appointments to the Board.  
In January 2017, Kjersti Wiklund joined as a Non-executive 
Director and has brought significant knowledge of the international 
telecommunications sector to the Board’s deliberations. In July, 
Karim Bitar was appointed as a Non-executive Director. Karim 
is chief executive of Genus plc, an agricultural biotechnology  
pioneer, and has extensive experience of leading international, 
technology-focused organisations, in particular in the 
pharmaceutical sector. I also express my thanks to Russell King, 
Senior Independent Director, for assuming the Chair earlier in 
the year following the illness of my predecessor, Dr John Hughes.
2017 has been a positive year, 
both in terms of operational 
performance and strategic 
delivery. We will continue our 
strategic evolution to offer 
customers increasing insights  
and solutions alongside our  
world-class instruments. 
Mark Williamson 
Chairman
Summary 
2017 has been a positive year, both in terms of operational 
performance and strategic delivery. It was particularly pleasing 
to record strong organic growth this year. Our aim is to continue 
to deliver organic growth and further improve the Group’s 
profitability, while maintaining a robust financial position. We 
will continue our strategic evolution to offer customers increasing 
insights and solutions alongside our world-class instruments. The 
strategic initiatives that we have launched have positioned us for 
delivering value both to our customers and to our shareholders, 
and this provides the Board with confidence that the Company is 
well placed for the future.

5 Spectris plc Four business segments
Our business comprises 13 operating companies organised 
into four business segments which reflect the applications and 
end-user markets we serve. Each operating company has its 
own products, brands and customers and is responsible for 
developing new products and applications. We have started 
to evolve our operating model to increase the co-ordination 
between companies across key business functions and to 
leverage our scale.
Common values
Despite the individual nature of the businesses, they are all 
united by the same purpose, values and corporate strategy. 
This shapes our culture across the Group. Increasingly, in 
certain end markets there is a more collaborative approach 
across our operating companies to provide the solutions our 
customers require. 
Central oversight
The corporate centre provides strategic direction, governance 
and oversight in addition to support in areas such as M&A, HR, 
legal and tax. It also facilitates the sharing of best practice. 
Project Uplift
Project Uplift is a Group-wide programme focused on reducing 
complexity, freeing up resources and stimulating growth with 
the aim of creating a cost-efficient and scalable platform  
from which we can grow profitably, whilst preserving the 
entrepreneurial spirit of our businesses.
Our Business Model

growth and exploits disruptive growth themes.
How we are structured

Strategic Report
6 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Understanding our customers
Our model is predominantly based on direct routes to market 
through a worldwide network of sales, marketing and support 
offices. This enables us to gain a deep understanding of the 
challenges our customers are seeking to address. Around 80% 
of sales come from customers who have purchased from us in 
the preceding two years. 
Enhancing productivity
Our businesses provide value-enhancing solutions for our 
customers. These include shortening development cycles, 
improving product quality and consistency, increasing yield 
and streamlining processes. Our products typically involve low 
capital expenditure but provide significant and rapid payback. 
Resilient revenues
As well as a high level of repeat business, we offer a full 
range of aftermarket services and support, including training, 
technical support, spare parts, calibration and maintenance. 
This accounts for around 30% of sales.
High returns
Our long-term customer relationships along with high-quality 
innovative products and solutions help sustain high barriers to 
entry which in turn lead to limited pricing pressure, retention 
of market share and high gross margins.
Good cash conversion
Our businesses are capital efficient, focusing on the areas 
where we have market-leading expertise and competitive 
advantage such as R&D, and out-sourcing component and 
sub-assembly production. This results in good cash conversion.
How we generate value Resources and relationships
Continuous innovation
Strong intellectual property and continuous innovation  
are underpinned by sustained investment of around  
7% of sales each year in R&D. In addition, we make both  
bolt-on and platform acquisitions to access new or 
complementary technology and markets, with a  
focus on software and services.
Customer relationships
We build long-term relationships with our customers and  
seek to develop a deep understanding of their business  
and processes.
Employee expertise
Our people play an essential role in delivering our strategy, 
particularly in the development of new products, software 
and services, and building relationships with customers. 
Many of our employees are highly-qualified engineers 
and technicians with deep product and application expertise. 
Supplier partnerships
Supply chain management is an important tool in enabling 
us to deliver high quality at a competitive cost, whilst ensuring 
compliance with international standards and regulations.  
We believe that suppliers should have the opportunity to 
benefit from their relationship with us. In practice, this means 
working together to minimise and manage business risk and 
improve business practices, through education, training and 
the sharing of good practice.

As customer requirements evolve, so too does the 
offering that Spectris provides to them. Our long-term 
customer relationships and technical know-how mean we 
can enhance our offering to them, whether that involves 
the supply of improved equipment or a packaged solution 
combining hardware, software and/or services. 
We build leadership positions in attractive niche markets 
where we believe there are opportunities for  
technology-led productivity enhancement. These markets 
currently include segments within the life sciences and 
pharmaceuticals, energy, automotive, basic materials and 
technology sectors, but we also review and actively 
pursue opportunities in new markets.
In response to a customer base that is extending its 
international operations and becoming increasingly 
sophisticated, we seek to expand our business globally, 
with particular emphasis on markets such as China 
and India.
We strive for continuous improvement in all aspects of 
our business operations, both to enhance customer 
experience and to generate efficiency and productivity 
gains. In addition, we seek to improve performance and 
profitability by driving synergistic opportunities within and 
between our operating companies, and across the Group 
as a whole.
Project Uplift is our productivity enhancement programme 
which is seeing increased collaboration and common 
processes being adopted across the Group to simplify the 
business, increase efficiency and productivity and drive 
continuous improvement and growth.
We acquire businesses which materially strengthen our 
operating companies through broadening their customer 
offering, reaching new customer segments or expanding 
their geographical presence. These are typically bolt-on in 
nature, i.e. integrated into one of our operating 
companies. In addition, we invest in new platform or 
stand-alone businesses in order to establish a presence in 
strategic markets or complementary capabilities.

9 Spectris plc Chief Executive’s Review
Results overview
Reported sales increased by 13% to £1,525.6 million (2016: 
£1,345.8 million) which reflected a 6% increase on an organic, 
constant currency (like-for-like, ‘LFL’)
1
 basis. During the year, we 
continued to make good strategic progress towards broadening  
our portfolio, adding further to our software and services offerings. 
As customers increasingly require an integrated solution, we are 
strategically positioning Spectris to align with their needs and this  
is transforming our business. 
2017 operational performance
An improving demand backdrop in some of the key industries we 
serve has been an important factor behind the 6% increase in LFL 
sales which, combined with 2% net growth from acquisitions and 
disposals and a beneficial impact of 5% from foreign currency 
exchange movements, produced a 13% increase in reported sales. 
LFL sales increased across all four segments and key regions.  
In Materials Analysis, a recovery in metals, minerals and mining plus 
good growth in pharma and semiconductor saw LFL sales increase 
7% whilst automotive was the key sector driving the growth in  
Test and Measurement. Sales to academic research in both these 
segments were lower year-on-year. For In-line Instrumentation, 
the recovery of capital spending in energy and utilities and process 
industries led to higher LFL sales whilst Industrial Controls benefited 
from an improved performance at Omega as well as an ongoing 
recovery in North American industrial spending.
On a regional basis, LFL sales to North America increased by 4%, 
with the second half performance stronger than the first half.  
In Asia, LFL sales continued to grow strongly (up 9%), helped 
particularly by China which grew 11%, along with Japan and India. 
In Europe, LFL sales rose 6%, with a strong second half contribution 
from the UK while sales to Germany grew strongly in the first half. 
Sales to the Rest of the world were up 1%.
Adjusted operating profit increased 11% to £223.5 million  
and reported operating profit was £182.4 million compared  
to £38.3 million recorded in 2016 which included a non-cash 
impairment charge of £115.3 million. On a LFL basis, adjusted 
operating profit increased 8%, primarily reflecting the effect of the 
higher sales volumes and a turnaround in performance at Omega, 
partly offset by adverse product mix and overhead cost increases, 
reflecting increased headcount, wage inflation and the cost to 
achieve our strategic growth initiatives. LFL overheads will continue 
to increase in 2018 at a similar rate to that in 2017, reflecting 
inflationary pressures together with the annualisation of the costs  
of our strategic initiatives which commenced in 2017.
Adjusted operating profit includes costs of £15.8 million in relation 
to Project Uplift. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating margins 
were 15.7%, 0.5pp higher than in 2016 (LFL +1.1pp). Reported 
operating profit included a number of one-off costs and income 
during the year resulting in a net overheads year-on-year benefit  
of £3.5 million.
The Group’s adjusted operating cash conversion was in line with 
our expectations with 75% (2016: 113%) of adjusted operating 
profit being converted into cash. This was lower than usual due  
to increased capital expenditure for the capacity expansion 
programme at Millbrook, resulting in an overall Group capital 
expenditure of £73.1 million. After allowing for the proceeds from 
the divestment of Microscan, net debt stood at £50.5 million at  
the year end, around 0.2 times the full-year adjusted EBITDA.
Executing our
STRATEGY
1. Adjusted performance measures (‘APMs’) are used consistently throughout 
this Report and are referred to as ‘adjusted’, ‘constant exchange rate’ or 
‘like-for-like (LFL)’. These are defined in full and reconciled to the reported 
statutory measures in Note 2 to the Financial Statements.
10 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report capacity in Finland, which is due to be commissioned in the third 
quarter of 2018. 
We will also be adding capability through the joint venture 
agreement we signed with Macquarie Capital in which they have 
agreed to acquire a 50% interest in our environmental monitoring 
business, EMS Brüel & Kjær. It is expected to close in the second 
quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals in China, the 
European Union and South Korea. This partnership, with a 
world-leading infrastructure adviser and investor, should benefit  
the new joint venture in its next stage of development as we jointly 
invest organically and inorganically to collaborate on our remote 
monitoring and analytics offering for environmental monitoring. 
The combination of our expertise in environmental monitoring 
solutions and Macquarie Capital’s significant presence in 
infrastructure markets will accelerate the growth of the business. 
In January 2018, we acquired Concept Life Sciences, which  
provides integrated drug discovery, development, analytical  
testing and environmental consultancy services, mainly in the

Our performance in 2017 was 
good, with like-for-like increases 
in both sales and profit as we 
executed on our strategy, and 
helped by a recovery in the USA 
and certain key end markets.
John O’Higgins 
Chief Executive
Positioning ourselves to deliver  
our solutions strategy
Our strategy is evolving towards the provision of complete solutions 
to our customers, based on our deep application and technical 
expertise, and we made good progress in broadening our software 
and services offerings to customers. 
Corporate development
We completed a number of bolt-on acquisitions in 2017. Setpoint 
brings conditioning monitoring hardware and software solutions 
for rotating and reciprocating machinery, allowing online condition 
monitoring analysis and machinery diagnostics, and has been 
integrated into Brüel & Kjær Vibro to enhance its product offering. 
Omnicon provides a range of services and software to help its 
customers analyse and improve product reliability and safety, 
particularly in aerospace, automotive, transportation and defence. 
The combination of Omnicon’s expertise in reliability design and 
testing with HBM Prenscia’s software and services will enable  
us to provide customers with a broader range of reliability-
improvement solutions.
We further strengthened the Millbrook business in the UK with  
the acquisition of the CSA Leyland Technical Centre, an automotive 
test facility in Lancashire which adds further capacity as well as a 
complementary customer base and services. In addition, we 
invested £25.5 million at Millbrook predominantly on new capacity, 
such as the 4WD climatic emissions chassis dynamometer cell  
which we commissioned in the year, and additional indoor testing 
11 Spectris plc Strategic initiatives
In order to drive our strategic initiatives, we have made a number of 
investments including new central leadership appointments in lean, 
supply chain, software and digital. Ensuring we have best-in-class 
processes and capabilities will be key to our continued success and 
these new roles will be pivotal in developing best practice and 
driving performance enhancement across the Group. This will be 
supported by our new central HR function with its talent 
management and organisational capability programme.
Across the Group, delivery of our strategy has meant more 
collaboration between our operating companies. Automotive is a 
key end-market focus and here we have strengthened our key 
account management approach and provided a more collaborative 
offering. This is based on our expertise in four key areas – durability, 
propulsion, safety and refinement – in order to cross-sell our 
products, software and services from Brüel & Kjær Sound & 
Vibration, HBM and Millbrook. 
At Malvern Panalytical, which we merged at the start of the year, 
there is now one management team and a combined sales and 
marketing team. Their collaboration has led to numerous  
cross-selling opportunities and, together with a more value-based 
approach to providing customer solutions, the combined business 
has made good progress during the year. 
We have also been reviewing our digital-led customer applications, 
with the potential for more cross-group solutions by leveraging 
existing operating company technologies, competencies and  
end-market expertise to more broadly serve our customers’ needs. 
New product development and our combination of hardware  
and software are focused on simplifying the integration of  
customer-generated data with remote data analytics services  
and in January 2018, we launched Spectris Advance to showcase 
this digital offering to customers. 
We decided to divest our machine vision technology business, 
Microscan, as we believe its next stage of development can be 
better fulfilled under new ownership. The Group completed the 
sale to Omron Corporation in October, resulting in post-tax cash 
proceeds of £91.9 million. Our balance sheet remains strong and 
provides the opportunity for us to redeploy capital to add further 
software and services capability. 
Project Uplift
Project Uplift continues to make progress, with Phase 1 fully 
underway. The majority of the Phase 1 savings will be derived from 
leveraging the Group’s scale, for instance through securing 
improved terms for procurement of goods and services, both direct 
and indirect. We made progress on this on a number of fronts 
during 2017; for example, we implemented new global freight 
contracts and are well advanced in the process of transitioning to 
new suppliers for a number of key product components. 
In 2017, the cost of £15.8 million and gross recurring benefit of 
£2.8 million were both lower than originally expected, and included 
an additional £1 million of spend on the Phase 2 shared service 
centre project. As we started to implement the initiatives during 
2017, it became evident that the IT implementation is more 
complex to deliver than we had anticipated and we have therefore 
revised the scope of the programme, resulting in a change in the 
magnitude and phasing of benefits and costs from those originally 
expected. As a result, for Phase 1, we now expect annualised 
recurring savings of £25 million and a total cost to achieve these  
of £35 million by the end of 2019, with more coming from 
procurement activities and less from IT. This compares to previous 
expectations of £35 million of savings and £45 million of costs.  
In 2018, the net benefit for Phase 1 is now expected to be  
£3 million. Work is again underway to affirm the potential benefits 
and costs of the shared service centre project in Phase 2 and we will 
provide further details on this later in 2018. Costs of £3-4 million 
related to this work will be incurred during 2018. 
As well as delivering the projected savings, the programme will 
further support our customer-focused solutions strategy, freeing up 
resources to facilitate the delivery of our strategy by identifying and 
capitalising on cross-group opportunities and making it easier for 
our customers to do business with us. 
Our people deliver the strategy
Ensuring we have the right people in place to deliver the strategy 
will continue to be a key focus. As our business evolves and there is 
more co-ordination across operating companies, it is critical that we 
retain the factors that have driven our success, preserving the 
entrepreneurial and dynamic nature of the Group, as well as 
continuing to promote our strong ethical culture and values. In 
2017, there has been a notable step forward in our leadership 
talent management process and this will continue to be a key focus 
linked to our future strategy and operating model. 
Summary and outlook 
Our performance in 2017 was good, with LFL increases in both  
sales and profit as we executed on our strategy, and helped by  
a recovery in the USA and certain key end markets. In 2018,  
we expect to see the benefit of organic sales growth, partly  
offset by the investment in our strategic growth initiatives and 
foreign currency exchange headwinds. 
We remain focused on increasing productivity and reducing 
complexity through Project Uplift. The magnitude and phasing  
of the benefits and costs from this programme have varied from 
those originally envisaged, primarily due to a re-scoping of the  
IT project. As a result, we now expect Phase 1 to deliver annual 
savings of £25 million at a total cost of £35 million over the period 
to the end of 2019. 
Our key priority remains the implementation of the strategy  
to provide a broader offering to our customers. Our balance  
sheet remains strong and we will continue to make acquisitions  
to support this strategy as we expand our software and  
services capability.

13 Spectris plc Electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles
The prevalence of electric (‘EV’) and hybrid vehicles has increased 
dramatically in recent years as the cost of the EV powertrain has 
become more competitive, emissions regulations become more 
stringent and consumer attitudes undergo rapid change. Growth  
is set to continue, further helped by government incentives and 
subsidies and by the automotive OEMs who are looking to extend 
the range of models they offer. The current hybrid and electric car 
stock now stands at over 2 million and the International Energy 
Agency predicts that this will increase to 9–20 million by 2020. 
R&D by the automotive OEMs has therefore been critical and spend 
has increased, focused on continuing technology improvements to 
further enhance performance and narrow the cost competitiveness 
gap with petrol and diesel vehicles. Similarly with autonomous cars, 
although full driverless technology is still at an advanced testing 
stage, it, too, is attracting notable investment. 
Our expertise in propulsion, durability, refinement and safety  
within the automotive space means we can deploy our hardware, 
software and services to provide solutions to the automotive OEMs 
and benefit from this trend – for example, our automotive testing 
services support new product development; with significantly lower 
noise emissions, our noise, vibration and harshness solutions can 
represent a key competitive advantage to vehicle manufacturers 
and our torque measurement capability can be deployed in 
determining EV mechanical efficiency and power distribution. We 
are also involved in the development and testing of autonomous 
and connected vehicles.
Regulation and compliance
Regulation is increasing in many markets, particularly the 
pharmaceutical, automotive and energy sectors, with an increasing 
emphasis on compliance and particular attention given to data 
integrity. In the automotive industry, stricter emissions testing and 
safety requirements are resulting in greater testing and validation 
during product development, both in the laboratory and in  
real-world driving situations. This leads to new equipment 
purchases as manufacturers upgrade their capabilities and  
also greater use of independent testing, validation and  
assurance services. 
Meeting increasing environmental regulations is also required  
in a number of process industries, such as petrochemicals, where 
customers need to ensure the safe running of their processes and 
reduce emissions. We already provide a number of products which 
help customers to meet regulations and are growing our services 
business to enable customers to demonstrate compliance.
UNDERSTANDING 
our markets 
Market Review
We serve a broad spectrum of blue-chip customers across key manufacturing industries around the world. 
Whilst our principal aim is to enhance our customers’ productivity, we are seeing a number of specific 
demand drivers and growth themes across these industries, which are summarised below. 
Biopharmaceuticals
Biopharmaceuticals are the fastest-growing part of the pharma 
industry as companies invest in new therapies that allow previously 
untreatable conditions to be addressed, offering higher efficacy and 
fewer side effects. This growth is expected to continue for the 
foreseeable future. Many large pharmaceutical companies are 
shifting their presence to biopharma, whilst endeavouring to 
maintain competitiveness through affordability, quality and delivery 
performance. In generics, India and China have seen substantial 
growth as household disposable income increases and there is now 
a drive to improve quality and standards in these regions. 
Generally, the industry is under increasing pressure to ensure 
therapies are delivered rapidly yet safely. Regulation is increasing, 
with manufacturers required to demonstrate compliance with, for 
example, the US Food and Drug Administration, and show that 
their production processes and data collection systems meet Good 
Manufacturing Practice standards. 
We see increasing opportunities for our analysis systems for product 
purity and stability as well as quality control systems to enable 
manufacturers to meet regulatory requirements and mitigate risks 
early on in development, accelerating time to market and 
minimising costs.
Energy
Global commodity markets have seen a wide swing in prices over 
the past five years which has put pressure on producers to reduce 
capital investment, focus on productivity and dedicate spend to 
more cost-effective projects. Energy prices have now stabilised, 
which has renewed confidence in the market and led to selected 
upgrades and new-build projects going ahead, after being 
postponed or cancelled while prices fluctuated.
Alongside this, non-fossil fuel energy sources such as wind are 
seeing major investment. Renewable energy accounted for  
two-thirds of new power added to the world's grids in 2016,  
with solar power the fastest-growing source of new energy. 
Technological advances in materials, cheaper storage and smarter 
grids are driving this efficiency. An increasing focus on air quality is 
also resulting in greater investment in electric and hybrid vehicle 
development, as well as reducing industrial emissions. 
We are seeing increasing demand for a number of our solutions in 
this area: microseismic monitoring; gas analysis products for 
refining and production of chemicals, petrochemicals, natural gas 
and fuels; systems for analysis of new materials; wind turbine and 
hydropower condition monitoring systems; battery testing systems 
and industrial connectivity solutions.

15 Spectris plc Demand for a solutions-based approach is being driven by 
changing market forces and we see a number of key trends  
behind this.
Amongst our customers there are fewer scientists and engineers  
as the existing employee population moves closer to retirement  
and fewer new scientists and engineers are entering the workforce. 
This is leading to a de-skilling of the workforce and also a 
requirement for products and outputs to be simpler, despite the 
fact that technology is becoming more complex. As a result, our 
customers are having to refocus their available resource and 
concentrate on core activities and, consequently, they are more 
willing to outsource some of their activities to trusted partners.
In an attempt also to preserve financial capital, companies are less 
willing to dedicate capital expenditure to acquiring the instruments 
themselves. They are more interested in acquiring the knowledge, 
data and insight provided by the hardware rather than the product 
itself. Therefore, buying this as a service and funding it as an 
operating cost rather than on their balance sheet is more attractive.
It is this data that is increasingly being recognised as having value 
by our customers. The ability to measure and collect data is at the 
heart of any activity to monitor and improve industrial processes 
and productivity. This data is translated into a format that enables 
more effective decision-making and automation optimisation. 
There is an increasing reliance on software which can automate  
the customer's activities, such as replacing some of the physical 
testing that is undertaken, and this software capability is allowing 
more sophisticated analysis of the data being collected. This is 
transforming how customers think about their assets, their facilities 
and their operations. 
Alongside this, there has been huge growth in technology in  
terms of connectivity: availability and speed have risen and the  
cost has come down dramatically. This is having an impact on  
the industrial world, which opens up notable opportunities for the 
sensing, connectivity and software and service capability that our 
businesses have. 
We are looking to complement and supplement our instruments 
with software and services such as engineering software, test 
service capability, process analytics software and diagnostic services. 
We are positioning ourselves as a group to really benefit from these 
trends and believe this puts us in an advantageous position to 
deliver added value to our customers.
SOLUTIONS 
selling in action
Providing our customers with solutions which combine our traditional hardware products with software 
and/or services is becoming increasingly more important in our strategy. Our aim is to further enhance our 
customer engagement by focusing on certain vertical markets where we have deep knowledge and 
expertise and can bring insight into their activities as they look to improve productivity and enhance returns.

Strategic Report Data management 
solutions 
The effective use of modern data 
management systems is giving progressive 
tissue producers a competitive edge, 
bringing improved quality, higher 
productivity and lower raw material  
costs and wastage. 
A tissue paper producer in Spain, a 
customer for BTG’s Duroblade coating 
blades, is one of the first tissue mills in  
the world to be equipped with BTG’s new 
Yankee Performance Scorecard. This data 
aggregation and visualisation tool gives 
operators real-time decision making  
support to improve the performance  
and reliability of this critical part of the 
tissue machine. 
The system collects a discrete process  
data set and processes it according to 
calculations based on domain expertise  
and industry best practice to display 
graphical performance information which 
helps operators to make the correct  
process decisions. The customer is seeing 
benefits in terms of improved productivity 
and better quality. Savings on plant 
downtime and plant cost efficiency are 
already estimated at €95,000 per year. 
Contamination 
control solutions
In September, Particle Measuring Systems 
formed a strategic partnership with  
Novatek International to provide a fully 
integrated hardware and software solution 
for cleanroom monitoring in the life 
sciences industry.
Particle Measuring Systems’ Facility Pro 
environmental monitoring system operates 
by communicating with cleanroom sensors, 
including particle and microbial monitors, 
which are placed where product 
contamination can occur during the 
manufacturing process. The Novatek 
software adds the next step to this system, 
providing customers with the secure data 
management they need to demonstrate 
sterility assurance.
This integrated solution uses a risk-based 
environmental monitoring programme to 
help pharmaceutical manufacturers to 
visualise possible sources of contamination 
in their critical production processes and 
correct potential problems before they 
occur, thereby maintaining consistent 
product quality and meeting increasingly 
stringent regulatory requirements.
Transmission 
testing solutions
Volkswagen Group uses Brüel & Kjær’s 
Discom noise, vibration and harshness 
analysis software to test gears at the end  
of their production lines and also to test 
the completed transmissions. Its largest 
gear and transmission production facility  
at Kassel, Germany, produces around 
17,500 transmissions per day. 
Testing is primarily focused on identifying 
durability issues and ensuring customer 
acceptance for ride quality and comfort. 
Durability issues in gears can lead to a 
failure in an assembled transmission. The 
end-of-line transmission test simulates 
vehicle conditions so that any potential 
problems are identified early or even 
predicted and avoided entirely, minimising 
costs and improving quality. 
The Discom database and associated tools 
in the system help develop predictions on 
tool wear. The system uses a unique 
USB-based data acquisition front end, 
developed especially for Volkswagen,  
and a significant number of features  
which are now part of the standard  
Discom system originated from  
discussions with Volkswagen.
17 Spectris plc Adjusted operating margin is  
a measure of improving 
profitability in our business and  
is defined as adjusted operating 
profit as a percentage of  
reported sales. Adjusted 
operating profit excludes  
certain items.
Performance
Adjusted operating margin 
was 14.7%, representing  
a decrease of 0.2pp over  
the prior year, primarily  
reflecting the costs of the  
Project Uplift programme. 
Adjusted earnings per share 
(‘EPS’) is the ratio of adjusted 
earnings for the year to the 
weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding 
during the year, excluding  
certain items.
Performance
Adjusted EPS was 145.1p, a 14% 
increase year-on-year, reflecting  
a 12% increase in adjusted profit 
before tax, a lower effective tax 
rate and an increase in the 
weighted average number 
of shares.
Link to remuneration 
EPS performance is one of the 
criteria for the Performance Share 
Plan award. See page 76 for 
more information.
LFL sales growth is a measure  
of how our R&D and other 
investments help to grow  
our business organically,  
i.e. excluding the effects of  
currency translation and 
acquisitions or divestments. 
Performance
Sales were £1,525.6 million  
in 2017, a 6% increase on a  
LFL basis compared with 2016. 
LFL sales increased across all four 
segments and all key regions.
Focusing on
PROFITABLE GROWTH
We monitor progress against the delivery of our 
strategic goals using five financial and two  
non-financial key performance indicators (‘KPIs’). 
Each KPI measures certain elements of the strategy, 
as indicated by the relevant strategy icons  
(see page 8). An element of the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is linked to two KPIs: adjusted 
earnings per share growth and economic profit. 
Our strategy focuses on profitable growth that is sustainable over 
the medium to long term and therefore we consider how we have 
performed over a number of years, showing the KPIs for the last 
five years.
A number of the KPIs are adjusted operating metrics as we believe 
these are the primary indicator of the performance of the business 
as they exclude foreign exchange movements and the impact 
of acquisitions and disposals. See Note 2 to the Financial 
Statements, page 103, for a reconciliation between adjusted 
and reported items. 
Even in years where like-for-like sales growth has been low, the 
Group has maintained an operating margin in the mid-teens and 
delivered good cash conversion of operating profit. The Group has 
also generated significant economic profit throughout the period.

Financial measures
Key Performance Indicators
18 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report We focus on cash generation and 
use cash conversion as a KPI as 
we believe cash represents an 
effective measure of the quality 
of our earnings. Cash conversion 
is defined as adjusted operating 
cash flow as a percentage of 
adjusted operating profit. 
Performance
Cash conversion was 75%, a 
decrease of 38pp over the prior 
year. This was primarily due to 
the planned increase in capital 
expenditure following the first  
full year of the inclusion of the 
Millbrook business and higher 
working capital in line with the 
improved trading performance.
Economic profit is the annual 
result derived from deducting a 
capital charge (applied to average 
capital employed) from adjusted 
operating profit, aggregated over 
a three-year period.
Performance
Three-year aggregated economic 
profit was £163.2 million, 
representing an increase  
on the prior year. 
Link to remuneration 
Economic profit is one of the 
criteria for the Performance Share 
Plan award. See page 76 for 
more information. 
Energy efficiency makes a 
significant contribution to 
environmental sustainability  
and helps us to reduce our 
operating costs. 
Performance
Energy efficiency, measured in 
MWh per £m revenue, was 67.2 
in 2017. This represents an 
improvement of 2% compared 
with the prior year.
We are committed to ensuring 
the health, safety and well-being 
of our people and monitor how 
we are performing by measuring 
work-related accidents or ill 
health resulting in lost time in 
excess of one day (years prior to 
2017, three days).
Performance
There were 5.3 reportable 
accidents per 1,000 employees. 
This has increased year-on-year 
due to the Group now reporting 
all accidents resulting in one day 
or more absent from work rather 
than three days.

19 Spectris plc Operating Review 
Reported sales increased 11%, reflecting a 7% increase in LFL sales, 
a 0.2% contribution from acquisitions and a 4% positive impact 
from foreign currency exchange movements. Sales growth for the 
year was driven primarily by Asia, particularly in China, South Korea 
and India. In North America, LFL sales increased, with a notable 
swing from a first half decline to a very strong second half. On a LFL 
basis, before Project Uplift costs, adjusted operating profit increased 
12% and adjusted operating margins increased by 0.9pp, reflecting 
the higher LFL sales, slightly reduced gross margin from adverse 
product mix, and lower net overhead costs, with the rise in 
merger-related costs being partly mitigated by good cost control 
and the benefit of an insurance settlement. Reported operating 
profit increased 4% to £68.6 million.
Materials
ANALYSIS
Malvern Panalytical continued to bring the two teams together as  
a single operating company. The business has now been organised 
around key market sectors – Advanced Materials, Pharma and 
Food, Raw and Bulk Materials – with a focus on value-based selling 
by the newly cross-trained sales and marketing teams. Numerous 
opportunities to promote the Malvern product line to customers  
of the former PANalytical brand and vice versa have translated  
into incremental orders and revenue, with an increasing list of 
opportunities being actively pursued. For example, a global cement 
company which was an existing PANalytical customer bought a 
Malvern Mastersizer for the first time alongside a PANalytical  
XRD/XRF system. 
New products have been launched during the year; for example, 
the Epsilon 1 Meso, a version of the Epsilon 1 XRF spectrometer 
which combines hardware and software to enable small spot 
elemental analysis. In February, the MicroCal PEAQ-DSC differential 
scanning calorimeter was launched. This instrument is used to 
assess the developability and shelf-life of biological products and for 
comparing biopharmaceuticals and their biosimilar counterparts. 
This product is the only such DSC system with software compliance 
for the regulated environment, positioning Malvern Panalytical well 
with biopharmaceutical customers. Additionally, in this area, 
Malvern Panalytical is leading an industrial and academic 
consortium which was awarded an Innovate UK grant. This will 
fund a project seeking to address the specific analytical challenges 
associated with biopharmaceutical stability, in order to ensure the 
delivery of safe and cost-effective drugs in the future. Malvern 
Panalytical also announced a partnership with TetraScience to 
develop applications for smart laboratories, which will increase 
efficiency in the pharma industry, enabling researchers to better 
manage their equipment and make swift, data-driven decisions.
Sales to the pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals industries rose on  
a LFL basis with Asia seeing particularly strong growth, notably in 
China and Japan. As the middle class in this region expands, the 
number of people who are able to pay for healthcare increases  
and they are demanding better government provision. In China in 
particular, state funding on healthcare is increasing notably. North 
America saw an increase in LFL sales and Europe was up slightly 
year-on-year. At Particle Measuring Systems ('PMS'), there has been 
a continued drive to provide our high-level consulting services to 
existing hardware customers following the acquisition of CAS Clean 
Air Service AG in 2016. For example, an American pharmaceutical 
corporation, which already had our air particle sensors installed at 
their largest US site, requested consultancy support for particle and 
microbiological contamination in their filling lines, which then led to 
a request for further equipment at their site. Demand for these 
services is motivated by regulatory compliance, which is becoming 
more stringent. This means demand continues to be strong, 
particularly in the area of aseptic pharma. PMS is focused on 
providing complete sterility assurance solutions to the life sciences 
industry and the customer proposition was further enhanced by a 
global partnership with Novatek International, a leader in regulatory 
compliant data management software. This provides a fully 
integrated software and hardware solution for environmental 
monitoring in controlled manufacturing processes, helping  
companies ensure cleanliness in their manufacturing environment

20 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report The world’s population continues to grow,  
with the result that food production needs to 
increase to keep up with demand. In agriculture, 
as much as 60% of crop yields depends on the 
fertility of the soil. Obtaining fast, affordable  
and reliable access to information about soil 
fertility is therefore key to helping farmers 
increase their yields. 
Dutch company SoilCares provides the world’s farming 
community with data-based precision farming tools in  
order to increase crop yields. Based on an Epsilon 1 XRF 
spectrometer from Malvern Panalytical, SoilCares'  
subscription-based solution, called Lab-in-a-Box, enables 
individual farmers or farming organisations to have direct 
access to soil testing services on site, something which has 
previously only been possible in a laboratory. 
The Lab-in-a-Box measures soil parameters such as pH, 
nutrients and organic matter using SoilCares’ unique global soil 
database. In this way, Malvern Panalytical enables a complete 
soil fertility report to be delivered back to the farmer’s 
computer in less than two hours, together with customised 
recommendations for improving the soil. 
Malvern Panalytical and SoilCares are working together to 
develop the self-learning database in which the results are 
stored so that the system can provide increasing knowledge  
to farmers anywhere in the world.
whilst automatically collecting much of the information necessary 
for batch release and regulatory compliance. 
The metals, minerals and mining sector reversed its 2016 sales 
decline, with a strong performance in all major regions, particularly 
in the second half of the year. Minerals and mining saw a strong 
recovery, whilst LFL sales increased more modestly in the metals 
space, although in North America and Europe, LFL sales were down 
slightly. There is a cautiously improving investment climate, and as a 
result, increased market activity as well as demand from a focus on 
safety and productivity. 
Sales (LFL) to academic research were notably weak in 2017, 
although they improved in the second half after a slow start to the 
year. The decline was prevalent across all regions with only India 
and the UK seeing any growth, with the former recovering from a 
weak 2016 as funding levels improved. In the USA, there has been 
little change under the new administration, with 2017 spending at 
most agencies at 2016 levels, which has generally prevented them 
from starting major new programmes. Similarly, political uncertainty 
in parts of Europe has meant that expenditure has remained 
subdued or delayed, with LFL sales into Germany notably weak 
until the latter part of the year as funds were released late. In Asia, 
Japanese academic budgets have also been under pressure and 
although LFL sales were down in China for the year, the 
government’s new ‘Double First Class’ initiative to develop 
world-class universities is already impacting positively.
Sales (LFL) to the semiconductor, electronics and telecoms industry 
continued to grow strongly during 2017, particularly in Asia (China 
and South Korea, notably) and in North America. This has been 
driven by a significant increase in semiconductor capital spending  
as the demand for consumer electronics and IIoT applications rises. 
Our customers are also driven by yield enhancement, which can be 
improved by ensuring ultra-clean manufacturing environments and 
therefore the ability to measure ever smaller particles is a key 
demand driver for our products, alongside the need to meet 
regulatory requirements. PMS has had success with its 
market-leading products that measure 20 nanometre particles  
in ultra-pure water and ultra-pure chemicals.
Segment outlook 
We expect continued growth in R&D expenditure by pharma  
and biotechnology companies with increasing investment in 
biopharmaceuticals and innovative drugs in western markets.  
In Asian markets, we expect continued growth in the development 
of generics as incomes increase and demand for access to 
healthcare products rises. 
Within pharmaceuticals, we expect a continued increase in  
the regulatory scrutiny of manufacturing processes, driving  
demand for our material characterisation and cleanroom products 
as well as for related services, as customers seek complete solutions 
for regulatory compliance such as sterility assurance and good 
manufacturing practices.
We have seen an improving backdrop in the mining sector which 
has led to improved demand for equipment and services. However, 
the growth in capital investment budgets for larger-scale greenfield 
investments may be more modest.
We expect growth in the academic research market to be muted, 
although demand in China should be better as government 
initiatives to drive quality across their university system are  
boosting funding. 
Within the semiconductor and telecoms industry, we expect to  
see continued growth in semiconductor investment, driven by the 
growing demand for consumer electronics, IIoT applications and 
autonomous vehicles, albeit at more muted rates than in 2017.

MEASUREMENT
Reported sales increased 20%, including a 9% contribution  
from acquisitions, predominantly related to Millbrook, and a  
5% positive impact from foreign currency exchange movements. 
LFL sales increased by 6%. By region, North America, Europe and 
Asia delivered similar levels of LFL sales growth, with a decline in  
the Rest of the world. Adjusted operating profit before Project 
Uplift costs increased 8% on a LFL basis and LFL operating  
margins before Project Uplift costs increased by 0.4pp, primarily 
reflecting the higher sales volumes and gross margin improvement 
due to cost-of-sales efficiencies. Reported operating profit  
increased to £55.6 million from the £26.7 million recorded in  
2016 which included a non-cash impairment charge of  
£20.9 million relating to a write-down of goodwill and other 
intangibles associated with ESG.
In October, the acquisition of The Omnicon Group, Inc. (‘Omnicon’) 
was completed for a final consideration of £23.8 million. Omnicon 
provides a range of services to help its customers analyse and 
improve product reliability and safety. Key industries served include 
aerospace, automotive, transportation and defence and its services 
strongly complement the existing capability within the reliability and 
durability software and services portfolio in this segment, enabling 
us to offer a broader range of reliability-improvement solutions. 
Within the automotive sector, LFL sales grew strongly during the 
year with the UK, Germany, North America and China being the 
main contributors. In China, we benefited from strong growth in 
torque sales, driven by investment in electrical drivetrains. At 
Millbrook, we expanded our testing capacity and capability with the 
acquisition of a commercial vehicle test facility in Lancashire in the 
UK and, organically, through further capital investment in the UK 
and for additional indoor testing capacity in Finland. For example, 
we expanded our powertrain testing capabilities with the opening 
of a new engine test cell to test premium and performance engines, 
commissioned a state-of-the-art climatic emissions chassis 
dynamometer to help develop lower emission vehicles and 
completed the first phase of investment in battery test capabilities 
to support electric vehicle development. We are also supporting the 
development of autonomous vehicles and were selected by the UK 
government to develop an innovative controlled urban environment 
for connected and autonomous vehicle testing and have been 
working with several companies developing driverless cars.  
At Brüel & Kjær Sound & Vibration (‘BKSV’), our noise, vibration  
and harshness (‘NVH’) offering into the automotive space was  
enhanced by the release of the latest version of the Sonoscout,  
an ultra-portable, multi-channel NVH system used, for example,  
to record vehicle intake and exhaust noise levels for benchmarking 
competitor vehicles, and VSound, a vehicle sound-generating 
system that enables virtual NVH prototype evaluation in the context 
of a real vehicle, without the need for a PC in the vehicle.
In machine manufacturing, a significant portion of which  
represents sales into the automotive supply chain, LFL sales were 
flat year-on-year. LFL sales into the two key regions, Europe and 
Asia, rose but declined in North America. Germany saw modest 
growth with a continued increase in exports. China, in particular, 
saw strong growth in demand, driven by the economic backdrop  
as well as the general trend from volume to quality.
In the aerospace and defence sector, LFL sales reversed the decline 
seen in 2016, though this is typically a project business and sales 
can be lumpy. Overall, we have seen more aerospace opportunities, 
especially driven by stronger demand and funding of aircraft, 
helicopter and spacecraft makers in the USA and China, and we 
were able to maintain our leading position in structural testing, 
including a number of new customer wins. There was very strong 
growth in both Europe and North America, and although lower in 
Asia overall, China saw good growth. A reorganised sales team and 
key account programme has delivered new sales opportunities with 
a number of notable contracts signed. For example, an agreement 
was signed with BAE Systems to deliver a hull vibration monitoring 
system for the UK Royal Navy and contracts were signed with two 
major North American aerospace manufacturers.
Sales (LFL) to our consumer electronics and telecoms customers 
increased in 2017, primarily reflecting the launch of new products

22 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Millbrook is supporting the development  
of the vehicles of the future in the area of 
advanced driver-assistance systems and 
connected and autonomous vehicles.
One project, backed by the UK government, involves 
collaboration with the Atomic Energy Authority’s centre for 
Remote Applications for Challenging Environments to develop 
a unique, controlled test bed representative of an urban 
environment for the development of connected and 
autonomous vehicle (‘CAV’) technologies. Millbrook’s  
70 kilometres of test tracks offer a diverse topography to 
replicate the complexity of urban environments. The test bed 
will enable both automotive OEMs and developers of software, 
sensors, roadside units and cyber security systems to access a 
comprehensive suite of virtual and physical tools for test and 
validation. The aim is to speed up development of CAV 
technologies by bridging the gap between track testing and 
deployment on public roads, enabling advanced connectivity 
testing, while being safe and secure for all users.
Another initiative is the creation of a virtual model of 
Millbrook’s proving ground which will enable vehicle 
manufacturers to significantly improve the development of 
CAV systems using digital experiments which precisely mirror 
the real-world tests conducted on the physical site. Test drivers 
can interact with this virtual replica of Millbrook in full-scale 
driving simulators or at desktop workstations with steering and 
pedal controls. This allows drivers to test cars with autonomous 
systems or use the virtual world to either subjectively assess the 
behaviour of autonomous vehicles or to provoke emergency 
scenarios and evaluate the response.
by our customers. We again saw strong growth in China where  
we are working with a number of mobile phone manufacturers. 
During the year, a new high-frequency head and torso simulator 
was launched − a mannequin with built-in ear and mouth 
simulators that provide a realistic reproduction of the acoustic 
properties of an average adult human head and torso. It is designed 
for in-situ electro-acoustics tests on smartphones, headsets and 
microphones. We are working closely with Sony on headphone 
development using this product and have also secured orders with 
leading acoustics and social media companies.
Sales (LFL) of our environmental noise monitoring services increased 
during the year, particularly in Asia, where sales are approaching 
similar levels to Europe. Our strategy to widen our market reach  
for noise monitoring equipment and services has continued to  
see an increase of orders for urban monitoring. In December,  
an agreement was signed with Macquarie Capital to form a joint 
venture with our environmental monitoring business (now named 
EMS Brüel & Kjær). Macquarie Capital will acquire 50% of the 
business for a total cash consideration of AUD76.6 million.  
It is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject  
to regulatory approvals in China, the European Union and  
South Korea. Both parties are committed to an accelerated 
investment programme to help create additional solutions and 
services to enable asset owners to monitor and manage their 
resources more effectively. The venture will benefit from  
Macquarie Capital’s unrivalled expertise as a world-leading 
infrastructure adviser and investor. 
As with the Materials Analysis segment, LFL sales to academic 
research institutes declined, with weakness in demand seen in  
all regions. 
Improved conditions in the oil and gas and mining markets in  
2017 resulted in an increase in LFL sales in these end markets, 
particularly in North America. Demand for microseismic monitoring 
solutions increased markedly in North America and we saw a  
higher level of activity for our downhole hydraulic fracture mapping 
and monitoring activities as both the US rig count and production 
rose throughout the year. We continue to target opportunities in 
other markets and are making progress in this regard in Latin 
America and the Middle East. As markets recover, ESG is looking  
to work more closely with its customers for productivity-enhancing 
solutions − for example, it has developed a microseismic analysis 
approach that helps operators better diagnose and improve 
fracturing effectiveness.
Segment outlook
We expect the automotive and aerospace sectors to benefit from 
further growth in demand for engineering software applications. 
The growth in hybrid and electric vehicles is expected to drive 
demand for our market-leading torque and eDrive solutions and 
test services. We are also seeing growth in sound and vibration 
applications in automotive.
In aerospace, as well as improved reliability and availability of 
engines, driven by safety and maintenance cost requirements, 
quieter engines and airframes (exterior noise) are also an area  
of focus. However, overall demand will be driven by new 
development programmes.
The underlying trends in the consumer electronics market  
remain healthy in our view, with strong consumer demand for 
smartphones, audio quality and innovative features, particularly  
in China and India. 
The improving market conditions in the oil and gas industry are 
expected to create increased demand for our microseismic solutions 
with expectations for both production and capex in the industry to 
be higher in 2018. 
23 Spectris plc Operating Review continued
In-line
INSTRUMENTATION
Reported sales increased 13%, reflecting a LFL sales increase  
of 6%, a 5% positive impact from foreign currency exchange 
movements and a 2% contribution from acquisitions. On a regional 
basis, LFL sales were up in all regions, with a good performance  
in Europe and Asia, particularly in the first half of the year. This 
reflected good growth in industrial production and a recovery  
in capital expenditure across many process industries globally. 
Excluding Project Uplift costs, LFL adjusted operating profit  
declined 12% and LFL adjusted operating margins were 2.6pp 
lower year-on-year. This resulted from adverse mix and an increase 
in overheads driven by higher employee costs, plus costs of  
£4.3 million relating to restructuring and costs following the closure 
of a business centre in Europe. This also led to reported operating 
profit decreasing, from £37.6 million to £29.5 million. 
In the pulp and paper markets, LFL sales increased modestly 
compared with 2016, with growth in pulping and tissue offsetting 
the continued structural decline in the coating segment. We 
continue to diversify towards the tissue, pulp and packaging 
markets, including digital solutions to meet ‘mill-of-the-future’ 
needs. Solutions tailored to drive gains in business performance  
at our customer sites continue to be the theme of many of the 
projects that the pulp and paper industry is looking for, including  
a more widespread use of automation and real-time monitoring  
of site-wide operating conditions. To address this, we have formed 
a new Process Solutions business unit. For example, a global pulp 
and paper producer deployed BTG’s instruments and Capstone 
MACS process control software in combination to automate  
their bleaching unit operation. Several pulp and paper producers 
implemented BTG’s dataPARC decision support and analysis 
software in order to access and visualise real-time data from 
multiple sources, enabling them to have a more comprehensive  
and intuitive means of leveraging their operational data. The data 
analytics offering also continues to be deployed in several other 
industries, including power generation, chemical, wastewater  
and ethanol.
In the energy and utilities market, LFL sales rose, reflecting the 
improved global oil and gas markets. Both the industrial gases 
business and the hydrocarbon processing sector continue to recover 
globally and along with the strengthened sales and marketing 
organisation at Servomex, we have been able to capitalise on this. 
Growth was also helped by the launch of a number of new  
flagship products: for example, the Servopro MultiExact 4100,  
a high-performance multi-gas analyser offering up to four 
simultaneous digital gas stream measurements and configurable to 
a wide range of industrial applications. Gases measured include 
oxygen, nitrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, 
argon and helium, delivering a new level of performance that 
further optimises processes, improves product yields, ensures high 
product quality for our customers and helps meet regulatory and 
safety requirements. 
During the year, we acquired Setpoint, a leading provider of 
vibration and condition monitoring solutions to process industries.  
It has become an integrated product line of Brüel & Kjær Vibro, 
growing our presence in the condition monitoring market.  
Setpoint is primarily focused on the oil and gas and power 
generation sectors and its technology enables customers to  
improve machinery availability, productivity and reliability by 
delivering accurate condition information. In August, the first 
shipments of Setpoint systems from Brüel & Kjær Vibro were 
delivered for the thermal power generation market in the 
Philippines. Since acquisition, we have also delivered new orders  
to two major South American oil and gas companies and a  
US power generation company, amongst others, and in December, 
we received the largest-ever order for Setpoint systems for a large 
petrochemical complex being built in Russia.
In the wind energy sector, we are continuing to see growth 
and have further expanded the number of wind farm owners 
and operators to whom we provide turbine monitoring services. 
In total, we have now sold more than 18,000 systems into the 
wind power industry. Brüel & Kjær Vibro has supplied for the first 
time condition monitoring systems to a US utility company under  
a five-year ‘systems-as-a-service’ contract. Simultaneously,

24 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Drax Power is the UK’s largest power station  
and is Europe's biggest decarbonisation project. 
70% of its electricity is generated from 
sustainable biomass. Drax uses Servomex’s 
analysers to optimise boiler combustion 
efficiency control, resulting in direct fuel savings, 
reduced maintenance and a reduction in direct 
carbon monoxide emissions.
The Fluegas Exact 2700 analyser measures both oxygen  
and carbon monoxide and is therefore suitable for continuous 
flow monitoring of combustion processes. It is designed for 
high temperature processes up to 1,750°C, so is ideal for  
use in extreme heated environments such as hydrocarbon  
processing and power generation applications. Over the past 
nine years, Servomex has supplied 48 of these analysers to 
monitor the boilers.
Drax estimate that improved control of the combustion  
process has saved them millions of pounds over the years  
in both direct fuel savings and lower operational costs. 
Brüel & Kjær Vibro’s systems are now considered fleet-wide 
standard for wind turbines used by three utility companies: one 
each in Canada, the USA and Central America. 
In our other end markets, sales (LFL) to the cable and tube (‘C&T’) 
and food and bulk (‘F&B’) markets increased during 2017 with 
strong performances in North America, Europe and Japan. C&T 
sales were up strongly on improved sales coverage, particularly in 
Europe and China. F&B sales were up strongly as a result of 
targeting key growth markets in this segment, including savoury 
snacks. Film extrusion and converting sales were especially strong in 
North America. NDC Technologies (‘NDCT’) continues to develop its 
technology partnerships and products. It has worked closely with 
RAM GmbH, a web inspection business, since a business  
co-operation agreement was signed in March. Customers will 
benefit from simplified service support with one organisation 
handling both gauging and inspection. During the year, NDCT 
delivered several new products to the market, including the new 
BenchMike Pro offline diameter and ovality metrology instrument 
which offers the highest accuracy in the industry. The instrument 
also offers faster communications processing and easy integration 
into production networks to support customers’ IIoT programmes. 
Restructuring activities at NDCT continued during the year and 
transfer and consolidation of the manufacturing and administrative 
functions from California into the Ohio facility is on track for 
completion in 2018. The California facility has become the new film 
extrusion and converting solutions technical centre of excellence.
Segment outlook
The mix in our pulp and paper business is expected to continue  
to improve during 2018 with our new focus on complete solutions, 
including digital capabilities, aimed at the growing tissue, pulp and 
packaging markets. We also expect to continue to benefit from  
the combination of Capstone’s software tools with BTG’s 
instruments to capture new opportunities with the Process 
Solutions business unit. 
With an improved environment in global oil and gas markets  
and with a partial revival of activity in greenfield projects as well  
as brownfield expansions, we expect growth from the energy and 
utilities sector to continue into 2018. The addition of Setpoint offers 
the potential to further grow the machine protection/condition 
monitoring solution business in this segment. The wind energy 
sector remains healthy and offers the potential for additional 
capabilities beyond vibration to encompass other condition 
monitoring in order to provide more predictive analysis and  
offer a full-service wind farm optimisation programme. 
Opportunities in the film extrusion, web converting and food and 
bulk materials markets are expected to increase as customers 
develop new products which require advanced inline measurement 
solutions. Quality requirements, particularly in the food segment 
and food packaging, continue to be more stringent globally and 
therefore drive demand for inline solutions.

CONTROLS
Reported sales rose 6%. After adjusting for Microscan, LFL sales 
increased by 6% and there was a favourable impact of 6% from 
foreign currency exchange movements. With the segment’s high 
exposure to North America (c.70%), it was encouraging to see an 
increase in LFL sales in this region for the first time since 2014.  
Asia recorded strong growth in LFL sales, particularly at Omega.  
In Europe, overall segment sales were higher on a LFL basis, with 
growth in both our industrial networking business and in process 
measurement and control products. Reported operating profit 
increased to £28.7 million from the loss of £92.2 million recorded  
in 2016 which included a non-cash impairment charge of  
£94.4 million relating to a write-down of the balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangibles associated with Omega.
Segment performance
Adjusted operating profit (LFL) before Project Uplift costs  
increased by 96% and LFL operating margins before Project Uplift 
costs improved by 7.4pp, following the significant improvement  
in gross margin at Omega as well as the effects of operating 
leverage. This reflected improved product mix and pricing and 
lower overheads. There was a restructuring charge of £2.1 million 
as we continue to improve the performance of Omega. 
The operational improvements at Omega were reflected in a  
good sales performance and higher gross margins. Omega derives 
the majority of sales from the USA and the improving industrial 
environment saw an increase in demand for its products. The 
internationalisation programme continued to deliver good sales 
growth in all major markets outside the USA, with particular 
strength in Asia, notably in China. A focus on lean operations, 
tighter inventory management and the consolidation of distribution 
centres globally have all contributed to this performance. Other 
performance improvement initiatives have focused on marketing, 
including a shift from higher cost print marketing to precisely-
targeted digital marketing campaigns. These campaigns highlight 
new products and real-life use applications − for example, for the 
Omega Enterprise Gateway, a software tool in Omega’s portfolio 
designed to link sensor data and monitor a variety of products from 
a single platform. Rapid adoption resulted from the targeted digital 
marketing promotion and expansion of Omega’s easily configured 
pressure transducer product line in aerospace, military and 
transportation markets. Examples of these applications include 
temperature sensors for pre-flight applications and automated  
data collection systems for robust asset monitoring. 
The increasing trend towards IIoT, driven by the need for smarter, 
more interconnected operations, is benefiting our industrial 
automation and networking business as organisations seek 
easy-to-use solutions to connect and expand the capabilities  
of legacy equipment within existing facilities. To better service this 
need, Red Lion reorganised its sales teams to focus on opportunities 
in certain key vertical markets. For example, in Asia, a targeted 
focus in energy and water resulted in sales to a large wind turbine 
manufacturer and a number of water projects in China. In India, 
Red Lion won a project to enable Azure Power to efficiently analyse 
previously installed solar power systems for energy consumption. 
During the year, Red Lion launched a new generation of human 
machine interface products (‘HMIs’) which provide enhanced 
functionality for remote monitoring and control. These HMIs  
allow customers to interconnect devices from a variety of leading 
manufacturers more easily. New additions of Red Lion’s  
industrial Ethernet switches were also launched. The new models 
are designed for industrial, transportation and intelligent traffic 
applications requiring high reliability and the ability to function  
in extreme environmental conditions to help maximise network 
uptime and prevent lost production, downtime or a safety risk. 
In October, the Group completed the sale of the Microscan 
Systems, Inc. business (‘Microscan’) to Omron Corporation, 
resulting in post-tax cash proceeds of £91.9 million. Microscan  
is a global provider of world-class machine vision technology  
and solutions for critical identification, inspection and verification  
applications. However, in light of the Group’s more focused 
strategic direction, we believed that its next stage of development 
could be better fulfilled elsewhere.

Strategic Report Azure Power, a solar power generation company 
in India, use a weather station tool  
for their solar power sites to analyse energy 
consumption based on the ambient conditions. 
To do this, they need to accurately monitor and 
log weather data from a number of different 
remotely-located field devices and send all of  
the data to their head office.
The previous process involved two devices and a long run of 
cable from the field, which often required site visits to repair. 
Now, using Red Lion’s solution of a modular controller with 
built-in web server and Ethernet switch, combined with 
third-party sensors for the field devices, Azure Power can 
monitor data remotely and store it in the cloud. This remote 
monitoring and control eliminates the need for multiple devices 
and data cabling, reducing the number of site visits required 
and lowering operating costs. 
Temperatures in northern India’s solar panel fields can reach 
extreme highs, so the rugged, reliable design of Red Lion’s 
equipment, with an operating temperature range of 0° to 
50°C, means that service will continue even in the most 
extreme of environments.
Segment outlook
The performance of this segment will continue to depend on  
US industrial markets. The growth recorded in 2017 is expected  
to continue into 2018, although order visibility is very low.
At Omega, the restructuring activities, organisational changes  
and enhanced marketing approach are producing better results  
and we expect this improvement to continue in 2018.
In the medium term, the demand for industrial companies to drive 
productivity and operational efficiencies by enabling effortless and 
secure access to their manufacturing information is expected to 
increase. Industrial customers who are implementing cloud-based 
analytics applications will drive further demand for best-in-class 
networking and connectivity solutions for stranded assets and 
disparate plant systems. Spectris has focused efforts to be well 
positioned to take full advantage of these opportunities.

2.0
In 2017, reported operating profit increased from £38.3 million in 
2016 to £182.4 million, with operating profit in 2016 principally 
impacted by an impairment charge of £115.3 million related to 
goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles of which  
£94.4 million related to Omega and £20.9 million to ESG.  
Reported operating profit included a number of one-off costs and 
income during the year resulting in a net overheads year-on-year 
benefit of £3.5 million. Reported operating margins of 12.0%  
were 9.2pp higher than the prior year, mainly arising from the 
impairment charge of £115.3 million in 2016 which reduced the 
operating margin in 2016 by 8.6pp.
Adjusted operating profit increased by £22.7 million (+11.3%)  
to £223.5 million in 2017. After reducing the 2016 operating  
profit by £1.7 million to reflect the sale of Microscan, LFL  
adjusted operating profit before Project Uplift costs increased  
by £29.1 million (+14.4%). Acquisitions and foreign exchange 
contributed £2.0 million and £5.9 million, respectively, to the 
growth in adjusted operating profit, whilst the net increase in 
Project Uplift costs amounted to £12.6 million.
Adjusted operating margins declined by 0.2pp, whilst LFL operating 
margins increased by 1.1pp, with the difference being explained 
mainly by the year-on-year increase in Project Uplift costs and  
the dilutive effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange. The 
improvement in the LFL operating margin consists of a 0.8pp LFL 
gross margin increase to 57.3% in 2017 (2016: 56.5%) combined 
with a 0.3pp decrease in LFL overhead costs as a percentage of 
sales. The improvement in gross margin was substantially driven  
by Industrial Controls which benefited from a turnaround in 
performance from Omega and the non-recurrence of the  
£9 million inventory charge recorded in 2016, partly offset by  
a weaker gross margin in the In-line Instrumentation segment, 
reflecting adverse product mix. LFL overheads were up 5.2%, 
reflecting increased headcount and inflation combined with the 
costs of implementation of strategic initiatives.
Adjusted operating profit bridge
We continued to invest in our R&D programmes, with a reported 
R&D expense of £105.1 million or 6.9% of sales (2016:  
£98.6 million or 7.3% of sales). The R&D expense was in line  
with 2016 on a LFL basis. 
Net finance costs decreased by £1.9 million to £4.5 million  
(2016: £6.4 million), with adjusted net finance costs for the year 
slightly higher at £5.1 million (2016: £5.0 million). Reported profit 
before tax increased from £31.9 million in 2016 to £278.4 million  
in 2017. Reported profit before tax in 2016 was impacted by the  
£115.3 million impairment charge relating to goodwill and other 
acquisition-related intangibles, whilst 2017 benefited from the 
£100.5 million profit on disposal of Microscan. Adjusted profit 
before tax increased by 11.5% to £218.4 million.
29 Spectris plc Acquisitions
The Group completed four acquisitions during the year. The total 
cost of acquisitions was £34.6 million (2016: £174.2 million), 
including £0.8 million (2016: £6.9 million) for cash acquired and 
£1.4 million (2016: £7.6 million) attributable to the fair value of 
deferred and contingent consideration which is expected to be paid 
in future years. A net £4.1 million (2016: £1.2 million) was paid in 
respect of prior year acquisitions, making the net cash outflow in 
the year £36.5 million (2016: £160.9 million). Furthermore, an 
amount of £2.8 million (2016: £5.4 million) was spent on 
acquisition-related legal and professional fees, which makes the 
total acquisition-related cash outflow for the year £39.3 million 
(2016: £166.3 million). Acquisitions contributed £44.2 million of 
incremental sales and £2.0 million of incremental operating profit 
during the year. 
Disposals
In October 2017, the Group completed the disposal of Microscan 
for net cash proceeds of £110.9 million which, after paying  
cash taxes of £19.0 million, resulted in a net cash inflow of  
£91.9 million. The post-tax profit on disposal was £81.5 million. 
Sales of £32.9 million and operating profit of £4.5 million  
relating to Microscan were included in the reported and adjusted 
results for the nine-month period of ownership prior to its  
disposal on 2 October 2017.
Project Uplift
One-off costs incurred in 2017 of £15.8 million principally  
related to Phase 1 of the programme (which is focused on IT,  
procurement and footprint), resulting in cumulative costs to date  
of £19.0 million. Gross recurring savings of £2.8 million were 
realised during 2017. The net impact on operating profit relating to 
Project Uplift in 2017 amounted to £13.0 million which, although 
in line with expectations at a net level, was as a result of reductions 
in both expected benefits and costs. This was as a consequence of 
slowing down Phase 1 of the programme and putting Phase 2 on 
pause for approximately four months. Annualised recurring savings 
of £25 million and a total cost to achieve these of £35 million by  
the end of 2019 are now expected, with more coming from 
procurement activities and less from IT. This compares to previous 
expectations of £35 million of savings and £45 million of costs.
Taxation
The effective tax rate on adjusted profit before tax was 20.8% 
(2016: 22.4%), a decrease of 1.6pp primarily due to the favourable 
settlement of certain tax audits. On a statutory basis, the weighted 
average expected tax rate was 28.6% (2016: -13.8%), an increase 
of 42.4pp largely due to disposal gains arising in the USA (a higher 
tax jurisdiction) compared to a decrease in the USA in 2016 arising 
from the impairment of goodwill. In 2018, the Group expects a 
reduction in its effective tax rate of around 2pp as a result of US  
tax reform. 
This year, the Audit and Risk Committee approved the Group tax 
strategy for publication, which sets out the Group’s approach to  
tax matters. In compliance with the Finance Act 2016, this has  
been made available on our website, www.spectris.com/
sustainability/tax-strategy.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 13.8% from 127.5p to 
145.1p, reflecting the net impact of the 11.5% increase in adjusted 
profit before tax, the reduction in the effective tax rate and the 
increase in the weighted average number of shares from  
119.1 million in 2016 to 119.2 million in 2017.

1. Adjusted depreciation and software amortisation represents depreciation

depreciation of acquisition-related fair value adjustments to property, plant  
and equipment.
Adjusted operating cash flow generation of £167.8 million during 
the year was in line with expectations and impacted by increased 
capital expenditure following the first full year of the inclusion  
of the Millbrook business. The adjusted operating cash flow 
conversion rate was 75% compared with 113% in 2016, 
primarily due to the increased capital expenditure and higher 
working capital. 
Average trade working capital (the monthly average of the sum of 
inventory, trade receivables, trade payables and other current 
trading net assets), expressed as a percentage of sales, decreased 
by 2.3pp to 11.9% (2016: 14.2%). Excluding acquisitions, disposals 
and foreign exchange, the LFL reduction in average trade working 
capital was 2.1pp, with improvements across all segments. Most 
notably in the Industrial Controls segment, Omega showed strong 
progress in inventory management and supplier payments 
following operational issues in 2016; in the Materials Analysis 
segment there was improved inventory management; and in In-line 
Instrumentation, Servomex improved both inventory levels and cash 
collections for receivables during the year. The year-end trade 
working capital to sales ratio decreased from 15.9% in 2016 to 
14.0% in 2017, a 1.9pp decrease.
Capital expenditure (net of grants) on property, plant and 
equipment during the year of £73.1 million (2016: £28.7 million) 
equated to 4.8% of sales (2016: 2.1%) and was 240% of adjusted 
depreciation and software amortisation (2016: 101%), partly due 
to the inclusion of the first full year of the recently-acquired 
Millbrook business with an incremental spend of £21.2 million as 
well as continued investments in property and infrastructure at 
Malvern Panalytical, HBM and Omega. Planned capital expenditure 
on a cash basis in 2018 is anticipated to be at around £80 million, 
primarily related to expansion opportunities at Millbrook, as well 
as a continuation of a number of projects at Malvern Panalytical 
and Omega.

Financing and treasury 
The Group finances its operations from both retained earnings and 
third-party borrowings, with the majority of the year-end gross debt 
balance being at fixed rates of interest. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had £593.7 million of 
committed facilities denominated in different currencies,  
consisting of a five-year $550 million (£406.5 million) revolving 
credit facility maturing in October 2019, a seven-year €94.8 million  
(£84.1 million) term loan maturing in October 2020, and a  
seven-year €116.2 million (£103.1 million) term loan maturing  
in September 2022. The revolving credit facility was undrawn at  
the year end. In addition, the Group had a year-end cash balance  
of £138.0 million, bank overdrafts of £1.3 million and various 
uncommitted facilities available. 
At the year end, the Group’s borrowings amounted to  
£188.5 million, 99% of which was at fixed interest rates  
(2016: 77%). The ageing profile at the year end showed that  
1% (2016: 5%) of year-end borrowings is due to mature within 
one year, 99% between two and five years (2016: 52%) and nil  
in more than five years (2016: 43%). 
Overall, net debt decreased by £100.4 million (2016: increase  
of £52.3 million) from £150.9 million to £50.5 million. Net bank 
interest costs were covered by adjusted operating profit  
52.0 times (2016: 43.7 times).
31 Spectris plc Currency
The Group has both translational and transactional currency 
exposures. Translational exposures arise on the consolidation of 
overseas company results into Sterling. Transactional exposures 
arise where the currency of sale or purchase invoices differs from 
the functional currency in which each company prepares its local 
accounts. The transactional exposures include situations where 
foreign currency denominated trade receivables, trade payables  
and cash balances are held.
After matching the currency of revenue with the currency of costs 
wherever practical, forward exchange contracts are used to hedge  
Financial Review continued
a proportion of the remaining forecast net transaction flows where 
there is reasonable certainty of an exposure. At 31 December 2017, 
approximately 61% of the estimated net Euro, US Dollar and 
Japanese Yen exposures for 2018 were hedged using forward 
exchange contracts, mainly against the Swiss Franc, Sterling,  
the Euro and the Danish Krone.
The largest translational exposures are to the US Dollar, Euro, 
Danish Krone, Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc. Translational 
exposures are not hedged. The table below shows the average  
and closing key exchange rates compared to Sterling. 
 
2017 
(average)
2016 
(average) Change

Japanese Yen (JPY) 145 147 (1%) 152 144 6%
Swiss Franc (CHF) 1.27 1.33 (5%) 1.32 1.25 6%
During the year, the translational foreign exchange gain on 
operating profit of £5.9 million (2016: £22.6 million gain), arising 
from the weakness of Sterling, was partly offset by a transactional 
foreign exchange loss of £1.1 million (2016: £7.8 million loss).
Dividends
The Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 37.5 pence per 
share which, combined with the interim dividend of 19.0 pence per  
share, gives a total dividend of 56.5 pence per share for the year,  
an increase of 9%. The dividend is covered 2.6 times by adjusted 
earnings and is consistent with our policy of making progressive 
dividend payments, based upon affordability and sustainability. 
In determining the level of dividend in any year, the Board considers 
a number of factors that influence the proposed dividend, including  
the level of distributable reserves in the Parent Company, future 
cash commitments and investment needs to sustain the long-term  
growth prospects of the Group and the level of dividend cover.
Events after the balance sheet date
On 26 January 2018, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital 
of Concept Life Sciences (Holdings) Limited, for a consideration  
of £163 million, on a debt and cash-free basis. This acquisition  
adds to the Group's capabilities in test services in the Materials  
Analysis segment.
 
32 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report Risk
MANAGEMENT
We recognise that effective management of risk is essential for 
delivering our strategic objectives. As such, risk management is  
built into our day-to-day activities and forms an integral part of  
how we operate.
Committed to managing risk effectively
The Group has a well-established process which delivers visibility 
and accountability for risk management across our businesses.  
This process forms part of the Group’s overall internal control 
framework, as described on page 61.
Risk management process
Our approach to risk management incorporates both bottom-up 
and top-down elements to the identification, evaluation and 
management of risks and all risks are evaluated with reference  
to the Group’s achievement of its strategic objectives, as outlined 
on pages 8 and 9.
Our business units are required to undertake formal risk 
management reviews at least twice a year. This involves the use  
of a consistent framework for the assessment of significant risks 
with respect to impact, likelihood and the time frame in which  
the risk could materialise. Risks are assessed both before and  
after the effect of controls and mitigating actions have been  
taken into account.
Overall ownership for each risk, together with responsibility for 
mitigating actions, is clearly assigned and communicated. The 
resulting risk registers are then subject to review on an ongoing 
basis as part of regular operational reviews. This ensures that  
risk management is embedded in day-to-day management 
processes and decision-making as well as in the annual  
strategic planning cycle.
Oversight
In addition, the Executive Committee and key functional personnel 
in the Group consider those risks to the Group’s strategic objectives 
which are not addressed within the business units and develop 
appropriate approaches to managing and mitigating these. These 
key Group risks are analysed against a ‘lines of defence’ framework 
which involves mapping the principal Group risks to: 
 › a first line of defence comprising the key controls and sources of 
risk mitigation implemented by our business units; 
 › a second line of defence consisting of various Group functions 
which, together with the Executive Directors, shapes the policy 
framework within which the first line of defence operates and 
provides oversight and monitoring of the same; and
 › a third line of defence identifying sources of assurance over the 
effectiveness of risk management activity.
The overall effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
mitigation processes is reviewed regularly by the Executive Directors 
and twice yearly by the Audit and Risk Committee. A formal 
evaluation of the Group’s risk appetite has also been completed in 
respect of each of the Group’s principal risks. 
During the year, people-related risk was identified as an additional 
Group-level risk. This concerns risk relating to the Group’s ability to 
recruit, develop and retain the talent required to deliver upon our 
strategy as the Group implements changes to the operating model 
and seeks to deliver an increasing proportion of revenues from 
solutions and services.
The key potential risks and uncertainties facing the Group’s ability 
to deliver its strategy, together with mitigating actions, are 
described on the following pages.

33 Spectris plc We have operations which sell and purchase goods in foreign 
currencies and whose results we record in a variety of different 
currencies. We are therefore exposed to any significant changes in 
exchange rates.
Impact
 › Unexpected variations in the Company’s results.
 › Reduced profitability and cash flow.
Mitigation
 › Forward foreign exchange contracts cover up to 75% of 
forecast transactional exposures up to 18 months ahead.
 › Natural hedging strategy, matching invoicing and purchasing 
currencies where practical.
 › Foreign currency investments hedged with borrowings in the 
same currency wherever possible.
 › Regular monitoring, including sensitivity analyses to 
understand the impact of exchange rate movements on the 
Group’s reporting.
2017 update
 › On average, Sterling weakened relative to most other 
currencies over the year, which had a positive impact on our 
reported results from a translational perspective, albeit to a 
lesser extent than in 2016. 
 › Our hedging policy continued to provide certainty and reduce 
volatility to the Group‘s cash flows.
We operate in a large number of jurisdictions and, consequently, 
are subject to wide-ranging laws and regulations.
Any failure by the Group or its representatives to comply  
with relevant laws and regulations could result in civil or  
criminal liabilities, leading to significant fines and penalties  
or the disqualification of the Group from participation in 
government-related contracts for a period of time. In the  
event of a failure to comply with export control regulations,  
the Group could also be exposed to restrictions being placed 
upon its ability to trade.
Impact
 › Reduced sales, profitability and cash flow.
 › Reputational damage.
 › Diversion of management resources resulting in lost 
opportunities.
 › Penalties arising from breach of laws and regulations.
 › Inability to attract and retain talent.
Mitigation
 › Strong culture, internal control framework and policies.
 › Ethics training provided to all employees.
 › Formal export controls compliance procedures in place, 
including strict product classification and transaction 
screening protocols.
 › Comprehensive insurance covers all standard categories of 
insurable risk. Contract review and approval processes mitigate 
exposure to contractual liability. 
2017 update
The Group continued to take a number of actions aimed at 
further mitigating this risk. These included formalisation and 
enhancement of the sales control framework in China, roll-out of 
conflicts of interest training and voluntary disclosure programme 
in China, Taiwan and South Korea, repeat anti-bribery and 
corruption reviews, deployment of anti-bribery and corruption as 
well as fair competition face-to-face workshops and introduction 
of alignment of values and incentives.
We continue to ensure that we are responsive to issues raised 
through the Group’s ethics hotline. For more details of our ethics 
programme see pages 46 to 47.

PRINCIPAL RISKS
The effective management of risk is essential for delivering our strategic 
objectives. As such, risk management is built into our day-to-day 
activities and forms an integral part of how we operate.

34 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report As with most organisations of a similar size and complexity, our 
businesses face both internal and external information security 
risks, the nature and complexity of which are constantly changing, 
becoming more sophisticated and unpredictable. In addition, 
regulatory responsibilities in relation to data protection are 
becoming increasingly stringent, including the implementation of 
the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') from May 2018.
Impact
 › Delay or impact on decision making through lack of available 
reliable data or disruption of service. 
 › Loss of commercially sensitive or personal information.
 › Reduced service to customers due to poor information handling 
or interruption of business.
Mitigation
 › Our businesses employ a number of physical and logical control 
measures designed to reduce the risk of a breach in information 
security arising. 
 › Our systems are monitored against unauthorised access.
 › A programme of continuous improvement focusing 
on information security risks evaluates whether the 
Group’s existing controls in this area would benefit from 
additional strengthening.
 › Employees receive online and face-to-face awareness training 
of information security risks and controls.
 › Cyber risk and security is reviewed regularly by the Board to 
address the evolving landscape.
2017 update
The Group has appointed a Group Head of Information Risk 
Governance and a GDPR training programme is being rolled out 
to employees throughout the organisation.
Integration of the operations and personnel of acquired 
businesses can be a complex process. Potential risks therefore exist 
that the planned benefits from the acquisition may not be 
achieved as a result of problems encountered during integration 
of the acquired business, incorrect assumptions made in the 
business case, changing market conditions, or issues which were 
not identified during the due diligence process. Further, the 
Company could be exposed to past acts or omissions of the 
acquired business.
Impact
 › Failure to attract sufficient numbers of high quality businesses 
to meet our growth targets.
 › Failure to achieve the benefits outlined in the business case.
 › Failure to identify new markets.
 › Reduced profitability and cash flow.
 › Unforeseen liabilities.
Mitigation
 › Rigorous financial, commercial and legal assessment of target 
businesses involving external consultants as appropriate.
 › Strict authority levels which, subject to size, involve review  
by the Board for such transactions.
 › Comprehensive representations and warranties in  
purchase agreements.
 › Integration planning.
 › Regular review of the acquired businesses against the  
business case.
 › Post-acquisition control reviews.
2017 update
There continued to be a healthy level of acquisition activity in our 
marketplaces. We participated in this activity, making four bolt-on 
acquisitions, and we continue to look for additional opportunities. 
We have been careful to maintain our rigorous financial, 
commercial and legal due diligence and disciplines, which has 
meant that we have also excluded ourselves from a number of 
potential deals.

35 Spectris plc Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued
The Group’s strategic priorities are set out on pages 8 and 9.
The Group considers that, as with any undertaking of this kind, 
there is necessarily inherent risk associated with the successful 
execution and delivery of the Group’s strategic priorities.
The risks associated with some of the Group’s strategic priorities 
are addressed in their own right – for example, how we develop 
new products and how we acquire other businesses.
Other relevant components of the Group’s strategy concern:
 › the Group’s desire to transition the business to achieving a 
larger proportion of sales through the provision of services, 
software and solutions to customers, rather than products 
alone; and
 › during the year, the Group launched a comprehensive 
Group-wide productivity improvement programme, Project 
Uplift. Over the medium term, this programme will deliver 
improvements in productivity, both within and across our 
operating companies, reducing complexity where appropriate 
whilst preserving the entrepreneurial culture of our businesses. 
We will also evaluate potential structural improvements 
that can leverage Spectris’ scale and optimise both efficiency 
and effectiveness.
Impact
 › Failure to realise the Group’s plans for enhanced efficiency  
and profitability.
 › Failure to realise the Group’s growth plans.
 › Reduced profitability and cash flow.
Mitigation
 › Programme management disciplines, including a dedicated 
programme management office.
 › Independent assurance.
 › Talent management programme.
 › Dashboard reporting against key growth initiatives.
 › A measured approach over time is being targeted, rather than  
a radical change.
 › Enhanced risk management and reporting.
2017 update
During 2017, we continued to make good strategic progress in 
transitioning our customer offering towards the provision of 
solutions encompassing hardware, software and services. Four 
small acquisitions were completed, adding further software, 
service and testing capability. The acquisition of Omnicon provides 
complementary software and service capability to our existing 
software business within HBM, and we were pleased to complete 
the first bolt-on for Millbrook. During the year, we completed the 
sale of Microscan to Omron, recognising that this business is not 
consistent with the Group strategy. In terms of the development 
of the data analytics strategy, we have entered into an agreement 
to put EMS into a joint venture with Macquarie Capital which will 
give this business access to the Macquarie Capital network with 
its market-leading environmental monitoring market offering. 
Similarly, progress has been made in respect of Project Uplift 
where a dedicated programme management office has been 
established, a detailed diagnostic and planning phase completed 
and a series of actionable plans created, with implementation of 
these beginning in 2017.
The nature of the markets in which we operate means that all of 
our businesses are exposed to risk from competitor activity.
Impact
 › Loss of market share.
 › Reduced financial performance arising from competitive  
threats both from third parties and customers bringing 
production in-house.
Mitigation
 › Ongoing monitoring of competitor activity and trends in  
the markets in which we compete.
 › Maintain market-leading positions through strong customer 
relationships and significant investment in R&D.
 › Diversified portfolio of products and markets limits the overall 
risk from any single competitor.
 › Develop operational excellence initiatives that enable our 
businesses to react quickly to changes in customer and  
market demand.
2017 update
We maintained high levels of investment in R&D, investing  
£105 million (6.9% of sales), with our operating businesses 
bringing new products and solutions to market during the year  
to sustain and strengthen our strong customer relationships and 
competitive advantages.
Strategy execution Competitive activity
Very low 3 4
Low
The Group needs to attract, develop, motivate and retain the right 
people to achieve our operational and strategic targets. Effective 
talent management is essential to deliver our current and future 
business requirements. Therefore, the Board has agreed to 
introduce people as a new principal risk. This is not reflective of 
deterioration in this risk but in recognition of the ongoing change 
programmes underway within the Group.
Impact
 › Failure to recruit and retain key staff leading to reduced 
innovation and progress against the Group’s strategic aims.
Mitigation
 › During the first half of 2017, the Group appointed a Director  
of Human Resources and a number of initiatives designed to 
mitigate this risk have now taken place or are under 
development, including:
 › developing a cohesive recruitment brand centred around the 
use of LinkedIn; and
 › a detailed review of Board and Executive succession plans  
was undertaken by the Nomination Committee in  
December 2017.
2017 update
During 2017, we began a number of initiatives to mitigate this 
risk. These initiatives will be built on during 2018.

36 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report We are exposed to the risk that some of the components we 
source, particularly for custom-built items or ageing products, are 
provided by a single supplier and are therefore vulnerable to 
interruption of supply.
Our businesses also manufacture components using proprietary 
technologies at a number of locations.
Our ability to supply products to customers could be adversely 
impacted by a disaster or other disruptive event at any of  
these sites.
Impact
 › Inability to fulfil customer orders, resulting in lost sales and 
reputational damage.
 › Increased costs reduce profitability.
 › Loss of market share.
Mitigation
 › Strategic sourcing teams source cost-effective suppliers across a 
range of markets whilst validating suppliers’ business processes, 
quality and standards.
 › Alternative sources of supply actively sought to reduce 
dependency upon single-source suppliers.
 › Safety stock levels established for critical components.
 › Business continuity plans and disaster prevention measures in 
place for all material manufacturing locations.
 › Business interruption insurance.
 › Strong contract review process.
2017 update
We continued to identify and qualify secondary sources of supply 
where key dependencies have been identified. During the year, a 
Group Vice President Supply Chain was appointed to support and 
drive the following:
 › Continued focus on the Group's critical suppliers based on 
specialist independent spend analysis.
 › Underpinning of indirect spend that has been afforded by 
Project Uplift.
 › Ongoing identification and delivery of cross-operating company 
savings potential.
We operate in a range of end-user markets around the world  
and may be affected by political, economic or regulatory 
developments in any of these countries. Material adverse changes 
in the political and economic environments in the countries in 
which we operate have the potential to put at risk our ability to 
execute our strategy.
Impact
 › Reduced profitability and cash flow.
Mitigation
 › Maintain a broad spread of markets, products and customers  
to limit risks associated with any given territory.
 › Monitor market intelligence so that we can respond quickly  
to changing trading conditions.
 › Ensure we remain structured in a way that enables us to 
take prompt action in the event of a material change in the 
trading environment.
 › Ensure we maintain a strong balance sheet and 
financial position. 
2017 update
The Group’s balanced geographical mix, with similar exposure to 
North America, Europe and Asia/Rest of the world, enabled it to 
benefit from an improvement in trading conditions in each region.
 › The Group continues to monitor and control its exposure to 
those countries where continuing economic uncertainties exist 
and, in particular, we are evaluating carefully the implications 
for the Group arising from the result of the UK’s decision to 
leave the European Union (‘Brexit’).
 › As far as potential trading exposures are concerned, exports 
from the UK into the European Union represent less than 3% 
of Group sales, whilst imports into the UK from the European 
Union represent less than 1% of Group sales. The acquisition of 
Concept Life Sciences in January 2018 will not materially impact 
trading flows to and from the UK. Our cost base in the UK is 
largely Sterling denominated.
 › As a consequence, we believe that Brexit presents only limited 
short-term direct impact for the Group. The main near-term risk 
for the Group arising from Brexit stems from broader 
uncertainty which could inhibit investment and increase market 
volatility, ultimately hindering growth in the UK and beyond. A 
Brexit Risk Committee has been established and an evaluation 
of the potential costs of moving to World Trade Organisation 
rules has been performed. The impact on the Group is not 
expected to be significant and there are a number of mitigating 
actions which can be undertaken. The Group will continue to 
monitor carefully any additional exposure arising as the full 
implications of Brexit become clearer.

37 Spectris plc The development of new technologies and products necessarily 
involves risk, including:
 › the product being more expensive or taking longer to develop 
than originally planned;
 › the product failing to reach the commercialisation phase; and
 › the market for the product being smaller than  
originally envisaged.
Impact
 › Reduced profitability and cash flow.
 › Loss of market share.
 › Failure to recoup investment in innovation.
Mitigation
 › Regular strategic evaluations of product portfolios and  
the markets in which we compete, ensuring that our  
investment in new products is targeted so as to maximise  
the opportunity of success.
 › Project management disciplines are in place across our product 
development programmes and audits provide assurance that 
these disciplines are applied consistently.
 › Work closely with customers to ensure that we develop 
solutions tailored to their specific needs.
 › Maintain customer involvement throughout the life-cycle of 
product development to product launch through, for example, 
beta evaluations. 
 › New product developments are based on standard platforms, 
customised through high added-value applications engineering.
2017 update
 › Formal strategy reviews are conducted annually and  
are supplemented with regular updates with each  
operating company.
 › These reviews often result in targeted investment in new 
product platforms, upgrades to existing products and services 
and bolt-on acquisitions. 
 › In 2017, several important new products were launched and 
further software, service and testing capability was added 
through our acquisition programme.
In support of the Group’s business model to provide 
technologically-advanced solutions to its customers, the Group 
has continued to take a holistic approach towards intellectual 
property protection and management. The Group owns and 
registers patents and trademarks and maintains trade secrets, 
confidential information and copyright as well as exploiting 
intellectual property through licensing.
The key risks are that the Group may inadvertently infringe 
third-party rights and that the Group may not hold sufficient 
rights to prevent competitors independently developing similar 
products. There are also risks that intellectual property may  
be lost through failure to implement controls to safeguard 
confidential information or actively manage registered  
intellectual property rights.
Impact
 › Reduced profitability and cash flow.
 › Loss of market share.
 › Failure to recoup investment in innovation.
Mitigation
 › Policies and procedures in place requiring all of our 
businesses to:
 › maintain a watching brief on new third-party patent 
applications and competitor activity;
 › ensure adequate protection for key intellectual property, 
including registration where appropriate;
 › undertake specific freedom-to-operate technical reviews prior 
to commencing new product development, acquisitions or 
licences; and
 › register intellectual property where appropriate.
 › Maintain a portfolio of intellectual property assets such that  
no single patent, trade secret or trademark is sufficiently 
important to present a material risk to the ongoing success  
of the Company.
2017 update
During the year, we continued a programme of intellectual 
property audits and also reviewed the management and 
safeguarding of confidential information. A programme of 
guidance and training in good information protection processes 
was implemented with an initial focus on higher risk jurisdictions.

38 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of the 
Company over a three-year period, taking into account the Group’s 
current position and the assessment of the principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out on pages 34 to 38. 
The Directors have determined that a three-year period to  
31 December 2020 constitutes an appropriate period over which to 
provide its Viability Statement. The selection of this period for the 
assessment is supported by the Group’s strategic planning cycle 
together with other relevant considerations such as the maturity of 
the Group’s credit facilities. In addition, the Group is exposed to a 
number of different industry cycles of varying and ill-defined length 
and duration which may or may not overlap, and this has also been 
taken into account in considering the relevant period. The Group 
operates a detailed financial forecasting process over a rolling 
18-month period, supplemented by monthly analysis of risks and 
opportunities against the forecast presented. Each of the Group’s 
businesses has established growth targets through to 2020. The 
Directors believe that this supports the selection of a three-year 
period over which the Viability Statement is made.
Whilst the Directors have no reason to believe that the Group will 
not be viable over a longer period, it is recognised that such future 
assessments carry a level of inherent uncertainty which increases 
with the length of the period. As such, we believe a three-year 
period presents users of the Annual Report with a reasonable 
degree of confidence while still providing a longer-term perspective. 
The Directors carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that could threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. This assessment 
was made with reference to the Group’s current position and 
prospects, the Group’s strategy and the Group’s principal  
risks, including how these are managed, as detailed on  
pages 33 to 38.
In considering the Group’s prospects, the Directors also noted the 
broad spread of markets, products and customers maintained by 
the Group. This natural diversification provides mitigation against 
the risk of a serious economic downturn in a particular market or 
the risks associated with dependence on a specific sector or 
customer. Our largest customer constitutes less than 2% of Group 
sales. At the same time, the Directors noted the Group’s strong 
financial position coupled with its ability to react promptly in 
adjusting our cost base in the event of a material change in the 
trading environment.
Similarly, in making the assessment, the Directors also considered 
the ability of the Group to raise finance and deploy capital in the 
context of the principal sources of facility for credit, the maturity  
of those facilities, the Group’s ability to re-finance debt as it falls 
due and the overall level of headroom available.
While the review encompassed all of the principal risks identified by 
the Group, the following were focused on for enhanced analysis 
including stress testing: political and economic; laws and 
regulations; and fluctuations in exchange rates. The following  
severe but plausible potential scenarios were analysed:
 › The translational foreign exchange impact of major  
movements and volatility in key Group currencies  
(Sterling vs the Euro and the Dollar).
 › A significant downturn in the trading environment faced by the 
Group triggered by each of the following:
 › Brexit;
 › a marked economic slowdown or downturn in the Chinese 
economy; and
 › a general increase in trade barriers between Europe and  
the USA.
 › Legal/regulatory breaches – modelling a fall in sales volumes 
arising from a theoretical debarment from operating in certain 
key markets.
Mitigations considered as part of the stress testing included cost 
reduction, a reduction in the Group’s dividend, a reduction in 
capital expenditure and re-financing of the Group’s credit facilities.
The results of the above stress testing demonstrated that the Group 
would be able to withstand the impact of each of these scenarios 
materialising over the course of the assessment period. This is in 
part due to the Group’s operating model and organisation structure 
which gives it the ability to respond rapidly in the event of 
heightened risk in the external environment, and also partly due to 
the Group’s financial position and access to additional funds.
Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have  
a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in  
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period  
to December 2020.

Committed to
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
Our approach
Our strategic objective is to deliver sustainable profitable  
growth for our shareholders by enhancing the productivity  
of our customers. Our products are designed to help our customers 
to reduce waste and save time, money and resources, contributing 
to a lower carbon world, and driving our own economic success 
and future growth.
Sustainable growth means building a well-governed and profitable 
business which delivers shareholder value and provides customers 
with the products and services they need. To achieve this, we need 
to understand our impact on the environment, our people, 
customers and suppliers, and the communities in which we work, 
embedding sustainability in our strategy, management systems and 
day-to-day activities. We focus on the issues most important to our 
stakeholders and our business and this report outlines how our 
relationships and interactions support our sustainability objectives.
We are committed to managing our business according to the 
highest ethical standards. Our core values support this by guiding 
our decision-making and shaping our culture. Further information 
can be found in the Ethics Report on pages 46 to 47.
Accountability
Eoghan O’Lionaird, Business Group Director for Materials Analysis 
and Test and Measurement, has overall executive responsibility for 
sustainability matters. 
The operating company Presidents are responsible for taking 
actions within their operations in support of the Company’s 
sustainability aims. Developments, including risks and opportunities, 
are reviewed annually by the Board within the context of the overall 
Group strategy. 
Management systems and certification
Our global policies are applicable across all our sites and  
are supplemented by local policies to reflect different legal 
frameworks and requirements. We encourage our businesses  
to gain certification to international standards and these are 
explained below. Certification involves independent processes  
to verify data to demonstrate conformance and that a  
company is fulfilling policy commitments and making  
continual improvement.
Certification standards
ISO 14001
This international standard (‘ISO‘) sets out criteria for the 
formulation and maintenance of an environmental management 
system. Certification to ISO 14001 requires an organisation to 
effectively manage its environmental impacts through 
commitments to pollution prevention, legal compliance and 
continual improvement. Approximately 60% of Spectris’ key 
manufacturing operations by turnover are certified to ISO 14001.
OHSAS 18001
This standard is intended to help an organisation control 
occupational health and safety risks. It is currently UK-specific but 
will shortly become an ISO. Several Spectris offices have obtained 
certification to OHSAS 18001.
SA 8000
SA 8000 Social Accountability is the most widely-recognised 
global standard for managing human rights in the workplace. It 
encourages an organisation to achieve best practice in ethical 
employment, trading and operations and includes much of the 
anti-slavery legislation recently introduced. At Spectris, we use 
this standard to assess leading suppliers in high-risk areas against 
criteria such as workers’ rights, workplace conditions (including 
child labour, forced labour, working hours, freedom of 
association, compensation and discrimination) and health,  
safety and the environment.
ISO 9001
This standard addresses various aspects of quality management 
and provides guidance and tools for companies to ensure that 
their products and services consistently meet customer 
requirements, and that quality is consistently improved.  
Recently updated, the new version of the standard requires  
that key quality management principles are embedded in the 
organisation. All key Spectris global manufacturing operations 
are certified to ISO 9001, with all key manufacturing operations 
certified to the new standard, or working towards certification  
by October 2018.
FTSE4Good
We have been a constituent of the FTSE4Good Index Series  
since it was founded in 2001. FTSE4Good is an equity index 
series designed to measure the performance of companies 
demonstrating strong environmental, social and governance 
practices and facilitates investment in companies that meet 
globally recognised corporate responsibility standards.

Strategic Report Environmental impact
We have world-leading expertise in providing solutions for 
customers involved in renewable energy generation. For example, 
wind turbines have to be able to withstand extreme conditions such 
as gale-force winds and lightning strikes. Our measurement 
technology is used in the research and development of new 
materials, helping to identify mechanical stress on wind turbine 
components at an early stage in order to extend their life span and 
improve safety. We also provide systems to monitor turbine 
performance remotely, ensuring that they are set up correctly for 
optimum performance and that preventive maintenance can be 
scheduled where required. This minimises wear and tear, prevents 
damage and optimises efficiency, saving both time and money.
Compared to manufacturers in other sectors, the impact of our 
operations on the environment is relatively low. However, we take 
seriously our responsibility to minimise our impact and recognise 
the opportunities and risks to the business of climate-related issues. 
Energy efficiency has been identified as a key performance indicator 
and further details can be found on page 19. No environmental 
risks have currently been assessed as being material to the business. 
A number of our operations have achieved ISO 14001 certification 
for environmental management.
As well as helping our customers to reduce their impact on the 
environment, this is also the focus for our own efforts and we 
monitor the use of key sources of energy (electricity, gas, oil and 
steam) in our efforts to reduce consumption and save costs. The 
following table summarises our performance.

The energy consumption table records large increases in 
consumption in two areas: electricity and oil. These increases  
reflect the acquisition of Millbrook in September 2016, 2017  
being the first sustainability reporting year for this business. 
However, if Millbrook is excluded, the underlying Group figure 
demonstrates a reduction in consumption of 3%, despite an 
increase in revenue of 9%. 
The increase in Scope 1 emissions shown in the table is a result of 
the Millbrook acquisition and additional business-related vehicle 
miles. Scope 3 emissions increased primarily as a result of increased 
air travel, which related mainly to Project Uplift. However, if the 
impact of the acquisition of Millbrook is excluded, the underlying 
trend is down, with the Group's total emissions decreasing by 3% 
against a revenue increase of 9%. For the Group as a whole,  
the result of this decrease brings emissions per £m of revenue 
down by 4% and if Millbrook is again excluded, this decrease 
extends to 11%.
Energy reduction initiatives at key operational sites in Europe have 
been identified through the implementation of Article 8 of the EU 
Energy Efficiency Directive, which was enacted in the UK by the 
mandatory energy assessment scheme, the Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme (‘ESOS’). Independent third-party energy 
reduction opportunity audits have taken place and identified areas 
for improvement. Our operating companies will use these audits 
as the basis for energy reduction programmes. ESOS Phase 2 has 
now been launched and we are considering how to make the best 
use of the regulations to continue the reduction programmes 
already in place. 
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance (‘LRQA’) has independently 
verified the data associated with energy consumption, greenhouse 
gas (‘GHG’) emissions, company vehicle and air miles and the 
accident incidence rate. The LRQA Assurance Statement confirming 
terms of engagement, approach, opinion and observations can be 
found on page 42.
We are confident that the systems we have in place for measuring 
and monitoring energy use underline our commitment to 
environmental accountability and enable us to provide 
independently verified public disclosure of our emissions on an 
annual basis. We therefore ceased to participate in the Carbon 
Disclosure Project in 2016. 
In support of the Group’s commitment to reduce GHG emissions, 
focus is being placed on recognising and capturing all GHG 
emissions. As part of Project Uplift activity during 2017, the Group 
implemented new global freight contracts with Geodis and UPS 
across over 60 sites. For the first time, this will allow the Group to 
monitor and capture GHG emissions relating to freight forwarding.
Following the launch of these contracts, the Group has begun to 
monitor related GHG emissions data. Approximately three months 
of data has been collated to date and is currently being reviewed to 
agree an acceptable emissions conversion methodology. Freight 
forwarding emissions data captured under these contracts will be 
used to inform future analysis of the Group's Scope 3 emissions. 
The Group will also look at the potential for the collation and 
provision of enhanced data that arises due to Project Uplift activity.

LRQA Independent Assurance Statement Summary
Relating to Spectris plc’s Annual Report and Accounts for the calendar year 2017
This is the summary version of the LRQA Assurance Statement. The full version of the LRQA Assurance Statement confirming terms of 
engagement, approach, opinion and observations is available on the Spectris website at http://www.spectris.com/sustainability/overview.
Terms of engagement
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance (LRQA) was commissioned by Spectris plc (Spectris) to provide independent assurance on the data 
disclosed in the Sustainability Report section of the Annual Report and Accounts for the calendar year 2017 (‘the report’) against the 
assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance using LRQA’s verification procedure. LRQA’s verification procedure is based on 
current best practice, is in accordance with ISAE 3000 and ISAE 3410 and uses the principles of AA1000AS (2008) – inclusivity, materiality, 
responsiveness and reliability of performance data.
Our assurance engagement covered Spectris’ global operations and specifically verified conformance with the following requirements:

also revenue performance data in energy consumption, which was taken directly from the audited financial accounts. 
LRQA’s responsibility is only to Spectris. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. Spectris’ 
responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the report and for maintaining 
effective internal controls over the systems from which the report is derived. Ultimately, the report has been approved by, and remains  
the responsibility of, Spectris.
LRQA’s opinion
Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that Spectris has not, in all material respects:
 › Met the requirements above.
 › Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and information as no errors or omissions were detected.
The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement  
of the verifier. 
Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited 
assurance engagements focus on aggregated data reviewed rather than physically checking source data at sites. Consequently, the level  
of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a 
reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

Strategic Report Social impact
Spectris is a specialised and technical business, and we rely  
on the skills and expertise of our people, many of whom are  
highly-qualified engineers and technicians. We have built our 
success on a combination of operational excellence and intelligent 
innovation, and we know that such innovation requires a way of 
working which is open, positive and respectful, and supports the 
development of new ideas, and the taking of reasonable and 
measured risks. You can read more about the key role our people 
play in our strategy and our business model on pages 6 to 9.
Diversity, equality and inclusion
We recruit, develop and promote our people based on their talent, 
commitment and achievement; everyone is treated equally and 
fairly whatever their race, colour, religion, national origin, gender, 
sexual orientation, age or background. Our people are key to the 
success of our business.
Our business is diverse, with operations at more than 190 locations 
throughout the world, with over 8,700 employees in over 30 
different countries and cultures. As such, we need a workforce 
based on a diverse group of talent able to provide solutions to a 
wide range of customers around the world and which reflects the 
cultures and perspectives of our local markets. We are aware that 
our current employee base is not fully representative of the 
geographies we operate in and that the gender balance does not 
reflect the population as a whole, as the table below demonstrates.

In the UK, our two largest operating companies, Malvern Panalytical 
and Millbrook, have processes in place to collect and publish data 
under the new Gender Pay Gap Reporting regulation. Millbrook has 
published its gender pay information and Malvern Panalytical will 
publish its data ahead of the April 2018 deadline. This legislation 
applies to employers with 250 or more employees who ordinarily 
work in Great Britain and whose contracts of employment are 
governed by UK legislation, and details the difference in mean and 
median pay between men and women at the company. As well as 
meeting the new disclosure requirements, the information will help 
us to focus on the underlying causes of any gender pay gap and 
take action to ensure equality and fairness in the workplace.
A challenge facing engineering companies is how to encourage 
more young people to pursue careers in manufacturing and 
engineering. Our businesses participate in various initiatives 
including student internships, apprenticeships, industrial 
placements, school careers days and other events designed to  
raise awareness amongst school children of the opportunities  
to work in manufacturing and engineering.
We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form. 
Disabled people are recruited, trained and promoted on the basis of 
aptitude and ability. If employees become disabled, every effort is 
made to retain them and, when necessary, re-train them for 
appropriate posts. Our full employment policy is published at  
www.spectris.com.
We comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and our 
anti-slavery training has been extended to all employees worldwide.
The Board has renewed its commitment to diversity and inclusion 
during the year through the adoption of a new policy. During 
2018, the Group will continue to focus on talent management and 
succession planning. Further information about the Board diversity 
policy and its implementation can be found in the Corporate 
Governance Statement on page 54.
Training, development and compensation
We work hard to build a creative working environment for our 
people with scope for individual responsibility and personal 
achievement. Our training programmes help our employees to 
develop both personally and professionally and reach their full 
potential. We carry out annual performance reviews to determine 
each individual’s training needs and assess their performance 
against the previous year’s targets. Employees at our operating 
companies and Spectris plc all have access to the Spectris Talent 
and Learning Management system. The system is also being used 
by a number of operating companies for objective setting and 
performance reviews. 
Malvern Panalytical, one of our UK businesses, has received the 
Investors in People accreditation for their training, appraisal, 
employee development and skills programmes. 
We encourage our employees to maintain a healthy balance 
between their working and personal lives, and offer flexible 
part-time and job-share opportunities to employees with family 
commitments, wherever possible.
We seek to attract and retain the best talent and our compensation 
and benefits schemes are in line with other leading companies in 
our sector, with rewards dependent on the achievement of 
individual and corporate objectives.
We conduct employee satisfaction surveys within our operating 
companies as part of an evaluation and measurement process, 
which also includes monitoring the rate of voluntary staff turnover 
in our key regions. This is compared against local data for our 
industry sector in order that our management teams can identify 
any unusual patterns and take the appropriate steps to improve 
employee retention. Voluntary turnover rates are higher in Asia 
than in other regions as finding and retaining staff is a challenge for 
all companies due to the increasing opportunities in this region. We 
monitor the situation closely and make every effort to retain our 
employees in this highly-competitive environment.

Women in engineering scholarship
Omega Engineering is sponsoring a scholarship for a senior 
student member of the Society of Women Engineers ('SWE')  
in the USA in the name of Omega’s founder, Betty Ruth 
Hollander. SWE's mission is to encourage women to achieve 
their full potential in careers as engineers and leaders, expand 
the image of the engineering profession as a positive force 
in improving the quality of life, and demonstrate the value 
of diversity. The scholarship programme is one of SWE’s 
most visible and successful initiatives, inspiring young women 
to enter and complete undergraduate and graduate 
engineering programmes. 
Scholarship recipients are chosen in late spring, awarded in the 
summer, and then publicly announced. Eligible areas of study 
include: aeronautical/aerospace engineering, automotive 
engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, 
engineering technology, industrial engineering, mechanical 
engineering, and manufacturing engineering. Geographical 
location of potential recipients is also a selection consideration 
to encourage an internship at one of Omega’s US facilities – 
an ideal opportunity to connect with students while providing 
them with an invaluable hands-on experience.
A study by the Commission on the Advancement of Women 
and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology 
indicates lack of financial resources and low self-confidence 
contribute to the weak retention of women in engineering 
programmes. Through a scholarship, supporters can make a 
difference for a woman beginning or continuing her 
engineering studies. Recognition, an integral component of 
every scholarship awarded, can improve the recipient’s 
self-confidence. Omega is proud to help provide a deserving 
woman with the opportunity to complete their education and 
meet their full potential. 
Employee engagement 
Employee communication is largely undertaken at a local level by 
individual operating company management teams. As the Group's 
strategy evolves it is likely that there will be further focus placed 
upon co-ordinated communications at a Group level. 
Health and safety
As a responsible employer, we take the health and safety of our 
employees seriously. We are proud to have an excellent record of 
safety in our workplaces, but we remain vigilant and track our 
accident incidence rate as a key performance indicator. Local health 
and safety managers and officers carry out regular audits and 
employee training and suggest improvements in working practices, 
where appropriate, in order to create a safer workplace. Potential 
product-related health and safety issues are considered as part of 
the product design process and continuous improvement 
programmes focused on health and safety aim to reduce accidents 
and injuries at our sites to as low a level as reasonably practical.
In 2017, we measured the total number of work-related accidents 
or ill health resulting in time lost in excess of one day. In previous 
years, the unit of measure was time lost in excess of three days.  
The number of reportable accidents has increased year-on-year  
due to this change.

Strategic Report Each of our operating companies is responsible for implementing 
the Group-wide health and safety policy, and for complying with 
any additional local regulations. Our Group policy covers our own 
employees, sub-contractors and, where appropriate, our suppliers. 
You can read the full policy on our website at www.spectris.com. 
All our major locations are regularly inspected by independent 
assessors for their compliance with health and safety policy  
and procedures.
Any recommendations for improvements are put into practice.  
A number of our UK offices have achieved certification to  
OHSAS 18001.
Human rights
Our human rights policy is consistent with the Core Conventions of 
the International Labour Organization, and we comply with 
internationally-recognised human rights standards at all our sites. 
The policy includes our position on non-discrimination, harassment, 
pay and forced labour. Human rights considerations are also 
included in the due diligence process we undertake before any 
potential acquisition. This ensures that before we acquire a 
business, we are fully informed of its approach in areas such as 
non-discrimination, equal opportunities and freedom of association. 
Our full human rights policy is available on our website at  
www.spectris.com.
Community
Our social responsibilities also extend to the communities in which 
we operate. We seek to play a positive role in our local communities 
and participate in a range of activities and educational initiatives. 
Community involvement and decisions on charitable donations and 
sponsorship are undertaken by local management teams and vary 
from one company to another, depending on business and regional 
priorities. Many of the activities we undertake are aimed at 
supporting schools and universities to promote science, technology 
and engineering. We also run a number of awards and 
programmes aimed at encouraging and providing support for 
young scientists who are at the beginning of their careers.  
We do not give either cash or support in kind to political  
parties or campaigns. 
Customers and suppliers
We serve a broad spectrum of blue-chip customers across all key 
manufacturing industries. We work closely with them to 
understand their business, which gives us a unique ability to 
anticipate and respond to their changing needs and fosters strong 
long-term relationships. 
Our business continues to evolve as we seek greater competitive 
advantage through efficiency gains and innovation, both in our 
products and how we work, whilst addressing new regulatory 
requirements and expectations from commercial and social 
stakeholders and shareholders. Focusing on supply chain 
management is an important tool in achieving this. Our supply 
chain management policy can be found at www.spectris.com.
With operations spread around the globe, our supplier base is 
fragmented. Responsibility for vetting and managing suppliers is 
therefore devolved to local management but must meet the 
Group’s ethical standards. We carry out regular inspections at our 
supplier sites and use the SA 8000 Social Accountability Standard to 
audit our key suppliers against specific criteria. Although the Group 
had intended to extend this to cover key suppliers worldwide 
during 2017, the introduction of the anti-slavery and conflict 
minerals legislation necessarily resulted in a change of focus to the 
introduction of anti-slavery and conflict minerals sections into the 
SA 8000 Asia Pacific supplier audit process. This is now complete.
We will continue to review our supply chain management policies 
and processes to ensure that we are compliant with upcoming 
legislation and that appropriate monitoring systems are in place.
45 Spectris plc Ethics Report
Driven by values
FOCUSED ON INTEGRITY
for all internal audits include a review of the implementation of the 
Company’s Code of Business Ethics. In addition to regular internal 
audits, the Company’s Head of Business Ethics undertakes an 
annual programme of Compliance Verification Reviews which 
includes visits to operating companies to assess their compliance 
with the Company’s anti-bribery and corruption (‘ABC’) policies and 
the Code of Business Ethics; recommendations are made to 
management following the reviews and their completion is 
monitored by the Board’s Audit and Risk Committee.
Embedding our values
2017 saw the deployment of training modules focused on the 
following areas of compliance:
 › A suite of 13 refresher anti-bribery and corruption modules for 
delivery by local managers during quarterly team meetings.
 › A bespoke anti-bribery and corruption training course was 
developed and deployed for use by sales teams engaging with 
third parties which underlines that such third parties must at all 
times adopt our explicit standards of ethical behaviour expected 
when working on our behalf.
 › Conflicts of interest engagement in China, Taiwan and Korea to 
clarify our understanding and expectations regarding what a 
conflict of interest is, and the requisite need for transparency and 
mitigating controls. This roll-out will continue into 2018 for the 
rest of the world.
In addition, the roll-out of our Value of Integrity online training 
module continued across operating companies to deliver our key 
ethics and integrity values to every employee throughout the 
Group. At the date of publishing, 92% of employees across the 
Group had completed the online module.
In October 2017, Mark Serföz ő joined Spectris as General Counsel 
and Company Secretary. Mark formerly served as director of risk at 
Rolls-Royce plc and before that as chief counsel compliance and 
regulation at BAE Systems plc, playing a major role in resolving 
criminal investigations by the US and UK authorities into alleged 
bribery and corruption and in effecting necessary changes in 
corporate culture and behaviours. Mark, in conjunction with the 
other members of the Executive team, will continue to drive our 
focus on ethical leadership, strong governance and compliance and 
pragmatic risk mitigation.
Culture of openness and support
We actively encourage a culture of openness, engagement and 
communication by integrating messaging on ethics and integrity 
into our business meetings at all levels, so employees feel they can 
discuss any issues that arise in the course of their work and raise 
any concerns with their managers. 
Importantly, we make a commitment to protect the careers and 
reputations of employees who report wrongdoing, as long as they 
do so in good faith and in the best interests of the Spectris Group.
To facilitate openness, three tools are available to our employees:
 › Our Decisions Guide mobile app is available for all employees to 
help them tackle challenging decision-making situations and 
provides contact details for all our Ethics Officers so employees 
can raise concerns or seek guidance 24/7.
Culture, ethics and leadership
At Spectris, we believe that maintaining a strong and consistent 
corporate culture supports long-term performance and is 
particularly important in the context of the Group’s operating 
model and entrepreneurial nature. 
The Board acknowledges its role in shaping, monitoring and 
overseeing culture, as well as ensuring alignment between our 
values, strategy and business model. Culture and ethics were a 
regular discussion focus for the Board, its Committees and the 
Executive Committee throughout the year. During 2017, 
discussions focused on a range of topics including managing 
compliance risk in China, particularly conflicts of interest, our 
whistleblowing policy and process, and the evolution of the ethics 
programme and its future strategy.
In 2017, there has also been a focus on reinforcing ethical 
leadership responsibility at operating company level, with a series of 
engagement sessions focused on the role of leaders in embedding 
ethical culture within our organisation.
In addition, in order to further drive operating company leadership 
responsibility for ethical leadership and outcomes, changes were 
made to our variable compensation structures to align incentive 
pay-out and ethics outcomes. In order to further drive leadership 
responsibility in these areas, finance, legal and HR functions will 
work closely together to further align values and incentives across 
the Group. Senior managers’ bonuses across the Group are now 
subject to a malus where there is evidence of insufficient 
commitment to ethical leadership. 
As part of their leadership commitment, all senior managers 
(including the Executive team, operating company Presidents and 
Finance Directors, as well as other Sales and General Managers) 
have certified that they have fostered an open ethical culture during 
the year, including having dealt with or reported any suspected 
violation of our Code of Business Ethics.
The Company undertakes due diligence on the third-party sales 
advisers and distributors that it engages and the proposing 
operating company is required to mitigate or remove any red flags 
that are raised during the due diligence process. Terms of reference

46 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report  › Our independent hotline (spectrishotline.com) gives our 
colleagues, business partners and other third parties the ability  
to report concerns anonymously if they wish.
 › A voluntary disclosure programme was launched for a three-
month period in 2017 in China, Taiwan and South Korea to 
encourage employees who have not, in line with our policies, 
previously disclosed a potential or actual conflict to come  
forward and report. 
Reports received from all sources, including our voluntary  
disclosure programme, are fully investigated and the results are 
communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee every six months. 
During 2017, 24 ethics and compliance reports were received via a 
number of sources and the charts below show the number of 
reports received from each region and the methods used to report 
the allegations. Each allegation was investigated and resolved and 
additional guidance, training and monitoring made available or 
disciplinary action taken, in some circumstances including 
employment termination, as appropriate.
Absolute Integrity Award 2017
We are very proud to have received seven nominations from 
across the Group in 2017. These are individuals who have 
displayed outstanding commitment to our value of Absolute 
Integrity. The 2017 winner is Jason Chen, a sales manager 
based in Taiwan with Particle Measuring Systems, who was 
chosen by our judging panel as representing a shining example 
of Absolute Integrity and ethical leadership in everyday work.
Even though we are pleased that employees in Asia feel able to 
report ethical and compliance concerns, further work will be done 
in 2018 to better understand the small number of reports the 
Group receives in the rest of the world and the steps we need to 
take to deal with any imbalance.
Addressing ongoing challenges
One area of focus in 2017 was a review of compliance resourcing, 
capability and capacity across the Group to ensure we have 
appropriate resources in place to support our business, 
strengthening our second line of defence. Additional Compliance 
Officers were recruited in 2017 to provide independent scrutiny and 
oversight of operations in Korea, Brazil and Mexico, and to provide 
subject matter expertise and advisory support to the operating 
companies in relation to anti-bribery, fraud and anti-trust risks.
2018 and beyond
A review of our ethics and compliance programme was conducted 
in 2017 and the following areas of focus will be prioritised:
 › Refresh Group-wide ABC policies and processes.
 › Refresh anti-bribery and corruption risk assessment for  
the Group.
 › Increase oversight and monitoring activity.
 › Further review of resourcing requirements.

Chairman’s Introduction to Corporate Governance
Focused on 
STRATEGY
Corporate Governance Code 
Statement of compliance
As a UK premium listed company, Spectris plc is expected to 
comply, or explain any non-compliance, with the 2016 UK 
Corporate Governance Code ('the Code'). The Board considers 
that the Company complied with the Code throughout the 
year ended 31 December 2017 and a full summary of 
compliance is set out on pages 62 to 63.
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present my first Corporate 
Governance Report as Chairman of Spectris. This report aims to 
provide shareholders and other stakeholders with an appreciation 
of how our Group is managed and the governance and control 
framework in which we operate. 
The Board and I are committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance and this report sets out how we 
have applied the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016. Culture is key to strong governance and in 
my first months as Chairman I have found the culture of Spectris to 
be open and transparent, with the Board and Executive sharing a 
common approach of constructive challenge and support.
The Board and I take very seriously our responsibility to have a 
robust governance structure in place to ensure that we properly 
discharge our responsibilities in setting our strategy, as well as 
monitoring and reviewing progress as it is implemented, and in 
ensuring that we manage our risks and carry out business 
responsibly. In support of this responsibility, the Board held an 
in-depth strategy review with the Executive team in December 
2017 to thoroughly consider and challenge the five-year strategic 
plan and the proposed organisational model to support that plan.  
A review of the implementation of the strategy agreed at that 
meeting will be included on the agenda of all scheduled Board 
meetings for 2018.
As a Board we have taken note of the reports from both the 
Hampton-Alexander and the Parker reviews. We have considered 
our approach to diversity in light of the issues raised in both reports. 
This report details the Board’s renewed commitment to promoting 
diversity at a Board, executive leadership and at every level of the 
Company. I was pleased to hear about some of the initiatives 
already underway within the operating companies to support 
future talent and diversity and you can read further details in the 
Sustainability Report on pages 43 and 44.
As a Board, we are conscious that we are accountable to our 
shareholders and must have regard to other stakeholders such as 
employees, customers, suppliers and the environment. We maintain 
an active dialogue with shareholders throughout the year and listen 
to views of representatives of investors and financial institutions. 
We welcome the opportunity at our Annual General Meeting to 
meet and answer shareholders’ questions.

Board Activity 
Board diversity policy
The Board reviewed its approach to the promotion of diversity in 
January 2018. Following this review and mindful of the findings of 
the Hampton-Alexander Review and the Parker Review, the Board 
has approved the following policy on diversity.
The Board is committed to further promoting diversity and 
inclusiveness of all kinds throughout the Group, regardless of 
geography or position. The Board agrees that diversity, which 
should be construed in its broadest sense and includes gender and 
ethnic diversity, is an important factor in Board effectiveness and 
the Group is a supportive participant of the Hampton-Alexander 
Review which sets a target for the percentage of women on FTSE 
boards and leadership teams to reach one third by 2020.
In support of this policy, the Nomination Committee will conduct 
an annual review of progress towards achieving a more diverse 
workforce at all levels within the organisation. In particular, the 
Committee will:
 › aspire to long lists of potential non-executive directors including 
50% female candidates;
 › only engage executive search firms who have signed up to the 
Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms on gender 
diversity and best practice;
 › work closely with the Group Human Resources Director during 
2018 to review the Group's approach to talent management and 
succession planning. In particular, ensuring that initiatives are in 
place to develop the talent pipeline and to promote diversity in 
senior leadership appointments with consideration being given to 
the nature, variety and frequency of interaction between the 
Board and aspiring candidates at all levels; and
 › ensure that high-performing employees from within the business 
and from a variety of backgrounds, who have the requisite skills, 
are given greater exposure to the nomination committees of 
other FTSE 350 companies.
The Board will report annually on progress.
In October 2017, the Board visited the 
offices of Malvern Panalytical in Almelo, the 
Netherlands, to review the progress made to 
merge the businesses during 2017. Paolo 
Carmassi, the President of Malvern 
Panalytical, toured the facility with the Board 
and provided an overview of how the newly 
combined company was working to leverage 
its joint resources in order to deliver a more 
complete range of products, solutions and 
services to a broader set of markets and 
customers and to grow its service offering. 
Outside of the formal meeting, the Board 
met with the executive team and other 
key employees to better understand 
the development of the joint 
business proposition.
Induction of Non-executive Directors 
Kjersti Wiklund and Karim Bitar joined the Board during the year 
and followed a tailored induction programme, which included 
dedicated time with the Group Executive and visits to operating 
companies within each of the four business sectors. 
 › They met with the Chairman, Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director on a one-to-one basis on appointment and subsequently 
met the other members of the Board and Executive Committee 
along with senior managers from head office functions and  
the sectors. 
 › The Company Secretary provided a comprehensive overview of: 
the Group and the legal and organisational structure; the 
governance framework; the role of Non-executive Directors; key 
business contacts at Group, sector and operating company level; 
and details of the external advisers. 
 › Karim Bitar spent a day with the Project Uplift working group to 
gain an insight into their work. 
Information regarding the induction process for the new Chairman 
during the year can be found on page 57.
Ongoing Board training and development
Board meetings are held regularly at our operating company sites, 
giving the Board the opportunity to tour the sites, meet local 
management and employees and gain an in-depth knowledge of 
our operations. During 2017, the Board visited Omega in the USA 
for its April meeting and Malvern Panalytical in the Netherlands for 
its October meetings.
54 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Board evaluation
In accordance with current best practice and the Code, the Board 
undertakes an annual formal evaluation of its performance and 
effectiveness and that of each Director and its Committees. It is the 
Board’s policy to invite external evaluation every three years.
As disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report, the 2016 Board and 
Committee evaluation was facilitated externally by Dr Tracy Long 
CBE of Boardroom Review. Dr Long is independent, her only 
connection with Spectris is her work on the Board evaluation. 
The Board continued to consider Dr Long’s recommendations 
during 2017 and, on appointment, the Chairman revisited the 
recommendations when considering his priorities for the year. 
The 2017 Board evaluation was facilitated by the Chairman with 
the support of the Company Secretary and was undertaken in 
December 2017. This was supplemented by individual evaluation 
exercises for each Board Committee which were managed by the 
relevant Committee chairman. The final evaluation report and 
suggested priorities were discussed by the Board at its meeting in 
February 2018.
The Chairman and the Company Secretary will assess progress 
against the priorities agreed during the evaluation process at 
regular intervals during 2018. 
 Actions taken following the 2016 external 
Board evaluation
 
Priorities for 2018 following the 2017 
Board evaluation
Strategic ambition
The Board met during the year to undertake an in-depth review 
of the Group's strategy. This meeting was the culmination of a 
detailed workstream undertaken by the Executive Committee to 
map the Group's strategy out to 2020. In their review, the Board 
gave particular attention to the review of the Group's principal 
risks and also the proposed organisation model that would 
support the Group's strategy.
 
Strategic implementation
The Board will focus on monitoring and supporting the 
implementation of the agreed strategy and considering the risks 
related to that implementation. The Board will also undertake a 
series of deep-dive reviews into the current risk appetite and 
mitigation plans in place regarding the Group's principal risks.
Stakeholder management
The Executive Directors met regularly with shareholders 
throughout the year. On his appointment, the Chairman also 
met with key investors. Members of the Board also met with 
analysts at a Capital Markets Day held at the Millbrook Proving 
Ground in May 2017.
 
Developing stakeholder communication
The Board will focus on the continued development of a clear 
narrative for communicating progress against the Group's 
strategy to the investor community. The Board will also spend 
time considering communication of the Group's strategy with 
employees and considering an appropriate method for 
gathering the views of the Group's employee base.
Pattern of meetings and information flow
The pattern of Board and Committee meetings was altered to 
include regular Board dinners and formal scheduled private 
meetings for the Non-executive Directors. The introduction of a 
forward agenda for Board and Committee meetings, together 
with the adoption of a consistent form of Board papers and 
monthly update reports between scheduled Board meetings, 
has improved both information flow, agenda planning and the 
quality of Board discussion. 
 
Enhanced Board interaction
In planning the Board's agenda for the year, continued focus 
will be placed on dedicating more time to open dialogue, 
debate and discussion outside of the formal meeting agenda. 
The Chairman will also work with the Company Secretary to 
introduce external speakers at certain Board dinners.
Succession planning
During the year, the Nomination Committee undertook a 
detailed review of the Group's Board and Executive succession 
planning processes with the support of the newly-appointed 
Group Human Resources Director. As part of this review, the 
Committee considered immediate succession plans and the 
talent pipeline to support long-term succession.
 
Succession planning
Building on work initiated in 2017, the Nomination Committee 
will meet at regular intervals during the year to assess the 
progress made in developing the Group's organisation model to 
support the Group's agreed strategy. The Committee will also 
focus on the development of the Group's talent pipeline and the 
enactment of the Board's diversity policy within the business.
Chairman and Non-executive Director induction programmes
Considerable time was spent during 2017 on the induction  
of two new Non-executive Directors and the new Chairman.
 
Board continuing education
The Board will introduce a Non-executive Director training and 
development programme which will bring together a variety of 
informal briefings, technical updates and further direct 
interaction with the operating companies. 
55 Spectris plc Governance
The Committee has taken note of the Financial Reporting Council's 
discussion paper on UK Board Succession Planning and, in 
particular, the recommendation that the Committee should 
regularly evaluate the senior management team and maintain  
a broad oversight of talent management processes within  
the Company.
In consideration of this recommendation and in support of the 
Group’s developing strategy, the Committee has focused during 
the year on reviewing and challenging talent management and 
succession planning at a Group Executive and at an operating 
company management level. This focus culminated in December 
2017 in the Committee holding a deep-dive discussion, led by the 
Group Human Resources Director, to review immediate and 
long-term executive succession plans and to ensure that initiatives 
were in place to develop the talent pipeline and to promote 
diversity of thinking within the organisation. The Committee will 
revisit these discussions during 2018.

Nomination Committee Report
 › assessing whether Directors are able to commit enough time  
to discharge their responsibilities;
 › reviewing induction and training needs of Directors; and
 › recommending the process and criteria for assessing the 
effectiveness of the Board and Board Committees and the 
contribution of the Chairman and individual Directors to  
the effectiveness of the Board and helping to implement  
these assessments.
Detailed terms of reference for the Committee can be found at 
www.spectris.com.
Membership and attendees
As at 31 December 2017, the members of the Committee were 
Mark Williamson, Russell King, Martha Wyrsch, Kjersti Wiklund and 
John O'Higgins. Meetings of the Committee are normally attended 
by the Group HR Director. From January 2018, all Non-executive 
Directors became members of the Committee and, in support of 
best governance practice, John O'Higgins ceased to be a formal 
member of the Committee and became a standing attendee.
Activities of the Committee during 2017
During the year, the Committee’s key activities included:
 › the appointment of a new Chairman;
 › overseeing a search and selection process for an additional 
Non-executive Director with life sciences experience. This process 
was supported by Egon Zehnder and resulted in the 
recommendation of the appointment of Karim Bitar to the Board 
in March 2017;
 › considering the independence of each Non-executive Director 
and whether each Director continued to be able to allocate 
sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively; and
 › providing continued oversight of a Group-wide organisational 
capability review that included both Board and Executive 
succession planning.
The Committee’s performance was assessed as part of the Board’s 
annual effectiveness review. It was concluded that the Committee 
had operated effectively. 
During 2018, the Committee will continue to focus on succession 
planning and supporting the diverse composition of the Board, 
Executive and senior management in support of the Board's 
diversity policy as set out on page 54.
Role of the Committee
The Committee leads the process for Board appointments and 
makes recommendations to the Board in this regard. In fulfilling this 
role, the Committee evaluates the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge on the Board and, in the light of this 
evaluation, prepares a description of the role and capabilities 
required for every appointment. The Board values diversity and 
when recruiting new Board members it addresses the issue of 
diversity, with particular regard to the percentage of women on 
the Board.
The key responsibilities of the Committee are:
 › reviewing the size, structure and composition of the Board;
 › recommending membership of Board Committees;
 › undertaking succession planning for the Chairman, Chief 
Executive and other Directors and senior management;
 › searching for candidates for the Board, and recommending 
Directors for appointment;
 › determining the independence of Directors;
During the year the Committee focused 
heavily on the search for a new Chairman 
and I would like to thank Russell King  
for leading this process on behalf of  
the Board.

Chairman’s induction process
Following the announcement of Mark’s appointment, the Chief 
Executive and the Company Secretary devised and led a detailed 
induction process which included an overview of the Group’s 
structure, history, strategy, succession plans, Board procedures,  
the Group’s Code of Business Ethics, previous Board effectiveness 
reviews and action plans; operating and financial performance;  
key relationships; and the Group’s risk profile.
Key shareholders were invited to meet with Mark and to provide 
him with their feedback on the Group. Mark also met separately 
with all members of the Executive Committee and other key 
executives within the business.
Mark visited the majority of operating companies during his first six 
months in role, with visits to the remaining operating companies 
scheduled for early 2018.
Recruitment of a new Chairman
In December 2016, the Group announced that Dr John 
Hughes had advised the Board that he would stand down as 
Chairman and Director on the appointment of a successor, 
after serving as Chairman for nearly nine years and as a 
Non-executive Director for nearly ten years. 
Following this announcement, the Board of Directors 
commenced the process to recruit and appoint a new 
Chairman. The search was undertaken by the Nomination 
Committee and led by myself as the Senior Independent 
Director. Egon Zehnder was appointed by the Committee to 
support the recruitment process. Egon Zehnder is a signatory 
to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms 
on gender diversity and best practice and, aside from assisting 
with recruitment and the development of senior leaders, has 
no other links with the Company.
Given that the announcement of John’s retirement had been 
made to the market in December and interested parties were 
able to contact either myself or other Committee members, it 
was not considered necessary to publicly advertise the role.
The Committee had a number of discussions to scope out the 
key skills, experience, characteristics and requirements for the 
role. Based on these discussions, a detailed specification for 
the role was prepared and shared with Egon Zehnder.
From a detailed understanding of our requirements and the 
specification of the role, Egon Zehnder put together an 
extensive range of potential candidates for the Committee’s 
consideration. After considered debate, this was narrowed 
down to a shortlist for interview by members of the 
Committee. John O’Higgins also spent significant time  
with the final candidates.
The Committee members were unanimous in their final 
selection of the new Chairman and on 17 May 2017, we were 
pleased to announce the appointment of Mark Williamson as 
Non-executive Chairman with effect from the conclusion of 
the Spectris Annual General Meeting held on 26 May 2017. 
Mark was a strong match to our requirements with 
considerable business and financial expertise combined with 
broad governance experience. The Committee believes that 
Mark is well placed to further strengthen the Spectris Board 
and to support John and the team as they continue to develop 
and deliver the Group’s strategy.

Audit and Risk Committee Report
I am pleased to report to shareholders on the activities of the Audit 
and Risk Committee during the year and provide insight into our 
deliberations. 
The external governance landscape continues to evolve and place 
further focus on the role of the Audit and Risk Committee. The 
Committee continues to pay close regard to the changes in external 
requirements and I would like to thank the members of the 
Committee, together with management and Deloitte, for their 
support, guidance and challenge during the year as we respond to 
those changes.
The Committee met four times during the year. The meetings 
are aligned to the Group’s financial reporting timetable, to allow 
sufficient time for full discussion of key topics and enable early 
identification and resolution of risks and issues. As Chairman, 
I met regularly with management, internal audit and the external 
auditor between Committee meetings. In July, I was pleased to 
welcome Karim Bitar to the Committee following his 
appointment to the Board.
Following the competitive tender of the Company’s external audit 
services in 2016 and the Board’s decision to recommend the 
appointment of Deloitte LLP to shareholders at the Company’s 
2017 AGM, the Committee has closely monitored the transition 
process and worked with Deloitte to agree the audit approach and 
scope of work to be undertaken. Deloitte undertook their first half 
year review on behalf of the Group in July 2017. 
The Committee is satisfied that Deloitte have been effective 
throughout the year and we have welcomed the new challenge 
and fresh perspective that the change in auditor has brought to the 
Committee's considerations to date. 
The Committee considers it important to interact with members of 
management beyond the Executive Committee. The Committee 
held its meeting in October at the offices of Malvern Panalytical in 
the Netherlands and spent time with senior leaders from both 
Malvern Panalytical and Particle Measuring Systems to discuss the 
opportunities and risks faced by the operating companies.
The UK Corporate Governance Code invites the Committee to 
report on the significant matters considered during the year. I am 
satisfied that our activities have provided the Committee with a 
good understanding of the key matters impacting the Group during 
the year and full details are contained on the opposite page. From 
my perspective the most important matters were:
 › the review of the Group's ethics programme and, in particular, 
the monitoring of the mitigating actions put in place by 
management to address the risk of sales diversion; 
 › the review of the impact of IFRS 15, a new accounting standard 
applying to revenue for contracts with customers, effective for 
accounting periods on or after 1 January 2018; 
 › the review of the Omega acquisition and lessons learned 
following the 2016 goodwill impairment; and
 › the evolution of our risk management processes and  
internal controls.
As a Committee, we will continue to focus on risk management 
and, in particular, the Group’s ongoing enhancements to systems 
of governance and internal control during 2018.
I hope that you find this review, and the report that follows, useful 
in understanding the work of the Committee during the year. The 
Committee and I encourage shareholder feedback and I look 
forward to meeting with shareholders at our Annual General 
Meeting in May.

Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee

The Committee has welcomed the new 
challenge and fresh perspective of the 
change in external auditor.
Bill Seeger
Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee
58 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Key areas of focus
Issue and significance The role of the Committee Comments and conclusion 
Impact of IFRS 15 
Under the new Standard, an entity is 
required to recognise revenue when it 
transfers goods/services to the customer in 
an amount that reflects the consideration 
to which the entity expects to be entitled 
in exchange for those goods and services. 
This will require the use of more 
judgement and estimation than the 
current standard and, in certain situations, 
will result in the revenue being deferred 
and recognised over a period of time 
rather than at a point in time which is 
likely to affect the measurement and 
timing of the recognition of revenue.
The Committee considered the main 
changes to revenue recognition required 
under IFRS 15 for the Group, the actions 
undertaken by management to prepare 
for both implementation for the year 
ending 31 December 2018 and to 
support the disclosure required in the 
2017 Annual Report and the expected 
impact on the Group’s revenue.
The Committee supported the 
judgements made by management 
regarding the likely impact of IFRS 15 for 
the year ending 31 December 2018 and 
agreed with management that, due to 
the year-on-year impact for the Group 
being relatively small, the opening 
balance sheet for 1 January 2018 should 
be adjusted to reflect the cumulative 
impact of the change, rather than the 
Group undertaking a full restatement  
of comparatives.
Provisions for taxation
Provisions held in respect of tax risks are 
included within current and deferred tax 
liabilities depending on the underlying 
circumstances of the provision. 
Management judgement is exercised in 
arriving at the amounts to be provided. 
Management confirmed to the Committee 
that the provisions recorded at 31 
December 2017 represent their best 
estimate of the likely financial exposure 
faced by the Group.
The Committee reviewed and challenged 
the approach taken by management and 
Deloitte explained to the Committee the 
work conducted during the year, 
including how their audit procedures 
were focused on those provisions with 
the highest level of judgement on 
recognition criteria and/or measurement.
Following discussion with both 
management and Deloitte regarding the 
key judgements which had been made, 
the Committee was satisfied that they 
were reasonable and that, accordingly, 
the provision amounts recorded were 
appropriate. Further details of the 
Group's taxation provision are set  
out on page 30.
Use of alternative performance 
measures (APMs)
The Company’s performance measures 
continue to include some measures which 
are not defined or specified under IFRS. 
Further detail is set out in the Financial 
Review on page 28.
The Committee noted the guidance 
issued by the European Securities and 
Markets Authority and by the Financial 
Reporting Council ('FRC') in relation to 
the use of APMs and, supported by the 
challenge of Deloitte, considered whether 
the performance measures used by 
management provided a meaningful 
insight into the results of the Company 
for its shareholders.
The Committee concluded that, in 
relation to the half and full year 2017 
results and the 2017 Annual Report, clear 
and meaningful descriptions had been 
provided for the APMs used. It was also 
concluded that the relationship between 
these measures and the statutory IFRS 
measures was clearly explained and 
supported the considered understanding 
of the Financial Statements. 
Estimation, uncertainty and judgement
During the year, the Committee received 
reports and recommendations from 
management and the external auditor to 
consider the significant accounting issues, 
estimates and judgements applicable to 
the Group’s Financial Statements and 
disclosures.
The key risks of estimation disclosed in the 
Group’s 2017 Financial Statements are:
 › the assumptions applied in the calculation 
of retirement benefit plan liabilities; and
 › provisions for uncertain exposures and  
tax positions.
Further details are set out in Note 1, Note 9 
and Note 20 to the Financial Statements.
Management confirmed to the 
Committee that they were not aware  
of any material or immaterial 
misstatements made intentionally  
to achieve a particular presentation.
The Committee reviewed presentations 
made to the Committee by management 
and questioned Deloitte to understand 
whether the external auditor had, to the 
Committee’s satisfaction, fulfilled its 
responsibilities with diligence and 
professional scepticism and in a 
sufficiently robust manner.
The Committee noted the inclusion of the 
Group's 2016 Annual Report in the FRC's 
thematic review of significant accounting 
judgements and sources of estimation 
uncertainty and the subsequent  
feedback received.
After reviewing the presentations and 
reports from management and 
consulting, where necessary, with the 
external auditor, the Committee is 
satisfied that the Financial Statements 
appropriately address critical judgements 
and key estimates (both in respect of the 
amounts reported and the disclosures).
The Committee is also satisfied that the 
significant assumptions used for 
determining the value of assets and 
liabilities have been appropriately 
scrutinised and challenged and are 
sufficiently robust.
In relation to the FRC's review of the 
significant accounting judgements and 
sources of estimation uncertainty set out 
in the 2016 Annual Report, the 
Committee noted that the feedback 
contained no substantive issues and 
supported management's consideration of 
the inclusion of additional information 
recommended by the FRC.
59 Spectris plc Governance
Role of the Committee
The Committee supports the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in 
respect of: overseeing the Company’s financial reporting processes; 
reviewing, challenging and approving significant accounting 
judgements proposed by management; the way in which 
management ensures and monitors the adequacy of financial and 
compliance controls; the appointment, remuneration, 
independence and performance of the Group’s external auditor; 
and the independence and performance of internal audit.
Details of the work carried out by the Committee in accordance 
with its terms of reference and in addressing significant issues are 
reported to the Board as a matter of course by the Chairman of the 
Committee and are described in this report. The terms of reference 
for the Committee can be found at www.spectris.com.
Membership and attendance
The Committee is comprised solely of independent Non-executive 
Directors. Bill Seeger, Martha Wyrsch and Ulf Quellmann were 
members of the Committee throughout 2017. Karim Bitar became 
a member of the Committee on joining the Board in July 2017.  
Bill Seeger is determined by the Committee to have ‘recent and 
relevant financial experience’ as required by the Code. All members

the Board deems relevant to the sectors in which the  
Company operates. 
Meetings are normally attended by the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive, the Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit, the 
General Counsel and Company Secretary and representatives of  
the external auditor. The Committee retains time at the end of  
each meeting to meet separately without management present  
and invites the Head of Internal Audit and the external auditor  
to attend for part of this session.
Performance review
The Committee’s performance was assessed during the year  
under the stewardship of the Committee Chairman and this  
review was fed into the wider Board evaluation process which  
was led by the Chairman. It was concluded that the Committee 
operated effectively. 
Activities of the Committee during 2017 
The Committee has an annual forward agenda developed from  
its terms of reference with standing items considered at each 
meeting in addition to any specific matters arising and topical 
business or financial items on which the Committee has chosen  
to focus. The work of the Committee in 2017 principally fell into 
three main areas:
1. Accounting, tax and financial reporting
 › reviewing the integrity of the half year and Annual Financial

model and strategy;
 › the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures 
designed to ensure that the Annual Report and Accounts 
complies with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements;
 › the process designed to ensure the external auditor is aware of 
all ‘relevant audit information’, as required by Sections 418 
and 419 of the Companies Act 2006; and
 › the Directors’ Report.
2. Risk management and internal controls

internal control environment and making recommendations to 
the Board;

Audit and Risk Committee Report continued
60 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Internal control and risk 
management systems
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of 
the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving its particular 
objectives and is ultimately responsible for the effectiveness of the 
risk management and internal control systems that safeguard 
shareholders’ investments and the Company’s assets. To ensure the 
effectiveness of these systems, at the Board’s request, a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group is undertaken by 
the Committee.
Before reporting its findings and recommendations to the Board, 
the Committee:
 › evaluates the results and recommendations of audits undertaken 
by the internal audit team and the external auditor;
 › reviews reports received on significant control issues to the 
Group and considers and challenges as necessary the adequacy 
of management’s response to any matters raised;
 › appraises the Group’s response to information security and data 
protection risks;
 › considers the Group’s ethics programme and the anti-bribery and 
corruption audit programme; 
 › considers common control themes identified throughout the 
business, and where themes are identified, ensures that 
subsequent action has been taken to minimise the risk;
 › assesses the Group’s responsibilities relating to regulated 
exposures of the Group;
 › reviews the annual Audit and Risk Committee agenda; and
 › has oversight of the governance and risk management 
framework, including a definition of risk appetite by risk category 
and principal risk, put in place throughout the Group.
The effectiveness of risk management and mitigation is reviewed 
regularly by the Executive Committee and twice yearly by the Audit 
and Risk Committee. The Board notes that, as with all such systems, 
the Group’s risk management and internal control framework is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Viability Statement
The Committee reviewed the 2016 Viability Statement and the 
draft 2017 Viability Statement in light of comments made by the 
FRC and the Investment Association regarding the first viability 
statements published by companies and remains of the view that 
the statement made regarding the Company’s viability period 
continues to be an accurate assessment of the Company’s  
viability as at the date of the report.
The Viability Statement is set out on page 39.
Independent assurance
Internal audit
The Committee has oversight responsibilities for the internal audit 
function which is led by the Head of Internal Audit.
The purpose of the Internal Audit function is to provide 
independent, objective assurance to add value and improve the 
Group’s operations. Its responsibilities include assessing the key risks 
of the organisation and examining, evaluating and reporting on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the systems of internal control and 
risk management in place, and the governance processes in 
operation throughout the Group.
During the year, the Committee considered the internal audit 
programme for the forthcoming year and reviewed the proposed 
audit approach, coverage and allocation of resources.
The Committee also reviewed the progress updates against the 
2017 activity of internal audit, received reports on issues of 
significance to the Group and reported to the Board on its 
evaluation of these findings.
External auditor 
The Committee is responsible for managing the relationship with 
the Group’s external auditor on behalf of the Board.
The Company last undertook a tender for external audit services 
during 2016 which led to the appointment of Deloitte LLP at the 
May 2017 Annual General Meeting ('AGM'). 
During the year, the Committee carried out a preliminary 
assessment of the auditors which focused on their performance 
during the half year review and their on-boarding process and 
reported these findings to the Board. To support this assessment, 
the Committee invited members of the Group and operating 
company finance teams to provide their feedback. In addition, the 
Committee reviewed the Audit Quality Inspection public report for 
2016/17 for Deloitte. After taking these reports into consideration, 
together with the auditor’s report on their approach to audit quality 
and transparency and having given consideration to the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Revised Ethical Standard 2016, the Committee 
concluded that the auditors demonstrated appropriate 
qualifications and expertise and remained independent of the 
Group and that the audit process was effective.
Following the tender process and the appointment of Deloitte, the 
Committee reviewed the proposed engagement letter and 
determined the proposed remuneration of Deloitte in accordance 
with the authority given to it by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. 
The Committee considered the proposed auditor's remuneration to 
be appropriate.
It is proposed that Deloitte be re-appointed as auditors of the 
Company at the next AGM in May 2018 and, if so re-appointed, 
that they will hold office until the conclusion of the next general 
meeting of the Company at which accounts are laid. Further details 
are set out in the Notice of Meeting which is available at  
www.spectris.com.
The Group will continue the practice of the rotation of the audit 
engagement partner at least every five years, with all other  
partners and senior management required to rotate at least  
every seven years.
The independent external auditor's report to shareholders is set out 
on pages 84 to 91. 
Non-audit fees
The Committee believes that non-audit work may only be 
undertaken by the external auditor in limited circumstances. A 
cumulative annual cap is imposed for non-audit services provided 
by our external auditor (save for acquisition due diligence and 
limited taxation services), above which all engagements are subject 
to the Committee’s prior approval.
Non-audit fees for services provided by Deloitte for the year 
amounted to £0.1million (6% of the audit fee). Further details are 
included in Note 5 to the Financial Statements. The Committee‘s 
non-audit services policy is available at www.spectris.com.

B. Effectiveness
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The UK Listing Rules stipulate that listed companies must include in their annual report a statement of whether they have 
complied with all the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 ('the Code'), which can be found at 
www.frc.org.uk.
During 2017, Spectris has complied fully with the Code. The notes below are intended to assist with the evaluation of 
Spectris’ compliance during 2017 and the processes put in place to support the continuation of best governance principles.
A.1 The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for promoting the success of Spectris and the 
operation of effective governance arrangements with a view to the creation of 
strong, sustainable financial performance and long-term shareholder value. The 
steps the Board takes to facilitate this are outlined in the Governance report set 
out on pages 48 to 82.
The Board met seven times in 2017 in order to review the Company’s 
performance and strategy against set objectives. Details of Board and Board 
Committee attendance for 2017 are set out on page 49.
The Board has adopted a clear schedule of matters reserved for its specific 
approval, including a framework for those decisions which can be delegated to 
committees or otherwise. A full list of matters reserved to the Board is available at 
www.spectris.com.
All Directors are covered by a directors’ and officers’ insurance policy.
A.2 Division of responsibilities
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, with both having  
distinct and clearly defined responsibilities which are established in written  
terms of reference that have been agreed by the Board and which are available  
at www.spectris.com. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership and 
effectiveness of the Board, and the Chief Executive is responsible for leading the 
day-to-day management of the Company within the strategy set by the Board.
A.3 The Chairman
The Chairman sets the agenda for meetings, manages the meeting timetable and 
facilitates open and constructive dialogue during the meetings.
The Chairman was independent on appointment.
A.4 Non-executive Directors
The Chairman promotes an open and constructive environment in the boardroom 
and actively invites the Non-executive Directors’ views to help develop proposals 
on strategy and scrutinise the performance of management against set goals  
and objectives. They should satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial 
information and that financial controls and systems of risk management are 
robust and defensible.
Russell King is the Senior Independent Non-executive Director and is available to 
meet with shareholders if required. The Chairman meets with Non-executive 
Directors in the absence of the Executive Directors at regular intervals during the 
year, and the Senior Independent Non-executive Director leads a meeting with the 
Non-executive Directors without the Chairman present at least once a year.
During the year, the Directors had no unresolved concerns about the running of 
the Company or any proposed action.
B.1 The composition of the Board
There are currently six Non-executive Directors in addition to the Chairman and 
two Executive Directors on the Board.
The composition of the Board is reviewed regularly by the Nomination Committee 
to ensure that there is an appropriate mix of skills, experience, diversity (including 
gender), independence and knowledge on the Board. Board members’ 
biographies are provided on pages 50 and 51, which identify the experience each 
Director brings to the Board. Diagrams identifying the skills and experience of 
Board members can be found on page 57. The 2017 Board evaluation 
determined that the Board continued to be effective and that the current 
Directors’ backgrounds provided a good mix to meet current and future needs. 
The Board determines, through the Nomination Committee, the independence of 
its members. The Board considers all of its Non-executive Directors to be 
independent and free of any business relationships that could compromise the 
exercise of independent and objective judgement. Conflicts of interest are 
regularly monitored.
B.2 Appointments to the Board
The Nomination Committee leads all appointments of new Directors to the Board, 
applying a rigorous and transparent process mindful of merit, objectivity and 
diversity. Details of its activities undertaken during the year, including the search 
and selection process that led to the appointment of the new Chairman, 
succession planning and talent management, can be found in the Nomination 
Committee report on pages 56 and 57. 
A full description of the Company’s diversity policy is set out on page 54.
The terms of reference for the Nomination Committee are available at  
www.spectris.com.
B.3 Commitment
The Nomination Committee considers on appointment and annually the time 
needed to fulfil the roles of Chairman, Senior Independent Director and 
Non-executive Director and ensures that the Non-executive Directors will have 
sufficient time to fulfil their duties. 
On appointment, and as at the date of this report, the Chairman’s significant 
listed company interests are as chairman of Imperial Brands plc and senior 
independent non-executive director of National Grid plc. The Board has formally 
reviewed the Chairman’s other commitments and confirms that it believes that 
the Chairman’s obligations to the Company are properly fulfilled notwithstanding 
these directorships. Indeed, the Board is appreciative of the additional skills and 
experience the Chairman brings to the Board arising from these directorships.
In November 2017, John O'Higgins joined the Board of Johnson Matthey plc as a 
non-executive director. Clive Watson has been a non-executive director of 
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc since 2009.
B.4 Development
New Directors receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining and the 
Chairman reviews and agrees subsequent training and development needs with 
the Board on at least an annual basis. Details of the induction programmes 
provided to Mark Williamson, Kjersti Wiklund and Karim Bitar are set out on pages 
57 and 54.
In April 2017, the Board visited Omega in the USA and in October 2017, the 
Board visited our Malvern Panalytical facility in the Netherlands to support its 
familiarity with the Group’s operations. Further details are set out on page 54.
B.5 Information and support
The Chairman is responsible for the delivery of accurate, timely and clear 
information to the Directors, with support from the Company Secretary.
Directors are able to solicit independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense where specific expertise is required in the course of discharging their 
duties. All Directors have access to the General Counsel and Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for ensuring compliance with appropriate statutes  
and regulations.
B.6 Evaluation
The Board and the Board Committees undertook an internal evaluation in 2017 
which was led by the Chairman and the Committee Chairmen and included a 
review of Committee membership, a review of Non-executive Directors whose 
length of service was more than six years, the external commitments of all 
Directors and a review of the skills of each of the Directors. Further details are set 
out on page 55. A summary of the relevant skills, knowledge and experience of 
Directors is shown on page 57.

B.7 Election/re-election
Each Director is subject to election at the first AGM following their appointment, 
and re-election at each subsequent AGM. In determining whether a Director 
should be proposed for re-election at the 2018 AGM, the Board took into account 
the Nomination Committee’s advice based on the results of a peer group review 
of each Director’s contribution to the Board’s effectiveness, which formed part of 
the internal Board evaluation. This review confirmed that all Directors continue to 
be effective and demonstrate commitment to their roles and the Committee 
accordingly recommended their re-appointment.
C.1 Financial and business reporting
A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities regarding the Financial Statements, 
including the status of the Group as a going concern, is set out on page 83, with 
an explanation of the Group’s strategy and business model, together with relevant 
risks and performance metrics, which are set out on pages 1 to 38. 
A further statement is provided on page 83, confirming that the Board considers 
that the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy.
The external auditor has provided a report to the shareholders on their reporting 
responsibilities at pages 84 to 91.
C.2 Risk management and internal control
The Company maintains its system of risk management and internal control  
with a view to safeguarding shareholders’ investment and the Company’s assets. 
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Company, including an assessment of the prospects of the Group. Further details 
can be found on pages 34 to 38.
The Directors have assessed that the appropriate period of longer-term viability  
for the Group is three years, as disclosed in the Viability Statement on page 39.  
The Viability Statement includes an explanation of how the Directors have 
assessed the prospects of the Company, over what period they have done so and 
why they consider that period to be appropriate. It also includes a statement that 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group can continue  
in operation over the three-year longer-term viability period.
The Board determines the Company’s risk appetite and has established risk 
management and internal control systems. At least annually, the Board 
undertakes a review of their effectiveness. Further details are set out on  
pages 33 and 61.
The Company operates a robust internal control framework which is routinely 
monitored through a combination of certification, self-assessment and internal 
audit reviews, complemented by a sound risk management process. This process 
is overseen by the Audit and Risk Committee.
C.3 Audit committee and auditor
The Audit and Risk Committee Report on pages 58 to 61 sets out details of the 
composition of the Committee, including the expertise of members, and outlines 
how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities during 2017.
The Board has delegated a number of responsibilities to the Audit and Risk 
Committee, including: financial and narrative reporting; management of the 
external and internal audit processes; internal controls; and risk management 
systems. Full details are set out in the terms of reference for the Committee, 
published at www.spectris.com.
D.1 The level and components of remuneration
The Remuneration Report on pages 64 to 79 outlines the implementation of 
remuneration during 2017, including salary, bonus and share awards.
Details of John O’Higgins' remuneration relating to his non-executive director 
role at Johnson Matthey and Clive Watson's remuneration relating to his 
non-executive director role at Spirax-Sarco are set out on page 78.
The Board believes that the current remuneration policy, as approved by 
shareholders at the 2017 AGM, remains appropriate and fit for purpose. The 
Board considers that Executive Director remuneration is an appropriate balance 
between fixed and performance-related, immediate and deferred remuneration, 
with the latter being subject to demanding performance conditions aligned with 
the Group’s strategic objectives, including appropriate circumstances for Spectris 
to recover sums paid or to withhold payment of sums. 
D.2 Procedure
During 2017, the Remuneration Committee comprised three Non-executive 
Directors and has delegated authority for setting the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors and the Chairman. The fees payable to the Non-executive 
Directors are determined by the Board. Full details of responsibilities are set out in 
the terms of reference for the Committee available at www.spectris.com.
In October 2017, the Remuneration Committee appointed PwC as its 
remuneration consultant from January 2018. Further details regarding this  
tender process are set out on page 65.
During 2017, no individual was present when their own remuneration was  
being discussed.
E.1 Dialogue with shareholders
The Board recognises that meaningful engagement with institutional and retail 
shareholders is integral to the continuing success of the Company. Throughout 
the year, the Board has sought to actively engage with shareholders on a  
number of occasions through meetings, roadshows and a Capital Markets Day  
in May 2017.
Shareholders representing in excess of 2.5% of the Company’s issued share 
capital receive a standing invitation to meet with the Chairman, the Senior 
Independent Director or Non-executive Directors. Such meetings supplement  
but do not replace the regular meetings with the Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director. The Board is kept informed of the views, needs, expectations, 
major issues and concerns of shareholders through periodic reports including,  
but not limited to, market feedback on investor relations, shareholding analysis 
and consensus. 
E.2 Constructive use of general meetings
The next AGM will be held on 25 May 2018 and is an opportunity for 
shareholders to vote on certain aspects of Group business, in person, and have  
the opportunity to meet and question the Chairman and Board members.
The results of proxy votes are available at the AGM. These are then published  
on the Company’s website.
At the AGM in 2017, there were no significant votes against any of the 
resolutions put before shareholders.
B. Effectiveness continued B. Effectiveness continued
63 Spectris plc Annual statement from the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Group’s 2017 
Remuneration Report. 
We have sought to improve our disclosures further this year to 
provide shareholders and stakeholders with a clear and suitably 
detailed understanding of our remuneration structure. We have 
summarised the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at 
the 2017 AGM rather than reproduce the policy in full. The tables 
on pages 66 to 69 provide an overview of the Directors’ annual 
remuneration framework and clearly detail the links between the 
Group’s strategy and KPIs and our approach to remuneration.
Full details of the policy are set out on pages 76 to 82 of the 
Company’s Annual Report and Accounts 2016, a copy of which is 
available on the Company’s website www.spectris.com or, upon 
request, from the Company Secretary at the Company’s registered 
office address.
At the 2017 AGM we received over 98% support for both our 
Remuneration Policy and our annual Directors' Remuneration 
Report. We are grateful to shareholders, shareholder representative 
bodies, regulatory bodies and remuneration advisers for their 
engagement, feedback, challenge and support on our 
remuneration during the past year.
During the year, the Committee agreed that it would be 
appropriate to undertake a tender process for remuneration 
advisory services in light of the significant length of the existing 
relationship with the Committee’s remuneration advisers. Following 
a detailed and rigorous process, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were 
appointed as adviser to the Committee. I would like to thank FIT 
Remuneration Consultants LLP for their strong and steady support 
during my time as Chairman of the Committee. The Committee 
and I look forward to working with PwC on the implementation of 
our current Remuneration Policy and in reviewing our response as a 
Group to the evolving external remuneration landscape.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report will be subject to an advisory 
vote at the 2018 AGM on 25 May 2018 and we look forward to 
receiving your support for the vote. Together with the rest of the 
Board, I look forward to hearing your views on our remuneration 
arrangements and we will be available to answer any questions you 
may have at the AGM.

£184.8m £203.3m £225.0m
The Group's performance in 2017 was robust with increases in 
both like-for-like sales and profit. The Group achieved a 11% 
increase in adjusted profit before tax and a 14% increase in 
adjusted earnings per share. This contributed to bonus outcomes 
for 2017 of 80.1% and 75.8% of maximum bonus opportunity  
for John O'Higgins and Clive Watson respectively. Details of their 
personal objectives, maximum bonus opportunity and on-target 
percentage for 2017 are set out on pages 70 and 71. The PSP 
awards granted in 2014 were measured over a three-year period 
against TSR, EPS and EP targets and vested in March 2017. None  
of the threshold targets were achieved and the awards lapsed in 
full. Further details are set out on page 72.
2018 remuneration outlook
The Executive Directors’ salaries were reviewed by the  
Committee in December 2017 with a 2% increase agreed with 
effect from 1 January 2018 in line with the approach taken with 
the wider population.
PSP awards granted in 2015 and due to mature in March 2018 did 
not meet the threshold target for EPS and EP conditions for the 
three-year performance period to 31 December 2017 which 
accounted for two-thirds of the total award. Based on the interim 
TSR performance results provided by Aon Hewitt Limited as at  
31 December 2017, part of the remaining one-third of this award 
which is based on the performance of TSR for the three-year 
performance period ending on 5 March 2018, may vest. Details of 
the interim performance outcomes are set out on page 72.
The fee structure for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
was last reviewed in 2016 and the next review will take place 
during 2018.

Remuneration Committee
The Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the 
policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the Chief Executive, 
the Group Finance Director and other members of the Executive 
Committee and for the practical operation of the policy. It regularly 
reviews the balance between fixed and variable pay and the 
performance conditions that attach to both short-term and 
long-term incentives. It also monitors the level and structure of 
remuneration for operating company Presidents and Managing 
Directors. The remuneration of Non-executive Directors is a matter 
reserved to the Board. The full terms of reference for the 
Remuneration Committee are reviewed annually and are available 
at www.spectris.com.
Committee members
All members of the Committee are independent Non-executive 
Directors. During 2017, the members were:
 › Russell King (Chairman)
 › Karim Bitar (appointed on 1 July 2017)
 › Ulf Quellmann
 › Kjersti Wiklund (appointed on 19 January 2017)
Committee meetings
The Committee met six times during 2017 and details of each 
member’s attendance are disclosed on page 49. Only members  
of the Committee have the right to attend meetings but other 
individuals and external advisers may attend by invitation. The 
Chairman is invited to attend all meetings of the Committee. 
During the year, the Committee also invited the Chief Executive  
and Group Human Resources Director to attend meetings to 
provide advice to the Committee to allow it to make informed 
decisions. The Deputy Company Secretary attends all meetings  
as Secretary to the Committee.
No individual was present when their own remuneration was  
being discussed.
The Committee also meets without management present and 
received independent remuneration advice during the year from  
FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP ('FIT') and independent 
information from Aon Hewitt Limited ('Aon').
Advisers to the Committee
FIT has advised the Committee on Directors’ remuneration  
matters since 2011 and provided advisory support on Directors’ 
remuneration to the Committee in 2017. FIT does not provide any 
other services to the Company.
Aon separately supports the Company in compiling IFRS 2 
share-based payment reporting on the Company’s share plans  
and TSR performance calculations in relation to the Company’s  
PSP. Aon does not provide any other services to the Company.  
Total fees paid during the financial year to these advisers were:  
FIT £23,581 (2016: £47,469) and Aon £35,352 (2016: £46,450).  
These fees were charged on the basis of each firm’s standard  
terms of business. 
Both FIT and Aon are members of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and adhere to its Code of Conduct. 
The Committee is satisfied that the advice it received from these 
firms during 2017 was objective and independent.
Following a rigorous and competitive tender process, the 
Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCooper LLP ('PwC') as its 
independent remuneration adviser from 1 January 2018 to advise 
the Committee on various aspects of the Directors’ remuneration 
and to provide fee benchmarking information for the Non-
executive Directors. PwC is a founding member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its Code of 
Conduct. During 2017, PwC provided certain project advisory 
services to the Company.
Activities in 2017
The key issues considered by the Committee during the  
year included:
 › 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report;
 › consideration of the introduction of an All–Employee Share 
Incentive Plan to replace the existing All-Employee Save As You

 › Executive Directors’ 2017 bonus arrangements, target 
performance measures and personal objectives;
 › review and approval of 2017 PSP grant levels and target range 
for performance measures;

Committee and the subsequent appointment of PwC as 
independent remuneration advisers to the Committee with effect 
from 1 January 2018; and
 › the change in the Group-wide annual salary review dates from  
1 January to 1 April from 2018 to support alignment with the 
Group’s new approach to performance management.
Use of Committee discretion
No discretion was exercised by the Committee in respect of 
remuneration during 2017.
Annual performance evaluation 
The Chairman of the Committee led the annual evaluation of the 
performance of the Committee for 2017, with the results being 
discussed by the Committee and forming part of the wider Board 
and Committee evaluation discussion led by the Chairman.  
The Committee was considered to have operated effectively  
during the year.

 › reviewing the Group’s remuneration strategy and structure  
in light of the evolving external governance landscape;
 › ensuring the continued strategic alignment of the Directors’ 
incentive arrangements;

Executive Directors’ remuneration illustrations
The following charts illustrate the actual remuneration outturns versus target in respect of each Executive Director for 2017. The fixed pay 
element includes basic salary, pension, benefits in kind, taxable expenses and all-employee share plan participation. Annual bonus is based 
on a percentage of base salary: at target level this is 60% of base salary; at maximum level this is 125% in respect of the Group Finance 
Director and 150% in respect of the Chief Executive. PSP is based on a percentage of the award (awarded at 200% of base salary) likely to 
vest based on performance: 20% at target and 100% at maximum. This equates to 40% of base salary at target and 200% of base salary 
at maximum. No awards vested during 2017. Each bar shows the percentage of the total comprised by each element.

Consideration of remuneration conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group together with current market practice 
when determining remuneration for the Executive Directors. In addition to the UK comparator group set out on page 73, the levels of 
remuneration, annual bonus and PSP awarded to the Presidents of each of the Group's operating companies are taken into consideration, 
notwithstanding that these reflect such businesses' particular trading positions and the geographical and technical employment markets in 
which they operate. However, the Committee does not consult specifically with employees on the Executive Remuneration Policy.
Consideration of shareholders' views
The Committee takes into account the views of the Company's shareholders and best practice guidelines set by shareholder representative 
bodies when determining Executive remuneration. The proposals for the 2017 Remuneration Policy were the subject of consultation with 
the Company's significant institutional shareholders and their representative bodies and their feedback was incorporated into the final 
policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Details of the votes received on the 2017 Remuneration Policy and annual Directors' Remuneration Report at the 2017 AGM are provided 
on page 78.
69 Spectris plc This section of the report sets out the details of the implementation of the Remuneration Policy during the 2017 financial year and also 
provides details of how the Committee intends to implement the policy during 2018. This part of the report, together with the Committee 
Chairman's Statement and the information on the Remuneration Committee, form the Annual Report on Remuneration which is subject 
to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2018 Annual General Meeting and contains both unaudited and audited information. The audited 
sections of this report are clearly identified.

C. 2017 Annual bonus outcome (audited)
The maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive was increased from 125% to 150% of base salary, of which 125% is based on 
adjusted profit before tax and 25% is based on personal objective performance measures. The maximum bonus opportunity for the Group 
Finance Director remained unchanged at 125% of base salary, of which 100% is based on adjusted profit before tax and 25% is based on 
personal objective performance measures. The on-target bonus for both Executive Directors is 60% comprising 50% based on adjusted 
profit before tax and 10% based on personal objectives. No bonus deferral is currently in operation other than the requirement to 
effectively defer bonus payments in excess of 60% of base salary into shares to satisfy shareholding requirements, which have already been 
met. The table below sets out the annual bonus earned by the Executive Directors in respect of the 2017 financial year including the 
financial trigger points used in determining the level of bonus payable.

D. Performance Share Plan (’PSP‘) (audited)
PSP awards to the Executive Directors are currently structured so that one-third of the award is subject to an EPS target, one-third is subject 
to a TSR target and one-third is subject to an Economic Profit (’EP‘) target. Each condition operates over a fixed three-year period (being the 
three financial years commencing with the financial year in which an award is made in respect of the EPS and EP conditions; and three 
years from the date of grant in respect of the TSR condition) with no opportunity for re-testing. The TSR performance condition is 
measured independently by Aon.
PSP awards granted during 2017 (audited)
The table below details share options granted to Executive Directors, in line with the Remuneration Policy, under the PSP scheme during 
2017. The maximum level of grant remains at 200% of base salary, calculated according to the average of the closing share price over the 
five days commencing with the day of the AGM (26 May 2017) and rounded down to the nearest ten shares. The awards were granted on 
6 June 2017. A holding period of two years applies following vesting. Full details of the performance conditions are set out on page 76.

71 Spectris plc PSP awards vested during 2017 (audited)
No PSP awards vested during the year as the minimum threshold for the EPS and EP conditions attached to the PSP awards granted in 
2014 for the three financial years to 31 December 2016, and TSR threshold targets for the performance period to 5 March 2017, were not 
met, as detailed in the table below. Those awards matured in March 2017 and have therefore lapsed.
Performance condition Weighting Threshold Actual
EPS One-third CPI + 5% compound per annum ('c.p.a.') CPI + 3% .c.p.a.
TSR One-third Median 5.7% (Median: 20.7%)

PSP awards vesting in March 2018 (audited)
PSP awards granted in 2015 and maturing in March 2018 will not vest on the EPS and EP performance measures for the three financial 
years to 31 December 2017, in respect of two-thirds of the total award. However, based on the interim TSR performance results provided 
by Aon as at 31 December 2017, for the TSR performance period to 5 March 2018, part of the award (up to a maximum of one-third) may 
vest on the TSR measure in March 2018 (see tables below). Full details of all performance conditions are set out on page 76.

The three-year period over which the TSR performance condition is measured ends on 5 March 2018. Based on the interim TSR 
performance results prepared by Aon as at 31 December 2017, TSR relative to the FTSE 250 index (excluding Investment Trusts and the 
Company) ranked above median at 27.8% resulting in an estimated vesting of 25.7% for this element of the 2015 PSP awards.

Vested awards are satisfied in shares (normally treasury shares) with sufficient shares being sold to meet income tax and national insurance 
contributions due on exercise, at the Director's discretion, and the net balance of shares transferred to the individual. Awards lapse if they 
do not vest on the third anniversary of their award.
E. Retirement benefits (audited)
The Executive Directors are entitled to a defined contribution pension contribution of 25% of base salary. In light of the pension lifetime 
allowance of £1 million and the maximum annual pension contribution allowance of £40,000, the Executive Directors are entitled, at their 
option, to a taxable salary supplement in lieu of some or all of such pension contributions. Both Executive Directors have chosen this option 
and each receives a 25% cash payment in lieu of participation in a Spectris pension scheme. No Executive Director participated in a defined 
benefit pension plan during the year, nor currently participates in a defined benefit plan. 
F. All-employee share plans (audited)
Options granted to John O’Higgins on 18 September 2014 under the Spectris Savings Related Share Option Scheme (‘SAYE Scheme’) 
vested on 1 December 2017 and were exercised to acquire 446 ordinary shares at an option price of 2,015 pence per share giving a total 
exercise value of £8,986.90. The option price was set at the time of grant based on the closing mid-market price of the Company’s shares 
on 20 August 2014, being the last business day prior to the grant date. Although the SAYE Scheme rules permit the option price to be 
discounted up to a maximum of 20% of the market price at the time of grant, no discount was applied to the option price. The exercise 
price therefore reflects fair value as at the date of grant. The closing market price on 1 December 2017 was 2,442 pence per share 
producing a total gain on exercise of £1,904.42.
Payments for loss of office or to past Directors (audited)
No compensation payments on termination of employment were made to Directors during the year and no payments were made to 
former Directors.

Percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive
The table below shows the percentage change in the salary, benefits and annual bonus of the Chief Executive compared with the change 
in the Executive team (excluding the Chief Executive) and in the Group’s UK-based employees between the year ended 31 December 2016 
and 31 December 2017. The Committee has selected this comparator group on the basis that the Chief Executive is UK-based and this 
provides a local market reference and a sufficiently large comparator group based on a similar incentive structure to the Chief Executive, 
and reduces any distortion arising from currency and cost of living differences in other geographies in which Spectris operates.

distributions to shareholders by way of dividend payments between the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017. Total 
employee pay is the total pay costs for all Group employees. Adjusted profit before tax has been used as a comparison as this is a key 
financial metric which the Board considers when assessing the Group’s financial performance.

Directors' shareholding requirements
Each Executive Director is, subject to personal circumstances, required to build a retained shareholding in Spectris plc of at least three times 
base salary in value and is required to apply the post-tax benefit of any vested PSP awards or any bonus payments exceeding 60% of base 
salary to the acquisition of shares until this required level of shareholding is achieved. Both Executive Directors currently have holdings in 
excess of this requirement. There is no such requirement in respect of the Chairman or Non-executive Directors, who have discretion as to 
whether to hold the Company’s shares or not.

Notes to the interests in share plans table:
Savings Related Share Option Scheme (‘SAYE Scheme’)
1. The Spectris Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2007 expired on 25 May 2017 and was replaced by a new SAYE scheme, on substantially the same terms, 
on 26 May 2017. This Scheme is a HMRC tax-favoured savings-related share option scheme open to all employees.
2. No performance conditions attached to SAYE options other than continuous service. No grants were made under the SAYE Scheme during 2017.
3. The face value of SAYE awards is calculated using the exercise price. The option exercise price was set at the time of grant based on the closing mid-market share 
price on the day immediately before the invitation date. Although the SAYE Scheme rules permit the option price to be discounted up to a maximum of 20% of the 
market price at the time of grant, no such discount was applied to the option price.
Performance Share Plan ('PSP')
4. Shareholders approved a three-year extension to the Spectris Performance Share Plan 2006 in 2014 and a further extension in 2017 for ten years.
5. The PSP awards are conditional rights to acquire shares and are nominal cost options. The exercise price is the nominal value of a Spectris ordinary share, which 
is 5 pence.
6. The level of PSP awards granted in 2016 and 2017 was 200% of base salary, calculated using the relevant market value at the date of the award, which was: 
(i) 1,713.6 pence per share for 2016, based on the average of the mid-market closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares over the five business days prior to the 
date of grant. The number of shares awarded were rounded down to the nearest ten shares; and 
(ii) 2,630.8 pence per share for 2017, based on the average of the mid-market closing share price over the five days commencing with the day of the AGM (26 May 
2017). The number of shares awarded were rounded down to the nearest ten shares. The face value of the PSP awards is calculated using the average five-day 
closing mid-market price at date of award (as explained in (i) above).
7. PSP awards to the Executive Directors are currently structured so that one-third of the award is subject to an EPS target, one-third is subject to a TSR target and 
one-third is subject to an Economic Profit (‘EP’) target. Each condition operates over a fixed three-year period (being the three financial years commencing with the 
financial year in which an award is made in respect of the EPS and EP conditions; and three years from the date of grant in respect of the TSR condition) with no 
opportunity for re-testing.
8. PSP awards granted in 2017 are subject to an additional two-year holding period following the initial three-year vesting period.
9. Under the terms of the PSP, notional dividends of the Company are applied at vesting over award shares during the period until vesting (and for any applicable 
holding period until exercise) thereby increasing the number of award shares granted. These additional award shares are subject to application of the performance 
criteria attaching to the award.
75 Spectris plc PSP performance conditions
The performance criteria for the awards granted in 2017 are summarised as follows:

Economic profit is defined as adjusted operating profit (pre-tax and interest) less capital employed x the Company’s weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’). WACC 
was set at 11% for the 2015, 2016 and 2017 awards except that lower transitional rates will be applied for subsequent acquisitions. Any impairment of goodwill over a 
performance period will be added back to capital employed. The TSR performance condition is measured independently by Aon Hewitt. The EPS figure is obtained from 
the audited Financial Statements and the calculation of achievement against growth condition is presented to and approved by the Committee. The Committee will also 
monitor outcomes for the EP measure to ensure that they achieve the original objectives and may adjust the vesting accordingly. Any exercise of discretion will be 
justified in the next Directors’ Remuneration Report. Similarly, the Committee must satisfy itself that the Company’s relative TSR performance is reflective of its underlying 
financial performance.

Governance Dilution limits
In line with best practice, the use of new or treasury shares to satisfy the vesting of awards made under all of the Company’s share plans 
(PSP and SAYE combined) is restricted to 10% in any ten-year rolling period. A further restriction applies to the PSP plan of 5% over the 
same period of which 3.98% has been utilised.

Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment
The Executive Directors have rolling contracts subject to 12 months’ notice of termination by either party, or to summary notice in the 
event of serious breach of the Director’s obligations, dishonesty, serious misconduct or other conduct bringing the Company into 
disrepute.
The contracts of employment in respect of John O’Higgins and Clive Watson contain an option, at the sole discretion of the Board, for the 
contract to be terminated by way of payments in lieu of notice equivalent to 1.4 times monthly base salary for the outstanding months of 
the notice period. Such payment accounts for: the 25% employer pension contribution; company car, insurance and fuel benefits; mobile 
telephone provision; life, disability and medical expenses insurances; and settlement of any statutory employment claims that may arise 
upon termination, but excludes any element of compensation for loss of bonus and is in full and final settlement of all employment-related 
claims.
All letters of appointment in respect of the Non-executive Directors are renewable at each AGM, subject to review prior to proposal for 
re-election, and provide for a notice period of six months. Ordinarily, appointments do not continue beyond nine years after first election, 
at which time Non-executive Directors cease to be presumed independent under the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out on pages 92 to 155.  
Adjusted operating profit for the year amounts to £223.5 million 
(2016: £200.8 million). 
An interim dividend of 19.0 pence per share was paid on 10 
November 2017 in respect of the half year ended 30 June 2017. 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 37.5 pence per 
share, making the total dividend for the year of 56.5 pence per 
share (2016: 52.0 pence per share). Dividend details are given in 
Note 10 to the Financial Statements. Subject to approval of 
shareholders at the 2018 Annual General Meeting, the final 
dividend will be paid on 29 June 2018 to those shareholders on the 
register at 25 May 2018.
Articles of Association (‘Articles’)
The Company’s Articles contain specific provisions and restrictions 
regarding the Company’s power to borrow money. Powers relating 
to pre-emptive rights; the allotment of shares; and share buy-backs 
of the Company’s shares are also included in the Articles and such 
authorities are renewed by shareholders each year at the Annual 
General Meeting. The Articles also give power to the Board to 
appoint and remove Directors and require Directors to submit 
themselves for election at the first Annual General Meeting 
following their appointment and for annual re-election at 
subsequent AGMs. The Articles may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders. The Company’s Articles are available 
on the Company’s website: www.spectris.com.
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’)
The AGM will be held at 12.30pm on Friday 25 May 2018 at Great 
Fosters, Stroude Road, Egham, Surrey TW20 9UR. The notice of the 
AGM accompanies this Annual Report.
Auditor’s re-appointment and remuneration 
In accordance with section 489 of the Companies Act, a resolution 
for the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Company’s auditor is 
to be proposed at the forthcoming 2018 AGM. A further resolution 
is to be proposed at that meeting to authorise the Directors to 
agree the remuneration of the auditor.
Branches
Spectris Group, through various subsidiaries, has established 
branches in a number of different countries in which the  
business operates.
Change in control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Group following a 
takeover, such as bank loan agreements and Company share  
plans. None of these are deemed to be significant in terms of their 
potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole. It is also 
possible that funding arrangements for the Group’s defined benefit 
pension arrangements would need to be enhanced following  
a change of control if that resulted in a weakening of the  
employer covenant. 
The Company does not have any agreements with any Director that 
would provide for enhanced compensation for loss of office or 
employment following a takeover bid.
Directors
Details of the Directors who served, were appointed and who 
retired during the year are set out on pages 50 to 51 other than Dr 
John Hughes who retired from the Board on 26 May 2017. 
Directors are appointed and replaced in accordance with the 
Articles, Companies Act, and the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2016. The powers of the Directors are set out in the Articles and 
the Companies Act.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Board has an established process to review at least annually, 
and, if appropriate, authorise conflict or potential conflict of 
interests. Any transactional conflicts are reviewed as they arise. 
Directors are asked to review and confirm reported conflicts of 
interest as part of the year-end process.
Directors’ remuneration and interests
Details of Directors’ remuneration and their interest in the 
Company’s shares can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 64 to 78. 
Directors’ and officers’ indemnities and 
insurance 
The Spectris Group maintains liability insurance for its Directors and 
officers. The Directors, Company Secretary and members of the 
Executive Committee have also been granted a third-party 
indemnity, under the Companies Act, which remains in force. 
Neither the Company’s indemnity nor insurance provides cover in 
the event that an indemnified individual is proved to have acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.

undertake a £100 million on-market share buy-back programme.

Note 27 to the Financial Statements on pages 135 to 136.
Going concern and viability statements
Having reviewed the Group’s plans and available financial facilities, 
the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at

reason it continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Group’s accounts. The Company’s Viability Statement can be

before the time fixed for a general meeting, will have one vote for 
every fully-paid share that they hold. Shareholders may cast votes

Governance Statement of Directors' responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
Directors' Remuneration Report and the Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Under the Companies Act, the Directors are required to prepare the 
Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS regulation and have 
also elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law, the Directors are required to prepare such 
Financial Statements for each financial year and must not approve 
the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent 
Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to:
 › select accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 › make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
 › for the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
 › for the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company Financial Statements; and 
 › prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Parent 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its Financial Statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 › the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; 
 › the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 47 and the Directors' Report 
on pages 48 to 83 include a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
 › the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
The Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report were approved by 
the Board on 19 February 2018.

Opinion on Financial Statements of Spectris plc 
In our opinion: 
› the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
› the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union; 
› the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
› the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The Financial Statements that we have audited comprise: 
› the Consolidated Income Statement; 
› the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income; 
› the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement of Financial Position; 
› the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows; 
› the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity; and 
› the related Notes 1 to 50. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the Parent Company Financial Statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘ISAs (UK)’) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.  
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the Financial Statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Summary of our audit approach 
Key audit matters 
 
The key risks that we identified in the current year were: 
› Impairment of the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in four of the Group’s  
cash-generating units; 
› Override in the application of the Group inventory provision accounting policy for obsolete, excess and 
slow-moving inventory items; and 
› Accuracy of provisions for taxation in respect of dividends received from EU based companies. 
In addition, in the prior year the previous auditors identified acquisitions as a key audit matter. This has 
not been identified as a key audit matter in the current year as there were no significant acquisitions. 
Materiality 
 
The materiality that we used in the current year was £9.0 million which was determined on the basis of 
5% of expected adjusted profit before tax. 
Scoping 
 
Full scope audit work was completed on 68 reporting entities and specified audit procedures were 
undertaken on a further 28 reporting entities. Our full scope and specified audit procedures covered 
74% of Group revenue and 91% of Group profit before tax.

Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement 
Going concern 
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement on page 83 in the 
Financial Statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them 
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s 
and Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements. 
We are required to state whether we have anything material to

Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we 
identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in four of the Group’s cash-generating units 
Key audit matter 
description 
 
 Total goodwill and intangible assets at 31 December 2017 were £627.5 million and £209.9 million, respectively. 
We focused our impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets testing on four cash-generating units 
(‘CGUs’), being Omega (£231.7 million), Millbrook (£151.6 million), ESG (£14.6 million) and Servomex 
(£54.3 million), based on growth assumptions and levels of headroom. 
There is a risk surrounding the recoverability of these balances, as assessed annually by management as part of 
their goodwill impairment review using discounted cash flows on a value in use basis. 
The key judgements in assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are the discount rate, the 
long-term growth rate and the short-term projected cash flows. The value in use model is sensitive to changes in 
these estimates, all of which must reflect a long-term view of underlying growth in the respective economies 
within which these businesses operate and the reasonableness of projected cash flows. We have pinpointed this 
significant risk to the short-term future cash flows including the terminal value in the four CGUs above and 
material judgements contained therein. This is where the highest degree of sensitivity exists to determining the 
value in use. 
We note that estimating a value in use is inherently uncertain, and a range of assumptions can reasonably be 
applied in determining the estimates mentioned above. 
Note 1 to the Financial Statements sets out the Group’s accounting policy for testing goodwill for impairment. 
The basis for the impairment reviews is outlined in Note 12 to the Financial Statements, including details of the 
discount rate and long-term growth rate used. Note 12 to the Financial Statements also includes details of the 
extent to which the goodwill and other intangibles test is sensitive to changes in discount rates, long-term 
growth rates and short-term cash flow projections. 
How the scope of 
our audit responded 
to the risk 
 
 Our procedures for challenging management’s methodology and assumptions focused on the four  
cash-generating units discussed above and included: 
› validating the integrity of management’s impairment model through testing of the mechanical accuracy and 
verifying the application of the input assumptions; 
› understanding the underlying process used to determine the risk adjusted cash flow projections; 
› evaluating the process management undertook to prepare the cash flow forecasts in its impairment model 
including agreement with the latest Board approved plans and management approved forecasts; 
› challenging the cash flow projections through assessing the accuracy of historical budgeting by comparing 
them with actual performance and independent evidence to support any significant expected future changes 
to the business; 
› considered reasonable possible changes in assumptions to challenge the appropriateness of management’s 
assessment of reasonable possible change scenarios; and  
› our challenge was informed by input from certain of our internal valuation specialists, utilising their knowledge 
and expertise. 
Key observations 
 
 
 
 We determined that there is currently sufficient headroom for Omega, Millbrook, ESG and Servomex such that 
we concur with management that no impairment is required. We conclude that the assumptions applied in the 
impairment models, when taken in aggregate, are within our acceptable range.

Override in the application of the Group inventory provision accounting policy for obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory items 
Key audit matter 
description 
 
 As described in Note 1 (Accounting policies) and Note 14 (Inventory), the Group carries inventory at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. As at 31 December 2017, the Group held inventories of £176.0 million 
(2016: £187.8 million). 
Management has to apply judgement to assess the level of provision required to write down obsolete, excess 
and slow-moving inventory items to their net realisable value. The Group has an inventory provisioning policy 
and methodology for determining the level of required provision. The calculation of the inventory provision relies 
upon assumptions made in determining appropriate provisioning percentages based on estimates of future sales.
The Group accounting policy sets out criteria to apply in determining the level of inventory provision, with 
written dispensation required from the Group for any override of the policy. There is a significant risk of material 
misstatement or potential fraud in any override to the application of the Group accounting policy given the level 
of management judgement involved in determining whether an override should be recognised and how it 
should be measured. 
The Group’s accounting policy for the inventory provision is outlined in Note 1 to the Financial Statements. 
How the scope of 
our audit responded 
to the key audit 
matter 
 
 
 
 We obtained assurance over the appropriateness of any override of the Group inventory provisioning policy and 
methodology by: 
› considering the appropriateness of the Group’s inventory provisioning policy in the context of our 
understanding of the individual businesses in the Group; 
› identifying and understanding instances where the inventory provisioning policy had been overridden 
compared to that set out in the Group accounting manual; and 
› challenging the validity and accuracy of any override through consideration of actual and forecast sales, actual 
inventory write-offs and other sources of available evidence, including the ageing and nature of inventory.  
Key observations 
 
 
 
 Based on our procedures we confirm that instances of override in the application of the Group inventory 
provision accounting policy for obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory items are appropriate. 
   
Accuracy of provisions for taxation in respect of dividends received from EU-based companies 
Key audit matter 
description 
 
 Estimation is required in relation to the value of the tax provision recorded in respect of taxation on historical 
dividends received from EU-based companies. Accordingly, tax provisioning is included in Note 1 as one of the 
significant accounting estimates.  
As outlined in Note 9, the UK’s dividend taxation regime prior to July 2009 is the subject of long-running 
litigation between HMRC and taxpayers in relation to the tax charge on dividends received from EU-based 
companies. Similar to the prior year, as at 31 December 2017 this tax provision remains unchanged at  
£12.6 million based on the likely outcome of this dispute that certain dividends received from EU-based 
companies are relevant. 
The Audit Committee Report on page 59 refers to provision for uncertain tax exposures as a key estimate 
considered by the Audit Committee. The Group’s accounting policy for the provision is outlined in Note 1 to 
the Financial Statements. Note 1 also includes details of the key sources of estimation uncertainty in relation 
to taxation. 
How the scope of 
our audit responded 
to the key audit 
matter 
 
 We have reviewed the correspondence in respect of the ongoing litigation between HMRC and tax payers in 
relation to dividends received from EU-based companies and recalculated the £12.6 million provision based on 
existing tax law. 
We used our tax specialists to assist us in appraising the likely outcome of the litigation with HMRC based on 
their experience of working with the revenue authorities and reviewed correspondence with the authorities to 
challenge the reasonableness of the provision. Our tax specialist also considered management’s assessment of 
the risk inherent in tax positions taken and reasonably possible outcomes pending resolution of the litigation. 
Key observations 
 
 
 
 Based on the procedures performed, we consider that the overall tax provision in respect of dividends received 
from EU-based companies is reasonable. 
  
87 Spectris plc Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Spectris plc continued 
88 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the Financial Statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows: 
Group materiality 
 
Group materiality as £9.0 million (2016: £7.4 million). 
Company materiality as £3.6 million. 
Basis for determining 
materiality 
 
We have used 5% of expected adjusted profit before tax as the benchmark for determining materiality. 
In 2016, the previous auditors used 5% of Group profit before tax, adjusted for the impairment charge 
related to Omega Engineering and ESG. 
Company materiality was set at 40% of Group materiality and equates to 0.4% of the Company’s net 
assets. 
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied 
 
Adjusted profit before tax is a key performance measure for management, investors and the analyst 
community. This metric is important to the users of the Financial Statements (investors and analysts 
being the key users for a listed entity) because it portrays the performance of the business and hence its 
ability to pay a return on investment to the investors. Likewise this metric takes into account the 
acquisitive nature of the Group which results in adjusting items needing to be considered when 
determining the performance of the business. 
Net assets are considered to be an appropriate benchmark for the Company given that it is mainly a 
holding company. 
Materiality 
 
 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.45 million (2016: £0.40 
million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the 
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the Financial Statements. 
  
Adjusted PBT £218.4m
Group materiality £9m

An overview of the scope of our audit 
The Group operates in more than 30 countries spread across five continents with the largest footprint being in North America, Asia and 
Europe. Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group and component level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit 
scope primarily on the audit work at the four segments, managed via 12 operating companies located and controlled across different 
geographical regions, and the Group head office function. These 12 operating companies are comprised of many individual reporting 
entities or components, which are the lowest level at which management prepares financial information that is included in the Group 
Financial Statements. The parent Company is located in the UK and is audited directly by the Group audit team.  
We have considered components on the basis of their contribution to Group revenue and operating profit, as well as those that require 
local statutory audits in their jurisdiction. Full scope audit work was completed on 68 reporting entities and specified audit procedures were 
done on a further 28 reporting entities. Our full scope and specified audit procedures covered 74% of total Group revenue and 91% of 
Group profit before tax. In the prior year, the previous auditors’ procedures covered 75% of total Group revenue and 87% of Group profit 
before tax. 
Each component in scope was subject to an audit materiality level between £3.0 million and £3.6 million. The audit work on all components 
was performed by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited member firms under the direction and supervision of the Group audit team. Further 
work was performed at a Group level over the consolidation and components not in scope.  
We communicated the results of our risk assessment exercise to the component auditors and instructed them on the areas of significant risk, 
the procedures to be performed and the form and timing of their reporting to us. We also provided direction on enquiries made by the 
component auditors through online and telephone conversations. All the findings noted were discussed with the component auditor in 
detail and further procedures to be performed were issued where relevant. 
The Group audit team followed a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that on a rotational basis the Senior Statutory 
Auditor or a senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the primary operating companies where the Group audit scope was 
focused in addition to the work performed at the Group head office. In relation to the current year audit, the Senior Statutory Auditor 
and/or a senior member of the audit team visited South Korea, China, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, USA, Canada and 
various locations in the UK. The visits were structured at different stages of the audit and the key components in the UK, USA, China and 
South Korea were visited during the local audit close meetings. 
Other information   
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the annual Report, other than the Financial Statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon. 
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, except to the 
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the Financial Statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that: 
› Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the 
annual Report and Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the 
audit; or 
› Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or 
› Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the 
Directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in 
accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
 We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.

Responsibilities of Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial 
Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. 
Use of our report 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006. 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
› the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements; and 
› the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception   
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
› we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
› adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
› the Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns. 
 We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are also required to report if in our opinion certain 
disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
 We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.

Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 
Spectris plc 97 
1. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation 
Basis of accounting 
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for items that are required by IFRS to be 
measured at fair value, principally certain financial instruments. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and interpretations issued by the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB, as adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’), and in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
The Financial Statements set out on pages 92 to 155 have been prepared using consistent accounting policies, except for the adoption of 
new accounting standards and interpretations noted below. No revisions to adopted IFRS that became applicable in 2017 had a significant 
impact on the Group Financial Statements. 
These Financial Statements are presented in millions of Sterling rounded to the nearest one decimal place. 
Basis of consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements set out the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2017 and the Group’s financial 
performance for the year ended 31 December 2017, which incorporate the Financial Statements of Spectris plc and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Associates 
and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. 
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and financial position, are set out 
in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 47. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial Review on pages 28 to 32. In addition, Note 27 to the Financial Statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s net debt balance at 31 December 2017 was £50.5m (2016: £150.9m), with available undrawn committed borrowing facilities 
of £406.5m (2016: £406.0m). 
The Board has reviewed sensitivity analysis on the Group’s forecasts to 30 June 2019, the maturity profile of its financial facilities and 
liabilities (Notes 17 and 28) and the ability of the Group to re-finance these obligations as they fall due. The principal liquidity risk is 
mitigated through its financial risk management policies (Note 27). For the foreseeable future, the Board has a high level of confidence that 
the Group will have the necessary liquid resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due and will be able to sustain its business model, strategy 
and operations and remain solvent, including the impact of reasonably possible adverse scenarios. For this reason, it continues to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Group Financial Statements. There are no key sensitivities identified in relation to this conclusion. 
Further information on the going concern of the Group can be found on page 39 in the Viability Statement.  
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
There are a number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are not yet effective for the year ended  
31 December 2017 which, therefore, have not been applied in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements: 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
Transition to IFRS 9 for the Group will take effect from 1 January 2018 with the half-year results for June 2018 being IFRS 9 compliant, 
and the first Annual Report published in accordance with IFRS 9 being for the year ended 31 December 2018. There is no requirement to 
restate comparatives. 
IFRS 9 provides a new impairment model for financial assets, which requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected 
credit losses rather than incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39. This requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of 
its trade receivables, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. The Group will apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses 
on all trade receivables.  
Overall, the Group expects no material impact on its statement of financial position and equity from applying the impairment requirements 
of IFRS 9. 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' using the modified retrospective approach, which means that the 
cumulative impact on adoption will be recognised in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 with the half-year results for June 2018 being 
IFRS 15 compliant, and the first Annual Report published in accordance with IFRS 15 being for the year ended 31 December 2018. 
Comparatives will not be restated. IFRS 15 provides a single, principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts, based on 
the transfer of control of goods and services to customers, and it replaces the separate model for goods and services of IAS 18 ‘Revenue’.  
  
97 Spectris plc Notes to the Accounts continued 
98 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Management carried out a comprehensive impact assessment which included scoping the Group’s revenues to identify different revenue 
streams and performing sample contract reviews to determine the appropriate revenue recognition treatment under IFRS 15. To ensure a 
consistent approach across the Group, the exercise was supported centrally through setting the approach to transition and providing the 
appropriate tools and guidance. Revenue is derived from a single performance obligation which is either the sale of goods or the provision 
of services. 
Under IFRS 15, revenue from the sale of goods, where the goods are not required to be installed, will continue to be recognised when legal 
title transfers to the customer on delivery.  
When the sale of goods is combined with installation, revenue recognition depends upon the nature of the installation. Simple installations 
are those which the customer perceives as a separate obligation within the overall contract to deliver goods, whereas complex installations 
are those for which the installation is an integral part of the delivery of the goods. Revenue will be recognised for simple installations 
separately from the delivery of goods, and only when the installation has occurred. For complex installations, revenue recognition on the 
delivery of the goods will be deferred until installation is complete.  
Revenue from the provision of services, including ongoing support, servicing and maintenance, will continue to be recognised in line with 
the delivery of the service. 
For contracts which combine sale of goods and provision of services, the contract’s revenue will continue to be allocated across the 
individual components in line with the relative value and accounted for as described above. 
The overall impact on transition on 1 January 2018 for the Group is expected to be as follows: 
Segment 
Decrease in  
retained 
earnings 
£m 
Increase in

£m 
Materials Analysis (22.6) 30.8
Test and Measurement – –
In-line Instrumentation (0.3) 0.7
Industrial Controls – 0.1
Group (22.9) 31.6
If the Group had applied IFRS 15 from 1 January 2017, the impact on reported revenue for 2017 would have been a decrease of £7.1m 
(0.5%). The adoption of IFRS 15 will also have an impact on the phasing of revenue between the first and second halves of the year with an 
increase in revenue recognised in the first half of the year driven by later recognition of revenues from the peak sales month of December to 
January under IFRS 15. 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’  
Transition to IFRS 16 for the Group will take effect from 1 January 2019 with the half-year results for June 2019 being IFRS 16 compliant, 
with the first Annual Report published in accordance with IFRS 16 being for the year ended 31 December 2019. IFRS 16 provides a single 
model for lessees which recognises a right of use asset and lease liability for all leases which are longer than one year or which are not 
classified as low value. The impact of IFRS 16 will be to recognise a lease liability and a corresponding asset in the Statement of Financial 
Position for leases currently classified as operating leases. The most significant impact will be that the Group’s land, building and car leases 
will be recognised on the balance sheet. Further assessment of other leases is ongoing. The Group’s future lease commitments for 
land, building and car leases as at 31 December 2017, which provides an indicator of the value to be recognised on the balance sheet, 
was £66.4m. 
There are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or 
future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.  
Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often required where the choice of specific policy, assumption or 
accounting estimate to be followed could materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, should it later be 
determined that a different choice be more appropriate. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based 
on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
In the course of preparing these Financial Statements in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, no judgements that have 
a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements have been made, other than those involving estimation. 
Management considers the following to be key areas of estimation uncertainty for the Group due to the possibility of material change in the 
next year. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
i) Taxation 
The Group operates in a number of countries and is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant estimation is required in 
determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment is often by its nature complex, and cannot be finally determined until a formal 
resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority which may take several years to conclude. Amounts provided are accrued based 
on management’s interpretation of country-specific tax laws and the likelihood of settlement. Actual liabilities could differ from the amount 
provided which could have a consequent adverse impact on the results and net position of the Group. The assumptions and estimates 
which have been applied in the determination of taxation are detailed in Note 9. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of 
taxation are set out on page 100.  
98 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Spectris plc 99 
ii) Retirement benefit plans 
Accounting for retirement benefit plans under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with 
actuarial assumptions. The discount rate and rate of retail price inflation (‘RPI’) assumptions applied in the calculation of plan liabilities, which 
are set out in Note 20, represent a key source of estimation uncertainty for the Group. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect 
of retirement benefit plans are set out on page 102. 
b) Summary of significant accounting policies 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by Group entities to all years presented in these Financial Statements. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration for the interests in subsidiary undertakings over the net fair 
value to the Group of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Where the fair value of the Group’s share of 
identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration, the difference is recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. Contingent consideration is initially recognised as a liability with changes to estimates of contingent consideration 
reflected in operating profit unless they occur during the 12-month measurement period, in which situation the amount of goodwill 
recognised on the acquisition is adjusted. Adjustments to contingent consideration are treated as an adjusting item for the purposes of 
alternative performance measures (see Note 2). 
Transaction costs on a business combination are expensed as incurred in the Consolidated Income Statement and treated as an adjusting 
item for the purposes of alternative performance measures (see Note 2). 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is not amortised, and any impairment losses are 
not subsequently reversed. The net book value of goodwill at the date of transition to IFRS has been treated as deemed cost. On the 
subsequent disposal or discontinuance of a previously acquired business, the relevant goodwill is dealt with in the Consolidated Income 
Statement except for the goodwill already charged to reserves. From 1 January 2004, goodwill is allocated on acquisition to cash-generating 
units that are anticipated to benefit from the combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment by assessing the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates and comparing it against the net book value. This estimate of recoverable amount is 
determined annually and additionally when there is an indication that a cash-generating unit may be impaired. The Group’s identified cash-
generating units are smaller than the reportable operating segments in Note 3. 
The estimate of recoverable amount requires significant assumptions to be made and is based on a number of factors such as the near-term 
business outlook for the cash-generating unit, including both its operating profit and operating cash flow performance. Where the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the 
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss 
on disposal. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained. 
Intangible assets and amortisation 
The cost of acquiring software (including associated implementation costs where applicable) that is not specific to an item of property, plant 
and equipment is classified as an intangible asset. 
Self-funded research and development costs are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they are incurred 
unless development expenditure meets certain strict criteria for capitalisation. These criteria include demonstration of the technical feasibility 
and intent of completing a new intangible asset that will be available for sale and that the asset will generate probable future economic 
benefits. From the point where expenditure meets the criteria, development costs are capitalised and amortised over the useful economic 
lives of the assets to which they relate. The Directors consider that, due to the nature of projects undertaken, the proportion of development 
costs incurred that meets the criteria for capitalisation is immaterial. 
Intangible assets arising from a business combination that are separable from goodwill are recognised initially at fair value at the date of 
acquisition. Other acquired intangible assets (including software not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment) are initially 
recognised at cost (plus any associated implementation costs where applicable). 
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits, otherwise it is expensed as incurred. 
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over 
the shorter of the estimated useful economic life (determined on an asset-by-asset basis) or underlying contractual life. The estimated useful 
lives are as follows: 
› Software – 3 to 5 years. 
› Patents, contractual rights and technology – up to 10 years, dependent upon the nature of the underlying contractual right. 
› Customer-related and trade names – 3 to 20 years, dependent upon the underlying contractual arrangements and specific circumstances 
such as customer retention experience. 
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost comprises the purchase price 
paid and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use. Tangible assets arising from a business 
combination are recognised initially at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
  
99 Spectris plc Notes to the Accounts continued 
100 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Depreciation is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual 
value (which is reviewed annually), of property, plant and equipment over its estimated useful economic life. Depreciation commences on 
the date the assets are available for use within the business and the asset carrying values are reviewed for impairment when there is an 
indication that they may be impaired. The depreciation charge is revised where useful lives are different from those previously estimated, or 
where technically obsolete assets are required to be written down. Where parts of an item of plant and equipment have separate lives, they 
are accounted for and depreciated as separate items. Land is not depreciated. Estimated useful lives are as follows: 
› Freehold and long leasehold property and automotive testing tracks – 20 to 40 years.  
› Short leasehold property – over the period of the lease.  
› Plant and equipment – 3 to 20 years. 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets that take a substantial period of time 
to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. 
Inventories 
Inventories and work in progress are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventory acquired as part of business 
combinations is valued at fair value less cost to sell. Cost represents direct costs incurred and, where appropriate, production or conversion 
costs and other costs to bring the inventory to its existing location and condition. In the case of manufacturing inventory and work in 
progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. Inventory is accounted for on a 
first-in, first-out basis or, in some cases, a weighted-average basis, if deemed more appropriate for the business. Provisions are made to write 
down slow-moving, excess and obsolete items to net realisable value, based on an assessment of technological and market developments 
and on an analysis of historical and projected usage with regard to quantities on hand. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount (which is considered a reasonable proxy for fair value) and are subsequently held at 
amortised cost less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the transactions. The amount of the provision is 
the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the present value of expected cash flows 
receivable. The movement in the provision is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits held on call or with maturities of less than three 
months at inception. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash equivalents for the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
Assets and liabilities held for sale 
Assets, liabilities and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Assets, liabilities and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal 
group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition and when management is committed to the sale which is expected to qualify 
for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are recognised at the amounts expected to be paid to counterparties and subsequently held at amortised cost. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably measured, will be required to settle the 
obligation. In respect of warranties, a provision is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold. Provisions are recognised at 
an amount equal to the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s liability. A contingent liability is disclosed where the 
existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with 
reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefit is probable. Obligations 
arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that 
such a plan will be carried out. 
Leasing 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term. 
Taxation 
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case tax is 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, respectively.  
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement 
of financial position date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years. Tax positions are reviewed to assess whether a 
provision should be made based on prevailing circumstances. Tax provisions are included within Current taxation payable.  
100 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Spectris plc 101 
Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial 
Statements and their corresponding tax bases. No provision is made for deferred tax which would become payable on the distribution of 
retained profits by overseas subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates expected to apply when 
the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date. 
Deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related 
transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of intra-group dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend. 
Foreign currency translation 
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined with reference to the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the statement of financial position date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions are determined using 
the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, and are 
charged/credited to the Consolidated Income Statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
On consolidation, the Income Statement items of subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange. Statement of 
Financial Position items are translated into Sterling at year-end exchange rates. Exchange differences on the retranslation are taken to the 
translation reserve within equity. Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings designated as a hedge of the net investment in a 
foreign operation are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. All other exchange differences are charged or 
credited to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they arise. On disposal of an overseas subsidiary, any cumulative 
exchange movements relating to that subsidiary held in the translation reserve are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Derivative financial instruments may be purchased to hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. The accounting 
policies applied in these circumstances are described below. 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are measured at amortised cost with any difference between cost and 
redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective-interest basis. 
Financial instruments 
Recognition 
The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when it becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously. 
Measurement 
When financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value, being the consideration given or received 
plus directly attributable transaction costs. In determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted bid prices on the trade 
date. When quoted prices on an active market are not available, fair value is determined by reference to price quotations for similar 
instruments traded. 
Originated loans and receivables are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently re-measured at 
amortised cost using the effective-interest method. Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge risks associated with foreign exchange 
fluctuations. These are designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various 
hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Amounts deferred in equity are reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement, in the same line of the Consolidated Income Statement as the recognised hedged item. However, when 
the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses 
previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. 
101 Spectris plc Notes to the Accounts continued 
102 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
1. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains 
in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. 
Derecognition 
A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset. This occurs 
when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged, cancelled or expired. Originated loans and receivables are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Group. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a 
financial asset, or group of financial assets, is impaired. A financial asset, or group of financial assets, is deemed to be impaired if, and only 
if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an 
incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets 
that can be reliably estimated. 
Net investment hedge accounting 
The Group uses Euro-denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Group’s net investment in overseas 
companies. To the extent that the hedge is effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies, caused by changes 
in foreign exchange rates, the changes in the value of the borrowings are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. 
Employee benefits 
The Group operates defined benefit post-retirement plans and defined contribution pension plans. 
Defined benefit plans 
The Group’s net obligation recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated 
separately for each plan as the present value of the plan’s liabilities less the fair value of the plan’s assets. The operating and financing costs 
of defined benefit plans are recognised separately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Operating costs comprise the current service cost, 
plan administrative expense, any gains or losses on settlement or curtailments, and past service costs where benefits have vested. Finance 
items comprise the unwinding of the discount on the net asset surplus/deficit. Actuarial gains or losses comprising changes in plans’ liabilities 
due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The amount of any pension fund asset recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is limited to any future refunds from 
the plan or the present value of reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
Defined contribution plans 
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will 
have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. 
In certain countries, the Group participates in industry-wide defined benefit-type pension arrangements. In such circumstances, it is 
not possible to determine the amount of any surplus or deficit attributable to the Group and the pension costs are accounted for as if 
the arrangements were defined contribution plans. These are not material to the Group and, accordingly, no additional disclosures 
are provided. 
Short-term benefits 
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. 
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can 
be estimated reliably. 
Share-based payments 
Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees 
render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions). The cost of equity-settled transactions with 
employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting 
conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at 
each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect 
the actual outcome of awards which have vested. No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are 
forfeited or not exercised. 
Where it is not possible to incentivise managers of the Group’s operating companies with equity-settled options, they are issued with cash-
settled options. The charge for these awards is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual levels of options that vest and the fair value is 
based on either the share price at date of exercise or the share price at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date if sooner.

Own shares 
Own equity instruments which are re-acquired (own shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference 
between the carrying amount and the consideration paid to acquire such equity instruments is recognised within equity. 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders. 
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in 
the normal course of business to external customers net of returns and discounts, excluding value added tax and other sales-related taxes.  
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
of the goods have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the costs and possible return of goods can 
be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably. This is typically on delivery when legal title transfers to the customer. If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the 
amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised. 
For contracts that involve a significant element of installation or testing of equipment, revenue is recognised at the point of 
customer acceptance.  
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in proportion to the measurement of the stage of 
completion of services rendered as at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date. This is assessed by reference to the amount 
of time incurred in proportion to the total expected time to be taken to deliver the service. 
Occasionally, the initial contract covers both the supply of goods and ongoing support, servicing and maintenance. For such contracts 
revenue is allocated across each of the individual components in line with their relative value and each element is accounted for as 
described above. 
Interest payable and receivable 
Interest payable comprises the interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest method and the unwinding of the 
discount factor on deferred or contingent consideration. Interest receivable comprises interest income on cash and invested funds and is 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as it accrues.  
2. Alternative performance measures 
Policy 
Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under IFRS, as management believe these 
measures enable management and stakeholders to assess the underlying trading performance of the businesses as they exclude certain 
non-operational items, foreign exchange movements and the impact of acquisitions and disposals. 
The adjusted performance measures (‘APMs’) are consistent with how the businesses performance is planned and reported within the 
internal management reporting to the Board and Operating Committees. Some of these measures are used for the purpose of setting 
remuneration targets. The key APMs that the Group uses include like-for-like (‘LFL’) organic performance measures and Adjusted measures 
for the income statement together with adjusted financial position and cash flow measures. Explanations of how they are calculated and 
how they are reconciled to an IFRS statutory measure are set out below. 
Adjusted measures 
The Group’s policy is to exclude items that are considered to be significant in nature and/or quantum and where treatment as an  
adjusted item provides stakeholders with additional useful information to assess the period-on-period trading performance of the Group. 
On this basis, adjusted figures exclude certain non-operational items that are predominantly acquisition- or disposal-related items which 
management have defined as: 
› Amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related goodwill and other intangible assets; 
› Bargain purchase on acquisition; 
› Depreciation of acquisition-related fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment; 
› Acquisition-related costs, deferred and contingent consideration fair value adjustments; 
› Profits or losses on termination or disposal of businesses; 
› Unwinding of the discount factor on deferred and contingent consideration; 
› Unrealised changes in the fair value of financial instruments; 
› Gains or losses on retranslation of short-term inter-company loan balances; and 
› Related tax effects on the above and other tax items which do not form part of the underlying tax rate (see Note 9).

2. Alternative performance measures continued 
LFL measures 
The Board reviews and compares current and prior year segmental sales and adjusted profit at constant exchange rates and excludes the 
impact of acquisitions and disposals during the year. In addition, Project Uplift programme implementation costs are excluded from adjusted 
profit to better reflect year-on-year operating performance. 
The constant exchange rate comparison uses the current year reported segmental information, stated in each operating entity’s functional 
currency, and translates the results into its presentation currency using the prior year's monthly exchange rates, irrespective of the underlying 
transactional currency. 
Within the In-line Instrumentation segment, the BTG business has large functional currency mismatches against its underlying transaction 
currencies which distort LFL comparison at times of significant currency movements. Accordingly, we have modified the basis on which 
BTG’s LFL results are translated into Sterling by using the actual underlying transaction currency mix for determining transactional 
gains/losses to provide more accurate and reliable information on BTG’s underlying performance. 
The incremental impact of business acquisitions is excluded for the first 12 months of ownership from the month of purchase. For business 
disposals, comparative figures for segmental sales and adjusted operating profit are adjusted to reflect the comparable periods of 
ownership. The Microscan business was disposed of on 2 October 2017 and the segmental sales and adjusted profit for 2016 exclude  
the trading results of the last three months of 2016. 
The LFL measure is presented as a means of eliminating the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the period-on-period reported results as 
well as allowing the Board to assess the underlying trading performance of the businesses on a LFL basis for both sales and operating profit. 
Based on the above policy, the adjusted performance measures are derived from the reported figures as follows:

Net acquisition-related costs and fair value adjustments comprise acquisition costs of £3.4m (2016: £4.5m) that have been recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement under IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’ and other fair value adjustments relating to deferred and 
contingent consideration comprising of a credit of £3.0m (2016: debit of £5.6m). Net acquisition-related costs and fair value adjustments 
are included within administrative expenses. Acquisition-related costs have been excluded from the adjusted operating profit and acquisition 
costs paid of £2.8m (2016: £5.4m) have been excluded from the adjusted operating cash flow.

3. Operating segments 
The Group has four reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group's strategic business units. These units offer different 
applications, assist companies at various stages of the production cycle and are focused on specific industries. These segments reflect the 
internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (considered to be the Board) on a regular basis to assist in making 
decisions on capital allocated to each segment and to assess performance. The segment results include an allocation of head office 
expenses. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments:  
› Materials Analysis provides products and services that enable customers to determine structure, composition, quantity and quality of 
particles and materials during their research and product development processes, when assessing materials before production, or during 
the manufacturing process. The operating companies in this segment are Malvern Panalytical and Particle Measuring Systems. 
› Test and Measurement supplies test, measurement and analysis equipment, software and services for product design optimisation and 
validation, manufacturing control, microseismic monitoring and environmental noise monitoring. The operating companies in this 
segment are Brüel & Kjær Sound & Vibration, ESG Solutions, HBM and Millbrook. 
› In-line Instrumentation provides process analytical measurement, asset monitoring and online controls as well as associated consumables 
and services for both primary processing and the converting industries. The operating companies in this segment are Brüel & Kjær Vibro, 
BTG, NDC Technologies and Servomex. 
› Industrial Controls provides products and solutions that measure, monitor, control, inform and connect during the production process. 
The operating companies in this segment are Microscan (disposed 2 October 2017), Omega Engineering and Red Lion Controls. 
Further details of the nature of these segments and the products and services they provide are contained in the Strategic Report on pages 
20 to 27.

The standard rate of corporation tax for the year, based on the weighted average of tax rates applied to the Group’s profits, is 28.6% 
(2016: -13.8%). The tax charge for the year is lower (2016: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax largely due to profits arising in 
the US (a higher tax jurisdiction) from the sale of Microscan in 2017, charges arising in the US from the impairment of goodwill and other 
acquisition-related intangible assets in 2016 and for other reasons as set out in the following reconciliation.

Factors that may affect the future tax charge 
The Group's tax charge in future years is likely to be affected by the proportion of profits arising, and the effective tax rates, in the various 
territories in which the Group operates, as well as changes in the tax law affecting future periods, such as the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Management judgement is applied to determine the level of provisions required in respect of both direct and indirect taxes. The Group is 
potentially subject to tax audits in many jurisdictions. By their nature these are often complex and could take a significant period of time to 
be agreed with the tax authorities. Judgement is therefore applied based on the interpretation of country-specific tax legislation and the 
likelihood of settlement. The Group estimates and accrues taxes that will ultimately be payable when reviews or audits by tax authorities of 
tax returns are completed. These estimates include judgements about the position expected to be taken by each tax authority. 
The Group applies judgement in respect of possible tax audit adjustments primarily in respect of transfer pricing as well as in respect of 
financing arrangements and tax credits and incentives. In respect of transfer pricing, the level of provision is determined by reference to 
management judgements of the adjustments that would arise in the event that certain intra-group transactions are successfully challenged 
as not being at arm’s length. 
Management estimates of the level of risk arising from tax audit may change in the next year as a result of changes in legislation or tax 
authority practice or correspondence with tax authorities during a specific tax audit. It is not possible to quantify the impact that such 
future developments may have on the Group’s tax positions. Actual outcomes and settlements may differ significantly from the estimates 
recorded in these Consolidated Financial Statements. Further detail is provided below in relation to tax provisions that are known to be 
potentially material. 
Judgement is also applied relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets which are dependent on an assessment of the generation of 
future taxable income in the countries concerned in which temporary differences become deductible or in which tax losses can be utilised. 
These estimates may change in the next year if there are changes in the forecast profitability of the relevant company. 
The UK’s dividend taxation regime prior to July 2009 is the subject of long-running litigation between HMRC and other taxpayers in relation 
to the tax charge on dividends received from EU-based companies. The outcome of this dispute is likely to be relevant to the Group in 
respect of certain dividends received by UK Group companies before that date. Pending resolution in the courts, an amount of £7.5m 
(2016: £7.5m) continues to be held as a current tax liability for the potential tax liabilities arising if the final decision is in HMRC’s favour. 
Following an IFRIC Agenda decision during the year, an amount of £5.1m relating to accrued interest on the potential tax liabilities, which in 
previous years was held as a current tax liability, has now been reclassified as a provision (see Note 19).  
In October 2017 the EU Commission opened a formal State Aid investigation into an exemption within the UK’s current Controlled Foreign 
Company (‘CFC’) regime (introduced in 2013) for certain finance income. The investigation is ongoing, but if the Commission ultimately 
concludes that the provisions do constitute State Aid then they would require the UK to recover any such aid from affected parties. The 
Group has claimed the benefit of this exemption, and therefore may be adversely affected by the outcome of the investigation. If the 
Commission were to conclude that the finance exemption with the UK’s CFC regime constitutes State Aid and no other exemptions were 
available to the Group then, as at 31 December 2017, an additional liability of £14.0m in respect of tax and £0.3m in respect of interest 
would arise unless such a decision could be successfully challenged in the EU Courts. However, no provision has been made in respect of 
this investigation since we believe that it is more likely than not that no additional tax will ultimately be due. 
Within the tax charge for 2016 is a credit of £3.1m relating to recognition of the net benefit of unused tax losses arising from the acquisition 
of Spectraseis AG in 2015. The ultimate utilisation of these losses is now considered probable as a result of the post-acquisition restructuring 
of the business.

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year (excluding treasury shares). 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year but adjusted for the effects of dilutive options. The key features of the Company's 
share option schemes are described in Note 24.

Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units that are anticipated to benefit from the acquisition. 
The Group’s identified cash-generating units are smaller than the four reportable segments, being the 12 operating companies. Goodwill 
arising on a bolt-on acquisition is combined with the goodwill in the existing Group company and is not considered separately for 
impairment purposes, since such acquisitions are quickly integrated. 
The most significant amounts of goodwill are as follows:

1. On 1 January 2017, two of the Group’s operating companies in the Materials Analysis segment, Malvern Instruments and PANalytical, merged their activities to form 
Malvern Panalytical. Both companies were previously identified as separate cash-generating units. Subsequent to the merger, the two operating companies have been 
reviewed, managed and budgeted for as one operating company for internal purposes therefore for annual impairment review purposes in 2017 they have been 
reviewed as one cash-generating unit. 
Included within ‘Other’ are three (2016: four) cash-generating units in which none of the goodwill balances is considered to be individually 
significant. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. As part of 
the annual impairment review, the carrying amount of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its recoverable amount, determined 
based on value in use. In assessing value in use, the forecast projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit, which are based on actual 
operating results, the most recent budget for the next financial year as approved by the Board, detailed strategic review projections and an 
assumed long-term growth rate to perpetuity, are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit. 
The key assumptions on which the value in use calculations are based on relate to future business performance over the forecast period 
(generally three years), projected long-term growth rates and the discount rates applied. The forecast cash flows include management’s 
latest estimates on sales volumes and pricing, production and other costs. The key estimates applied in the impairment review are the 
forecast level of revenue, operating margins and the proportion of operating profit converted to cash in each year. A long-term growth rate 
of 2.0% (2016: 2.0%) has been consistently applied in the impairment review for all cash-generating units based on current forecast global 
industrial production growth rates, and long-term GDP growth rates for the Group’s primary markets. The cash flow projections have been 
discounted using cash-generating unit specific pre-tax discount rates of between 10.7% and 13.8% (2016: 10.8% and 17.8%). These rates 
have been determined by taking into account the size of business and specific geographical and industry risk factors. As a result of the 
annual impairment review, no goodwill impairment charge has been recognised within operating profit in the Consolidated Income 
Statement (2016: charge of £114.3m) in respect of Omega and ESG Solutions (‘ESG’) goodwill.  
Sensitivity analysis 
The results of the Group’s impairment tests are dependent upon estimates, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above. 
Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in the key assumptions has been undertaken based on the following sensitivities in isolation: 
Key assumption change: 
› a two percentage point (‘pp’) increase in the pre-tax discount rate applied to each cash-generating unit; 
› if the long-term growth rate assumption is reduced by 1.0pp to 1%; and 
› if the cash flow projections for cash-generating units are reduced by 25% in each of the next two years. 
For each cash-generating unit, the Directors do not consider that there are any reasonably possible sensitivities for the business that could 
arise in the next 12 months that could result in an impairment charge being recognised.

Other intangible assets 
Of the total amortisation charge of £47.5m (2016: £42.4m), the amount attributable to the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible 
assets was £41.9m (2016: £36.9m). 
The Group has no internally-generated intangible assets from development expenditure in either 2017 or 2016 as the criteria for the 
recognition as an asset under IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ have not been met. 
The trade names and technology assets recognised on the acquisition of Omega Engineering in 2011, and included within the Industrial 
Controls reportable segment, are considered significant by the Directors as they represent 42.5% (2016: 43.9%) of total customer-related 
and trade names, and 19.6% (2016: 20.0%) of total patents, contractual rights and technology, respectively. The carrying amount of trade 
name intangible assets at 31 December 2017 is £50.3m (2016: £59.3m) and is being amortised over 20 years with the remaining 
amortisation period being 13.8 years. The carrying amount of technology intangible assets at 31 December 2017 is £12.4m (2016: £17.3m) 
and is being amortised over ten years with the remaining amortisation period being 3.8 years.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing. Standard credit terms provided to customers differ according to business and country, and are 
typically between 30 and 60 days. Trade receivables are stated after the provision for impairment of £7.0m (2016: £13.2m). 
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to its carrying amount due to the short-term maturities associated with these 
items. There is no impairment risk identified with regards to other receivables where no amounts are past due.

19. Provisions continued 
Reorganisation 
Reorganisation provisions relate to committed restructuring plans in place within the business. Costs are expected to be incurred within one 
year and there is little judgement in determining the amount. 
Product warranty 
Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included 
within the Group's standard terms and conditions. Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, but can extend to 36 
months. These extended warranties are not significant. 
Legal, contractual and other 
Legal, contractual and other provisions mainly comprise amounts provided against open legal and contractual disputes arising in the normal 
course of business. The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to protect its intellectual property rights, to 
enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties. Provisions are made 
for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account 
professional advice received, and represent management’s best estimate of the most likely outcome. The timing of utilisation of these 
provisions is frequently uncertain, reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations. 
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors' best estimate of the cost of settling current obligations although there is a higher 
degree of judgement involved. The increase during the year relates to £5.1m of interest related to tax provisions which was transferred from 
current tax liabilities during the year (see Note 9). 
No provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless management, 
taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is probable that such proceedings may be successful. Contingent liabilities 
associated with such proceedings have been identified, but the Directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be 
brought can be defeated successfully and, therefore, the possibility of any material outflow in settlement is assessed as remote. 
20. Retirement benefit plans 
Spectris plc operates funded defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for the Group’s qualifying employees in the UK. In 
addition, 14 overseas subsidiaries (2016: 14) in three overseas countries provide defined benefit plans. Other UK and overseas subsidiaries 
have their own defined contribution plans invested in independent funds. 
Defined benefit plans 
The UK, German, Dutch and Swiss plans provide pensions in retirement, death in service and in some cases disability benefits to members. 
The pension benefit is linked to members’ final salary at retirement and their service life. Since 31 December 2009, the UK plan has been 
closed to all service accruals. The German and Dutch plans are closed to new members. 
The UK plan is administered by a pension fund, but the Swiss and Dutch plans are held by insurance companies that are legally separate 
from the Group. The majority of the overseas plan assets are insurance policies held in the Swiss plans, which are not matching in nature. 
The UK plan is managed by a Board of Trustees that represents both employees and employer, who is required to act in the best interest 
of the plan’s participants and is responsible for setting certain policies (e.g. investment, contribution and indexation policies) of the 
various funds. 
The plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market (investment) risk. Inflation 
and interest rate hedges are taken out to mitigate against risks arising on the UK plan and some reinsurance exists in respect of the 
overseas plans. 
The overseas plans are funded by the Group’s overseas subsidiaries, and the UK plan has been funded in the past by both the Group’s UK 
subsidiaries and the Company. The assets of the UK plan are invested in accordance with Section 40 of the Pensions Act 1995. Although the 
Act permits 5% of the plan’s assets to be invested in ‘employer-related investments’, the Trustees have elected that none of the plan assets 
are to be invested directly in Spectris plc shares. The Trustees also hold interest rate and inflation swaps to help protect against the impact of 
changes in prevailing interest rates and price inflation, which in conjunction with the corporate bond portfolio aims to fully hedge against 
interest and inflation rate risks on the basis used by the Trustee to fund the plan. Trustee investment in derivatives is only made in so far as 
they contribute to the reduction of investment risks or facilitate efficient portfolio management and are managed such as to avoid excessive 
risk exposure to a single counterparty or other derivative operations. 
The funding requirements are based on the individual funds’ actuarial measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the 
various plans. 
The Group has determined that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the defined benefit plans, and in accordance with statutory 
requirements (including minimum funding requirements) of the plans of the respective jurisdictions, the present value of the refunds or 
reductions in future contributions is not lower than the balance of the total fair value of the plan assets less the total present value of 
obligations. This determination has been made on a plan-by-plan basis. As such, no decrease in the defined benefit asset was necessary 
at 31 December 2017. 
The last full actuarial valuation for the UK plan was 31 December 2014 and for the overseas plans was 31 December 2017. Where 
applicable, the valuations were updated to 31 December 2017 for IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’ purposes by qualified 
independent actuaries. 
  
122 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Spectris plc 123 
The Group’s contributions to defined benefit plans during the year ended 31 December 2017 were £2.2m (2016: £2.1m). Contributions for 
2018 are expected to be £2.1m for the overseas plans. 
Contributions to the Spectris Pension Plan (UK) ceased from 1 July 2012. The contribution rates are subject to review at future valuations 
and periodic certifications of the schedule of contributions.

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2017 was approximately 17 years (2016: 16 years) for the 
UK plan and 18.6 years (2016: 14.7 years) for the overseas plans. 
Pensioner life expectancy assumed in the 31 December 2017 valuation is based on the following tables:

Unrecognised temporary differences 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on the following temporary differences due to the degree of uncertainty over both the 
amount and utilisation of the underlying tax losses and deductions in certain jurisdictions. £1.3m will expire between 2026 and 2028.  
There is no expiry date associated with the remaining tax losses of £46.7m.

Phased reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020 were substantively 
enacted in the UK Finance (No. 2) Act 2015 and UK Finance Act 2016 respectively. 
It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would be 
due upon remitting these earnings to the UK. However, £54.7m (2016: £68.2m) of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally 
as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate. These tax liabilities 
are not expected to exceed £3.2m (2016: £3.3m), of which only £1.4m (2016: £1.3m) has been provided for as the Group is able to control 
the timing of the dividends. It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future.

Other reserves 
Movements in reserves are set out in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. The retained earnings reserve also includes own 
shares purchased by the Company and treated as treasury shares (see Note 23). The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of 
equity are as follows: 
Translation reserve 
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation into Sterling of the Financial 
Statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges. 
Hedging reserve 
This reserve records the cumulative net change in the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated as effective cash 
flow hedge relationships.  
Merger reserve 
This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore 
eligible for merger relief under the provisions of Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Capital redemption reserve 
This reserve records the historical repurchase of the Company's own shares. 
23. Treasury shares 
At 31 December 2017, the Group held 5,747,360 treasury shares (2016: 5,840,513). During the year 93,153 (2016: 58,395) of these shares 
were issued to satisfy options exercised by employees which were granted under the Group’s share schemes. No shares were repurchased 
by the Group during the year (2016: nil) and no shares were cancelled during the year (2016: nil). 
24. Share-based payments 
The Spectris Savings Related Share Option Scheme (‘SAYE’) provides UK employees with options to purchase ordinary shares in the 
Company following a three-year vesting period. Options may be exercised during a six-month period following the vesting date. The 
exercise price is determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant. There are 
no performance criteria associated with options granted under SAYE. 
Under the Performance Share Plan ('PSP') the exercise price is the nominal cost of the Company’s shares.  
From 2014, awards to Spectris plc Executive Directors have been subject to the following performance criteria: 33.33% of the award being 
based on fulfilment of an adjusted earnings per share growth target (‘EPS’), 33.33% of the award subject to a total shareholder return 
target (‘TSR’) and 33.33% of the award being based on fulfilment of an economic profit ('EP') target.  
Awards to other members of the Spectris plc Executive Committee were subject to the same performance criteria up to 2016. For 2017 
onwards, awards to the Executive Committee are subject to the following performance criteria: 33.33% of the award being based on 
fulfilment of EPS, 33.33% of the award being based on EP target and 33.33% of the award being subject to continued employment for the 
three-year vesting term. Awards to other senior managers were until 2016 subject to EPS for 50% of the award and TSR for the remaining 
50%. From 2017, these awards to senior management are 66.67% subject to EPS and 33.33% subject to continued employment over the 
three-year vesting period. 
Awards made to executives and senior managers of the Group’s operating companies in 2008/2009 were subject to EPS in respect of 50% 
of the award and operating company profit targets in respect of 50% of the award. Awards made between 2009 and 2013 were entirely 
subject to operating company profit targets. In 2016, the performance criteria was EPS in respect of 33.33% of the award and operating 
company profit targets in respect of 66.67% of the award and for 2017 onwards, the performance criteria was operating company profit 
targets in respect of 66.67% of the award and continued employment within the Group during the three-year vesting period for 33.33% 
of the award. All PSP awards vest after a period of three years and must be exercised during the seven-year period following vesting. 
Since 2011, PSP options have also been granted to UK employees as tax-advantaged share options as defined by HMRC. The performance 
criteria and vesting conditions are consistent with the PSP options granted described above. 
The tax-advantaged share options are linked to the PSP share options in order to benefit from the tax-exempt status of the tax-advantaged 
share option grants to an aggregate value not exceeding £30,000. Should there be a gain on exercise under the tax-advantaged options, 
such gain will cause a proportionate reduction in the number and value of the linked PSP options. Should there be no gain on exercise under 
the tax-advantaged options, these options are then forfeited and the linked PSP options may be exercised in full, to the extent their 
performance criteria are met.  
  
128 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Spectris plc 129 
From 2014, awards were made under the Restricted Shares Plan ('RSP') to selected employees. Awards vest three years from grant and 
are cash-settled on vesting. The RSP is subject to the same rules as the PSP but gives flexibility as to whether or not awards are subject to 
performance criteria. Awards under the RSP may be granted to an employee of the Group, but may not be granted to an Executive Director 
of Spectris plc.

Share-based payment expense 
Share options are valued using the stochastic option pricing model (also known as the Monte Carlo model) in respect of TSR, and the  
Black-Scholes model for all other options, with support from an independent remuneration consultant. The TSR performance condition  
was included in the calculation of fair value under the PSP. For options granted in 2016 and 2017, the fair value of options granted and  
the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:

No grant of SAYE options was made in 2017. 
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the expected term. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. 
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. 
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised under the PSP in 2017 was £25.00 (2016: £18.00).  
The weighted average fair value of cash-settled options outstanding at 31 December 2017 is £24.31 (2016: £22.53) for the EPS condition. 
The Group recognised a total share-based payment charge of £8.2m (2016: £3.3m) in the Consolidated Income Statement, of which £5.4m 
(2016: £2.1m) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.

25. Acquisitions 
On 6 February 2017, the Group acquired 99% of the share capital of Pixirad Imaging Counters S.r.l. (Pixirad), a supplier based in Italy, for 
a total consideration of £2.8m. The company develops and distributes high performance X-ray detectors. The excess of the fair value of 
the consideration paid over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is represented by the following intangible assets: technology and 
goodwill of £1.1m and £1.7m, respectively. The goodwill arising is attributable to the acquired workforce and synergies from leveraging 
the customer base to optimise the sales potential of Pixirad and Spectris products. Goodwill includes an amount of £0.3m representing the 
requirement to recognise a net deferred tax liability on the fair value adjustments. The business is being integrated into the Materials 
Analysis segment. The remaining 1% of share capital was purchased on 24 July 2017. 
On 15 May 2017, the Group acquired the trade and certain assets of Setpoint, a US business, for a total consideration of £8.0m. This 
extends the Group’s capabilities in the condition monitoring market. The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair 
value of net tangible assets acquired is represented by the following intangible assets: customer-related (customer relations), technology 
and goodwill of £0.3m, £2.4m and £4.6m, respectively. The goodwill arising is attributable to the acquired workforce, opportunities 
expected from the extension of the Group’s product offerings leveraging its stronger position in vibration and condition monitoring 
solutions, and sharing capabilities and technologies in value-added solutions. The business is being integrated into the In-line 
Instrumentation segment. 
On 1 July 2017, the Group acquired the trade and certain assets of CSA Leyland, a UK business, for no consideration. This extends the 
Group’s capabilities in the automotive testing services market. The excess of the fair value of net tangible assets acquired has resulted in 
a gain on purchase, as a consequence of buying the business in a troubled state, amounting to £1.9m and is disclosed in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. The business is being integrated into the Test and Measurement segment. 
On 2 October 2017, the Group acquired the shares of Omnicon Group Inc., a US company, for a total consideration of £23.8m including 
£1.4m deferred consideration. This extends the Group’s capabilities in engineering services to support the design of reliability electronic and 
software systems. The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is represented by 
the following intangible assets: customer-related (customer relations), contractual rights, trade name and goodwill of £7.6m, £2.1m, £2.4m 
and £10.5m, respectively. The goodwill arising is attributable to the acquired workforce and synergies from leveraging the customer base 
to optimise the sales potential of Omnicon and Spectris services. The business is being integrated into the Test and Measurement segment. 
The assets and liabilities acquired with the above acquisitions, together with the total purchase consideration, are summarised in the table 
below. The revenue and operating profit contribution from the acquisitions in the year to the Group’s results for the year were £6.6m and 
£(3.5)m, respectively. Group revenue and operating profit would have been £1,534.9m and £182.1m, respectively (adjusted operating 
profit: £222.6m), had each of these acquisitions taken place on the first day of the financial year.

Where appropriate, a detailed exercise has been undertaken to assess the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, supported 
by the use of third-party experts. The valuation of the above intangible and tangible assets requires the use of assumptions and estimates. 
Intangible asset assumptions consist of future growth rates, expected inflation and attrition rates, discount rates used and useful 
economic lives. 
The fair value of contingent consideration on the 2017 acquisitions amounts to £1.4m. The contingent consideration payable on financial 
milestones could range from £nil to £5.3m, dependent on incremental future revenues, and the total contingent consideration is sensitive 
to risk-adjusted discount rates. 
Due to their contractual due dates, the fair value of receivables acquired approximates to the gross contractual amounts receivable.  
The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial. 
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised).

26. Assets and liabilities held for sale 
On 14 December 2017, the Group signed an agreement with Macquarie Corporate Holdings Pty Limited for them to acquire 50% of 
the Group's environmental monitoring business, EMS Brüel & Kj ær, for a total cash consideration of AUD$76.6m, subject to closing 
adjustments. The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals in China, the European Union 
and South Korea. The net proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce net debt, thereby increasing the Group’s financial flexibility for 
future capital deployment. As at 31 December 2017, assets and liabilities of this business are presented in the Group's Financial Statements 
as held for sale and are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. There was no gain or loss as a result of 
the classification as held for sale. This business is part of the Test and Measurement segment.

27. Financial risk management 
The Group’s multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks. In the course of its business, the Group 
is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Financial risk management is an integral part of the way 
the Group is managed. Financial risk management policies are set by the Board of Directors. These policies are implemented by a central 
treasury department that has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, including, where 
appropriate, the use of derivative financial instruments. The Group has clearly defined authority and approval limits. The central treasury 
department operates as a service centre to the Group and not as a profit centre. 
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
Such instruments are only used to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future 
transactions. The quantitative analysis of financial risk is included in Note 28. 
Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions are undertaken in currencies other than the respective functional 
currencies of Group companies (transactional exposures) and where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the Group’s 
reporting currency of Sterling (translational exposures). The Group has operations around the world which record their results in a variety 
of different local functional currencies. In countries where the Group does not have operations, it invariably has some customers or suppliers 
that transact in a foreign currency. The Group is therefore exposed to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates between a number of 
different currencies but the Group’s primary exposures relate to the US Dollar, Euro, Danish Krone, Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen. Where 
appropriate, the Group manages its foreign currency exposures using derivative financial instruments. 
The Group manages its transactional exposures to foreign currency risks through the use of forward exchange contracts. Forward exchange 
contracts are used to hedge highly probable transactions which can be forecast to occur typically up to 18 months into the future. 
The Group’s translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate both to the Consolidated Income Statement and net assets of 
overseas subsidiaries. The Group’s policy is not to hedge the translational exposure that arises on consolidation of the Consolidated 
Income Statement of overseas subsidiaries. The Group finances overseas company investments partly through the use of foreign currency 
borrowings in order to provide a natural hedge of foreign currency risk arising on translation of the Group’s foreign currency subsidiaries. 
The quantitative analysis of foreign currency risk is included in Note 28. 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and also the interest 
cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates. Where appropriate, interest rate swaps are used to manage the Group’s interest 
rate profile. 
  
135 Spectris plc Notes to the Accounts continued 
136 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
27. Financial risk management continued 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach 
to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both 
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group manages 
this risk through the use of regularly updated cash flow and covenant compliance forecasts and a liquidity headroom analysis which is used 
to determine funding requirements. Adequate committed lines of funding are maintained from high-quality investment grade lenders. The 
facilities committed to the Group as at 31 December 2017 are set out in Note 17. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such 
as cash balances, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on whether receivables 
are past due based on contractual terms, payment history and other available evidence of collectability. Trade receivables are subject to 
credit limits and control and approval procedures in the operating companies. Due to its large geographical base and number of customers, 
the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables. The quantitative analysis of credit risk relating to 
receivables is included in Note 15. 
Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed centrally by transacting with existing relationship 
banks with strong investment grade ratings. Accordingly, the Group’s associated credit risk is limited. The Group has no significant 
concentration of credit risk. 
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial 
instruments, as shown in Note 28. 
Capital management 
The Board considers equity shareholders’ funds, together with committed debt facilities, as capital for the purposes of funding the Group’s 
operations. Total managed capital at 31 December is: 
 
2017 
£m 
2016
£m 
Equity shareholders' funds  1,204.1   1,067.4 
Committed debt facilities  593.7   628.1 
  1,797.8   1,695.5 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. 
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future 
development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors both the geographic spread of shareholders and the level of dividends to 
ordinary shareholders. 
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company. This is carried out through a SAYE option scheme in the UK, as well 
as performance and restricted share plans. Full details of these schemes are given in Note 24. 
The main financial covenants in the Company’s debt facilities are the ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation and the ratio of finance charges to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, amortisation and impairment. Covenant testing 
is completed twice a year based on the half-year and year-end Financial Statements. At 31 December 2017, the Company had, and is 
expected to continue to have, significant headroom under these financial covenant ratios. 
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares in the market; the timing of these purchases depends on market prices. Buy and sell 
decisions are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board. 
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.  
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to externally-imposed capital requirements. 
28. Financial instruments 
The following tables show the fair value measurement of financial instruments by level following the fair value hierarchy: 
› Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
› Level 3: inputs for assets and liabilities derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data.

   (58.8)
There were no movements between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy in the year. 
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents including held for sale, receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount because of 
the short maturity of these instruments. 
The fair value of floating rate borrowings approximates to the carrying amount because interest rates are at floating rates where payments 
are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year. 
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using appropriate yield curves, to the net 
present values. 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data. 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2017 is a net asset of £0.9m (2016: net liability £4.2m), of 
which £0.7m has been credited to the hedging reserve (2016: £3.4m charged) and £0.2m credited to the Consolidated Income Statement 
(2016: £0.8m charged). These contracts mature over periods typically not exceeding 18 months. A summary of the movements in the 
hedging reserve during the year is presented below. All of the cash flow hedges in 2017 and 2016 were deemed to be effective.

28. Financial instruments continued 
The fair value of deferred and contingent consideration is determined by considering the performance expectations of the acquired entity 
or the likelihood of non-financial integration milestones whilst applying the entity-specific discount rates. The unobservable inputs are the 
projected forecast measures that are assessed on an annual basis. Changes in the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration 
relating to updated projected forecast performance measures are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period that 
the change occurs. 
Deferred and contingent consideration relates to financial (2017: £4.6m, 2016: £10.4m) and non-financial (2017: £6.5m, 2016: £5.8m) 
milestones on current and prior year acquisitions, as disclosed in Note 25. The financial milestones are mainly sensitive to risk-adjusted 
discount rates and annual future revenue targets.

143 Spectris plc Notes to the Accounts continued 
 
144 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
35. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies  
The separate Financial Statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that Act,  
the separate Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.  
In accordance with the exemption provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own  
income statement or statement of comprehensive income. 
a) Basis of preparation 
These Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (‘FRS 
101’). The Company’s shareholders were notified in 2015 of the use of the EU-adopted IFRS disclosure exemptions and there were no 
objections to the adoption of FRS 101.  
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. 
The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: 
› A Cash Flow Statement and related notes. 
› Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets. 
› Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries. 
› Disclosures in respect of capital management.  
› The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs. 
› Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel. 
As the Consolidated Financial Statements of Spectris plc (pages 92 to 141) include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken 
the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures: 
› IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payments’ in respect of Group-settled share-based payments. 
› Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instrument Disclosures’.  
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments. Historical cost is 
generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies are set out below. 
As permitted by s408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account or statement of 
comprehensive income for the year. The profit attributable to the Company is disclosed in the footnote to the Company's balance sheet. 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Financial Statements. 
Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often required where the choice of specific policy, assumption or accounting 
estimate to be followed could materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, should it later be 
determined that a different choice be more appropriate. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based  
on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
In the course of preparing these Financial Statements in accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, no judgements that have a 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements have been made, other than those involving estimation. 
Management considers the following to be key areas of estimation for the Company due to greater complexity and/or are particularly 
subject to uncertainty. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Retirement benefit plans 
Accounting for retirement benefit plans under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with 
actuarial assumptions. The discount rate and rate of retail price inflation (‘RPI’) assumptions applied in the calculation of plan liabilities, which 
are set out in Note 20, represent a key source of estimation uncertainty for the Company. 
b) Summary of significant accounting policies 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets purchased by the Company are capitalised at their cost. 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication 
that the intangible asset may be impaired. The estimated useful economic lives are as follows: 
› Software – 3 to 5 years. 
 
144 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements  
Spectris plc 145 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost comprises the purchase 
price paid and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value (which is 
reviewed annually), of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful economic life. Depreciation commences on the date the 
assets are ready for use within the business and the asset carrying values are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that they 
may be impaired. Land is not depreciated. Estimated useful lives are as follows: 
› Freehold property – 25 years. 
› Office equipment – 3 to 5 years. 
Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at historical cost, less provision for any impairment in value.  
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are carried at original invoice amount (which is considered a reasonable proxy for fair value) and are 
subsequently held at amortised cost less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the transactions. The 
amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the present value of 
expected cash flows receivable. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
This comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits held on call or with maturities of less than three months at inception.  
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are recognised at the amounts expected to be paid to counterparties and subsequently held at amortised cost. 
Taxation 
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years. 
Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial 
Statements and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realised or 
the liability settled based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised or that they will reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will 
be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
Foreign currency translation 
The functional currency of the Company is Pounds Sterling and is determined with reference to the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional 
currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions are translated at 
the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, and are 
charged/credited to the profit and loss account. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at 
historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Financial instruments 
Recognition 
The Company recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set 
off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Measurement 
When financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value, being the consideration given or received plus 
directly attributable transaction costs. 
Originated loans and debtors are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently re-measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis. 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge risks associated with foreign 
exchange fluctuations. These are designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for 
undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents 
145 Spectris plc Notes to the Accounts continued 
 
146 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
35. Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies continued 
whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the 
hedged item. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
Amounts deferred in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income 
Statement, in the same line of the Income Statement as the recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is 
hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are 
transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Company revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains 
in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in  
the Income Statement. 
Derecognition 
A financial asset is derecognised when the Company loses control over the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset. This occurs 
when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged, cancelled or expires. Originated loans and debtors are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Company. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Company assesses at each balance sheet reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset, or group of 
financial assets, is impaired. A financial asset, or group of financial assets, is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that 
loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
Employee benefits 
The Company operates a defined benefit post-retirement benefit plan and a defined contribution pension plan. 
Defined benefit plan 
The Company’s net obligation recognised in the balance sheet in respect of its defined benefit plan is calculated as the present value of the 
plan’s liabilities less the fair value of the plan’s assets. The operating and financing costs of the defined benefit plan are recognised separately 
in the Income Statement. Operating costs comprise the current service cost, scheme administrative expense, any gains or losses on 
settlement or curtailments, and past service costs where benefits have vested. Finance items comprise the unwinding of the discount on the 
net asset/deficit. Actuarial gains or losses comprising changes in plan liabilities due to experience and changes in actuarial assumptions are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The amount of any pension fund asset recognised in the balance sheet is limited to any future refunds from the plan or the present value of 
reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
Defined contribution plan 
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will 
have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are 
recognised in the Income Statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. 
Short-term employee benefits 
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. 
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Company has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can 
be estimated reliably. 
Share-based payments 
Certain employees of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions). The cost of equity-settled transactions 
with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting 
conditions is determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed 
at each balance sheet reporting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards 
which have vested. No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised. 
Where it is not possible to incentivise managers of the Company with equity-settled options, they are issued with cash-settled options. 
The charge for these awards is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual levels of options that vest and the fair value is based on either 
the share price at date of exercise or the share price at the balance sheet date if sooner. 
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises an increase in the cost of 
investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in the subsidiary’s Financial Statements 
with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity. In cases where a subsidiary is recharged for the share-based payment 
expense, no such increase in investment is recognised which may result in a credit in a particular year.

Financial Statements Spectris plc 147 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders. 
Treasury shares 
Shares held in treasury are treated as a deduction from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed. Where such shares are 
subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental costs and related tax effects, is 
included in equity attributable to the Company's equity shareholders.

No ordinary shares were issued upon exercise under share option schemes during the year (2016: nil).  
Share options have been granted to subscribe for ordinary shares of Spectris plc. Full details of share options currently in issue, including 
those issued during the year, together with information regarding the basis of calculation of the share-based payment expense, is contained 
in Note 24. 
45. Reserves 
Merger reserve 
This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore 
eligible for merger relief under the provisions of Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Capital redemption reserve  
This reserve records the historical repurchase of the Company’s own shares. 
Special reserve 
The special reserve was created historically following the cancellation of an amount of share premium for the purpose of writing off 
goodwill. The special reserve is not distributable. 
46. Retirement benefit plan 
The Company participates in, and is the sponsoring employer of, the UK Group defined benefit plan. The plan provides pensions in 
retirement, death in service and, in some cases, disability benefits to members. The pension benefit is linked to members’ final salary at 
retirement and their service life. Since 31 December 2009, the UK plan has been closed to new members.  
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost within the Group. In accordance with IAS 19 
(Revised 2011), there were no Company contributions made to the defined benefit plan during the year (2016: £nil).  
Further details of the UK Spectris Pension Plan, including all disclosures required under FRS 101, are contained in Note 20. 
47. Contingent liabilities 
The cross-guarantee arrangements to support trade finance facilities are stated in Note 27. 
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the
