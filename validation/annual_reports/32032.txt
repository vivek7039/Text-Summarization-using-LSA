Chairman’s statement
Progressing towards ambitious goals
“I am delighted to report another year of growth, 
driven by a strong flow of organic new business”
Joanne Lake
Non-Executive Chairman
This is my first statement to shareholders 
since being appointed as the Group’s 
new Chairman at our Annual General 
Meeting in October 2016. On behalf of all 
of my colleagues, I would like to thank my 
predecessor and co-founder of Mattioli 
Woods, Bob Woods, for his immense 
contribution in building our business  
into one of the UK’s leading providers  
of wealth management and employee 
benefit services. 
Review of the year
I am delighted to report another year of 
growth, driven by a strong flow of organic 
new business and continued demand for 
advice from clients, which together with 
acquisitions completed in this and the prior 
financial year has seen the Group achieve a 
significant milestone in generating annual 
revenues of over £50m. 
We have enjoyed further growth in our 
investment and asset management 
business, with gross discretionary assets 
under management
4
 (“AuM”) increasing 
by £460m during the year, with £190m of 
new monies invested in our discretionary 
portfolio management service. The Mattioli 
Woods Structured Products Fund was 
launched in November 2016 and its value 
now exceeds £100m. Custodian REIT, the 
UK real estate investment trust managed 
by our subsidiary Custodian Capital, raised 
£76m of new monies during the year 
and now has a market capitalisation of 
almost £400m. 
One of our stated aims is to lower the 
cost of the range of services we provide 
to clients, while growing a long-term 
sustainable business. We were delighted 
to reduce the custody charge for all those 
clients using our core investment platform 
from 1 August 2017, which followed our 
previous announcement that the terms of 
the Investment Management Agreement 
between Custodian Capital and Custodian 
REIT have been amended to secure both 
a cost reduction for investors in Custodian 
REIT and an important long-term revenue 
stream for the Group.
Organic revenue growth of 11.6% 
(2016: 8.5%) or £4.4m was driven by 
our largely home-grown consultancy 
team, further accelerated by growth in 
our investment and asset management 
and property businesses. We continue 
to see demand for advice from clients, 
driven by lifestyle, increasing longevity, 
tax and other legislative changes, 
including the pension freedoms that 
introduced a major shift in how people 
can access their pensions, which in turn 
has driven further growth in pension 
consultancy and administration revenues. 
Acquisitions continue to be a core part 
of our growth strategy. Our purchase of 
49% of Amati Global Investors Limited 
(“Amati”), which we announced in 
February, is an exciting extension to our 
asset management business. Amati’s 
total AuM has increased from £120m 
at acquisition to over £178m today. 
In September 2016 we were pleased 
to announce the acquisition of MC 
Trustees, which is an excellent fit with 
our existing pension business and has 
contributed positively to the Group’s 
trading result for the year . We believe 
further consolidation within our core 
markets remains likely and our strong 
balance sheet gives us the flexibility to 
make further value-enhancing acquisitions. 
Strong revenue growth in the year 
translated into growth in Adjusted EPS 
of 11.4% to 34.1p (2016: 30.6p). We are 
proud of the strong shareholder returns 
we have delivered and remain committed 
to growing the dividend, while maintaining 
an appropriate level of dividend cover . 
Accordingly, the Board is pleased to 
recommend the payment of an increased 
final dividend of 9.4p per share (2016: 
8.65 p). This makes a proposed total 
dividend for the year of 14.1p (2016: 12.5p), 
a year-on-year increase of 12.8%.

Investors Limited.

The market
The past 12 months have seen changes  
in many respects. The General Election 
result created fresh speculation around  
the shape of ‘Brexit’ and regulatory 
changes continue at considerable pace. 
Our immediate focus is on ensuring that 
we are fully compliant with those changes 
already in train, such as the Markets 
in Financial Instruments Directive II 
(“MiFID II”), the General Data Protection 
Regulations (“GDPR”) and the Senior 
Managers Regime (“SMR”). 
The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) 
published its final report on the asset 
management market in June 2017, 
confirming its assessment that there 
is weak price competition in the asset 
management industry. In addition, the 
FCA has said it will assess firms’ vertical 
integration and the entire value chain of 
investing, as well as the platform market, 
in its upcoming platform market review. 
Improving client outcomes and reducing 
client costs are key objectives of ours and 
we strongly support the FCA’s objectives 
of increased transparency and better 
alignment of interests between fund 
managers and investors. 
Our strategy
Our strategy remains focused on the 
pursuit of strong organic growth, 
supplemented by strategic acquisitions 
that enhance value and broaden or  
deepen our expertise and services. 
Our distribution channels include our 
consultancy team, a nationwide network  
of professional introducers and, 
increasingly, our workplace financial 
educational programmes. 
Investment in our bespoke pension 
administration and wealth management 
platform continues in line with expected 
spend, while we continue to review 
the possibility of moving to a hosted IT 
infrastructure, which may offer improved 
data security, business continuity and 
scalability for future growth. 
Construction of our new central Leicester 
office, which will provide our staff with a 
modern working environment and capacity 
for further growth, remains scheduled to 
complete around the end of this calendar 
year, with the move from our existing 
offices scheduled for the second quarter  
of 2018. Costs are in line with expectations. 
Our focus is on ensuring we continue to 
address our clients’ changing needs and 
our ambition is to see our brand become 
an even stronger force in the UK financial 
services sector . 
Our people
As an Investors in People company we are 
committed to developing our people and 
building the capacity to deliver sustainable 
growth. In the last financial year we moved 
into larger premises in London and opened 
a new office in Manchester, strengthening 
Mattioli Woods’ position in the North West 
following the acquisition of Preston-based 
financial advisory firm Taylor Patterson in 
the prior financial year . 
I would like to thank all our staff for their 
continued commitment, enthusiasm and 
professionalism in dealing with our new 
and existing clients’ affairs. 
Governance and the board
The Board is committed to developing the 
corporate governance and management 
structures of the Group to ensure they 
continue to meet the changing needs of the 
business. Following my appointment as the 
Group’s first independent Non-Executive 
Chairman, we carried out internal and 
external reviews of the effectiveness of the 
Board, its sub-committees and the Group’s 
senior executive management framework. 
We have created a new Senior Executive 
Team (“SET
GO
”) to execute the strategy 
determined by the Board, bringing together 
a senior team with responsibility for all 
our key operational areas. In addition, 
we have reduced the size of our Board 
to eliminate duplication between the 
Board and SET
GO
, ensuring clearer lines 
of responsibility within the management 
team and creating a balanced Board of 
three executive directors and three non-
executive directors. 
As part of the implementation of these 
changes, Mark Smith and Alan Fergusson 
stepped down as directors in August 
2017, with both remaining key members 
of SET
GO
. 
We believe these changes give the 
business the optimal management 
structure to secure continued growth. 
Shareholders
We are fortunate to have a number of 
supportive institutional shareholders with 
a significant investment in the Group. 
We welcome opportunities to talk to all 
shareholders, large and small, and we 
will continue to maintain a regular and 
constructive dialogue with them, while 
seeking to broaden our shareholder base. 
Outlook
We were delighted to see Bob and Ian 
recognised for their services to business 
and the community in Leicester through 
the award of MBEs in the Queen’s 
New Year’s Honours List. 
Throughout its 25 year history, 
Mattioli Woods has demonstrated 
that in both good and bad economic 
conditions we have a robust business 
model, which delivers organic growth 
by winning new clients and developing 
new revenue streams, and also through 
the careful acquisition of similar or 
complementary businesses. 
Our focus remains on ensuring the 
Group addresses our clients’ changing 
needs and we continue to broaden our 
proposition through advice, innovative 
product development, organically 
and by acquisition. We believe our 
vertically-integrated models for 
wealth management and employee 
benefits, blending our capabilities as 
trusted adviser, administrator, product 
provider and asset manager, allow us 
to deliver improved and sustainable 
client outcomes, and we look forward 
to continuing our success over the 
next 25 years.

Amati case study
Award winning Amati Global Investors 
joins the Mattioli Woods Group
Amati Global Investors, the award winning, Edinburgh based 
investment boutique, joined the Group when Mattioli Woods took a 
49% stake in the business in February 2017. An exciting and dynamic 
business, Amati has a great track record and excellent performance in 
VCTs and the UK Smaller Companies Fund. The significant growth in 
funds since Amati joined the group is testament to Paul Jourdan and 
his team’s track record and top-quartile performance*. 
Amati have three strings to their very 
considerable bow:
 » Amati Aim VCT and Amati Aim VCT 2
 » TB Amati UK Smaller 
Companies Fund
 » Amati AIM IHT Portfolio Service
Now managing more than £165m 
(as at 31 May 2017), there are exciting 
plans for the two VCTs, and the 
progress of the UK Smaller Companies 
Fund is in no small way down to the 
high regard in which Paul Jourdan, 
David Stephenson and Doug Lawson 
and their team are held by investors 
and peers alike. 
“We are thrilled to have 
Amati Global Investors 
as part of the Group 
and look forward to 
developing new and 
innovative investment 
opportunities and 
helping the existing 
trusts, fund and portfolio 
service in reaching 
a wider audience” 
Simon Gibson,
Chief Investment Officer, 
Mattioli Woods 
“Bringing Mattioli 
Woods on board as a 
major shareholder in 
Amati has been a hugely 
significant step, and 
has already borne fruit 
in our development. 
The investment has 
coincided with a strong 
period of performance 
from our funds, which 
will help us to maximise 
the benefits of our 
strategic relationship” 
Paul Jourdan, 
Chief Executive Officer,
Amati Global Investors

We provide wealth management and 
administration services to individuals and 
families, embracing all aspects of financial 
planning, pensions, personal and trust 
investment, coupled with estate planning. 
Investment and asset management 
Discretionary management and the 
provision of bespoke investment advice sit 
at the heart of our investment proposition. 
Continuing growth in the quantum of 
assets under management and advice 
has enhanced the quality of the Group’s 
earnings through an increase in recurring 
revenues, while the migration of client 
assets under advice to assets under 
management allows us to deliver a more 
efficient wealth management service to 
those clients. Our services are delivered 
by a dedicated team, with many years’ 
experience in finance and investment. 
Our business
Integrated financial services
Property management
Our property management business, 
Custodian Capital Limited (“Custodian 
Capital”), is the discretionary fund manager 
of Custodian REIT plc (“Custodian REIT”), 
a UK real estate investment trust listed 
on the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange. We believe investment in good 
quality properties with institutional grade 
tenants typically provides stable returns 
over the long-term and our property team 
offers years of experience in commercial 
property investment to help deliver this. 
In addition, Custodian Capital facilitates 
direct property ownership on behalf of 
pension schemes and private clients and 
also manages the “Mattioli Woods Private 
Investors Club”, which offers alternative 
investment opportunities to suitable clients 
by way of private investment structures. 
Pension consultancy  
and administration
Mattioli Woods is a leader in the provision 
of Self Invested Personal Pension (“SIPP”) 
and Small Self-Administered Pension 
Scheme (“SSAS”) arrangements, which 
are often central to our clients’ life 
planning strategies. We have established 
a reputation for technical excellence, 
widely acknowledged within our industry. 
We maintain our technical edge through 
our in-depth understanding of UK 
pension legislation, which translates into 
meaningful advice given to clients by our 
consultancy team. 
The provision of first-class client service 
through personalised and proactive 
administration further differentiates us 
from our competitors, with our bespoke 
SIPP product having been awarded the 
Defaqto 5-star rating.

Introduction
Still at the beginning of our journey… 
after 25 years 
I am pleased to report another successful 
year, with revenue for the 12 months 
ended 31 May 2017 up 17.4% to £50.5m 
(2016: £43.0m). We are over half way 
towards our medium term goal of growing 
revenues to £100m and we continue to 
focus on delivering great outcomes for our 
clients, with one of our key aims being to 
reduce their total expense ratios (“TERs”) 
while maintaining our target profit margin. 
Sustained demand for advice, driven by our 
clients’ desire for a better understanding of 
their financial position, and the continued 
development of our investment and asset 
management proposition have driven 
strong new business flows, which together 
with acquisitions completed in the 
current and prior financial year increased 
total client assets under management, 
administration and advice by 17.5% to 
£7.77bn (2016: £6.61bn) at the year end. 
Organic growth was supplemented by 
£1.2m of revenues generated by the MC 
Trustees pension administration business 
acquired in September 2016, plus full-year 
revenues of £7.1m (2016: £5.2m) from the 
five businesses acquired in the prior year . 
EBITDA
5
 was up 18.0% to £10.5m  
(2016: £8.9m), maintaining EBITDA  
margin at 20.8% (2016: 20.7%) despite 
further investment in the infrastructure 
of our business and an expected fall in 
banking revenues. 
Adjusted EPS
6
 increased 11.4% to 34.1p 
(2016: 30.6p), while basic EPS was up 
18.7% to 24.8p (2016: 20.9p), with growth in 
operating profits stated after £0.4m (2016: 
£0.3m) of acquisition-related costs and 
£0.3m (2016: £0.5m) of notional finance 
charges on the unwinding of discounts on 
long-term provisions. The effective rate of 
taxation was 16.9% (2016: 16.6%) due to 
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities on 
acquired intangibles following further cuts 
in the substantively enacted rate of UK 
corporation tax. 
Our success is based upon the delivery 
of quality advice, services and products, 
growing our clients’ assets and enhancing 
their financial outcomes. The foundation 
of this success is the development of our 
people and I am delighted we have created

Royal seal of approval as Ian and Bob receive MBEs from Prince of Wales
Co-founders Ian Mattioli and Bob 
Woods were presented with MBEs 
by Prince Charles in an investiture 
ceremony at Buckingham Palace 
in May 2017.
They were named as recipients of the 
awards in the New Year’s Honours List in 
recognition of their services to business 
and the community.
Both were given their insignia by His 
Royal Highness in front of their proud 
families in the palace’s elegant ballroom. 
“It was so nice to be there alongside so 
many people who were being recognised 
for their selfless actions, ordinary people 
who give freely of their time and efforts 
yet seek no reward.”
Former chairman Bob Woods, now 
Senior Adviser to the company, said: 
“To be there, surrounded by so much 
history, and to think we were a small 
part of it was an incredible feeling and 
something I’ll always cherish.”
“It was an amazing occasion, 
a real mixture of excitement 
and adrenaline, but at 
the same time incredibly 
humbling”

We continue to be proactive in relation to 
the opportunities this creates, with our 
specialists dedicated to keeping up with 
the pace of change. Our entrepreneurial 
model allows us to adapt and advise our 
clients accordingly. 
Our markets are highly fragmented and 
serviced by a wide range of suppliers 
offering diverse services to both individual 
and corporate clients. These markets 
remain highly competitive, with recent 
regulatory changes, including the abolition 
of provider commissions on corporate 
pensions in April 2016 and increased 
capital requirements for SIPP operators 
from 1 September 2016, driving further 
consolidation across the industry. 
The Financial Advice Market Review 
(“FAMR”) published by the FCA and  
HM Treasury in March 2016 made a series 
of recommendations designed to tackle 
barriers to consumers engaging with 
financial advice and help the industry 
develop more cost-effective ways of 
delivering advice, particularly through the 
use of technology, while the FCA’s recent 
review of the asset management market 
highlighted its concerns over pricing. 
We continue to invest in the development 
of our IT platform and anticipate that the 
entry of new competitors with innovative 
technology (such as ‘robo-advice’) may 
drive some margin compression in the 
wider market. I expect this, coupled with 
regulatory and market concerns around 
the cost of financial services, to further 
validate our vertically-integrated model, 
where seeking operational efficiencies in 
administration and reducing investment 
management and administration costs 
are key elements of our drive to reduce 
our clients’ TERs, while maintaining 
fair and sustainable profit margins for 
our shareholders. 
Our services
Our core pension and wealth management 
offering serves the higher end of the 
market, including controlling directors and 
owner-managed businesses, professionals, 
executives and retirees. Our broad range 
of employee benefit services is targeted 
towards medium-sized and larger 
corporates. 
In recent years, the Group has developed a 
broader wealth management proposition, 
grown from its strong pensions advisory 
and administration expertise, with the 
Group’s income now derived from four  
key service lines: 
 » Investment and asset management; 
 » Pension consultancy and 
administration; 
 » Employee benefits; and 
 » Property management. 
We aim to operate a seamless structure, 
allowing us to cover all aspects of wealth 
management and employee benefits, 
without confusing strategy for individual 
service lines, such as our advice-led SSAS 
and SIPP proposition. 
Medium-term goals
Our vision is to create a long-term 
sustainable business, built on integrity 
and trust, and delivered with passion. 
Throughout our first 25 years we have 
stayed true to our core values, putting 
our clients at the heart of everything we 
do and doing what is right to build long-
term shareholder value. To assist in the 
achievement of our long-term objectives, 
in early 2014 we announced the following 
medium-term goals:
 » Revenue  £100m
 » Assets under management,  
administration and advice £15bn
 » EBITDA margin 20% 
We are making strong progress towards 
these goals and remain a business built 
on the integrity and expertise of our people. 
We will continue to focus on delivering 
great outcomes for our clients, with 
one of our key aims being to grow and 
preserve their investment assets. 
SET
GO
The Board and Senior Executives have 
long debated the structure of our rapidly 
growing group. When we announced our 
medium-term goals to the market we had 
annual revenues of £23m and assets under 
management, administration and advice 
of £3.6bn.
The business has changed from a young 
entrepreneurial business into what I now 
call ‘a small, friendly corporate’. Last year, 
my longstanding business partner Bob 
Woods stepped down after ten years in 
the role of Executive Chairman to focus 
on his client portfolio, new business 
development and acting as an ambassador 
for Mattioli Woods. Bob and I have now 
worked closely together for over 30 years. 
With Joanne Lake stepping into the 
Non-Executive Chairman role, it was a 
timely opportunity to look closely at the 
structure of the Group. We added to the 
executive team with the appointments of 
Sara Andrews as Chief Business Officer 
and Simon Gibson as Chief Investment 
Officer and created SET
GO
, our Senior 
Executive Team, with the ‘go’ highlighting 
that we are set, ready and moving 
forward. The introduction of SET
GO
 gives 
all our people – clients, shareholders, 
employees and suppliers – a very clear 
operational structure that is enhancing 
our management of the Company and 
will enable it to further grow and develop. 
The new SET
GO
 structure combined with 
a smaller Board is logical, practical and 
in all our people’s best interests.
Mark Smith and Alan Fergusson stepped 
down from the Board in August 2017, 
continuing in their full-time executive 
roles as key members of the SET
GO 
team. Mark’s and Alan’s experience adds 
great value to the Group and both have 
given their support to these changes, 
for which I am truly grateful – it shows 
their long-term commitment to realising 
our ambitions.

Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017
“Demand has surpassed our expectations and we 
have built a well-diversified portfolio of structured 
products within the fund”
Mark Fuller
Head of Structured Products
Mattioli Woods has seen huge 
demand for its industry-leading 
structured products fund, which 
has attracted over £100m of 
investment in its first six months.
The unique venture delivers substantial 
cost-savings and better returns for 
clients. It was created in association with 
Commerzbank AG, a leading commercial 
bank with branches and offices in more 
than 50 countries.
The fund – recognised by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) – offers greater 
security, an improved investment 
process, higher potential returns and 
instant diversification of products.
It builds on the company’s long-standing 
track record of managing more than 
£250m in structured investments, which 
have provided average returns of more 
than 6% per annum.
Mark Fuller, explains the concept 
and why it has been such a 
runaway success.
Prior to the fund’s launch, what 
did the company offer in terms 
of structured products?
Previously, we offered individual 
structured products with individual 
pay-offs. However many clients held a 
number of these individual structured 
products, in effect giving them a ‘fund’ 
of structured products. The multiple 
structured product holdings of many 
clients gave us the premise for 
launching the fund.
Why did Mattioli Woods decide it 
was time to launch its own fund?
We wanted to evolve our structured 
product offering by building on what 
we already had. SPs have provided 
steady attractive returns since 2005 at 
Mattioli Woods, but all the old structured 
products had a number of drawbacks 
- primarily credit exposure to the bank 
issuing the structured product and the 
administration associated with investing 
in structured products. The fund gives 
all the advantages of structured product 
investing without any credit exposure 
and the administration is now much 
less time consuming.
How long did it take to set up?
Once we agreed on what we were going 
to do, it took around nine months. A big 
proportion of this time (more than three 
months) was taken up obtaining all the 
necessary regulatory approvals.
In what way does it differ from 
others on the market?
Our fund was the first of its type to be 
offered to retail investors. The fund’s 
exposure can be recreated by buying 
individual structured products, but the 
extra features such as the daily liquidity 
and collateralisation cannot. Our clients 
are only exposed to the movement of the 
structured products held by the fund, 
which makes our fund unique.
How would you describe its 
success to date?
Improving the client experience of 
investing in structured products was at 
the core of what we set out to achieve. 
Clients can now buy units in the fund 
as easily as buying shares. Furthermore, 
we publish the price of the units in the 
fund every day and the fund’s holdings 
are available on our dedicated website  
www.structuredproductsfund.com. 
The amount of money we have attracted 
into the fund shows how clients have 
understood and endorsed what we have 
created. For me, the amount raised is 
a secondary consideration. I am solely 
focussed in achieving the target return 
for clients – whether we have £1m in 
the fund or £100m.
The fund was seen as ground-
breaking at the time of launch. 
Do you think it will be emulated 
by other companies?
It has already been emulated by 
other structured product providers. 
A large French bank, Societe Generale, 
is launching its own fund in Q3 2017. 
Who can invest in the Mattioli 
Woods fund – and how much do 
they need to put in?
Any Mattioli Woods client can invest. 
The minimum investment is £3,000. 
This can be as a lump sum or in 
monthly instalments.
What is the minimum 
investment period?
It is intended to be held for the long-
term, and clients should invest with at 
least a two-year investment horizon. 
However, units in the fund can be bought 
and sold every day if clients need to 
access their investment in the fund.
What are the likely returns?
We are targeting cash plus 6%. 
Cash means 3 month Libor – the 
standard cash benchmark. 
However, I view this is a minimum 
return – not a maximum.
Name one of the main advantages 
it has over other funds.
The vast majority of funds rely on assets 
invested in going up to achieve a return. 
Our structured product fund can achieve 
a return if the underlying assets we 
invest in go up, down or stay the same. 
The fund is also collateralised, meaning 
we are not exposed to the insolvency of 
any of the banks we deal with.

The acquisition of MC Trustees during  
the year added £466.5m of client assets, 
with a net inflow of £699.3m during the 
year comprising:
 » An increase of £568.7m in SIPP 
and SSAS funds under trusteeship, 
following a period of strong investment 
returns and net organic growth of 
7.6% in the number of schemes being 
administered at the year end. We 
enjoyed 11.8% net organic growth 
in direct11 schemes, with 1.6% net 
organic growth in the number of 
schemes the Group operates on an 
administration-only basis (excluding 
the acquisition of MC Trustees)
 » A £186.5m increase in other personal 
and pension assets; and
 » A £55.9m fall in the value of assets 
held in the corporate pension schemes 
advised by our employee benefits 
business, following the loss of a large 
client in the North Sea oil and gas 
industry, which has gone through a 
difficult period of cost-cutting and 
redundancies. It should be noted that 
revenues in our employee benefits 
business are not linked to the value 
of client assets in the same way that 
certain of our wealth management 
revenue streams are. 
We have extended our asset management 
business through our purchase of 49% of 
Amati, an award-winning specialist fund 
management business based in Edinburgh, 
focusing on UK small and mid-sized 
companies. Amati is the manager of the 
TB Amati UK Smaller Companies Fund; 
two AIM Venture Capital Trusts (Amati VCT 
plc and Amati VCT 2 plc); and an AIM IHT 
portfolio service. Amati’s total AuM had 
increased from £120m at acquisition to 
over £165m at the year end. We anticipate 
further growth in the value of Amati’s AuM, 
including the boards of the VCTs plans to 
launch a joint fundraising to raise around 
£20m between the two VCTs later this year . 
Mattioli Woods has the option to acquire 
the remaining 51% of Amati in the two 
years commencing 6 February 2019 for 
a mixture of cash and Mattioli Woods’ 
ordinary shares. 
Segmental review
Investment and asset management
Investment and asset management 
revenues generated from advising clients 
on both pension and personal investments 
increased 23.5% to £21.0m (2016: £17.0m), 
representing 41.6% (2016: 39.6%) of 
total Group revenues. Income from both 
initial and ongoing portfolio management 
charges increased to £10.7m (2016: 
£8.8m), as the value of clients’ assets in 
discretionary portfolios increased 29.5% to 
£1.14bn (2016: £0.88bn). The Group’s gross 
discretionary assets under management, 
including Custodian REIT, the FP 
Mattioli Woods Balanced Fund (formerly 
the Thoroughbred OEIC) and the Mattioli 
Woods Structured Products Fund totalled 
£1.63bn (2016: £1.17bn) at the year end. 
The Mattioli Woods Structured Products 
Fund was launched in November 2016 
and has raised over £100m to date, 
generating fund management charges 
of £0.2m during the year . The fund has 
been designed around our core objective 
of delivering sustainable long-term 
returns to clients while lowering their 
costs and offers investors the benefits of 
collateralisation, instant diversification, 
continuous availability and liquidity. 
Adviser charges based on the value  
of assets under advice were £10.1m 
(2016: £8.2m). The growth in funds under 
management and advice continues to 
enhance the quality of earnings through 
an increase in recurring revenues, with 
the proportion of investment and asset 
management revenues which are 
recurring being 81.0% (2016: 81.7%).  
As with other firms, these income  
streams are linked to the value of funds 
under management and advice, and are 
therefore affected by the performance  
of financial markets. 
Pension consultancy  
and administration
Retirement planning is often central to our 
clients’ wealth management strategies. 
We maintain our technical edge through 
our widely acknowledged understanding of 
UK pension legislation, which allows our 
consultancy team to deliver meaningful 
guidance to our clients. Our client 
base primarily comprises owner-
managers, executives and members 
of the professions. Additional fees 
are generated from the provision of 
specialist consultancy services. 
In July 2017, the work and pensions 
secretary announced that individuals 
born between 1970 and 1978 will now 
have to wait an extra year, until they 
are 68, to claim their state pension. 
While continual change (and talk of 
change) to the UK pensions system may 
work against the Government’s aim 
to ensure all individuals save for their 
retirement, I expect it to drive sustained 
demand for advice, benefiting our core 
pensions business. 
Pension consultancy and administration 
revenues were up 13.9% to £18.9m  
(2016: £16.6m), representing 37.4% 
(2016: 38.6%) of Group revenues of which 
92.6% (2016: 82.6%) were recurring, with 
additional one-off revenues earned in the 
prior year following significant changes  
in pension legislation. The growth in 
revenues was driven by the total number 
of SIPP and SSAS schemes administered 
by the Group increasing 27.3% to 10,021 
(2016: 7,872) at the year end, with the 
acquisition of MC Trustees during the  
year adding 1,554 schemes. 
Fees for direct pension consultancy 
and administration, where the Group 
deals directly with the client in all areas 
associated with their pension affairs, 
increased 11.0% to £14.1m (2016: £12.7m), 
with sustained demand for advice as more 
people look to take advantage of pension 
freedoms. The number of direct schemes 
administered by the Group increased 11.8% 
to 5,140 (2016: 4,598), with 764 (2016: 665)

own commercial properties, are only subject to a

new schemes gained in the year (excluding 
acquisitions), representing 16.6% (2016: 
17.3%) of the number of schemes at the 
start of the year . 
Our focus remains on the quality of new 
business, with an average new SIPP value 
of over £0.3m and average new SSAS value 
of over £1.0m. We also maintained strong 
client retention, with an external loss rate
12
 
of 2.1% (2016: 2.4%) and an overall attrition 
rate
13
 of 3.6% (2016: 3.6%). 
Third party administration fees increased 
31.4% to £4.6m (2016: £3.5m), with £1.2m 
of revenues generated by MC Trustees 
during the period. The number of SSAS 
and SIPP schemes the Group operates  
on an administration-only basis increased 
to 4,881 (2016: 3,274) at the year end.  
In recent years, Mattioli Woods has 
been appointed to operate or wind-up 
a number of distressed SIPP portfolios 
following the failure of the previous 
operator . Lost schemes include the 
planned transfer of members of these 
distressed SIPP portfolios to alternative 
arrangements, with the 265 schemes lost 
during the period being more than offset 
by acquisition of MC Trustees’ portfolio  
and organic growth. 
Strong growth in pension fees was offset 
by an anticipated fall of £0.2m in banking 
revenues to £0.2m (2016: £0.4m), following 
the cut in the Bank of England base rate  
to a historic low of 0.25% in August 2016. 
The introduction of increased regulatory 
capital requirements for SIPP operators 
on 1 September 2016 and the accelerating 
pace of consolidation within the SIPP 
market is putting some smaller operators 
under increasing pressure to join forces 
with larger firms. 
Property management
Property management revenues increased 
26.8% to £5.2m (2016: £4.1m) or 10.3% 
of total revenue (2016: 9.5%), of which 
90.4% (2016: 91.6%) represented 
recurring annual management charges. 
Our subsidiary Custodian Capital is the 
external fund manager to Custodian 
REIT plc and also manages properties 
on behalf of pension schemes and private 
clients, managing an overall portfolio of 
property investments with a net asset 
value of £445.0m (2016: £328.1m) at the 
year end. The majority of our property 
management revenues are derived from 
the services provided to Custodian REIT, 
which now has a market capitalisation 
of almost £400m and offers one of the 
highest yields
14
 among its UK property 
investment company peer group, coupled 
with the potential for capital growth from 
a balanced portfolio of real estate assets. 
Custodian Capital manages our “Private 
Investors Club”, which offers alternative 
investment opportunities to suitable 
clients by way of private investor 
syndicates. This continues to be well 
received by clients, with £20.6m (2016: 
£9.9m) invested in seven (2016: eight) 
new syndicates completed during the year . 
As part of our strategy to create a 
single, strong identity across our Group, 
Custodian Capital will be renamed Mattioli 
Woods Capital in the first half of the 2018 
calendar year . 
Employee benefits
At a time when the employee benefits 
market is going through extensive 
transition, we recognise the value that 
having a full employee benefits offering 
adds to the Group, allowing us to realise 
synergies between it and our wealth 
management business, with revenues of 
£0.7m (2016: £0.6m) generated in cross 
referrals between the two divisions during 
the last financial year . 
Employee benefits revenues were up 
1.9% to £5.4m (2016: £5.3m), representing 
10.7% of total revenue (2016: 12.3%). 
I believe this is a major achievement, 
following the rebasing of our employee 
benefits business to create the platform 
to optimise our position in this market. 
The move to a fee-based proposition has 
been well-received by corporate clients, 
with 75.9% (2016: 78.7%) of employee 
benefits revenues recurring, and I expect 
our Executive Financial Counselling, 
Boardroom Pay and Financial Education 
initiatives to continue to gather pace. 
There is rising recognition from 
organisations of the importance 
of investing in employee benefits. 
Employers are increasingly encouraging 
staff wellbeing and retirement savings, 
which we expect to drive a period of 
steady growth in the UK employee benefits 
market, and I am delighted over 100 
new corporate clients were attracted to 
the Group’s range of employee benefits 
services during the year . 
In addition, the employee benefits work 
of our Aberdeen business is stabilising 
following several years of localised 
contraction in the oil and gas industry. 
Our membership of the Worldwide Broker 
Network, on which Alan Fergusson serves 
on the board, is driving an increasing 
number of referrals and we have grown 
our consultancy team to capitalise on 
these new opportunities. 
The FAMR highlighted concerns around 
a developing ‘advice gap’, driven by: 
 » Increasing responsibility on individuals 
to manage their own financial affairs; 
 » The ability of individuals to pay for 
advice; and
 » Advice needs arising from pensions’ 
liberalisation and auto-enrolment. 
We believe the Government’s emphasis 
on workplace advice presents new 
opportunities for us to realise further 
synergies between our employee benefits 
and wealth management businesses. 
Financial performance and  
future developments
Group results
Revenues were up 17.4% to £50.5m  
(2016: £43.0m), with sustained demand for 
the Group’s services. We are particularly 
pleased with the continued development 
of our broader wealth management 
proposition and the integration of recently 
acquired businesses during the year . 
The mix between the Group’s key revenue 
streams changed during the period, 
summarised as follows: 
 » 41.6% investment and asset 
management (2016: 39.6%);
 » 37.4% pension consultancy and 
administration (2016: 38.6%);
 » 10.7% employee benefits  
(2016: 12.3%); and
 » 10.3% property management  
(2016: 9.5%). 
EBITDA increased 18.0% to £10.5m  
(2016: £8.9m), with EBITDA margin of 
20.8% (2016: 20.7%) despite further 
investment in the infrastructure and 
sustainability of our business, a fall in 
banking revenues and costs associated 
with the completion and integration of 
recent acquisitions. 
To facilitate a like-for-like comparison 
with prior years, acquisition costs of  
£0.4m (2016: £0.3m) incurred on 
acquisitions during the year have been 
added back in calculating adjusted 
EBITDA and adjusted profit before tax.

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Previously, I set out our aim to reduce 
the TERs incurred by clients and I see 
both a market expectation and possible 
regulatory or legislative pressure to 
reduce product costs, which could bring 
about some continued pressure on sector 
margins. We plan to manage this by 
realising operational efficiencies through 
the development of our IT platform and 
securing further reductions in investment 
management and platform costs. 
Net finance costs
The Group has maintained a positive net 
cash position throughout the year, with net 
finance costs of £0.2m (2016: £0.3m) due 
to the impact of £0.3m (2016: £0.5m) of 
notional finance charges on the unwinding 
of discounts on long-term provisions. 
Taxation
The effective rate of taxation on profit 
on ordinary activities of 16.9% (2016: 
16.6%) was again below the standard 
rate of tax primarily due to the 
recalculation of deferred tax liabilities 
on acquired intangibles following a cut 
in the substantively enacted rate of UK 
corporation tax from 18% to 17%. The net 
deferred taxation liability carried forward 
at 31 May 2017 was £2.8m (2016: £3.0m).
Earnings per share and dividend 
Adjusted EPS
16
 was up 11.4% to 34.1p  
(2016: 30.6p) with strong revenue growth 
and an increase in operating profits. 
Basic EPS increased 18.7% to 24.8p  
(2016: 20.9p), with a fall in the value of 
add backs to adjusted EPS as a result 
of a fall in notional finance charges on 
the unwinding of discounts on long-term 
provisions. Diluted EPS increased 18.2% 
to 24.7p (2016: 20.9p), with the exercise 
of 226,841 options issued under the 
Company’s share option plans during the 
year and the issue of 256,061 new shares 
as consideration for acquisitions. 
Dividends
The Board is pleased to recommend the 
payment of an increased final dividend of 
9.4p per share (2016: 8.65p). This makes 
a proposed total dividend for the year of 
14.1p (2016: 12.5p), a year-on-year increase 
of 12.8% (2016: 19.0%), demonstrating 
our desire to deliver value to shareholders 
and confidence in the outlook for our 
business. The Board remains committed 
to growing the dividend, while maintaining 
an appropriate level of dividend cover . If 
approved, the final dividend will be paid 
on 27 October 2017 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 22 
September 2017. 
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations fell to 
£10.5m or 100% of EBITDA (2016: £11.8m 
or 133%). A £1.8m increase in cash flows 
from operating activities before changes in 
working capital and provisions to £12.3m 
(2016: £10.5m) was offset by a £1.8m 
increase in the Group’s working capital 
requirement (2016: decrease of £1.3m) 
following a £2.0m (2016: £0.5m) increase 
in trade and other receivables and a 
£1.5m decrease (2016: £0.2m increase) 
in provisions after the settlement of 
contingent deferred consideration on 
acquisitions and cash settled share-
based payment awards during the year . 
The impact of the increase in receivables 
and decrease in provisions was partially 
offset by a £1.7m (2016: £1.6m) increase 
in trade and other payables, which was 
primarily due to:
 » A £1.3m increase in accrued staff 
bonuses at the year end, following 
another successful year and an 
increase in headcount across the 
Group; and 
 » A £0.6m increase in trade payables 
at the year end, with a £0.9m stage 
payment on the New Walk office 
development outstanding at the 
year end. 
The increase in trade and other receivables 
was due to:
 » A £0.9m increase in accrued income 
and prepayments as a result of the 
increase in assets under management 
and advice during the year;
 » A £0.7m increase in other receivables 
following an increase in property 
insurance premiums incurred by the 
Group to be recharged to clients at the 
year end; and
 » A £0.4m increase in trade 
receivables following strong growth 
in direct pension consultancy and 
administration fees. 
Net cash at 31 May 2017 was £23.0m 
(2016: £29.8m), with £2.8m of initial 
cash consideration paid and £0.2m 
cash acquired on the two transactions 
completed during the year, plus £2.3m 
(2016: £1.1m) of contingent deferred 
consideration paid in cash on historic 
acquisitions. 
Outstanding trade receivables fell to 
40 days’ sales (2016: 46 days), with an 
increase in investment and asset 
management revenues and a continued 
focus on credit control, while trade 
payables remained at 52 days’ 
purchases (2016: 52 days). 
Capital expenditure in the year was £9.1m 
(2016: £1.7m), with the most significant 
costs being £7.4m incurred on the 
development of the Group’s new offices 
in Leicester, £1.1m investment in new 
computer hardware, software and office 
equipment and £0.5m on the purchase of 
new company cars following continued 
expansion of the consultancy team. 
The continued development of the Group’s 
technology infrastructure is a key part of 
our strategy and although taking longer 
than we initially anticipated, investment in 
our bespoke pension administration and 
wealth management platform continues in 
line with expected spend. We are reviewing 
the possibility of moving to a hosted IT 
infrastructure, which may offer improved 
data security, business continuity and 
scalability for future growth. 
Bank facilities
The Group does not have an overdraft  
facility due to the headroom the 
Group’s current cash balances provide 
on its working capital requirements. 
Management will continue to review the 
level of bank facilities the Group may 
require going forward. 
Capital structure
The Group’s capital structure is as follows:
 2017 2016
 £000 £000
Net cash (22,979) (29,809)
Shareholders’ equity 72,595 65,581
Capital employed 49,616 35,772
The Group continues to maintain a net cash 
position, with net cash balances falling 
to £23.0m (2016: £29.8m) due to capital 
expenditure during the year, coupled with 
the initial cash outflows on the acquisition 
of MC Trustees and the Group’s investment 
in Amati. 
Regulatory capital
The Board considers it prudent for the 
Group to target headroom of circa 25% over 
the FCA regulatory capital requirement. 
The Group’s regulatory capital requirement 
has increased in recent years, and in 
addition its capital is eroded when it makes 
acquisitions due to the requirement for 
intangible assets arising on acquisition to 
be deducted from Tier 1 Capital. 
The Group continues to enjoy significant 
headroom on its increased regulatory 
capital requirement following the 
acquisition of MC Trustees and its 
16 Before acquisition-related costs, amortisation and 
impairment of acquired intangibles, and notional 
finance income and charges. Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

investment in Amati during the 
year, allowing us to pursue further 
acquisition opportunities. 
Acquisitions
We have invested £46m since our 
admission to AIM in 2005 in bringing 
20 businesses or client portfolios into 
the Group, developing considerable 
expertise and a strong track record in the 
execution and its subsequent integration 
of such transactions. 
In September 2016, we were pleased to 
acquire MC Trustees, bringing additional 
scale and expertise to our pension 
administration business. MC Trustees 
is a great fit culturally and strategically, 
serving a similar client base to the Group’s 
existing business, while complementing our 
existing operations. 
The Group’s strategic investment in Amati 
announced in February 2017 brings a 
new dimension to our asset management 
business, which we expect to deliver 
significant synergies for each business. 
The five businesses acquired during the 
previous financial year have integrated well 
and all have contributed positively to the 
Group’s trading results since acquisition, 
increasing earnings and enhancing value. 
With increasing complexity and continuing 
consolidation across the key markets in 
which we operate, we expect there will 
be further opportunities to accelerate our 
strong organic growth by acquisition. 
Relationships
The Group’s performance and value to 
our shareholders are influenced by other 
stakeholders, principally our clients, 
suppliers, employees, the Government 
and our strategic partners. Our approach 
to all these parties is founded on the 
principle of open and honest dialogue, 
based on a mutual understanding of 
needs and objectives. 
Relationships with our clients are managed 
on an individual basis through our client 
relationship managers and consultants. 
Employees have performance development 
reviews and employee forums also provide 
a communication route between employees 
and management including SET
GO
. 
Mattioli Woods also participates in 
trade associations and industry groups, 
which give us access to client and 
supplier groups and decision-makers 
in Government and other regulatory 
bodies. Mattioli Woods is a member of 
the Association of Member-directed 
Pension Schemes and the Quoted 
Companies Alliance. 
Resources
The Group aims to safeguard the assets 
that give it competitive advantage, including 
its reputation for quality and proactive 
advice, its technical competency and 
its people. 
Our core values provide a framework 
for integrity, leading to responsible and 
ethical business practices. Structures for 
accountability from our administration 
and consultancy teams through to SET
GO
 
and the Group’s Board are clearly defined. 
The proper operation of the supporting 
processes and controls are regularly 
reviewed by the Audit, Risk and Compliance 
Committee and take into account ethical 
considerations, including procedures for 
‘whistle-blowing’. 
Our people
advantage of new business opportunities, 
with the number of consultants having 
increased to 115 (2016: 104) at the year end. 
With continued growth in our investment 
and asset management business, and 
to support our growth ambitions, we 
strengthened our SET
GO
 team through 
the appointments of Simon Gibson as 
the Group’s Chief Investment Officer 
and Sara Andrews as Chief Business 
Officer . Simon is a well-respected fund 
manager with over 30 years’ investing 
experience, while Sara brings more 
than 25 years’ experience of developing 
people and managing change within fast-
growing businesses. 
We also welcomed 26 employees to 
the Group as part of the MC Trustees 
acquisition. As an Investors in People 
company we are committed to 
developing our people and building the 
capacity to deliver sustainable growth. 
Recent expansion has seen us move into 
larger premises in London and Glasgow, 
and open a new office in Manchester . 
We enjoy a strong team spirit and facilitate 
employee equity ownership through the 
Mattioli Woods plc Share Incentive Plan 
(“the Plan”) and other share schemes. 
At the year end the proportion of eligible 
staff invested via the Plan remained high 
at 58% (2016: 61%) and we will continue to 
encourage broader participation in the Plan. 
Forward-looking statements
The strategic report is prepared for the 
members of Mattioli Woods and should not 
be relied upon by any other party for any 
other purpose. Where the report contains 
forward-looking statements these are 
made by the directors in good faith based 
on the information available to them at 
the time of their approval of this report. 
Consequently, such statements should be 
treated with caution due to the inherent 
uncertainties, including both economic and 
business risks underlying such forward-
looking statements and information. 
The Group undertakes no obligation to 
update these forward-looking statements. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks which 
could hinder the implementation of our 
strategy and have a material impact on 
our long-term performance. These arise 
from internal or external events, acts or 
omissions which could pose a threat to  
the Group. 
We are proud of our consistently high client 
retention rate, but continue seeking ways 
to strengthen this. We believe the most 
significant risk we face is potential damage 
Our friend and colleague,
Ketan Radia
In September 2016, Mattioli Woods 
lost one of its very best. Our friend 
and colleague, Ketan Radia, passed 
away shortly after playing football 
with his beloved two boys and family. 
Ketan was a fantastic employee and 
ambassador for all things Mattioli 
Woods. Ketan’s friends within the 
Group continue to help and provide 
support to his wife Reena and the 
boys. Ketan is so sadly missed.
As we continue to grow, our previous 
“Small to Big” employee engagement 
theme has evolved into our new “Big to 
Better” initiative, which will enable us to 
retain our core principles as a business 
built on the integrity, expertise and passion 
of our people. Our total headcount at 
31 May 2017 had increased to 568 (2016: 
504) and we continue to invest in our 
graduate recruitment programme, with 25 
(2016: 25) new graduates and 16 (2016: 15) 
apprentices joining the Group during the 
year . We are also developing programmes 
for ‘life served’ people seeking exciting 
opportunities for a change in career or a 
return to work. We continue to expand our 
consultancy and technical teams to take  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

Chief Executive’s Officers review continued
to our reputation as a result of poor client 
service and we are determined not to let 
standards slip. We address this through 
ongoing quality control procedures and the 
provision of regular training for all our staff. 
Pension regulations will continue to be 
reviewed. Future changes may not produce 
an environment that is advantageous to 
the Group and any changes in regulation 
may be retrospective. To address this risk, 
we are committed to ensuring that our 
views are expressed during consultation 
exercises and that we respond positively 
and rapidly to new regulations. 
We also recognise that a significant 
skills shortage would represent a risk to 
growth. We are mitigating this risk through 
investment in our graduate, apprentice 
and life served recruitment programmes 
and by providing incentives to motivate and 
retain our existing employees. Throughout 
the Group, we have introduced Financial 
Assess, a web-based training programme 
provided through the Chartered Insurance 
Institute, written specifically from a 
financial services perspective. This training 
helps maintain staff competence and 
compliance within our organisation 
and brings a better understanding to 
all employees of the markets in which 
we operate. 
One source of revenue is based on the 
value of cash balances held in clients’ 
schemes. These balances are not 
included in the Consolidated or Company 
statements of financial position. In recent 
years, lower banking margins due to a 
continued low interest rate environment 
have resulted in a decline in these 
revenues. Following the Bank of England’s 
decision to cut the base rate to a historic 
low of 0.25% in August 2016 we have 
reviewed how we might enhance our client 
banking model and plan to launch a new 
pooled banking solution for our clients’ 
pension scheme accounts later this year . 
The Group has an indirect exposure to 
security price risk on investments held 
by clients, with discretionary portfolio 
management fees, fund management 
fees, adviser charges (including legacy 
investment commissions) and property 
management fees being based on the 
value of clients’ assets under management, 
administration or advice. Periods of 
volatility in a particular asset class may see 
changes in how our investment revenues 
are derived. However, a great strength 
of our business is that we can continue 
to derive income from investments in all 
asset classes, while ensuring our clients’ 
investment strategies are appropriately 
aligned to the prevailing market conditions 
and suitable for their financial needs. 
The table on pages 24 to 27 outlines the 
current risk factors for the business 
identified by the Group. The risk factors 
mentioned do not purport to be exhaustive 
as there may be additional risks that 
materialise over time that the Group 
has not yet identified or deemed to have 
a potentially material adverse effect on 
the business.
Corporate social responsibility
We believe that running a profitable 
and growing business, which creates 
jobs and contributes to the economic 
success of the areas in which it operates, 
is a good platform for good corporate 
social responsibility. 
Mattioli Woods has a long-standing 
commitment to ensure our staff can 
engage with their local communities, 
playing a valuable role by forming 
innovative partnerships with other 
organisations and charities. This social 
awareness is present throughout the 
business, from our employees to our 
clients, our professional connections 
and the suppliers we use.
We have a high level of engagement 
within our local communities. Each year, 
we sponsor both business, sports and 
community awards. Our business has 
benefited greatly from winning numerous 
awards and we feel its right to help other 
businesses reap the rewards of such 
accolades. In addition, we sponsor a variety 
of local clubs, business and sports related 
events across the country. We believe 
this brings many benefits to the local 
community and beyond. 
The Group is pleased to continue 
sponsoring the Rothley 10k, one of the 
most celebrated charity road running races 
in Leicestershire, which attracted almost 
800 runners in 2017, a new record for the 
race, which again raised over £20,000 of 
essential funds for a variety of local causes, 
including LOROS, Rainbows, County Air 
Ambulance Service, Age UK, Eye Camps 
and RNLI. 
In 2015 we chose our first national charity, 
Breast Cancer Now, the UK’s largest 
breast cancer charity dedicated to funding 
research into this devastating disease. 
By tackling the disease in the labs, on the 
political agenda, through public health 
information and with the health service, it 
believes it can transform the outlook for 
everyone affected by breast cancer . To date, 
the Group has raised over £127,000 for 
the charity. 
Employees across the country have been 
involved in a number of activities to raise 
essential funding for this great cause, 
including a group wide cycling challenge, 
Tough Mudder in the Midlands, the National 
Three Peaks Challenge, the London and 
Edinburgh marathons, Glack Attack in 
Aberdeen and numerous cake sales 
and challenges. 
We also continue to sponsor wheelchair 
racer Sammi Kinghorn, who won two 
gold medals at the world para athletics 
championships in London in 2017 and 
now has her sights set on the 2018 
Commonwealth Games.
In addition, we support many other smaller 
charities such as Newmarket’s Open 
Door initiative, which provides vulnerable 
people with supported housing and training 
opportunities; Rainbow House in Preston, 
a comprehensive programme for children, 
young people and adults with neurological 
conditions and Project Luangwa, an 
international charity supported by our 
Solihull team that provides education in 
Zambia through the construction of schools, 
sponsoring of students and provision of 
educational materials.
The Group continues to create opportunities 
for young people through both its Financial 
Services Development scheme and 
apprenticeship recruitment, recently 
winning Apprenticeship Employer of the 
Year at the 2017 Leicester Apprenticeship 
Hub Graduation Ceremony. This year, 
we are looking to recruit 24 graduates 
and increase our apprentice intake 
to 25. We have also given 21 students 
the opportunity to work with us to gain 
valuable work experience during the year . 
Finally, as our Chairman has stated, Bob 
and I were honoured in the Queen’s New 
Year’s Honours List and received MBEs 
for business and community services in 
Leicester – an honour greatly appreciated 
by us both.

new look to heart of 
Leicester city centre
 
Leicester’s city landscape continues 
to transform as work forges ahead 
on the new home for Mattioli 
Woods’ Leicester team.
 
Months of intensive construction work 
have completely reshaped the New Walk 
area as the company’s new offices edge 
nearer completion.
 
The purpose-built structure will provide 
50,000 sq ft of space and house more than 
400 staff when they switch from Enderby 
next year .
 
The site was formerly the headquarters of 
Leicester City Council, whose offices were 
demolished in February 2015 after being 
declared unsafe.
 
Mattioli Woods’ staff have been taken on 
a series of monthly visits to see first-hand 
how the building project is developing.
 
Other improvements in the area include 
new homes, retail outlets and a public

Corporate governance report
The Board is committed to achieving high standards of corporate governance, integrity and business ethics. Under the AIM Rules the 
Group is not required to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2014 (“the Code”). The Code has not been applied in full, however, the Board has taken into consideration the Guidance for 
Smaller Quoted Companies on the Code produced by the Quoted Companies Alliance, and taken steps to apply the principles of the Code 
in so far as it can be applied practically, given the size of the Group and the nature of its operations. 
Operation of the Board
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group and has a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved to it for decision. These include strategic planning, business acquisitions and disposals, authorisation of major capital 
expenditure and material contractual arrangements, setting policies for the conduct of business and approval of budgets and financial 
statements. Other matters are delegated to SET
GO
, supported by policies for reporting to the Board. The Company maintains appropriate 
insurance cover in respect of legal action against the Company’s directors, but no cover exists in the event that a director is found to have 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
The agenda and relevant briefing papers are distributed by the Company Secretary on a timely basis, usually a week in advance of each 
Board meeting. 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are distinct, as set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for 
the effectiveness of the Board, directing strategy and ensuring communication with shareholders. The Chief Executive is responsible 
for overseeing the delivery of this strategy and the day-to-day management of the Group by the senior executive team. The Board is 
committed to developing the corporate governance and management structures of the Group to ensure they continue to meet the 
changing needs of the business, with the role of Chairman having been separated from executive responsibilities with the appointment  
of Joanne Lake as independent Chairman, in line with conventional corporate governance standards. 
The Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any relationship which might 
materially interfere with the exercise of independent judgement. The Board does not consider the Non-Executive Directors’ shareholdings 
to impinge on their independence. The Non-Executive Directors provide a strong independent element to the Board and bring experience 
at a senior level of business operations and strategy. Anne Gunther is the Senior Independent Director .
All directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures and applicable rules and 
regulations are observed. Any director, on appointment and throughout their service, is entitled to receive any training they consider 
necessary to fulfil their responsibilities effectively. 
The Board meets regularly throughout the year as well as on an ad hoc basis, as required by time critical business needs, and is the 
principal forum for directing the business of the Group. 
Board committees
The Board has delegated authority to three committees. The Chairman of each committee provides a report of any meeting of that 
committee at the next Board meeting. The Chairman of each committee is present at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions 
from shareholders. 
Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee 
The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (“the Committee”) comprises Anne Gunther (Chairman), Carol Duncumb and  
Joanne Lake. Anne Gunther is a Chartered Banker and the Board believes the Committee is independent, with all members  
being Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee meets together with the Chief Financial Officer, Nathan Imlach, and Chief Operating Officer, Mark Smith, not less  
than twice a year . It is responsible for ensuring the financial performance of the Group is properly reported on and monitored. The 
Committee considers the appointment of, and fees payable to, the external auditor and discusses with them the scope of the annual 
audit. The Committee also reviews the external auditor’s management letter and detailed presentations are made to the Committee by 
the Company’s auditor at least once a year . An analysis of fees payable to the external audit firm in respect of audit and non-audit services 
during the year is set out in Note 7 to the financial statements. The Company is satisfied the external auditor remains independent in  
the discharge of their audit responsibilities.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
35
The Committee reviews the Interim Report and annual financial statements for compliance with accounting standards, statutory 
obligations and the requirements of the AIM Rules. The Committee also reviews the effectiveness of the internal controls of the Group.  
The presence of other senior executives from the Group may be requested. 
The Committee has reinforced its mission for risk management and embarked on a path to substantially evolve the main components of 
its three lines of defence. The Head of Internal Audit is responsible for providing assurance on the internal controls related to the Group’s 
key activities, and during the year has engaged in a number of activities:
 » Audits over data privacy, to assess how well we safeguard our corporate and client personal data, and help us prepare for the 
upcoming General Data Protection Regulations legislation; and payments processing, to validate the control environment in which 
we process client and corporate payments through our various banking partners. Both reviews identified control improvements  
to enhance our business operations. 
 » Consultancy-style reviews, where internal audit has partnered with the business to strengthen a number of key processes, 
including disaster recovering planning and our human resources recruitment process. 
In addition, the internal audit function has worked closely with the Board to provide training and awareness over the Group’s evolving 
business and IT (or cyber) risks, including our resilience to prevent criminal attacks on our internal network. This has included a number 
of workshops to update the Group Risk Register and the Board’s statement of Risk Appetite.
As the third line of defence, the Internal Audit function (together with the external auditors for financial reporting) is building risk 
awareness within the organisation by challenging the first and second lines of defence to continue improving the controls framework. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Carol Duncumb (Chairman), Joanne Lake and Anne Gunther . The Committee meets not less 
than twice a year . It is responsible for determining and reviewing the Group’s policy on executive remuneration and other benefits and 
terms of employment, including performance related bonuses and share options. The Committee also administers the operation of the 
share option and share incentive schemes established by the Company. 
The members of the Remuneration Committee have no personal interest in the outcome of their decisions and seek to serve the interests 
of shareholders to ensure the continuing success of the Company. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the 
Board itself. No director is permitted to participate in decisions concerning their own remuneration. 
The Committee has reviewed the Group’s Long-Term Incentive Plans in conjunction with external consultants to ensure it can continue 
to attract, retain and incentivise appropriately qualified staff to achieve its goals. 
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises Joanne Lake (Chairman), Carol Duncumb and Anne Gunther . The Committee is responsible  
for reviewing the size, structure and composition of the Board, establishing appropriate succession plans for the Executive Directors and 
other senior executives in the Group and for the nomination of candidates to fill Board vacancies where required. The Committee works  
in close consultation with the Executive Directors, with its main priorities being Board structure and management succession.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

Asset Management Executive Committee
SET
GO
 has delegated authority to the Asset Management Executive Committee to oversee the Group’s investment management approach, 
developing the ‘house view’ on economics, investment markets and asset allocation; and considering how the Group should best apply 
these views. 
In particular, the Asset Management Executive Committee is responsible for developing and implementing the Group’s asset management 
strategy, for developing and monitoring all aspects of the Group’s investment business on a continuing basis, receiving reports from the 
board of Custodian Capital, the Structured Products Fund Oversight Committee and the Multi-Asset Team (including the Asset Allocation 
Committee). The committee is also responsible for ensuring that the Group’s day-to-day investment and asset management operations 
are conducted in accordance with the relevant regulatory and statutory requirements through the investment research and investment 
operations teams. 
The Asset Management Executive Committee meets at least six times a year but more frequently if required. The committee is chaired 
by the Chief Investment Officer and during the year comprised the following members: 
 » Simon Gibson, Chief Investment Officer;
 » Ben Wattam, Investment Director;
 » Ian Goodchild, Investment Director;
 » Alex Nix, Assistant Fund Manager (Custodian Capital);
 » Alex Brown, Wealth Management Director; and;
 » David Thurlow, Director (Tax Strategies).
Biographies of the committee’s members are available on our website: www.mattioliwoods.com. 
Induction, training and performance evaluation
New directors receive an induction on their appointment covering the activities of the Group, its key business and financial risks, the terms 
of reference of the Board and its Committees and the latest financial information.
The Chairman ensures directors update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Group as required to fulfil their roles on the Board 
and its Committees. Ongoing training is provided as necessary and includes updates from the Company Secretary on changes to the 
AIM Rules, requirements under the Companies Acts and other regulatory matters. All directors have access to independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their duties, with requests for such advice being authorised 
by the Chairman or two other directors, one of whom is a Non-Executive. 
Evaluation of the Board’s performance
Following the end of the financial year, an external review of the Board’s effectiveness was undertaken by an independent third party.  
This involved one-to-one interviews with directors and a review of Board and Board committee papers and minutes. The key points raised 
in the review were around board composition and succession planning. 
In response, we have reduced the size of our Board to eliminate duplication of documentation and discussion between the Board and 
SET
GO
, ensuring clearer lines of responsibility within the management team and creating a balanced Board of three executive directors 
and three non-executive directors. 
Individual appraisal of each director’s performance is undertaken either by the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman each year and involves 
meetings with each director on a one-to-one basis. The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, carry out an 
appraisal of the performance of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer .  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

Retirement and re-election
All directors are subject to election by shareholders after their appointment and to re-election thereafter at intervals of no more  
than three years. 
Non-Executive Directors’ appointments are initially for 12 months, and continue thereafter until terminated by either party giving three 
months’ prior written notice to expire at any time on or after the initial 12 month period. The terms and conditions of appointment of the 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at MW House during normal business hours and prior to the AGM. 
Communications with shareholders
The Board is committed to maintaining an ongoing dialogue with the Company’s shareholders. The principal methods of communication 
with private investors remain the Annual Report and financial statements, the Interim Report, the AGM and the Group’s website  
(www.mattioliwoods.com). 
It is intended that all directors will attend each AGM and shareholders will be given the opportunity to ask questions at the AGM  
on 26 October 2017. In addition, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer welcome dialogue with individual 
institutional shareholders to understand their views and feed these back to the Board. General presentations are also given to analysts 
and investors covering the annual and interim results. 
Internal control and risk management
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate risks and can only provide reasonable not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
In accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control, an ongoing process has been established for identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group. This process has been in place throughout the year under review and  
up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and financial statements. 
The Board routinely reviews the effectiveness of the system of internal control and risk management to ensure controls react to changes 
in the nature of the Group’s operations.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover and reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly, in conjunction with the Group’s 
insurance brokers. 
There are clearly defined procedures for reviewing and approving all bids, acquisitions and capital expenditure within the Group.

Directors’ remuneration report
Remuneration policy
Mattioli Woods recognises the importance of its employees to the success of the Group and consequently the remuneration policy 
is designed to be market competitive in order to attract, motivate and retain high calibre individuals. The main focus of the Group’s 
remuneration policy is to align the interests of the Executive Directors with the Group’s strategic priorities and the long-term creation 
of shareholder value. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the regulatory and legislative framework with the aim of ensuring that the remuneration policy is 
in line with best practice, including the FCA codes of practice (“the FCA Codes”) which set out the standards and policies that regulated 
firms are required to meet when setting pay and bonus awards for staff. External third party data is used to validate rather than to 
benchmark the total reward and the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the current economic climate, remuneration 
policies of comparable businesses and pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when considering Executive Directors‘ 
and other senior management’s pay. 
The remuneration arrangements are designed to:
 » Promote value creation;
 » Support the business strategy;
 » Promote the long-term success of the Group;
 » Deliver a competitive level of pay for the Executive Directors and senior management;
 » Encourage the retention of staff through deferred variable compensation, where appropriate;
 » Ensure greater alignment between the interests of the Executive Directors and the long-term interests of shareholders through 
significant long-term equity participation;
 » Be fair for both the director and the Group, with some element of discretion;
 » Comply with financial services rules and regulations;
 » Discourage excessive risk taking and short-termism;
 » Encourage more effective risk management; and
 » Support positive behaviours and a strong and appropriate conduct culture. 
The Group’s policy is to remunerate Executive Directors and senior management through basic salary and benefits, annual 
performance-related discretionary bonuses and participation in Long-Term Incentive Plans which promote the creation of sustainable 
shareholder value. The total reward is designed to include a balance of fixed and variable pay with an element of deferral. 
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board and are reviewed annually, having regard to fees paid to non-executive 
directors in other UK quoted companies, the time commitment and responsibilities of the role. Non-Executive Directors do not receive 
bonuses or share entitlements. No director is permitted to participate in decisions concerning their own remuneration. 
During the year, the effective date for changes in directors’ remuneration was reviewed and going forward will change from 1 June  
to 1 September, in line with the Group’s other employees. 
Shareholders will be asked to approve the remuneration policy, which applies to the directors and employees of the Group, at the 
Company’s next AGM on 26 October 2017.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

Notes to Directors’ remuneration table
Salary
The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually having regard to personal performance, divisional or Group 
performance, significant changes in responsibilities and competitive market practice in their area of operation. 
Fees
The Non-Executive Directors are only paid fees, which are not pensionable. In addition to a basic fee, Non-Executive Directors also receive 
additional responsibility fees in recognition of them being a member of or chairing a committee or being the senior independent director . 
Benefits
Benefits for Executive Directors principally relate to the provision of cars, death in service cover and permanent health insurance or cash 
allowances taken in lieu of such benefits. 
Bonus
Awards to Executive Directors and some other senior employees of the Group of profit related bonuses are made from a pool of the 
Group’s earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation after payment of bonuses payable to all other staff. For the year 
ended 31 May 2017, the bonus arrangements for the Executive Directors comprised:
 » A corporate award based on actual profit achieved compared to target profit; and 
 » A personal award based on the achievement of personal objectives assessed on a discretionary basis, considering each executive’s 
performance against their key objectives. 
The payment of corporate award at its maximum level is dependent on outperformance of the Board’s approved internal budget for the 
period. For the year ending 31 May 2018, the short-term incentive arrangements for each Executive Director are as follows:
 Maximum
 award as a Linked to Linked to

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Long-Term Incentive Plan
To assist the Group to attract and retain appropriately qualified staff, it adopted the Mattioli Woods 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan  
(“the LTIP”) to incentivise certain of its senior employees and Executive Directors. Awards made to the Executive Directors under the 
LTIP are set out below. 
Pension related benefits
Executive Directors may participate in the pension arrangements of the Group or elect to have pension payments paid into a personal 
pension plan or as cash in lieu of pension on the same basis as other employees. Pension payments in respect of Executive Directors 
are currently 10% of base salary. 
Share Incentive Plan
The Mattioli Woods plc Share Incentive Plan (“the SIP”) enables employees to buy shares in the Company at an effective discount to the 
Stock Exchange price by having an amount deducted from pre-tax salary each month. In addition, the Company can grant participating 
employees matching and/or free shares.
This benefit is the value of the SIP matching shares made in the year . Employees may contribute up to £150 per month to buy 
partnership shares with contributions matched on a one-for-one basis by the Company. 
Mattioli Woods 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan
The current LTIP was approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2010 AGM. During the year ended 31 May 2017 the Remuneration 
Committee granted further awards under the LTIP in respect of the year ended 31 May 2016. The LTIP allows a significant element of 
deferred variable remuneration to be paid in equity or a cash equivalent award. 
Eligibility
Any employee (including an Executive Director) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the LTIP at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Form of award
Awards under the LTIP may be in the form of an option granted to the participant to acquire ordinary shares with a nominal exercise 
price of 1p. Alternatively, the Remuneration Committee may at its discretion grant participants a right to receive a cash amount which 
relates to the value of a certain number of notional shares. 
Performance conditions
Options granted under the LTIP are only exercisable subject to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions which will 
determine the proportion of the option that will vest at the end of the three-year performance period:
Compound annual growth in EBITDA over
the three-year performance period Percentage of maximum award vesting
‹5% Nil
5% 30%
12% 100%
The percentage of maximum award vesting will be calculated pro rata between the minimum and maximum hurdles. If the 
performance conditions are not met over the three financial years commencing on 1 June before the date of grant, the options lapse. 
The options will generally be exercisable after approval of the financial statements for the financial year two years after the year of 
grant, or on a change of control (if earlier). 
Individual and overall limits
The maximum award for any eligible employee under the LTIP for any one year is 100% of salary. The LTIP is subject to an overall limit 
on the total number of shares which may be issued within a 10 year period under the LTIP or any other employee share plan operated 
by the Group of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. 
Clawback
Vested and unvested LTIP awards are subject to a formal malus and clawback mechanism. 
Grant of equity share options under the LTIP
As at 31 May 2017, the Company had granted options to certain of its senior employees and Executive Directors to acquire (in aggregate) 
up to 3.13% (2016: 2.76%) of its share capital. The maximum entitlement of any individual was 0.57% (2016: 0.53%). The options are 
exercisable at 1p per share.
Grant of cash-settled options under the LTIP
At 31 May 2017, the Company had granted cash-settled options to Ian Mattioli and Bob Woods that are the equivalent of (in aggregate) 
up to 0.46% (2016: 1.06%) of its share capital. The maximum entitlement of any individual was 0.27% (2016: 0.62%). The options are 
exercisable at 1p per share. The amount of any cash entitlement on vesting of an award will be directly linked to the value of a specified 
number of the Company’s shares at the vesting date.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
43
Terms of awards
Options may be granted over newly issued shares, treasury shares or shares purchased in the market. Options are not transferable other 
than on death. Shares acquired through the LTIP may be delivered to participants by the trustees of the Mattioli Woods 2010 Employee 
Benefit Trust (“the EBT”), which was established for this purpose. The trustees may either subscribe for new shares from the Company 
or purchase shares on the market. The EBT may never hold more than 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company at any time.  
At 31 May 2017 the Company held no shares in treasury (2016: Nil). 
Mattioli Woods Consultants’ Share Option Plan
To attract and retain appropriately qualified staff the Group adopted the Mattioli Woods Consultants’ Share Option Plan (“the Consultants’ 
Share Option Plan”) to incentivise certain of its senior consultants. Where possible, and to the limits applied by the legislation, the 
Consultants’ Share Option Plan benefits from the tax advantages under an Enterprise Management Initiative (“EMI”) scheme. 
At 31 May 2017, the Company had granted options under the Consultants’ Share Option Plan to certain of its senior consultants to 
acquire (in aggregate) up to 0.39% (2016: 0.57%) of its share capital. The maximum entitlement of any individual was 0.17% (2016: 0.19%). 
The options are exercisable at various prices, depending upon the date the options were granted. 
Unapproved share scheme
Options issued under the Consultants’ Share Option Plan are intended to be qualifying options for EMI purposes. If they are not qualifying 
options (for example, because they exceed the statutory limit at the date of grant) then they will take effect as unapproved options which 
cannot benefit from the preferential tax treatments afforded to options granted pursuant to an EMI scheme. The rules for these options 
will be identical to those for the Consultants’ Share Option Plan. 
Directors’ interest in share options
Outstanding share options granted to Executive Directors under the 2010 LTIP are as follows:

Directors’ report
Report and financial statements
The directors have pleasure in presenting their report together with the financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2017.  
For the purposes of this report, the expression ‘Company’ means Mattioli Woods plc and the expression ‘Group’ means the Company  
and its subsidiaries. 
Business review
The Group’s principal activities continue to be the provision of pension consulting and administration, wealth management, 
asset management and employee benefits consultancy. The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 31 includes further information about the  
Group’s principal activities, financial performance during the year and indications of likely future developments. 
The directors believe they have adequately discharged their responsibilities under section 414(c) of the Companies Act 2006 to provide  
a balanced and comprehensive review of the development and performance of the business. 
Results and dividends
Group profit for the year after taxation amounted to £6.4m (2016: £5.2m), up 23.1% on the previous year as a result of strong revenue 
growth, with revenues up 17.4% to £50.5m (2016: £43.0m). The effective rate of taxation was again below the standard rate of tax 
at 16.9% (2016: 16.6%), primarily due to the recalculation of deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles following a cut in the 
substantively enacted rate of UK corporation tax from 18% to 17%. 
The final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 May 2016 of 8.65p per share was paid in October 2016. An interim dividend in respect  
of the year ended 31 May 2017 of 4.7p per share was paid to shareholders in March 2017. The directors recommend a final dividend of 
9.4p per share. This has not been included within the Group financial statements as no obligation existed at 31 May 2017. If approved, 
the final dividend will be paid on 27 October 2017 to ordinary shareholders whose names are on the register at the close of business 
on 22 September 2017. 
Share capital 
Mattioli Woods plc is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales and its shares are quoted on the AIM market  
of London Stock Exchange plc. The Company’s authorised and issued share capital during the year and as at 31 May 2017 is shown  
in Note 23. The ordinary shares rank pari passu in all respects. Save as agreed at the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders,  
the ordinary shares have pre-emption rights in respect of any future issues of ordinary shares to the extent conferred by section 561  
of the Companies Act 2006. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company, other than:

FCA, whereby certain directors, officers and employees of the Group require the approval of the Group to deal in ordinary shares  
of the Company; 
 » Restrictions on the former shareholders of Taylor Patterson as a result of them entering into a lock-in deed with Mattioli

CREST
Mattioli Woods plc share dealings are settled in CREST, the computerised system for the settlement of share dealings on the London 
Stock Exchange. CREST reduces the amount of documentation required and makes the trading of shares faster and more secure. 
CREST enables shares to be held in an electronic form instead of the traditional share certificates. CREST is voluntary and shareholders 
can keep their share certificates if they wish. This may be preferable for shareholders who do not trade in shares on a frequent basis.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

Directors
A list of current serving directors and their biographies is given on pages 32 and 33. Nathan Imlach and Carol Duncumb retire and, 
being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. 
The appointment of Anne Gunther as Non-Executive Director was announced on 14 June 2016. Bob Woods stepped down from the Board 
at the Annual General Meeting on 25 October 2016, following the appointment of Joanne Lake as Non-Executive Chairman. Mark Smith, 
Chief Operating Officer and Alan Fergusson, Managing Director Employee Benefits stepped down from the Board on 15 August 2017. 
Directors’ interests
Directors’ emoluments, beneficial interests in the shares of the Company and their options to acquire shares are disclosed in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. During the period covered by this report, no director had a material interest in a contract to which the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries was a party (other than their own service contract), requiring disclosure under the Companies Act 
2006 other than in respect of Custodian REIT plc and the rental of the office premises at MW House and Gateway House as disclosed  
in Note 29. 
Conflicts of interest
There are procedures in place to deal with any directors’ conflicts of interest arising under section 175 of the Companies Act 2006 and 
such procedures have operated effectively since the Company adopted new Articles of Association on 22 October 2009. 
Directors’ indemnity
All directors and officers of the Company have the benefit of the indemnity provision contained in the Company’s Articles of Association. 
The provision, which is a qualifying third party indemnity provision, was in force throughout the last two financial years and is currently 
still in force. The Group also purchased and maintained throughout the financial period Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
in respect of itself and its directors and officers, although no cover exists in the event directors or officers are found to have acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly. 
Employees
The Group continues to involve its staff in the future development of the business. Information is provided to employees through briefing 
sessions, the Group’s website and its intranet, ‘MWeb’, which is continually updated. 
The Group operates ‘MyWay’, an online flexible benefits platform. Employees can change elements of their benefits choice annually  
or if they have any lifestyle events. MyWay offers a variety of benefits covering health and wellbeing, finance and lifestyle choices, in 
addition to a core benefits package, and employees are able to purchase these benefits at group rates. MyWay shows employees the 
value of their salary and all other benefits as part of a total reward statement. The platform allows individuals to select options to meet 
their personal needs and since its launch we have seen an increasing take up of flexible benefits each year . 
The Group operates a Group Personal Pension plan available to all employees and contributes to the pension schemes of directors and 
employees. Following the introduction of auto-enrolment every employer must automatically enrol eligible jobholders into a workplace 
pension scheme. Employers are then required to make contributions to pension schemes, adding to the savings made by employees. 
Eligible employees may choose to opt out after they have been automatically enrolled. Employers cannot avoid their obligation to 
automatically enrol eligible employees into a qualifying scheme.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

Directors’ report continued
Employees continued
The Group’s pension scheme qualifies as an auto-enrolment scheme, with the Group applying the following minimum contribution rates:
    Minimum Minimum 
    employer  employee
Date    contribution contribution
Up to 5 April 2018    2% 1%
6 April 2018 to 5 April 2019    3% 3%
6 April 2019 onwards    4% 5%
The Group operates an Enterprise Management Incentive scheme, Share Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan, details of which 
are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements. 
The Group is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in employment, regardless of a person’s race, creed, colour, nationality, 
gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, religion or disability. Employment policies are fair, equitable and consistent with the 
skills and abilities of the employees and the needs of the business. 
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every 
effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. Group policy is that 
the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees. 
We continue to run a successful graduate training programme, have expanded our apprenticeship scheme and increased numbers 
in The Mattioli Woods Business Academy from eight to 12. We have increased the number of short duration work experience places 
available to local schools and colleges, while continuing to work in partnership with Gateway College Leicester, offering those 
considering an alternative route to higher education worthwhile work experience. We were pleased to be awarded Apprentice Employer 
of the Year by Leicester Apprenticeship Hub, demonstrating our commitment in this area. Apprenticeships offer work-based training 
programmes to develop new and existing staff across a range of business areas, fulfilling the Group’s commitment to creating 
opportunities that offer a clear progression path both in the short and long-term. 
We have launched an eLearning platform in conjunction with the Chartered Insurance Institute’s Financial Assess for the continued 
professional development of our staff. We are committed to continual process improvement and intend to roll-out business improvement 
techniques across our locations, following an initial launch in Leicester .
Research and development
In response to the need for an increasingly sophisticated software solution to manage the broader range of products and services offered 
by Mattioli Woods, the Group has continued to develop its technology infrastructure, extending the development of its bespoke pension 
administration and wealth management platform to include employee benefits, with the aim of enhancing the services offered to 
clients and realising operational efficiencies across the Group as a whole. The costs of this development are capitalised where they are 
recognised as having an economic value that will extend into the future and they meet the criteria of IAS 38 to be capitalised. 
Related party transactions
Details of related party transactions are given in Note 29. 
Environmental
The Board believes good environmental practices, such as the recycling of paper waste and purchase of fuel efficient motor vehicles, 
will support its strategy by enhancing the reputation of the Group. However, due to the nature of its business generally, the Group does 
not have a significant environmental impact. 
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company will be held on 26 October 2017. The Notice of Meeting is included with this 
document and contains further information on the ordinary and special business to be proposed at the meeting. Resolutions 9 and 10 
are the only special business being proposed. Resolution 9 renews the authorities previously granted to the Directors to (a) allot shares 
in the Company in connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive offer and (b) otherwise allot shares in the Company for cash up  
to a maximum nominal amount (representing approximately 5% of the share capital of the Company in issue at 15 September 2017),  
in each case as if the pre-emption rights of section 561 of the Act did not apply.
Resolution 10 seeks separate and additional authority in accordance with the Statement of Principles (“Statement of Principles”) issued 
by the Pre-Emption Group. The Statement of Principles states that in addition to the previous standard annual disapplication of pre-
emption rights of up to a maximum equal to 5% of issued ordinary share capital, the Pre-Emption Group is supportive of companies 
extending the general disapplication authority by an additional 5% for certain purposes. The Company intends to use the additional 5% 
only in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment. 
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company, every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by proxy and entitled 
to vote shall have one vote unless the proxy is appointed by more than one shareholder and has been instructed by one or more 
shareholders to vote for the resolution and by one or more shareholders to vote against the resolution, in which case the proxy has one 
vote for and one vote against. This is to reflect the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations which have amended the Companies Act 2006. Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
49
On a poll, every member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. None of 
the ordinary shares carry any special voting rights with regard to control of the Company. The Notice of AGM specifies deadlines for 
exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions to be passed at the AGM. The relevant proxy 
votes are counted and the number for, against or withheld in relation to each resolution are announced at the AGM. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The directors’ view of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business is summarised on pages 19 to 20 of the  
Chief Executive’s Review. 
Financial risk management
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are supervised in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). The Group must  
comply with the regulatory capital requirements set by the FCA and manages its regulatory capital through continuous review of the 
capital requirements of the Company and its regulated subsidiaries, which are monitored by the Group’s management and reported 
monthly to the Board. 
The Group’s financial risk management is based upon sound economic objectives and good corporate practice. The Board has overall 
responsibility for risk management and internal control. Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail on  
page 39 of the review of Corporate Governance. The key risks and mitigating factors are set out on pages 24 to 27. 
The Group seeks to manage financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet the identifiable needs of the Group and to 
invest cash assets safely and profitably. If required, short term flexibility is achieved through the use of bank overdraft facilities. The 
Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments. All activities are transacted in Sterling. The Group does not 
engage in any hedging activities. 
The Group reviews the credit quality of customers and limits credit exposures accordingly. All trade receivables are subject to credit risk 
exposure. However, there is no specific concentration of credit risk as the amounts recognised represent a large number of receivables 
from various customers. 
In agreeing budgets, the Board sets limits for debtors’ days and doubtful debts expense against which performance is monitored. 
Loans may be advanced to investment syndicates to secure new investment opportunities. In the event that a syndicate fails to raise 
sufficient funds to complete the investment, the Group may either take up ownership of part of the investment or lose some, or all, of 
the loan. However, to mitigate this risk, loans are only approved by the Board under strict criteria, which include confirmation of client 
demand for the investment. 
Corporate governance
A full review of Corporate Governance appears on pages 32 to 39. 
Auditor
RSM UK Audit LLP, who have been the Group’s auditor since 2005, have confirmed their willingness to continue in office as auditor in 
accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006. The Group is satisfied that RSM UK Audit LLP are independent and there are 
adequate safeguards in place to safeguard their objectivity. A resolution to re-appoint RSM UK Audit LLP as the Company’s auditor will 
be proposed at the 2017 AGM. In line with good corporate governance, the Audit Committee periodically reviews whether to put the 
audit services contract out to tender, to enable the Committee to compare the quality and effectiveness of the services provided by the 
incumbent auditor with those of other audit firms. 
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to the auditor
The directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving the Directors’ Report are listed on pages 32 and 33. Having made 
enquiries of fellow directors and of the Company’s auditor, each of these directors confirms that:
 » To the best of each director’s knowledge and belief, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware; and
 » Each director has taken all the steps they might reasonably be expected to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
Going concern
The directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Group’s forecasts and projections show that 
the Group should continue to be cash generative and able to operate within the level of its current financing arrangements. Accordingly, 
the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements. 
Events after the balance sheet date
Details of significant events occurring after the end of the reporting period are given in Note 32.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report, Strategic Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
UK company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year . The directors are 
required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. 
The financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the Group and Company 
and the financial performance of the Group. The Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in 
the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 » Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 » Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 » State whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the EU; and
 » Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company 
will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable 
them to ensure the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the  
Mattioli Woods plc website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Mattioli Woods plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 
31 May 2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company statements of financial 
position, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity, the consolidated and company statements of cash flows, and 
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
In our opinion the financial statements:
 » give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 May 2017 and of the group’s profit for 
the year then ended;
 » have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 » have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements  
in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) Ethical Standard as applied to SME listed entities and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
 » the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
 » the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 
twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. 
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, 
including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Business combinations and acquisition of investment in associate
Acquisitions of interests in other businesses have a material impact on the group financial statements. We reviewed the documented 
accounting rationale in respect of each acquisition and the purchase price allocation method applied, including reviewing the assets 
recognised for completeness. We audited the key assumptions made including conclusions on the nature of the interests acquired, 
assumptions used in valuations and the amortisation policy applied. 
We note the financial statements include descriptions of significant judgements being made by management and that the accounting 
policies set the basis of accounting for these items.
Trade receivables and accrued income recovery
We reviewed the processes undertaken to identify potential doubtful realisation which could impact on reported profits. We audited 
samples of balances for recovery and tested balances where receivables are passed credit terms. We reviewed the ageing analysis 
and profile of realisations and recovery rates. 
We note that the financial statements include disclosure of the significant judgements made by management for accrued income, 
time costs and disbursements, and the disclosure of balances past due but not impaired.
Our application of materiality
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we set certain thresholds which help us to determine the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effects of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
During planning we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judge would be material for the financial 
statements as a whole (FSM). During planning FSM was calculated as £800,000, which was not changed during the course of our audit. 
We agreed with the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee that we would report to them all unadjusted differences in excess of £20,000, 
as well as differences below those thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
An overview of the scope of our Audit
Our group audit approach focused on the parent company and five active trading subsidiaries. The audit was scoped to support  
our audit opinion on the group and parent company financial statements of Mattioli Woods plc and was based on group materiality  
and an assessment of risk at group level.

Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, 
other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required  
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.  
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required  
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 » the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 » the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
 » adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 » the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 » certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 » we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 50, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error . 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at: http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the financial statements
1.  Corporate information
Mattioli Woods plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, whose shares are 
publicly traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange plc. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are 
set out in the Chief Executive’s Review. 
2.  Basis of preparation and accounting policies 
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. 
The financial statements comprise the financial statements of Mattioli Woods plc and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as at 31 May 
each year . The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are 
measured at fair value (Notes 17, 21 and 26), and are presented in pounds, with all values rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 
(£000) except when otherwise indicated. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in this note and, unless otherwise stated, have been applied consistently to all 
periods presented in the financial statements. The financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution 
of the directors on 4 September 2017. 
2.2 Developments in reporting standards and interpretations
Standards affecting the financial statements
There have been no new or revised standards and interpretations that have been adopted in the current year and have affected the 
amounts reported in these financial statements. 
Standards not affecting the financial statements
The following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year:
  Periods commencing  
Standard or interpretation  on or after
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle 1 January 2016
IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements 1 January 2016
IAS 16 (amended) Property, Plant and Equipment 1 January 2016
IAS 27 (revised)  Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016
IAS 28 (amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 1 January 2016
IAS 38 (amended) Intangible Assets 1 January 2016
IFRS 10 (amended) Consolidated Financial Statements – Applying the Consolidation Exception 1 January 2016
IFRS 11 (amended) Joint Arrangements 1 January 2016
IFRS 12 (amended) Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities  1 January 2016
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting 
for future transactions and arrangements, or give rise to additional disclosures. 
Future new standards and interpretations 
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations will be effective for future annual periods commencing 
after 1 June 2016 and, therefore, have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. At the date of authorisation 
of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements 
were in issue but not yet effective: Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

2.2 Developments in reporting standards and interpretations continued
  Periods commencing  
Standard or interpretation  on or after
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle 1 January 2017/2018
IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2017
IAS 12  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 1 January 2017
IFRS 2 (amended) Share Based Payments – Classification and measurement 1 January 2018
IFRS 9  Financial Instruments  1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ are expected to have the most 
significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ are to become mandatory for periods commencing 
on or after 1 January 2018. These standards have been adopted by the EU and the Group does not plan to adopt these standards early. 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ could change the classification and measurement of financial assets and the timing and extent of 
credit provisioning. 
 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ could change how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers. 
The extent of their impact has not yet been fully determined. 
IFRS 16 ‘ Leases’ is not expected to become mandatory for periods commencing before 1 January 2019. It eliminates the classification 
of leases as either operating leases or finance leases. The Group will be required to recognise all leases with a term of more than 
12 months as a lease asset in its statement of financial position, together with a financial liability representing its obligation to make 
future lease payments. The extent of its impact has not yet been fully determined. 
Other than to expand certain disclosures within the financial statements, the directors do not expect the adoption of the other standards 
and interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in the future periods. 
2.3 Principal accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised 
gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. 
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase accounting method. This involves assessing whether any assets acquired 
meet the criteria for recognition as separately identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at their 
fair value at the date of acquisition. Client portfolios are valued by discounting their expected future cash flows over their expected useful 
lives, based on the Group’s historic experience. Expected future cash flows are estimated based on the historic revenues and costs 
associated with the operation of that client portfolio. The discount rates used estimate the cost of capital, adjusted for risk. 
Associates
The Company’s share of profits from associates is reported separately in the Statement of Comprehensive income and the investment is 
recognised in the Statement of Financial Position using the equity method. The investment is initially recorded at cost and subsequently 
adjusted to reflect the Company’s share of the cumulative profits of the associate since acquisition. Appropriate adjustments to the 
Company’s share of the profits or losses after acquisition are made to account for additional amortisation of the associate’s amortisable 
assets based on the excess of their fair values over their carrying amounts at the time the investment was acquired.
Group re-organisation
On 31 August 2016 the trade and assets of the Taylor Patterson Group Limited and its subsidiaries Taylor Patterson Financial Planning 
Limited and Taylor Patterson Associates Limited (together “the Business”) were transferred to the Company. The trade and assets were 
exchanged for loan notes equal to the book value of the assets and assumed liabilities of the Business as at 31 August 2016, attracting 
annual interest on the outstanding principal at a rate of 3% above the Bank of England base rate.
Notes to the financial statements continued STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017
59
Property, plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment is stated at cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment when that cost is incurred, if the 
recognition criteria are met. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write each asset down to its estimated residual value 
over its expected useful life as follows:
 » Assets under construction 2% per annum straightline;
 » Computer and office equipment 20/25% per annum on written down values;
 » Fixtures and fittings 20% per annum on written down values; 
 » Motor vehicles 25% per annum on written down values; and
 » Leasehold improvements Straight line over the term of the lease. 
Assets under construction are not depreciated until construction is complete. At the point when the asset becomes available for use, 
the assets will be transferred to the appropriate asset class and depreciated in line with the above policy. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use 
or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income in the year the asset is derecognised. 
The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial  
year end. 
Investments
The Group accounts for its investments in subsidiaries using the cost model and investments in associates using the equity method.
Short-term investments
Short-term investments include units in private property syndicates, which are measured at fair value.
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units, or groups 
of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units. 
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated:
 » Represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and
 » Is not larger than a segment based on the Group’s reporting format determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. 
If a cash generating unit was to be sold, the difference between the selling price and the net assets and goodwill would be recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income. Where the Group reorganises its reporting structure in a way that changes the composition of 
one or more cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated, the goodwill is reallocated to the units affected.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017
60
2.3 Principal accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either  
finite or indefinite. Intangible assets assessed as having finite lives are amortised over their useful economic life as follows:
 » Purchased software 25% per annum on written down values; and
 » Internally generated software Straight line over 10 years. 
Intangible assets assessed as having finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may 
be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at 
each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied 
in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting 
estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The Group amortises individual client portfolios acquired through business combinations on a straight-line basis over an estimated 
useful life based on the Group’s historic experience. 
Client portfolios acquired through business combinations are as follows:

Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication  
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s, or cash generating unit’s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use, 
and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent from those 
of other assets or group of assets. 
When the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less cost to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples or other 
available fair value indicators.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of 
the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used 
to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount 
of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case reversal is treated as a revaluation 
increase, except in relation to goodwill. 
The following criteria are also applied in assessing impairment of specific non-financial assets:
Goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group  
of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of  
cash-generating units) is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) to which  
goodwill has been allocated, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future 
periods. The Group performs its annual impairment test of goodwill as at 31 May. 
Financial assets
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
After initial measurement, loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
allowance for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and includes fees 
and transaction costs. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the loans and receivables are 
derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. 
Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with  
an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash 
and short-term deposits as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial assets
Derivative financial assets comprise an option contract to acquire the remaining ordinary share capital of an associate of the Group. 
Derivative financial assets are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken directly to the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. Fair values of derivatives are determined using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models 
and option pricing models as appropriate. 
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, and provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence 
(such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all 
of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an 
allowance account. 
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as not being collectible.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017
62
2.3 Principal accounting policies continued
Assets carried at amortised cost
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount 
of the loss is measured as a difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
(excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate  
(i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an 
allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, 
and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of 
impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial 
assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are 
individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective 
assessment for impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of 
an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does 
not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised at cost, due to their short term nature. Accruals and deferred income are normally settled 
monthly throughout the financial year, with the exemption of bonus accruals which are typically paid annually. 
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date  
of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right  
to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease, only if one of the following applies:
a) There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement;
b) A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included  
in the lease term;
c) There is a change in the determination of whether fulfilment is dependent on a specified asset; or
d) There is substantial change to the asset. 
Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting shall commence or cease from the date when the change in circumstances gave  
rise to the reassessment for scenarios a), c) or d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b). The Group has no 
finance lease arrangements. 
Group as a lessee
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the 
lease term. 
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the amortisation process.
Contingent consideration
Where the Group has entered into an acquisition agreement under which contingent consideration may be payable, management  
reviews the agreement and monitors the financial and other targets to be met to estimate the fair value of any amounts payable. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in 
accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is  
classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance 
contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to any provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income, net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value 
of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate which reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passing of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
Provisions include financial liabilities. Where the Group has entered into certain acquisition agreements that provide for contingent 
consideration to be paid the Board estimates the net present value of contingent consideration payable. 
Share based payments
The Group engages in share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees. In relation to equity 
settled share based payments, the fair value of services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options 
granted on the date of grant and is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, as an expense over the period in which 
the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the 
award (“the vesting date”). The fair value of share options is determined using the Black Scholes Merton pricing model. 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The statement of comprehensive income charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised 
as at the beginning and end of that period. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense if the terms had not been 
modified. An expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share based payment arrangement, 
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification. 
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as 
a replacement award on the date it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original 
award, as described in the previous paragraph.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the services received, measured initially at the fair value of the 
liability. At the date on which the liability is settled, and at the date of each statement of financial position between grant date and 
settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with any changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income for the year . 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share (further details 
are given in Note 13).
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or 
duty. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised.
Rendering of services
Mattioli Woods generally invoices its pension clients six months in arrears for time costs incurred in advising on and administering their 
affairs. Revenue is recognised as time is spent/incurred on the provision of services, with an estimate being made of what proportion 
of uninvoiced time costs will be recoverable. Recoverability is measured as a percentage of the total time costs incurred on clients’ 
affairs compared to the proportion of these time costs actually invoiced during the year . No revenue is recognised if there are significant 
uncertainties regarding recovery of the time incurred.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017
64
2.3 Principal accounting policies continued
Commission income and adviser charges
Commission (less provision for clawbacks) and adviser charges are recognised as being earned at the point when an investment of funds 
has been made by the client and submitted to the product provider . 
Interest income
Revenue is recognised as interest accrues (using the effective interest method that is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset). 
Taxes
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from 
or repaid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date. 
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax balances are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except where the deferred income tax balance arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax 
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the 
carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that 
future taxable profit will allow the deferred income tax asset to be recovered. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised 
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. 
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of comprehensive 
income. Deferred income tax assets related to temporary differences arising on share-based payments to employees are based on the 
market value of the Company’s shares at the year end. 
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
Sales tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except:
 » Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the 
sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
 » Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included. 
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
statement of financial position. 
Dividend recognition
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the accounting period in which the dividends are declared and 
paid, or if earlier, in the accounting period when the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
Pension costs
The Group makes discretionary payments into the personal pension schemes of certain employees. Contributions are charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income as they are payable.

2.4 Key sources of judgements and estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. If in the future such estimates and 
assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial statements, deviate from 
actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances 
change. The areas where a higher degree of judgement or complexity arises, or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
consolidated financial statements, are discussed below. 
Impairment of client portfolios
The Group reviews whether acquired client portfolios are impaired at least on an annual basis. This comprises an estimation of the  
fair value less cost to sell and the value in use of the acquired client portfolios. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash  
flows expected to arise from each client portfolio are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects  
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset. 
The key assumptions used in respect of value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and anticipated changes to revenues 
and costs during the period covered by the calculations. Changes to revenue and costs are based upon management’s expectation. 
The Group prepares its annual budget and five-year cash flow forecasts derived therefrom, thereafter extrapolating these cash flows 
using a terminal growth rate of 2.5% (2016: 2.5%), which management considers conservative against industry average long-term 
growth rates. 
The key assumption used in arriving at a fair value less costs to sell requires a valuation based on earnings multiples and  
values based on assets under management. These have been determined by looking at valuations of similar businesses and the 
consideration paid in comparable transactions. Management has used a range of multiples resulting in an average of 7.5x EBITDA  
to arrive at a fair value. 
The carrying amount of client portfolios at 31 May 2017 was £25.2m (2016: £25.4m). No impairment provisions have been made during 
the year (2016: £nil) based upon the directors’ review. 
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use  
of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects  
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset. Details of the cash-generating units  
are contained in Note 18. 
The key assumptions used in respect of value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and anticipated changes to revenues 
and costs during the period covered by the calculations, based upon management’s expectation. The carrying amount of goodwill at  
31 May 2017 was £17.3m (2016: £16.4m). No impairment provisions have been made during the year (2016: £nil) based upon the 
directors’ review. 
Internally generated capitalised software
The costs of internal software developments are capitalised where they are judged to have an economic value that will extend into 
the future and meet the recognition criteria in IAS 38. Internally generated software is then amortised over an estimated useful life, 
assessed by taking into consideration the useful life of comparable software packages. The carrying amount of internally generated 
capitalised software at 31 May 2017 was £1.1m (2016: £1.1m).  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017
66
2.4 Key sources of judgements and estimation uncertainty continued
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets include temporary differences related to employee benefits settled via the issue of share options. Recognition of 
the deferred tax assets assumes share options will have a positive value at the date of vesting, which is greater than the exercise price. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets at 31 May 2017 was £0.8m (2016: £0.7m). 
Interests in associates
Associates are entities in which the Group owns less than 100% of voting rights and has significant influence, but not control or joint 
control over the financial and operating policies. In determining whether control exists, this requires significant judgements in assessing 
factors such as the structure of the investment and the contractual agreement. The existence of significant influence is evidenced by the 
Group having representation on the board and the ability to participate in decisions but not being able to control the vote. The carrying 
amount of the investment in associate at 31 May 2017 was £3.5m (2016: £nil).
Recoverability of accrued time costs and disbursements
The Group recognises accrued income in respect of time costs and disbursements incurred on clients’ affairs during the accounting 
period, which have not been invoiced at the reporting date. This requires an estimation of the recoverability of the time costs and 
disbursements incurred but not invoiced to clients. The carrying amount of accrued time costs and disbursements at 31 May 2017  
was £4.5m (2016: £4.6m). 
Accrued income 
Accrued income is recognised in respect of fees, adviser charges and commissions due to the Group on investments and bank deposits 
placed during the accounting period which have not been received at the reporting date. This requires an estimation of the amount of 
income that will be received subsequent to the reporting date in respect of the accounting period, which is based on the value of historic 
receipts and investments placed by clients under management and advice. The carrying amount of accrued income at 31 May 2017 was 
£3.2m (2016: £2.5m). 
Acquisitions and business combinations
When an acquisition arises the Group is required under IFRS to calculate the Purchase Price Allocation (“PPA”). The PPA requires 
companies to report the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and it establishes useful lives for identified assets. The identification 
and the valuation of the assets and liabilities acquired involves estimation and judgement when determining whether the recognition 
criteria are met. The classification of consideration payable as either purchase consideration or remuneration is an area of judgement 
and estimate. 
Subjectivity is also involved in PPA with the estimation of the future value of brands, technology, customer relationships and goodwill. 
Contingent consideration payable on acquisitions
The Group has entered into certain acquisition agreements that provide for a contingent consideration to be paid. A financial instrument 
is recognised for all amounts management anticipates will be paid under the relevant acquisition agreement. This requires management 
to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the acquired business and determine a suitable discount rate for the 
calculation of the present value of any deferred contingent consideration payments. The carrying amount of contingent consideration 
provided for at 31 May 2017 was £4.4m (2016: £5.8m). 
Provisions
As detailed in Note 26, the Group recognises provisions for client claims, contingent consideration payable on acquisitions, commission 
clawbacks, cash-settled share based payment awards and other obligations which exist at the reporting date. These provisions are 
estimates and the actual amount and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Management reviews these provisions 
at each reporting date to ensure they are measured at the current best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. 
Any difference between the amounts previously recognised and the current estimate is recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income.

3. Business combinations
The Group completed one acquisition during the year . Transaction costs of £0.1m incurred during the course of the acquisition have been 
expensed and are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and operating cash flows 
in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the period in which they were incurred. 
Acquisition of MC Trustees Limited
On 7 September 2016, Mattioli Woods plc acquired the entire issued share capital of Old Station Road Holdings Limited and its 
subsidiaries (together “MC Trustees”), a pension administration business based in Hampton-in-Arden in the West Midlands.  
The acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method. The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities  
of MC Trustees as at the date of acquisition was:

MC Trustees specialises in the provision of personal service and strong technical advice. It is an excellent cultural and strategic fit with 
Mattioli Woods’ existing pension business, providing pension administration and trustee services to over 1,500 SIPP and SSAS clients 
with over £400m of assets under administration. The acquisition brings additional scale to Mattioli Woods’ existing operations and offers 
the opportunity to transfer MC Trustees’ business onto Mattioli Woods’ bespoke pension administration platform.

3. Business combinations continued
Acquisition of MC Trustees Limited continued
Synergies include the ability to promote additional services to existing and prospective clients of MC Trustees. In addition, the acquisition 
added further specialist expertise to the Group and its experienced management team has remained with the business. The goodwill 
recognised above is attributed to the expected benefits from combining the assets and activities of MC Trustees with those of the Group. 
The primary components of this residual goodwill comprise:
 » Revenue synergies expected to be available to Mattioli Woods as a result of the transaction;
 » The workforce;
 » The knowledge and know-how resident in MC Trustees’ modus operandi; and
 » New opportunities available to the combined business, as a result of both MC Trustees and the existing business becoming part  
of a more sizeable listed company. 
None of the recognised goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The client portfolio is being amortised  
on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life based on the Group’s historic experience. 
From the date of acquisition MC Trustees has contributed £1.22m to revenue and £0.21m to the Group profit for the year . If the 
combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, Group revenue from continuing operations would have been £51.0m  
and the profit for the year would have been £6.3m. 
Contingent consideration
The Group has entered into certain acquisition agreements that provide for contingent consideration to be paid. These agreements 
and the basis of calculation of the net present value of the contingent consideration are summarised below. While it is not possible to 
determine the exact amount of contingent consideration (as this will depend on the performance of the acquired businesses during the 
period), the Group estimates the fair value of contingent consideration payable within the next 12 months is £2.8m (2016: £2.3m). 
On 7 September 2016 the Group acquired MC Trustees for total consideration of up to £2.5m, comprising initial consideration of £1.23m 
in cash plus 38,081 new ordinary shares of 1p each in Mattioli Woods plus contingent consideration of up to £1.0m payable in cash in the 
two years following completion if certain financial target based on growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
are met. The Group estimates the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration at 31 May 2017 to be £0.9m using cash flows 
approved by the Board covering the contingent consideration period and expects the maximum contingent consideration will be payable. 
 
On 8 September 2015 the Group acquired Taylor Patterson for an initial consideration comprising cash of £2.1m (excluding cash 
acquired with the business) and 419,888 shares in Mattioli Woods, plus contingent consideration of £3.3m payable in cash in the three 
years following completion if certain revenue and profit targets are met. The Group estimates the fair value of the remaining contingent 
consideration at 31 May 2017 to be £2.2m (2016: £3.1m) using cash flows approved by the Board covering the contingent consideration 
period and expects the maximum contingent consideration will be payable. 
On 23 June 2015 the Group acquired Boyd Coughlan for initial consideration comprising cash of £3.9m (excluding cash acquired  
with the business) and 235,742 shares in Mattioli Woods, plus contingent consideration of £2.5m payable in cash in the two years 
following completion if certain profit targets are met. The Group estimates the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration  
at 31 May 2017 to be £1.2m (2016: £2.4m) using cash flows approved by the Board covering the contingent consideration period and 
expects the maximum contingent consideration will be payable. 
On 11 August 2014 the Group acquired UKWM Pensions for initial cash consideration of £0.28m (excluding cash acquired with  
the business) plus contingent consideration of £0.08m payable in cash in the two years following completion if certain revenue  
targets are met. The Group estimates the net present value of the remaining contingent consideration at 31 May 2017 to be £0.04m 
(2016: £0.04m) using cash flows approved by the Board covering the contingent consideration period and expects the remaining 
contingent consideration will be payable. 
On 23 April 2013, the Group acquired the trade and certain assets of Ashcourt Rowan Administration Limited, 100% of the share  
capital of Ashcourt Rowan Pension Trustees Limited and 100% of the share capital of Robinson Gear (Management Services) Limited 
for an initial cash consideration of £0.66m plus contingent consideration of up to £0.625m payable in cash in the five years following 
completion if certain targets are met based on growth in revenues and client retention during that period. During the year £0.25m of the 
remaining consideration payable was released to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as the number of new scheme referrals were 
lower than target. The Group estimates that at 31 May 2017 no further consideration will be payable so the remaining consideration is 
£nil (2016: £0.25m) using cash flows approved by the Board covering the contingent consideration period.

5. Seasonality of operations
Historically, revenues in the second half-year have been typically higher than in the first half, primarily due to SSAS scheme year 
ends being linked to the sponsoring company’s year end, which is often in December or March, coupled with the end of the fiscal year 
being 5 April. Despite growth in the number of SIPP schemes under administration and further diversification of the Group’s wealth 
management and employee benefits revenue streams, the directors believe there is still some seasonality of operations, although  
a substantial element of the Group’s revenues are geared to the prevailing economic and market conditions. 
6. Segment information 
The Group’s objective is to fully integrate the businesses it acquires, to enable it to deliver holistic solutions across its wide and diverse 
client base. During the year, the Group transferred the trade and assets of the Taylor Patterson Group Limited and its subsidiaries into 
Mattioli Woods. The Group’s operating segments comprise the following:
 » Pension consultancy and administration – fees earned by Mattioli Woods for setting up and administering pension schemes. 
Additional fees are generated from consultancy services provided for special one-off activities and the provision of bespoke scheme 
banking arrangements. In prior years, fees earned for setting up and administering pension schemes under an advice led model 
were reported separately for setting up and administering pension schemes under an administration only model. Following the 
transfer of the trade and assets of City Pensions Limited to Mattioli Woods, these fees are reported as one operating segment;
 » Investment and asset management – income generated from the management and placing of investments on behalf of clients;
 » Property management – income generated where Custodian Capital manages collective property investment vehicles, facilitates 
direct commercial property investments on behalf of clients or acts as the external discretionary manager for Custodian REIT plc; 
and
 » Employee benefits – income generated by the Group’s employee benefits operations. 
Each segment represents a revenue stream subject to risks and returns that are different to other operating segments, although 
each operating segment’s products and services are offered to broadly the same market. The Group operates exclusively within the 
United Kingdom.
Operating segments
The operating segments defined above all utilise the same intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and the segments have 
been financed as a whole, rather than individually. The Group’s operating segments are managed together as one business. Accordingly, 
certain costs are not allocated across the individual operating segments, as they are managed on a group basis. Segment profit or loss 
reflects the measure of segment performance reviewed by the Board of Directors (the Chief Operating Decision Maker). 
The following tables present revenue and profit information regarding the Group’s operating segments for the two years ended  
31 May 2017 and 2016 respectively.

Segment assets exclude property, plant and equipment, certain items of computer software, investments, current and deferred tax 
balances, and cash balances, as these assets are considered corporate in nature and are not allocated to a specific operating segment. 
Acquired intangibles and amortisation thereon relate to a specific transaction and are allocated between individual operating segments 
based on the headcount or revenue mix of the cash generating units at the time of acquisition. The subsequent delivery of services to 
acquired clients may be across a number or all operating segments, comprising different operating segments to those the acquired 
intangibles have been allocated to. 
Liabilities have not been allocated between individual operating segments, as they cannot be allocated on anything other than an 
arbitrary basis. 
Corporate costs
Certain administrative expenses including acquisition costs, amortisation of software, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, 
irrecoverable VAT, legal and professional fees and professional indemnity insurance are not allocated between segments that are 
managed on a unified basis and utilise the same intangible and tangible assets. 
Finance income and expenses, gains and losses on the disposal of assets, taxes, intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities 
are not allocated to individual segments as they are managed on a group basis. Capital expenditure consists of additions of property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets, including assets from the acquisition of subsidiaries.

The UK Government reduced the rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. Changes to the UK corporation 
tax rates were enacted as part of the Finance (No.2) Act 2015 which received Royal Assent on 18 November 2015, including the reduction 
of the main rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017. A further reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020 was enacted in the Finance Act 
2016 on 23 September 2016 and hence UK deferred tax has been recognised at 17%.

13. Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year . 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that 
would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
The income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations is as follows:
    2017 2016
    £000 £000
Net profit and diluted net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company   6,356 5,245
  
Weighted average number of ordinary shares:    000s 000s
Issued ordinary shares at start period    25,205 20,372

Effect of dilutive options at the statement of financial position date     101 90
Diluted weighted average number of shares    25,761 25,150
The Company has granted options under the Share Option Plan, the Consultants’ Share Option Plan and the LTIP to certain of its  
senior managers and directors to acquire (in aggregate) up to 3.33% of its issued share capital (see Note 19). Under IAS 33 Earnings  
Per Share, contingently issuable ordinary shares are treated as outstanding and included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  
if the conditions (the events triggering the vesting of the option) are satisfied. At 31 May 2017 the conditions attached to 777,480 options 
granted under the LTIP were not satisfied (2016: 696,574). If the conditions had been satisfied, diluted earnings per share would have 
been 24.0p per share (2016: 20.3p). 
Since the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements the following transactions have taken place involving 
ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares: 
 » The issue of 38,011 ordinary shares to satisfy the exercise of options under the Consultants’ Share Option Plan; 
 » The issue of 19,352 ordinary shares under the Mattioli Woods plc Share Incentive Plan; and
 » The issue of 9,819 ordinary shares to satisfy the exercise of options under the LTIP.

Software
Software is amortised over its useful economic life of four years on a reducing balance basis. Internally generated software represents 
the development costs of the Group’s bespoke customer relationship management, administration and trading platform. The directors 
believe this technology will be the principal technology platform used throughout the Group for the foreseeable future. Internally 
generated software is amortised on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 10 years. 
Client portfolios
Client portfolios represent individual client portfolios acquired through business combinations. Client portfolios are amortised 
on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of between 10 and 25 years, based on the Group’s historic experience. 
 
Goodwill
Goodwill arises where the price paid for an acquisition is greater than the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill arising on 
business combinations is subject to annual impairment testing (see Note 18).
Other intangibles
Other intangibles represent external costs incurred in obtaining a licence. Other intangibles are amortised on a straight-line basis over 
a useful economic life of three years.

Investment in associate
On 6 February 2017 the Group acquired 49% of the ordinary share capital of Amati Global Investors Limited (“Amati”) from Amati Global 
Partners LLP plus an option over the remaining ordinary share capital of Amati for a total consideration of £3.39m, comprising £1.65m in 
cash and £1.74m of new ordinary shares in Mattioli Woods. 
Amati is a fund management firm founded in 2010 by Paul Jourdan and Douglas Lawson following the management buyout of Noble Fund 
Managers Limited. It focuses on small and mid-sized companies, with a universe ranging from fully listed constituents of the FTSE Mid 
250 and FTSE Small Cap indices, to stocks quoted on AIM. At the date of acquisition it managed £120m of funds, including the TB Amati 
UK Smaller Companies Fund: (“TB Amati”); two AIM Venture Capital Trusts - Amati VCT and Amati VCT 2; and an AIM IHT portfolio service. 
Amati's principal place of business is the United Kingdom.
The Group exercises significant influence by virtue of its contractual right to appoint a minority of directors to Amati’s board of directors. 
The option held by the Group to acquire the remaining shares in Amati is not exercisable until 6 February 2019. In addition, the Group has 
no other rights which would allow it to exercise control over Amati’s operations. Therefore, the Group is not judged to control Amati and it 
is not consolidated. 
The movement in the Group's investment in associate is as follows:

two conditional sale agreements (“the Agreements”) to acquire freehold land with vacant possession (the “Development Land”). 
However, the Agreements have been terminated and at 31 May 2017 the Company’s investment in Mainsforth was valued at £nil  
(2016: £nil). 
At 1 June 2016 the Company owned 9.40% of the shareholding in MW Properties (No.25) Limited (“MWPS25”), acquired at a total cost 
of £90,769. MWPS25 owns part of the Development Land. At 31 May 2017 these shares are included within investments at a value of

At 31 May 2017 these shares are included within investments at a value of £14,787 (2016: £14,956), with an impairment of £169 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income during the period (2016: £nil).

18. Impairment of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is allocated to the cash generating units comprising the acquired businesses. Where the Group 
reorganises its operating and reporting structures in a way that changes the composition of one or more cash-generating units  
to which goodwill has been allocated, the goodwill is reallocated to the units affected. 
During the year ended 31 May 2015, the Group reorganised its structure in such a way that the composition of the cash-generating units 
to which goodwill had been previously allocated was altered. Accordingly, goodwill was reallocated to cash-generating units based on 
headcount or revenues at the date of acquisition. 
The cash-generating units now comprise the same groups of assets as the four operating segments, which represent the smallest 
individual groups of assets generating cash flows. Goodwill has been allocated between the Group’s operating segments for impairment 
testing, as follows:

At 31 May 2017 4,828 6,741 188 3,134 14,891
The determination of whether goodwill is impaired requires an assessment of the fair value less cost to sell and estimation of the value 
in use of the operating segments to which the goodwill has been allocated. The recoverable amount of goodwill on a fair value less costs 
to sell calculation is based on the closing share price of the Group on 31 May 2017 of 819.5p, giving a market capitalisation of £211.3m. 
Comparing this to the net asset value of the Group of £72.6m, the directors believe the value of goodwill is not impaired at 31 May 2017. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows of each operating segment are discounted to their present value using  
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  
The estimated cash flows are derived by extrapolating the actual cash flows for the year ended 31 May 2017 using a terminal growth  
rate of 2.5% (2016: 2.5%), which management considers conservative against actual average long-term growth rates, and discounting  
at a pre-tax discount rate of 6.9%. 
The value in use calculated at 31 May 2017 was £149.5m. Comparing this to the net asset value of the operating segments identified 
above, the directors believe the value of goodwill is not impaired at 31 May 2017. This accounting treatment resulted in an impairment 
loss of £nil (2016: £nil).

Consultants’ Share Option Plan
The Company also operates the Consultants’ Share Option Plan by which certain senior executives are able to subscribe for ordinary 
shares in the Company. Options granted under the Consultants’ Share Option Plan are summarised as follows:
    Exercised
  Exercise  At 1 June during the At 31 May

   143,925 (43,572) 100,353
The exercise price of the options is equal to the market price of the shares at the close of business on the day immediately preceding 
the date of grant. The options vest when the option holders achieve certain individual performance hurdles. No options vested during the 
year as a result of the associated performance conditions being fulfilled. If the performance hurdles, which are linked to individual sales 
revenues, are not met over the five financial years commencing on 1 June before the date of grant, the options lapse. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
During the year, Mattioli Woods granted awards to the Company’s executive directors and certain senior employees under the LTIP. 
Conditional share awards (“Equity-settled”) grant participating employees a conditional right to become entitled to options with an 
exercise price of 1p over ordinary shares in the Company. Conditional cash awards (“Cash-settled”) grant participating employees a 
conditional right to be paid a cash amount based on the proceeds of the sale of a specified number of Ordinary Shares following the 
vesting of the award. Movements in the LTIP scheme during the period were as follows:
  31 May  31 May 31 May 31 May

The LTIP awards are subject to the achievement of corporate profitability targets measured over a three year performance period and 
will vest following publication of the Group’s audited results for the final performance year . The amounts shown above represent the 
maximum opportunity for the participants in the LTIP. 
Share Incentive Plan 
The Company introduced the Mattioli Woods plc Share Incentive Plan (“the SIP”) in July 2008. Participants in the SIP are entitled to 
purchase, at market value, up to a prescribed number of new 1p ordinary shares in the Company at the end of each month for which they 
will receive a like for like matching share. These ordinary shares rank pari passu with existing issued ordinary shares of the Company.
A total of 94,392 (2016: 99,972) new ordinary shares were issued to the 308 (2016: 218) employees who participated in the SIP during the 
year . At 31 May 2017 the SIP held 553,658 (2016: 508,218) shares on their behalf. 
Share based payments expense
The expense for share based payments made in respect of employee services under the LTIP is recognised over the expected vesting 
period of the awards. The expense recognised during the year ended 31 May 2017 is £1,610,790 (2016: £1,351,505), of which £949,395 
arises from equity-settled share based payment transactions (2016: £595,665) and £661,395 arises from cash-settled share based 
payment transactions (2016: £755,841). 
The expense for share based payments made in respect of employee services under the Share Option Plan and the Consultants’ Share 
Option Plan is recognised over the expected vesting period of the awards. The expense recognised during the year ended 31 May 2017 
was £nil (2016: £nil), which arises entirely from equity-settled share based payment transactions. 
The expense for share based payments in respect of “Matching shares” issued under the SIP is recognised in the period the shares  
are granted to the participating employee (see Note 23). The expense recognised during the year ended 31 May 2017 is £291,146  
(2016: £242,913), which arises entirely from equity-settled share based payment transactions.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £7.31 (2016: £5.48). For the 
share options outstanding as at 31 May 2017, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 4.0 years (2016: 4.0 years). The WAEP 
for options outstanding at the end of the year was £0.27 (2016: £0.43), with the option exercise prices ranging from £0.01 to £2.79. 
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black Scholes Merton model, taking 
into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used to 
estimate the fair value of options granted during the year ended 31 May 2017:
      
     LTIP
Share price at date of grant     £6.55
Option exercise price     £0.01
Expected life of option (years)     4.5
Expected share price volatility (%)     17.5
Dividend yield (%)     2.21
Risk-free interest rate (%)     0.81
The share price at date of grant for options issued under the LTIP is based on the market value of the shares on that date. The expected 
life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur . The expected volatility 
reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. 
No other features of options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
The share price at 31 May 2017 and movements during the year are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Loan notes due to subsidiary undertakings
On 31 August 2016 the trade and assets of the Taylor Patterson Group Limited and its subsidiaries Taylor Patterson Financial Planning 
Limited and Taylor Patterson Associates Limited (together “the Business”) were transferred to the Company. The trade and assets were 
exchanged for loan notes equal to the book value of the assets and assumed liabilities of the Business as at 31 August 2016, attracting 
annual interest on the outstanding principal at a rate of 3% above the Bank of England base rate.
Contingent consideration
The Group has entered into certain acquisition agreements that provide for contingent consideration to be paid. Details of these 
agreements and the basis of calculation of the net present value of the contingent consideration is summarised in Note 3. The Group 
estimates the net present value of the financial liability payable within the next 12 months is £2.8m (2016: £2.3m). 
Client claims
A provision is recognised for the estimated potential liability when the Group becomes aware of a possible client claim. No discount rate 
is applied to the projected cash flows due to their short term nature. 
Dilapidations 
Under the terms of the leases for the Group’s premises, the Group has an obligation to return the properties in a specified condition 
at the end of the lease term. The Group provides for the estimated net present value of the cost of any dilapidations. The discount rate 
applied to the cash flow projections is 5.0%. 
Clawbacks 
The Group receives certain initial commissions on indemnity terms and hence the Group provides for the expected level of clawback, 
based on past experience. No discount rate is applied to the projected cash flows due to their short term nature. 
Onerous contracts
The Group acquired onerous contracts for the provision of certain IT systems on the acquisition of Ashcourt Rowan’s pension business 
and on the acquisition of UKWM Pensions. Management has assessed the expected benefits and costs associated with these contracts 
and concluded that the costs of the obligation exceed the benefits to the extent that it is appropriate to provide against these contracts  
in full. 
LTIP cash liability
The Group has granted cash settled options to certain Executive Directors. The amount of any cash entitlement on vesting of an award 
will be directly linked to the value of a specified number of the Company’s shares at the vesting date.

Capital commitments
At 31 May 2017 the Group had capital commitments amounting to £7.6m (2016: £14.0m). In August 2015, Mattioli Woods (New Walk) 
Limited entered into a development agreement with Ingleby (1245) Limited, a company owned and controlled by Sowden Group Limited 
to build a new 50,000 square foot office on the site of the former Leicester City Council headquarters at New Walk, Leicester . 
The expected expenditure for the development is circa £15.0m including fit out costs and irrecoverable VAT, which will be funded 
through a combination of existing cash resources, bank funding and future operating cashflows. Construction commenced in May 2016, 
with construction scheduled to complete in late 2017 for occupancy in 2018. 
There are pre-existing conditions retained by Leicester City Council over the transfer of title of the land to Mattioli Woods, which the 
directors are confident will be satisfied on completion of the development.
Sponsorship agreement
In July 2016, the Group entered in to a three-year sponsorship agreement with rugby giants Leicester Tigers to strengthen the Group’s 
brand awareness. The agreement includes shirt sponsorship on the Tigers’ home and away shirts, a dedicated Mattioli Woods stand at

27. Commitments and contingencies continued
Client claims
The Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to certain litigation risks. As a result, the Group occasionally 
receives claims in respect of products and services provided and which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Group provides for 
potential losses that may arise out of contingencies (Note 27). 
In-specie pension contributions
As has been widely reported in the media, HMRC has recently challenged all SIPP providers on whether pension contributions could 
be made in-specie. As a result there are a number of tax relief claims made on behalf of our clients that have been challenged and we 
expect to receive assessment notices which could amount to £0.9m. These will be appealed. 
Irrespective of the result of HMRC’s claims, the impact on the financial position of the Group is expected to be neutral. 
FSCS levy
The arrangements put in place by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) to protect depositors and investors from loss 
in the event of failure of financial institutions has resulted in significant levies on the industry in recent years. 
There is uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies as they depend on the ultimate cost to the FSCS of industry failures.  
The group contributes to the investment intermediation levy class and accrues levy costs for future levy years when the obligation  
arises. No provision has been made in these financial statements for any FSCS interim levy in the year ended 31 May 2017. 
28. Pension costs
The Group makes discretionary and contractual payments into the personal pension schemes of employees and contributions are 
charged in the statement of comprehensive income as they become payable. The charge for the year was £435,056 (2016: £390,510).

30. Financial risk management
Financial assets principally comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations. 
Financial liabilities comprise certain provisions and trade and other payables. The main risks arising from financial instruments are 
market risk (including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk. Each of these risks is 
discussed in detail below. 
The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis, with its financial risk management based upon sound economic objectives 
and good corporate practice. No hedging transactions have taken place during the years presented. 
Market risk
(a) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in interest bearing assets. There is an exposure 
to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business. At 31 May 2017 the value of financial instruments on the 
Group’s statement of financial position exposed to interest rate risk was £23.0m (2016: £29.8m) comprising cash, cash equivalents and 
financial assets. This exposure is monitored to ensure that the Group is maximising its interest earning potential within accepted liquidity 
and credit constraints. Other than short term overdrafts, the Group has no external borrowings and as such is not exposed to interest 
rate or refinancing risk on borrowings. Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short term 
deposits are also made for varying periods of between one day and 12 months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the 
Group and earn interest at the respective fixed term deposit rates. 
A source of revenue is based on the value of client cash under administration. The Group has an indirect exposure to interest rate risk  
on these cash balances held for clients. These balances are not on the Company or Group statements of financial position. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 100bps (1%) change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the 
Group’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate deposits). There is no impact on the Group’s equity.

(b) Foreign exchange translation and transaction risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates. With all of 
the Group’s business located within the UK, the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange translation or transaction risk and does not 
hedge any foreign current assets or liabilities. 
(c) Price risk
Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts the profitability of the Group as a result of an asset not 
meeting its expected value. The Group is exposed to price risk on corporate investments held on the Group’s statement of financial 
position. At 31 May 2017, the fair value of investments and derivative financial assets recognised on the Group’s statement of financial 
position was £196,122 (2016: £79,405). Any move in the value of these investments would not have a material impact on the Group 
balance sheet or results. 
Property administration fees, discretionary management charges and adviser charges for intermediation are based on the value  
of client assets under administration and hence the Group has an indirect exposure to security price risk on investments held by  
clients. These assets are not on the Group’s statement of financial position. The risk of lower revenues is partially mitigated by asset  
class diversification. The Group does not hedge its revenue exposure to movements in the value of client assets arising from these risks 
and so the interests of the Group are aligned to those of its clients. 
Credit risk
The Group trades only with third parties it recognises as being creditworthy. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an  
ongoing basis. 
Credit risk from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, arises from default of the 
counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by considering the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets  
(e.g. accounts receivables, other financial assets) and projected cash flows from operations.
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans 
and leases. The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 May 2017 and 2016 based  
on contractual undiscounted payments:

Capital management
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are supervised in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). The Group manages its 
capital through continuous review of the capital requirements of the Company and its regulated subsidiaries, which are monitored by the 
Group’s management and reported monthly to the Board. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
 » To comply with the regulatory capital requirements set by the FCA; 
 » To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders; and
 » To maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business. 
Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves. Total capital at 31 May 2017 
was £72.6m (2016: £65.6m). The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic 
conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders or issue new shares. 
Regulatory capital is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive (“the CRD”) prescribed 
in the UK by the FCA, and the Group’s regulatory capital comprises Tier 1 capital, which is the total of issued share capital, retained 
earnings and reserves created by appropriations of externally verified retained earnings, net of the book value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets. The Group does not hold any Tier 2 or Tier 3 capital. 
From 30 April 2012, all regulated entities within the Group have been required to meet the Pillar 1 Capital Resources Requirements 
set out in the CRD. The Group is also required to comply with the CRD’s requirements under Pillar 2 (Operational Risk) and Pillar 3 
(Disclosure). The CRD requires continual assessment of the Group’s risks to ensure that the higher of Pillar 1 and 2 requirements is 
met. Under the Pillar 3 requirements, the Group must disclose regulatory capital information and has done so by making the disclosures 
available on the Group’s website at www.mattioliwoods.com. 
The latest version of the CRD legislation (“CRD IV”) came into effect on 1 January 2014. The aim of CRD IV is to minimise the negative 
effects of firms failing by ensuring that firms hold enough financial resources to cover the risk associated with their business. CRD IV 
is the fourth amendment of the CRD legislation. Each amendment strengthens the prudential framework for individual institutions and 
responds to financial stability concerns that arose during the banking crisis. 
The Company and regulated subsidiary companies submit quarterly returns to the FCA relating to their capital resources. At 31 May 2017 
the total regulatory capital requirement across the Group was £10.0m (2016: £8.5m) and the Group had an aggregate surplus of £9.7m 
(2016: £10.1m) across all regulated entities. All the regulated firms within the Group maintained surplus regulated capital throughout 
the year . The regulated subsidiaries are limited in the distributions that can be paid up to the Company by each of their individual capital 
resource requirements.  Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017

31. Financial instruments
Fair values
The directors consider that the carrying value of financial instruments in the Company’s and the Group’s financial statements is 
equivalent to fair value. The following table summarises the fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position  
by class of asset or liability and categorised by level according to the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

   prices in active
   markets for Significant other Significant

Contingent consideration  4,418 — — 4,418
At 31 May 2017  5,262 — 844 4,418
The fair value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to their  
short-term nature. 
Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of the option contract is calculated using an option valuation model. The key assumptions used to value the option in the 
model are the value of shares in the associate (based on growth of funds under management and the valuation multiples of similar 
businesses), the option exercise price, the expected life of the option, the expected share price volatility of similar businesses, forecast 
dividends and the risk-free interest rate. Management has assessed that changing one or more of the key assumptions to reasonably 
possible alternatives would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the contract. 
The gain relating to the derivative financial instrument is included within ‘operating profit’. There were no other gains or losses arising 
from changes in the fair value of financial instruments categorised as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 
Contingent consideration
As set out in Note 3, the Group has entered into certain acquisition agreements that provide for contingent consideration to be paid. 
While the exact amounts payable cannot be determined (as these depend on the future performance of the acquired businesses) the 
Group estimates the fair value of contingent consideration payable on acquisitions to be £4.4m (2016: £5.8m). 
Interest rate risk
The following table sets out the carrying amount after taking into account provisions for impairment, by maturity, of the Company’s and 
the Group’s financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk:

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year . Other financial instruments of 
the Company and Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and short term deposits and trade and other receivables. The only significant 
concentrations of credit risk relate to the Group’s bank deposits and exposure to credit risk arising from default of the counterparty.  
The maximum exposure is equal to the carrying amount of these deposits. At 31 May 2017, the Group’s bank deposits were held with 
Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and Clydesdale Bank plc. 
Given the nature of the Group’s operations, it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables,  
with exposure spread over a large number of customers. An allowance for impairment for trade receivables is made where there is an 
identified loss event, which based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. Details of 
trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment are disclosed in Note 20. 
Contingent consideration
As set out in Note 3, the Group has entered into certain acquisition agreements that provide for contingent consideration to be paid. 
While the exact amounts payable cannot be determined (as these depend on the future performance of the acquired businesses) the 
Group estimates the fair value of contingent consideration payable on acquisitions to be £4.4m (2016: £5.8m). 
32. Events after the reporting date 
Taxation
On 15 September 2016 the Finance Bill 2016 received Royal Assent, therefore enacting proposals that were announced in the 2016 
budget, Autumn Statement 2015 and Summer Budget 2015. The rate of corporation was 20% from April 2015. This reduced to 19% 
from April 2017 and will reduce to 17% from April 2020.
These rate changes will affect the amount of future cash tax payments to be made by the Group and will also reduce the size of the 
Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Group’s statement of financial position.
