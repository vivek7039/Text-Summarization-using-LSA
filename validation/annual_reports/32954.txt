The move to the new facility began 
in mid-2016 with the acquisition of a 
prime 8,500 square metre capacity 
site built on top of the city’s fortified 
16
th
 century walls in the heart of 
Riga Old Town, a site that dwarfs 
any existing Live Casino area in the 
market today.
Intensive work immediately began 
on converting the site into a state-of-
the-art, next-generation Live Casino 
studio. The magnitude of the task 
was made even greater as the core 
studio had to simultaneously maintain 
existing operations while the new site

STRATEGIC REPORT
04 The strength of Playtech’s model was 
evident again as the Group delivered 
double digit top line growth despite 
significant headwinds faced in the year. 
One of the key pillars of Playtech’s 
strategy has been its ability to continually 
improve the quality of earnings both 
organically and through acquiring 
strategically important targets in regulated 
and soon-to-be regulated markets. These 
acquisitions, such as BGT and ECM in 
2016, have augmented the growth of 
regulated revenue by deepening the 
retail channel in Playtech’s Omni-channel 
offering and delivering new opportunities 
in the regulated and newly regulated 
markets. This strategy has delivered 
consistent growth in the Company’s 
regulated revenue which grew to 54%  
in 2017. As outlined at the trading update 
in November, the M&A pipeline is very 
strong and Management and the Board 
are confident it will continue to diversify 
Playtech’s revenue base. 
 
Operationally 2017 was another year of 
significant progress for Playtech as the 
Company continues to execute on its 
industry leading Omni-channel solution. 
The integration of Playtech BGT Sports 
(PBS) is an important milestone for 
the Company and has created a fully 
integrated best-in-class sports technology 
solution. Integrated with the strength of 
the Casino vertical, via Playtech’s single 
platform, we have already seen the 
Sports division win new landmark clients, 
including leading Portuguese operator 
SAS, post period end. Moreover, the 
completion of the migration to our new 
Live Casino facility in Riga gives Playtech 
a competitive advantage in a fast-growing 
part of the industry.
Momentum reported in TradeTech Group 
continued with improvements across 
all KPIs, including revenue and EBITDA 
growth. Given Playtech’s experience in 
the Gaming industry the Financials division 
has been an early adopter of regulation in 
its industry and is therefore strategically 
well positioned for the potential incoming 
ESMA measures. Moreover 2017 saw 
TradeTech consolidate its B2B offering 
creating a full turnkey financial trading 
solution which Management believes is 
strategically well placed to benefit from  
the consolidation further regulation will 
bring to the sector. 
Management is confident 2017 has delivered  
a strong platform for strategic progress in 2018.

A POSITION OF STRENGTH 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
To reflect the Board’s confidence in 
the growth and cash generation of the 
business Playtech adopted a progressive 
dividend policy in 2016. One of the 
pillars of the Playtech model is its ability 
to convert its operational performance 
into strong cash generation and this has 
allowed a 10% increase in the full year 
dividend per share for 2017. 
Management is confident 2017 has 
delivered a strong platform for strategic 
progress in 2018 through both organic  
and inorganic opportunities.

GIBRALTAR – EMPOWERING THE NEXT  
GENERATION OF WOMEN IN TECH
Playtech is proud to support the launch of the 
Girls in Tech Gibraltar chapter, which opened its 
doors in early 2017. The chapter, which is part 
of a global network of 64+ chapters across the 
globe, was established to inspire, engage and 
empower women in STEM fields. 
Throughout the year, the Gibraltar chapter 
delivered a wide range of events to facilitate 
exchange of experiences and inspiring stories, 
to build new programming skills and to help 
deliver solutions for social challenges. 
This year’s chapter sponsored a ‘Hacking for 
Humanity’ initiative to engage local communities 
and charities on their challenges in order to 
explore and create innovative and forward-
thinking solutions for important causes. 
Participating charities included Childline, 
Animals in Need and Understanding Gibraltar. 
The Gibraltar Finance Centre joined the 
sponsors list and provided monetary prizes for 
the top three places, with first place receiving 
£2,000 in prize money for their winning solution 
that provided a complete and modern solution 
to replace Childline’s legacy call centre and 
management software. This initiative would lead 
to positive and sustainable benefits in the future.

STRENGTH IN THE INDUSTRY
I am pleased to report that Playtech enjoyed 
another year of operational success and as 
a result finds itself in a position of strength 
at the end of 2017. Despite headwinds 
in regulated revenue in H1 2017 and 
the disruptions in unregulated markets 
experienced in the second half of 2017, the 
strength of the underlying Playtech business 
was demonstrated by the 18% revenue 
growth for the Group at constant currency. 
Moreover, given the operational progress 
in our Playtech ONE Omni-channel offering 
reported in 2017, Playtech is in an important 
strategic position going in to 2018. The 
strength of the new Live and Sports offerings 
has delivered immediate results with new 
contract wins in Casino and Live and our 
first online sports book licensees for PBS 
following the restructuring of our sports 
division. Management believe that Playtech 
ONE is at equal strength across all key 
product verticals and will provide Playtech 
with a strategic advantage in winning new 
licensees in key regulated and regulating 
markets in coming years. 
A UNIQUE  
OFFERING
Omni-channel offers users a 
unique and seamless journey 
through technology and 
compliance tools.

HIGH SHAREHOLDER  
RETURNS
We are committed to returning 
value to shareholders, as 
evidenced by the strong 
compound growth in our 
regular dividends.

Importantly, the strength of our balance 
sheet and cash flows means Playtech can 
continue to invest in our proven approach 
in strategic, fast growing, markets in Europe 
and Latin America by delivering and running 
integrated online and retail solutions to the 
‘local heroes’ in these markets. It is these 
land-based operators that are best placed to 
lead the growth of the new online markets. 
This will continue to drive the improvement 
in the quality of earnings we saw in 2017, 
with regulated revenue now reaching 
54% of Group revenue in 2017 and set to 
continue to grow. Moreover, the growth of 
these important markets will also drive the 
geographical diversification of Playtech’s 
revenue base, an important strategic 
objective for management in 2018. 
Finally, we operate in a rapidly changing 
and dynamic industry and it is important that 
we continue to invest in the evolution of 
the Playtech technology and offering. The 
acquisition of BetBuddy in 2017 adds ever 
greater Responsible Gambling functionality 
to our platform, providing further support 
to licensees in developed markets that 
are facing increased responsibilities in 
compliance and regulation.  
Moreover, the launch of our new Gaming 
Platform as a Service (GPAS) and Marketplace 
represent the next stage of evolution of 
the Playtech platform, ensuring that it is 
Playtech’s technology which remains the 
architecture of the industry. 
REGULATION
Regulation continues to be one of the 
biggest influences in the gambling industry 
worldwide, shaping the growth in each 
territory. Playtech’s strategy has been to 
invest in regulated markets, through organic 
growth and acquisitions and this resulted in 
regulated gaming revenue increasing to 49% 
in 2017 from 42% in 2016. 
Given the growth experienced in mature 
regulated markets, such as the UK, Playtech’s 
strategy is to focus on investing in fast 
growing newly regulated or regulating 
markets. During the period, we concentrated 
on supporting the organic growth of our 
customers in Italy, Spain, Finland, Denmark, 
Mexico, Columbia and Romania. Moreover, 
our strategy of partnering with the leading 
retail brands in newly regulated markets 
continued as we became the first supplier  
to launch online casino in the Czech  
Republic with the expanding Fortuna  
brand in January 2017.

STRATEGIC REPORT
13 REGULATION CONTINUED
The Playtech ONE Omni-channel offering is 
uniquely placed to support new and existing 
licensees in newly regulated markets.
Playtech provides all the capabilities across 
the gambling value chain from software and 
services to direct customer acquisition and 
marketing capabilities, offering a seamless 
platform across all gambling verticals and 
with customer entry points in retail and online. 
This makes Playtech the partner of choice 
for the leading land based operators that 
are best placed to lead the newly regulated 
online markets.
This was demonstrated post period end 
in January 2018 when Playtech signed an 
agreement to provide Sociedade de Apostas 
Sociais (SAS) with its new online sports book 
and online casino platform, all integrated 
through Playtech’s IMS player management 
system. SAS is majority owned by Santa 
Casa, Portugal’s national lottery provider,  
and the launch of an online casino and sports 
betting offering follows regulation of online 
gambling in Portugal in late 2016. 
In the second half of 2017 the Company 
experienced a slowdown in Malaysia due  
to changing market conditions. Our strategic 
position on Asia is unchanged. We operate 
a risk based approach where our legal and 
compliance teams are consistently reviewing 
the regulatory environment to ensure that our 
presence is commercially beneficial to the 
Group. As outlined at the trading update in 
November 2017 the Board and Management 
is focused on continuing to diversify its 
revenue base by investing in fast growing 
regulated and regulating markets in Europe 
and Latin America through organic growth 
and M&A. This strategy will continue to drive 
the growth in Playtech’s regulated revenue 
streams and will diversify the geographical 
make-up of our revenue base.
FUTURE MARKETS
Between 2018 and 2019 licensing  
regimes are expected to be introduced  
in major European countries including  
the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and 
some commentators expect significant 
steps forward in Germany. Playtech already 
has an agreement in place with national 
operator Holland Casino in the Netherlands 
and remains in discussions with potential 
customers in others. 
Latin America remains a key growth territory 
for online gaming. Mexico is now one of 
Playtech’s top five regulated markets, by 
player jurisdiction, following the growth 
of licensee Caliente. The strength of our 
operations in Latin America positions us well 
with the potential significant markets of Peru 
and Brazil currently reviewing regulations. 
In the US, the outcome of the judicial  
review on sports betting could represent  
a milestone towards the regulation of sports 
betting at a federal level. Currently, the 
limited regulation of online casino does not 
present a commercially beneficial opportunity 
for Playtech. However, we believe that 
the potential movement in sports betting 
regulation would represent an attractive 
opportunity given the unique strength  
of our Playtech BGT Sports offering. 
PLAYTECH ONE 
Although multi-channel approaches are 
common (same content across web, mobile 
and retail), Playtech’s unique approach to 
Omni-channel is based on one integrated 
CRM (the IMS). This single CRM across all 
product verticals and channels allows for a 
single customer profile, and therefore single 
customer experience. Central to this single 
customer experience is Playtech’s ability to 
offer integrated products in each vertical. 
Not only are these products integrated 
from a branding point of view, (e.g the Age 
of the Gods suite available online and in 
retail across Live, Bingo and Casino), to 
drive player interaction across verticals, but 
also integrated in their use and collection 
of player data – allowing for more tailored, 
and successful, marketing and player cross-
sell. Playtech is uniquely positioned given 
the scale of its platform, the capabilities and 
access to data that scale provides. Playtech 
ONE creates an ecosystem for operators 
supporting a data driven offering that 
improves the engagement with customers 
significantly within the ecosystem maintaining 
their loyalty to operator brands. 
Playtech believes that retail is one of the 
most powerful bet entry points for customers 
and our strategy in recent years has been 
to invest in industry leading retail software 
capabilities across all verticals. IGS, retail 
casino software, ECM, the retail Bingo 
software and BGT as part of Playtech BGT 
Sports allow land-based operators to capture 
retail player traffic as part of the Playtech 
ONE ecosystem. 
IMS – THE PLAYTECH PLATFORM
One of the most powerful elements of 
Playtech ONE is the use of the data collected 
across the breadth of the verticals and 
channels. Key to our strategy is the continued 
development of the functionality of the 
Playtech platform as we continue to utilise  
the player data and intelligence collated  
via the IMS. 
As the gambling market continues to 
mature, the focus for operators in developed 
markets such as the UK continues to move 
beyond player acquisition to focus on player 
retention and ultimately increasing player 
life time value. The platform allows for 
industry standard bonusing, together with 
more sophisticated mechanics, including 
automated cashback, free-spins, golden 
chips for table and card games and other 
types of bonuses. All these promotional 
methods can be controlled and configured 
by the operator, allowing for stringent liability 
and monetary control. Games Advisor is a 
real-time driven recommendation engine 
based on sophisticated real time algorithms 
that suggests other games the player 
might be interested in with high probability, 
dependent on many game-specific variables, 
including volatility, win hit frequency and 
win distribution. During the second half 
of 2017 we have seen the number of Tier 
One licensee active marketing campaigns 
managed through the Playtech Campaign 
Manager more than double to over 4,000 
active campaigns with some managing 
hundreds in parallel. 
The acquisition of BetBuddy, the Responsible 
Gambling analytics solution provider, 
represents a continuation of Playtech’s 
strategy to acquire complimentary software 
that will utilise the big data collated via the 
IMS and add to the industry leading services 
available to operators on Playtech’s platform. 
Furthermore in 2017 Playtech signed a 
strategic partnership with Featurespace 
to integrate its real-time gameplay fraud 
detection models into the IMS’ already 
considerable player protection tool kit. 
GPAS & MARKETPLACE
GPAS (Gaming Platform as a Service) 
provides the next step in Playtech’s 
relationship with licensees, content providers 
and developers. Third parties can use the 
Playtech’s drag and drop maths engine to 
build high quality HTML5 games or submit 
their own existing content for distribution 
across Playtech’s global network on any 
channel. GPAS content can be seamlessly 
developed for retail and online, whereas 
traditionally converting popular online 
games into retail games was expensive and 
inefficient involving two sets of technology 
and two sets of developers.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW CONT.
PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
14 Management believe GPAS will provide  
a strategic advantage for Playtech’s Omni-
channel approach in newly regulated fast 
growing markets, as integrated content 
across retail and online can help facilitate the 
player journey across channels and will also 
provide our customers with more flexibility 
allowing them to develop bespoke games  
to support their promotions.
Marketplace is Playtech’s new content 
discovery platform where operators can 
access Playtech’s portfolio of content. As 
new content providers or partners develop 
games on GPAS, they will be able to place 
their games onto the Marketplace, gaining 
immediate access to all Playtech’s distribution 
network. Our goal is for Marketplace to 
become a games store that is based on 
and driven by data that will automatically 
determine the relevance of games to 
different customer’s demographics.
CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION
The period saw revenue from the top ten 
licensees stand at 55% compared to 54% 
for full year 2016. Revenue from the top five 
licensees remained consistent on the full year 
period at 36% and 37% of revenue in 2016 and 
2017 respectfully. This was the first full year 
period where the consolidation, and ultimately 
increased scale and growth, of key licensees 
such as Ladbrokes Coral was included. In 
addition, this was the first full year period where 
the large revenue contributing Sun Bingo 
related white-label contract was included.
M&A
As outlined above, the acquisition of 
BetBuddy for an undisclosed fee in October 
2017 was an important acquisition. The 
integration of BetBuddy’s behavioural 
identification and modification software into 
Playtech’s powerful IMS player management 
system will enable Playtech to continue 
to lead the industry in the delivery of 
Responsible Gambling products and services.
In February 2017 Playtech completed the 
acquisition of Eyecon, a specialist supplier 
of online gaming soft slots, and a bingo slots 
specialist software for an initial consideration 
of £25 million (€29 million). The acquisition 
of Eyecon is a further example of Playtech 
executing its Omni-channel solution through 
earnings accretive M&A. Eyecon is a soft casino 
slot provider specialising in games for the 
Bingo market. Eyecon deepens the content 
offering in the Bingo vertical ultimately helping 
to drive revenue across verticals as well as 
allow us to also extend to retail. The acquisition 
strengthens Playtech's Bingo distribution 
network whilst offering industry leading  
games content.
Given the Company position and strong 
balance sheet it remains opportunistic and 
acquisitive. It does however remain disciplined 
and takes measured steps to ensure the 
opportunities are in line with our stated M&A 
strategy and present growth opportunities 
beyond cost synergies which are important  
but not the essence of our approach. 
GAMING DIVISION PERFORMANCE 
BY VERTICAL
GAMING B2B
The new presentation of Gaming revenue by 
vertical is explained fully in the CFO section. 
Gaming B2B includes software and services 
revenues, while Gaming B2C includes white-
label gaming operations in regulated markets, 
such as Sun bingo and casual games.
CASINO
Casino revenue grew 11% from 2016 to 2017 
and 15% at constant currency. Despite the 
headwinds in Asia in H2 2017 the growth 
was driven by the organic growth of existing 
licensees with growth excluding acquisitions 
of 12% at constant currency.
The pillars of Playtech’s future growth 
strategy are reflected in the operational 
achievements reported in our Casino vertical 
as we continued to support the organic 
growth of our core regulated markets.  
In Europe in 2017 Playtech launched 45 
new games in Italy, 75 in Spain, 90 in Czech 
Republic, 71 in Bulgaria and 51 in the UK. 
Importantly, following the ‘de-coupling’ of 
Playtech’s Casino games from the platform 
that formed part of the platform overhaul 
reported at the interim results in August 2017, 
Playtech is now able to launch new content 
seamlessly across all regulated markets, 
allowing licensees to deliver global marketing 
campaigns for branded content.
In November Playtech announced the launch 
of exclusive online Casino agreement with 
leading Spanish operator Casino Barcelona, 
in addition to online casino the agreement 
saw Casino Barcelona join Playtech’s Spanish 
iPoker.es network. 
Content & Studios
In 2017 Playtech completed the unification 
of its games studios onto our agile 
games development platform content 
and distribution strategy. Playtech now 
operates eight games studios worldwide, 
all with proven pedigrees and collectively 
providing unparalleled knowledge and 
experience in online casino games creation. 
The studios are now applying the new 
SAS – NEW  
SPORTSBOOK
CLIENT
SOCIEDADE DE APOSTAS 
SOCIAIS (SAS), PORTUGAL’S 
LARGEST REGULATED 
ONLINE OPERATOR
In February 2018 Playtech signed a 
landmark deal landmark deal to supply 
Sociedade de Apostas Sociais (SAS), 
Portugal’s largest online gaming and 
betting operator, with its cutting-edge 
IMS player management platform  
and new sportsbook offering.
SAS is one of the first operators to 
launch such a wide range of online 
products following the country 
regulating gaming and betting  
18 months ago.
 
The multi-year agreement will see  
Playtech integrate its award-winning  
data-driven IMS player management 
platform and single wallet functionality  
into SAS’s operation, powering its entire 
online offering.
The Playtech BGT Sports (PBS) digital 
offering is a single, integrated solution 
for both desktop and mobile devices 
containing a state-of-the-art interface 
that will enable SAS customers to bet 
on the move or at home.
With a focus on simple navigation and 
in-play betting, the mobile solution 
meets the needs of all online bettors 
and maximises operator margins.
PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
15 Playtech content pillars to game production; 
Signature (individual style of the studio), 
Reach (relevance to market), Reliability 
(stable games and publication dates) and 
Value (largest Jackpots, bonusing tools, 
engagement tools). This unified approach 
to rapid Omni-channel game deployment 
enables operators seeking differentiation  
and customisation to integrate bespoke 
games in record time and under budget. 
Given the size and scale of Playtech’s 
distribution platform we are in an unrivalled 
position to be able to develop branded 
content as a cornerstone of our portfolio of 
over 600 games. The first half of 2017 saw 
Playtech sign an industry first agreement 
with DC Comics to provide a full suite of DC 
branded games including the Man of Steel, 
Classic Superman and Batman and Suicide 
Squad slot titles. The DC agreement was 
the culmination of a strategic project in the 
second half of 2016 designed to replace 
the Marvel studios content in the Playtech 
portfolio. Playtech had a long and successful 
relationship with Marvel studios and this 
ended in 2016 following Marvel’s acquisition 
by Disney and a change of licensing 
approach from the acquirer. 
The second half of 2017 saw Playtech 
complete an industry first for gaming content 
by completing the synchronised launch of the 
DC Justice League slot game in conjunction 
with the launch of the Hollywood film 
available to licensees across all regulated 
markets. Moreover 2017 saw Playtech further 
grow its portfolio of branded games by 
launching the American Dad, The Matrix, 
RoboCop, Monty Python's Holy Grail and  
Dirty Dancing titles.
In addition to the global branded content 
strategy for slot games the breadth of our 
games development capabilities allows 
Playtech to launch territory specific games 
and content. The second half of 2017 saw 
the successful launch of slot game Torrente 
for the Spanish market. Moreover, Playtech’s 
own Age of the Gods suite of games 
continues to go from strength to strength with 
its games titles in the top rankings of popular 
games for all our licensees. The latest game 
in the series, God of Storms, experienced a 
highly successful launch in 2017. The Age of 
the Gods suite is the end result of thorough 
research that was based on big data analysis 
designed to improve the probability of 
success of the games. 
Live Casino
This year saw Playtech complete the full 
migration of existing Live Casino rooms 
to the new market leading facility in Riga. 
This has enabled Playtech to drive product 
innovation in Live with new concepts, games 
and features. Driven by the powerful Playtech 
IMS player management platform and data-
driven business intelligence technology, 
Playtech Live Casino is fully integrated into 
the Playtech platform and Casino offering. 
Playtech Live Casino therefore delivers 
greater cross-sell opportunities through a 
seamless user experience from slots to Live 
table games in conjunction with industry first 
branded Live games and pooled jackpot 
experiences.  
The quality of our Live Casino offering was 
reflected in the progress we made with 
licensees in the key vertical in 2017. The 
completion of the migration to the new Riga 
facility saw Playtech re-imagine and design  
all dedicated areas for our leading customers, 
this resulted in Tier 1 Live Casino customers 
renewing existing agreements for long 
term deals, such as Sky in July 2017, and 
increasing the number of dedicated tables 
hosted in our studio. Moreover, we saw new 
commitments for dedicated tables in the 
second half of the year from Betfred and BGO 
Entertainment and launched new licensees 
Sports Interaction and Stoiximan in Greece  
at the end of 2017. 
Importantly as part of the Tier 1 renewal 
process, and in line with the Group’s growth 
strategy, Playtech Live Casino secured 
new territory launches for Tier 1 licensees 
including the launch of Live Casino on 
Sky Bet’s ‘Sky Italy’ gaming sites. The 
sophistication and success of the new Live 
offering was reflected with Sky Bet’s success 
in winning the eGaming Review Innovation in 
Casino award for its new Playtech supplied 
Live Casino. Sky Bet went live with its new 
state of the art dedicated Live Casino 
environment in April 2017 and won the award 
for offering players an enhanced Omni-
channel experience, product enhancements 
and richer gameplay.
PLAYTECH BGT SPORTS (PBS)
Revenue in Sports for 2017 saw an increase 
on 2016 of 58% at constant currency. This 
was due to the contribution from BGT, the 
retail Sports software provider acquired by 
Playtech in July 2016. Underlying revenue 
excluding acquisitions at constant currency 
declined compared to 2016 mainly due to  
the absence of the Mobenga contracts which 
came into effect at the end of H1 2016.
A key strategic milestone in 2017 has 
been the launch and the completion of 
the integration of Playtech BGT Sports 
(PBS). PBS brings together Playtech Sports 
companies BGT, Geneity, Mobenga, Unilogic 
and Playtech’s internal Sports Trading team. 
In 2017 PBS completed a considered and 
strategic integration combining the best of 
technology and modules from the Playtech 
Sports companies and delivering the 
industry’s first integrated retail and online 
sports betting platform. PBS will provide a 
‘bricks-to-clicks’ fully integrated sports betting 
technology solution based on Playtech ONE, 
offering single-betting accounts across the 
web, mobile, self-service betting terminals 
(SSBTs) and over the counter (OTC) in retail 
betting shops. 
PBS believes there is significant opportunity 
for SSBT growth globally and has seen the 
number of active retail machines increase 
37% from c.27,000 in December 2016 
to c.37,000 in December 2017. With the 
completion of the integration of the PBS 
retail software to the Playtech ONE platform 
the size of the retail machine footprint offers 
significant opportunities for the cross sell  
of PBS’ integrated offering.
Along with the completion of the PBS 
integration the Sports division has 
concentrated on growing its retail and  
online customer base in the key fast growing 
markets in Europe and Latin America, in 
line with the Group level strategy. Early in 
the period PBS announced a three-year 
agreement with OPAP, the leading Greek 
betting and lottery operator, for the supply  
of SSBTs, relevant software and services, 
and the introduction of an OTC sports betting 
solution. The second half of 2017 saw PBS 
solution go live across the 4,500 estate with 
over four thousand OTC tills and over 1,500 
SSBTs active by the end of the period.

STRATEGIC REPORT
16 PLAYTECH BGT SPORTS 
INTEGRATION, INNOVATION, 
DISRUPTION
This year, 2017 was a challenging and 
important year. We had the challenge of 
integrating four different Sportsbetting 
platforms across seven different countries 
into one division – Playtech BGT Sports. 
Our plan was to take the best of 
technology stack and modules across 
the different companies and form an 
integrated PBS Sportsbetting platform 
across retail and online, whilst at the same 
time delivering growth and maintaining  
our advantage in the existing retail  
Sports offering. 
Our vision is to change the way that 
bookmakers think about sportsbetting by 
delivering a ‘bricks-to-clicks’ fully integrated 
Sportsbetting technology solution based 
on Playtech ONE the unique Omni-channel 
platform. From digital SSBTs and OTC in 
retail to mobile, web and tablet. 
Altogether Playtech BGT Sports aims to 
form the leading Sportsbetting Technology 
Powerhouse of the industry. 
In line with Group strategy we delivered 
important geographical expansion in 
strategically important territories, such 
as Germany, Spain, Italy, Columbia and 
Mexico. Moreover, my goal was to deliver 
the new PBS platform to one of Europe’s 
largest Lottery and Sports operators  
OPAP in 2017. This was our biggest  
client project in 2017.
Key to maintaining our strategic position 
in sports is innovation of our products and 
we introduced new exclusive content and 
innovations across all our product lines: 
Self Service, Till and Digital Applications. 
I am proud to report that the PBS 
management team and all our fabulous 
employees our vision within the last 12 
months. Thank you to all our passionate 
PBS employees that are coming on 
this journey with us to change the way 
operators think about Sportsbetting. 
Dr Armin Sageder
CEO Playtech BGT Sports
In addition to OPAP, 2017 saw PBS launch 
SSBTs with customers in Malta, Romania, 
Spain, Czech Republic, Austria and Germany. 
As outlined at the interim results in August 
2017, alongside Europe a key focus for 
the PBS SSBT product was growth in Latin 
America and the second half of 2017 saw  
PBS install a first phase SSBT programme  
in Columbia with Codere and Sportium.
The second half of 2017 also saw an 
important strategic milestone in the launch  
of PBS’ first integrated online and retail 
sports book customers with German operator 
HpyBet and Belgian Magic Betting. In 
addition, the post period end signing of an 
integrated online sports book and casino 
platform with the biggest gambling brand 
in Portugal, SAS, was another important 
strategic win for the new sports division.
Key contracts have been renewed with 
Betfred and Paddy Power Betfair with both 
secured until at least 2020 and with Betfred 
taking another 500 terminals and Paddy 
Power shops installing a minimum of 800 
new terminals over the next 12 months. 
Playtech’s strategy in Sports is to continue to 
drive product development to retain operator 
and customer engagement with retail. In 
H1 2017, PBS launched its revolutionary 
Retail Mobile App named ‘Bet Tracker’. Bet 
Tracker went live with Betfred in August 2017 
and Jennings Bet, Boyles and Plucks will 
also followed later in 2017. The Bet Tracker 
product is leading the digitilisation of the 
retail sports experience, allowing customers 
to track their bets placed in store on their 
mobile phones without already having a 
mobile account, giving operators increased 
touch points with their customers. In addition, 
2017 saw PBS become the first retail provider 
to deliver Lottoland’s jackpot lotto betting 
products on SSBTs located in licenced 
betting shops.
 
Moreover, PBS’ integration into Playtech’s 
IMS platform has allowed PBS to build in 
the same data tools and functionality that is 
available across the Playtech ONE platform. 
In line with the Group’s strategy to deliver 
Responsible Gambling tools to support 
licensees PBS has agreed a development 
roadmap with the UK Gambling Commission 
to deliver Anti Money Laundering and Fraud 
prevention identification tools across the 
retail and online platform.

STRATEGIC REPORT
17 SERVICES
The increase in contribution from the white-
label offering meant the transition in services 
from dot com to regulated revenue streams 
continued in the period resulting in a higher 
proportion of regulated revenues for this 
vertical. As part of the natural transition 
from unregulated to regulated markets our 
services division is now focused on different 
partners in regulated markets where we 
see real momentum in activity. In Mexico, 
our partner Caliente is going from strength 
to strength and we continue to experience 
significant growth. In Spain, we see good 
momentum from our local partners and 
expect it to continue rapidly growing in the 
coming years. We have made real progress 
in other markets such as the UK, Italy and in 
line with our overall strategy and focus on 
regulated markets our services division will 
extend its reach into other regulated markets 
such as Portugal, Colombia and others.
 
BINGO
Following the acquisition of Bingo software 
and services supplier ECM in October 2016 
the Bingo vertical saw a 47% increase in 
revenue at constant currency in 2017. 
 
The Bingo vertical remains a key customer 
acquisition channel at the operator level. 
Playtech’s Bingo offering allows licensees 
to offer seamless cross-sell and movement 
between channels and verticals, but more 
importantly Bingo slot and Casino integrated 
content. The integration of retail software 
and services supplier ECM, onto the Playtech 
Bingo platform has created an ecosystem 
for licensees to retain players regardless 
of channel or vertical. Omni-channel, 
integrated content, such as Tiki Paradise, 
allows operators to drive player traffic to 
other verticals and importantly track the 
behavioural analytics across those channels 
and verticals. Post period end in January 
2018 Playtech announced it had launched the 
popular online game Clover Rollover across 
128 Gala Bingo UK retail sites meaning the 
game was now available online, in retail and 
on mobile. 
POKER
Poker remains an important part of the 
complete Playtech ONE product offering and 
Playtech continues to offer the largest open 
and ‘tappable’ poker network in the industry. 
Although the wider online Poker market 
remains challenging Playtech’s poker vertical 
returned to growth in 2017 with revenue 
increasing 7% at constant compared to  
2016, this follows a consistent slowing  
of the decline in the last few years.
OTHER
Other revenues grew 48% to €26.4 million 
as our retail Casino software, the IGS land-
based Casino system management system 
received new orders across the Rank estate 
and across the eight landmark Caesars 
Entertainment EMEA casino portfolio. 
B2C GAMING 
The new disclosure shows a new line item 
called B2C Gaming which include white-label, 
B2C and Casual.
WHITE-LABEL AND B2C
The contract with News UK for Sun 
Bingo continues to see improvement in 
revenue although it remains challenging. 
As a reminder, although the migration of 
Sun Bingo in 2016 was successful from 
a technological perspective there were 
challenges migrating all of the VIPs. Changes 
were then made in Q2 2017 which has 
led to some improvement in KPIs and 
performance. However, given that Bingo 
is very much a UK business which is also 
seasonal, management believes that the full 
benefit of the changes made were offset 
by exceptionally good weather combined 
with the UK summer holidays. Sun Bingo 
revenue improved towards the end of 
the year with a successful promotion just 
before Christmas, with the start of 2018 
showing some continued momentum. It is 
worth remembering that there is significant 
operating leverage within the Sun Bingo 
contract due to minimum guarantees payable 
to News UK which means that as revenues 
increase, the benefit will drop straight 
through to the bottom line. As stated above, 
despite the improvement, the Sun Bingo 
contract remains challenging. Playtech is 
in discussions with News UK following a 
thorough analysis of the issues encountered 
with the contract. 
Revenue from other white-label and B2C 
contracts declined to €22.8 million.
CASUAL
Casual games continued to enjoy revenue 
growth driven by the ongoing success  
of the Narcos branded game.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW CONT.
TRADETECH GROUP –
PLAYTECH’S FINANCIAL DIVISION
TradeTech Group achieved key 
milestones in 2017, delivering both 
significant organic growth as well as 
successful acquisitions which together are 
providing the foundation for future growth, 
in line with the strategic vision at Playtech 
Group level. The strong financial results 
reflect the significant improvement and 
progress we have made last year.
The division reported significant growth 
on reported results and importantly 
when excluding acquisitions and on a 
proforma (assuming ACM assets acquired 
from beginning of financial year) basis, 
delivering Adjusted EBITDA growth across 
each of the different business segments, 
with organic growth in Adjusted EBITDA 
of 44% after excluding acquisitions, 
and an impressive 58% growth on a 
proforma basis, after considering all of the 
acquisitions during the period and their 
historic underlying performance. 
As can be seen from the results, 
TradeTech has delivered significant 
margin improvement of the underlying 
business following efficiencies and cost 
reductions made toward the end of 2016 
year and the beginning of 2017. In addition, 
results in 2017 were negatively impacted 
by the crypto ‘hype’ experienced in the 
year, predominantly in Q4, resulting in a 
total loss of $7.6 million from our top line, 
affecting both the B2C segment as well  
as B2B.
REGULATION IN THE  
FINANCIAL TRADING SECTOR
Playtech management and the Board 
believe that TradeTech is well placed 
to benefit from the potential regulatory 
changes the industry could experience in 
2018. Management believe that TradeTech 
has significant experience, governance 
procedures and balance sheet to continue 
to support regulation and remain both 
commercial and compliant. Our experience 
of new regulatory frameworks learned in 
the Gaming division prompted TradeTech  
to be an early adopter of new regulation.
On January 18 2018, as part of its ‘call 
for evidence’ the European Securities 
and Markets Authority, ESMA, proposed 
measures to restrict the marketing, 
distribution and sale of CFDs to retail clients. 
PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
18 BETBUDDY  
ACQUISITION
In October 2017 Playtech agreed the 
acquisition of Responsible Gambling software 
specialist BetBuddy for an undisclosed fee. 
The addition of BetBuddy’s machine learning  
and Artificial Intelligence software into 
Playtech’s data driven IMS platform  
will deliver an innovative Responsible  
Gambling solution to operators globally. 
Playtech’s strategy is to acquire complementary 
technology which extends its software and 
services offering to the gambling industry’s 
leading operators. The integration of 
BetBuddy’s behavioural identification and 
modification software into Playtech’s powerful 
IMS player management system will enable 
Playtech to continue to lead innovation in the 
delivery of Responsible Gambling products  
and services.
The integration will deliver an industry leading 
Responsible Gambling player management 
platform and will give Playtech's licensees 
the opportunity to offer their players a safer 
environment in which to enjoy Playtech’s  
Omni-channel products, features and 
functionality. The acquisition will ensure the 
Playtech platform will be well placed to navigate 
the continually evolving global regulatory 
challenges around Responsible Gambling in 
online and retail markets.
Playtech trialled Bet Buddy’s analytics software 
earlier in 2017, using its algorithms to detect  
‘at risk’ behaviours. The addition of the 
BetBuddy team and methodologies to Playtech’s 
data driven approach will allow Playtech to take 
the next step in evolving its gambling content 
to ensure it is developed and deployed in a 
sustainable manner.
While these are still proposals for changes 
in regulations, we believe TradeTech is 
well positioned in the market following 
implementation of such proposals or 
other changes as they may come into 
effect. It is important to note that some 
of the proposed changes are already 
implemented as part of our existing 
business model, including negative 
balance protection and restriction of  
use of bonuses and other incentives  
for trading. 
MARKETS.COM PERFORMANCE
Our B2C business operating our Markets.
com brand enjoyed significant growth 
on both first-time depositors and active 
customers, with 43% growth in actives 
and 93% in FTDs. This fundamental 
improvement and momentum in the 
B2C business is driven by a significant 
improvement in the cost per acquisition 
of $870 in 2017, on the back of continued 
development of our automated marketing 
capabilities.
As noted above, the crypto ‘hype’ in 2017 
had a material impact on our B2C top line 
performance, which together with very 
low volatility on other asset classes in Q4 
resulted in an overall underperforming 
fourth quarter. However, it is important 
to acknowledge the steady growth in 
actives which we believe will continue 
in 2018 and which will be translated 
into higher revenues and profits going 
forward. Outside the crypto ‘hype’ 
effect and low Q4 volatility, volume has 
remained relatively stable, on the back 
of regulatory changes related to default 
leverage limitation and elimination of 
incentive bonuses introduced at the 
beginning of 2017. Importantly 2017 saw 
strong continuity in our relationships with 
our B2C customers. Approximately 62% 
of revenue was generated from existing 
customers onboarded prior to 2017, further 
strengthened by the fact that the majority 
of revenues are generated from customers 
trading for more than 1 year, with 28% from 
customers trading for more than 2 years. 
These measures reflect the continuous 
investment in improving the quality of 
services we offer to our customers, with 
further development of ‘decision support’ 
tools and capabilities to aide customers in 
identifying trading opportunities. 
These include our real time “Trending 
now” feature, “Traders trends” live 
disclosure per asset, “Events & trade” 
financial calendar, “Market consensus” 
analysts integrated portal and more. 
TRADETECH GROUP  
B2B RESULTS
In the B2B business 2017 also saw 
significant growth on reported results, 
excluding acquisitions and on a proforma 
basis. TradeTech’s B2B segment is now 
servicing over $1 trillion in volume from 
B2B customers, and over $1.3 trillion on  
a proforma basis after adding Alpha’s pre-
acquisition volumes in 2017. These results 
show a healthy link between revenues and 
volume, with a steady revenue generation 
on the back of increase in volume from 
customers from the three sub-segments  
of our B2B offering.
TradeTech management believe these 
results demonstrate the execution of 
Playtech’s B2B strategy to become 
the provider of choice to brokers in 
the financial trading industry. The CFH 
and TradeTech Alpha acquisitions 
complimented our existing frontend and 
backend technology and enabled us to 
deliver an end to end solution for brokers, 
enabling them to enjoy a full suite of 
products from a unique trading platform 
and CRM systems, to liquidity control, 
risk management capabilities, real time 
risk applications and more. TradeTech’s 
strategy is to continue to establish its 
capabilities across the entire value chain  
in the financial trading sector.

THE ONLINE GAMBLING MARKET
The global online gambling market continues 
to exhibit strong growth while continuing to 
evolve. H2 Gambling Capital estimates that 
in 2017 Gross Gambling Revenues (GGR 
defined as amounts staked less prizes) 
for casino, poker, bingo, sports betting, 
skill based gaming and lotteries, grew by 
approximately 9% to €40.5 billion from €37.2 
billion in 2016. Looking forward, H2 Gambling 
Capital predicts the market will continue to 
grow at a compound annual growth rate of 
8% from 2017 to 2020.
2
GEOGRAPHICAL DEVELOPMENT
The UK remains the largest as well as the 
most mature online market. H2 Gambling 
Capital estimates that in 2017 the UK 
market online market grew 10% in 2017 
and accounted for 17% of the overall online 
gambling market. China and Japan are the 
next largest markets with 10% each. Europe 
remains the largest territory, comprising 53% 
of the overall online gambling market in 2017 
and is forecast to grow at a compound annual 
growth rate of 9% from 2017 to 2020. Growth 
in Europe is driven by more mature markets 
such as the UK but also relatively smaller 
markets such as Italy and Spain that are 
growing faster due to more recent regulation 
related to online gambling.

DRIVERS OF MARKET GROWTH 
FOR GAMING DIVISION 
In line with the growth of e-commerce across all 
consumer and leisure related sectors globally, 
the online gaming market continues to benefit 
from the transition of land-based revenue 
to online revenue. Improved broadband 
penetration and capacity, faster mobile 
data transfer rates, improved smartphone 
penetration, a growing number of market 
participants, along with increased marketing 
expenditure by operators through a wide  
range of marketing channels are all driving 
factors for growth in the industry. In addition,  
the growing trend of greater acceptance 
of online gambling as a mainstream leisure 
pastime is contributing to increasing  
regulatory regimes appearing globally.

OUR INDUSTRY
GAMBLING MARKET TRENDS
REGULATION
Regulation remains a key opportunity for 
growth in geographical markets. Moving from 
a predominantly .com regime to a regulated 
regime presents numerous challenges to 
operators and suppliers but also creates 
opportunities, potentially opening up new 
product verticals and increased marketing 
activity for operators. A combination of 
factors determine whether the opportunity 
will be attractive in the long term; including 
tax rate, product availability and technical 
requirements. Playtech is uniquely placed 
given its strength, geographic diversity 
and technical acumen to manage these 
challenges and continue to be the leading 
supplier in regulated markets.
Europe continues to lead the regulatory 
movement, with the Czech Republic, Poland 
and Portugal recently regulated. Holland, 
Switzerland and Sweden are expected to 
regulate in the near future. In Latin America, 
Brazil is a big opportunity, whilst Peru and 
Uruguay are reviewing historic positions. 
Finally, the Indian sub-continent remains 
an interesting and lucrative long-term 
opportunity.
4
MOBILE
The number of mobile devices in use 
continues to grow every day. In the gambling 
sector increasing numbers of players are 
choosing mobile sports betting and gaming 
for the convenience it brings. According to H2 
Gambling Capital, mobile accounted for 37% 
of the total online gambling market in 2017, up 
from 34% in 2016 and 31% in 2015. H2 Gambling 
Capital expects mobile to continue to grow  
and reach 44% of total online gambling  
activity by 2020. 
CONVERGENCE OF ONLINE AND  
LAND-BASED
In line with other consumer and leisure-led 
sectors a significant industry trend in gambling 
is the growing convergence of the land-based 
and online segments. This is principally a result 
of many of the new entrants in regulated online 
markets being existing land-based operators 
gaming, betting and lottery operators. While  
the online segment has grown faster than  
land-based, the land-based segment accounted 
for 89% of the global gambling market in 2017 
according to H2 Gambling Capital. Going 
forward this represents an attractive opportunity 
for online operators as the shift online continues 
but also for land-based operators that leverage 
their existing retail businesses to capture the 
online opportunity.

STRATEGIC REPORT
22 LEADING THE COMPETITION
MAINTAINING AND EXTENDING  
OUR LEADERSHIP
The single most realistic alternative to 
partnering with Playtech is for operators to 
utilise their own proprietary platform together 
with proprietary and third-party software. 
Playtech believes this is an increasingly 
unsustainable and costly business model. 
Playtech enjoys significant scale advantages 
by being able to leverage operating and 
development costs across its global customer 
base, including the top gambling operators in 
the UK, Europe and Latin America. Playtech’s 
strategy is to offer all product verticals across 
all distribution channels on an integrated 
platform that offers a single wallet and sign-in. 
Playtech is also the only supplier that can 
offer sophisticated marketing and operational 
services to drive player acquisition and 
retention via a modular range of flexible 
approaches from a full turnkey solution to 
equity joint ventures or structured agreements. 
This means that Playtech can partner with 
or sign commercial agreements with a wide 
range of gambling providers, from Government 
sponsored entities to the leading independent 
brands in each jurisdiction. 
BARRIERS TO ENTRY
Scale
The rapid growth and increased scale of 
Playtech has enabled the development of 
a superior platform, more relevant software 
and more products than other suppliers. New 
B2B operators or licensees are not able to 
undertake significant product development 
as they lack economies of scale. This is even 
more apparent in new channels coming to 
market such as mobile, or new products such 
as virtual sports. Games such as bingo or 
poker rely on liquidity to satisfy player demand. 
Networked casino and live casino games can 
also provide significant jackpot opportunities.
Technology
The Playtech operating system is agnostic, 
allowing upgrades and new features to 
be rolled out to every operator from a 
single platform. This enables all operators 
the benefit of a more advanced offering. 
Playtech’s R&D costs vary from year to 
year, but are typically around 20% of overall 
software revenue. This development cost 
is shared across the licensee base, and the 
revenue share model offered by Playtech 
is cost effective when compared to self-
development, and allows licensees to remain 
at the cutting edge of the market. Operators 
also benefit from product development 
through two-way feedback with Playtech.
Experience
As Playtech’s scale has increased over  
the 18 years since its incorporation, its 
knowledge, expertise and offering in all 
markets have enabled operators to grow 
their businesses and to diversify into new 
markets more quickly.
Liquidity
Playtech offers greater liquidity in the bingo 
and poker markets, and can provide highly 
progressive jackpots for games across 
casino, live casino, bingo and poker.
Services
Other barriers to entry are Playtech’s 
expertise in the services environment 
(marketing, hosting and affiliates) and 
increasingly longer-term supply contracts 
and established relationships with licensees.

Interview with
Mor Weizer
Chief Executive Officer YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYTECH CEO FOR 
MORE THAN TEN YEARS NOW. HOW HAS 
THE GAMBLING INDUSTRY CHANGED IN 
THAT TIME?
The players of 2018, whether playing 
online, on mobile or through traditional 
retail channels, are looking for a seamless 
experience. They are looking to enjoy that 
experience without restriction – more than 
that, they expect it. For operators in a highly 
competitive industry the challenge is not 
only to attract players to your brand but 
retain them as a customer of your brand 
through every channel and every vertical.
WHAT IS AN OMNI-CHANNEL APPROACH 
AND WHY DO OPERATORS NEED ONE? 
Omni-channel is a word you will come 
across a lot in the gambling industry as 
operators and content providers alike have 
realised that they need to provide the same 
level of service and style of content for 
customers across different channels be it 
land based retail or on mobile or desktop. 
Where Playtech ONE and our Omni-channel 
approach is different is that we offer the 
same platform and CRM across all channels 
and importantly across all products. This 
means you get one, real time data profile 
for a customer. For example, you don’t have 
to spend hours or days performing a data 
reconciliation across Bingo and Live Casino 
in order to develop an effective marketing 
campaign. One platform means you can run 
more cost effective cross sell campaigns or 
customer journeys across all verticals and 
channels, driving retail players to online and 
vice-versa. Moreover, you can do it using  
the functionality of our IMS platform with  
our Campaign Manager software.
WHAT MAKES PLAYTECH ONE 
SUCCESSFUL? 
There are many important aspects to 
the success of Playtech ONE, and the 
integrated Omni-channel solution operators 
and players experience today is a result 
of the strategic roadmap we have worked 
on since developing our Casino platform 
19 years ago. This includes the scale and 
quantity of data and intelligence available 
and our constant investment in innovation. 
I would, however, highlight two important 
characteristics to Playtech ONE. 
Firstly our strength in retail. Some operators 
today neglect retail gambling and others 
think it is old-fashioned. At Playtech we  
see retail as an essential part of the  
Omni-channel approach, especially in  
newly regulated online markets where  
the new entrants to the online arena  
are retail brands who have an existing  
brand and customer base.

STRATEGIC REPORT
25
Our retail software in Sports, Bingo and Casino not 
only digitalises the retail offering but allows you to 
facilitate the journey of retail players to become 
online players, making retail and online part of the 
same ecosystem.
Secondly, it is the strength of our offering across 
different product verticals and this is a strategic  
goal we have finally realised this year with the 
integration of Playtech BGT Sports. To facilitate 
cross-sell and player traffic between verticals you 
need competitive and appealing products in each 
vertical. Sports is important as it is the gateway  
for many players into other verticals. 
WHAT DOES ‘INTEGRATED’ CONTENT MEAN  
AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? 
Playtech ONE creates an ecosystem, from retail 
in store, to mobile, desktop and tablet. Integrated 
content, not only integrated by wallet and customer 
data but also integrated across content through 
consistent cross vertical branding and cross vertical 
jackpots – allows licensees to take customers on a 
journey through their ecosystem – ensuring when 
they play another vertical it is with them. 
WHAT’S THE NEXT INNOVATION ON THE 
PLAYTECH ONE ROADMAP? 
We believe Playtech’s GPAS, Gaming Platform as 
a Service, and Marketplace will both revolutionise 
Playtech’s relationships with operators and third 
party games developers, ensuring Playtech’s 
technology is the architecture of the gambling 
industry in the future. GPAS’s maths editor allows 
licensees and developers to easily build their own 
games to be hosted and distributed on Playtech’s 
platform. While Marketplace will be an open market 
where operators can access Playtech’s portfolio  
of content and also content developed on GPAS. 
WHAT IS GPAS AND HOW WILL IT BENEFIT 
PLAYTECH AND ITS LICENSEES? 
GPAS technology is also bridging the gap between 
online and land-based retail when it comes to game 
delivery. GPAS technology enables HTML5 games 
to be brought to life on land-based slot machines as 
well as online devices, without losing any of the feel 
of traditional retail slot gaming. HTML5 games can 
run across several screens, be integrated with the 
machine buttons, lights and sounds; developers can 
create high quality graphics, build in game volatility 
– everything you need. With GPAS’s rapid game 
development tools, developers can optimise HTML5 
games, run them on a slot machine simulator and 
deploy them in a matter of hours – games that 
are genuinely indistinguishable from traditional 
CC+ games. For me, this is truly Omni-channel 
technology in action and will provide Playtech with 
a strategic advantage in our key growth markets. REINVENTING CONTENT

PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
40 CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE RATIONALE FOR 
PLAYTECH LAUNCHING THE FINANCIALS 
DIVISION IN 2015?
The financial trading industry is driven by 
the same core competencies and skills 
as the gambling industry. It is a platform, 
e-commerce driven business where success 
is determined by customer acquisition and 
retention technology and the use of data. 
Moreover, it is a young, fast developing 
industry which is being shaped by fast 
moving regulation – Playtech has proven 
experience driving growth in these 
environments. 
WHAT IMPACT DO YOU THINK  
INCREASED REGULATION WILL  
HAVE ON THE INDUSTRY?
The industry is still very young and as a 
result it is fragmented. At TradeTech we 
embrace regulation, as we have done  
in the Gaming division. Similarly to the  
Gaming division we believe that the 
increased scrutiny and cost of regulations 
will mean B2C providers in the financial 
trading industry will need to rely more 
and more on B2B service and technology 
providers such as TradeTech Group.

WHY THE REBRAND AND NEW NAME  
OF TRADETECH IN 2017?
The brand TradeTech Group is more 
representative of the breadth of operations 
across the division, from pure B2B services 
to our customer facing brand Markets.com. 
As part of TradeTech Group we operate 
CFH, providing Tier 1 liquidity services and 
multi-asset execution through its best of 
breed proprietary brokerage technology 
and TradeTech Alpha which was created 
in August 2017 as part of the acquisition 
of assets from Alpha Capital Markets, 
delivering a dedicated, professional bespoke 
trade execution, and risk services for B2C 
operators. In addition, we also operate 
MarketsPro a high net worth segment  
of our B2C brand Markets.com.
WHAT DOES THE LAUNCH OF TRADETECH 
ALPHA BRING TO THE DIVISION IT DIDN’T 
HAVE BEFORE?
Furthering the breadth of TradeTech Group's 
financial risk management, trading, and 
market making services is a central part 
of the strategy to grow its B2B financial 
offering. The launch of TradeTech Alpha 
following the acquisition of ACM assets was 
significant step in the evolution of TradeTech. 
The financial trading industry is driven by 
the core capabilities of platform technology, 
customer acquisition and retention, CRM 
management, and financial trading and risk 
management expertise. The acquisition 
of Alpha's high-quality technology and 
teams of industry experts has significantly 
deepened our expertise in trading and risk 
management, allowing TradeTech Group to 
offer a full turnkey solution to B2B clients 
across the industry.

In August 2017 Playtech announced it acquired 
technology, intellectual property and customer 
assets from ACM Group Limited, known in 
the industry as 'Alpha', as part of its continued 
strategy to enhance TradeTech’s B2B offering.
As a result of the acquisition of the assets a 
team from Alpha joined the TradeTech Group 
and the brand TradeTech Alpha was created to 
deliver a bespoke risk management and trading 
solution to B2B customers. 
We aspire to establish TradeTech as the World’s leading B2B and B2C financial 
trading and liquidity provider offering best-performing products and adding 
significant value to our licensees and retail brokers.

48 PRESENTATION OF RESULTS
The Directors believe that in order to best 
represent the trading performance and 
results of the Group, the reported numbers 
should exclude certain non-cash and one-off 
items including amortisation of intangibles 
on acquisitions, professional costs on 
acquisitions, additional consideration payable 
for put/call options, one off employee 
related costs, finance costs and contingent 
consideration movement on acquisitions, 
impairment of available for sale investments, 
deferred tax on acquisitions, non-cash 
accrued interest and additional various  
non-cash charges. 
The Directors believe therefore that Adjusted 
EBITDA and Adjusted net profit more 
accurately represent the trading performance 
of the business and are the key performance 
metrics used by the Board when assessing 
the Group's financial performance. A full 
reconciliation between the actual and 
adjusted results is provided in Note 5  
of the financial statements below.
Given the significant fluctuations in exchange 
rates in the period, the underlying results are 
presented in respect of the above measures 
after excluding acquisitions and on a constant 
currency basis to best represent the trading 
performance and results of the Group.
OVERVIEW
Playtech delivered a good financial performance 
in 2017 driven by both underlying growth and 
from the acquisitions made in 2016 and in 2017.
Total reported revenue and Adjusted EBITDA 
increased 14% and 7% respectively compared 
to 2016. Reported Adjusted net profit increased 
14% due to significant fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates, mainly in Sterling, impacting 
2016 reported Adjusted net profit leading to 
high growth from 2016 to 2017. On a constant 
currency basis, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA  
and Adjusted net profit, increased by 18%,  
11% and 8% respectively. 
This performance was achieved despite 2017 
being an unusual year for headwinds faced, 
with so many combining including currency 
headwinds as well as issues in H2 in Asia and 
the expected loss of Marvel, certain Mobenga 
contracts and the contract with Poker Stars 
for Poker Strategy. At Adjusted EBITDA 
level, currency alone provided a €14 million 
headwind with total EBITDA headwinds 
totalling €60 million.
As discussed above, the Sun Bingo 
contract generated a significant Adjusted 
EBITDA loss due to the levels of minimum 
guarantees payable to News UK. Playtech 
is in discussions with News UK following a 
thorough analysis of the issues encountered 
with the contract.
In line with the guidance provided at the 2016 
full year results, the Group EBITDA margin fell 
from 43% in 2016 to 40% in 2017, principally 
due to a higher percentage contribution from 
lower margin parts of the business including 
white-label, specifically from the full year 
contribution from Sun Bingo, the Financials 
division and from Casual. The Adjusted 
EBITDA margin in B2B Gaming remained 
broadly flat for the year at 49%.
Playtech continues to be highly cash 
generative and delivered net cash from 
operations up 22% to €306.7 million 
compared to €251.4 million in 2016, 
representing 88% cash conversion from 
Adjusted EBITDA when excluding cash 
movements, which are not reflected in 
Adjusted EBITDA, such as movements in 
jackpot liabilities, customer security deposits 
and changes in client equity.
Playtech has a very strong balance sheet 
with cash and cash equivalents of €584.0 
million or Adjusted Gross cash of €412.6 
million (2016: €392.0 million) net of cash 
held on behalf of client funds, progressive 
jackpot and security deposits. Together with 
the Available-for-sale investments of €381.3 
million (2016: €230.3 million), Playtech has 
considerable available resources to  
execute its strategy.

CHANGES TO DISCLOSURE OF 
REVENUE AND ADJUSTED EBITDA
Disclosure has been improved to assist  
with analysis, specifically the businesses  
with different margin profiles.
The new disclosure shows a new line item 
called B2C Gaming which includes white-label, 
B2C and Casual. Revenues and costs for these 
businesses are presented separately as they 
have fundamentally different margin profiles.
In addition, we have also re-categorised other 
cost line items including removing revenue 
driven costs, which contained a significant 
amount of the Sun Bingo contract and are now 
in B2C Gaming. Most importantly, R&D now has 
its own line item which serves to highlight the 
technology base of Playtech’s B2B  
Gaming business.
REVENUE
Total revenue increased by 14% to €807.1 
million (2016: €708.6 million) and by 18% on a 
constant currency basis, with underlying growth 
of 5% (after excluding acquisitions at constant 
currency). 
NEW PRESENTATION OF GAMING 
REVENUES BY VERTICAL
The new presentation of Gaming revenue by 
vertical splits between the business to business 
(B2B) element, which includes both software 
and services revenues and the business to 
customer (B2C) element, which includes white-
label gaming operations in regulated markets, 
such as Sun Bingo and casual games. 
Casino, the biggest product vertical, increased 
by 11% in 2017 and by 15% on a constant 
currency basis and 12% when further excluding 
acquisitions. The growth in Casino is mainly 
generated from core casino activity, such as 
online slots and roulette, driven by Mobile 
casino revenue increased by 67% over 2016, 
which represents 50% growth in mobile 
penetration. The UK reached more than 50% in 
penetration, Asia more than doubled its mobile 
penetration compared to 2016 to 42% and 
non-UK Europe mobile casino revenues grew 
by 81% to reach a penetration of 36%. 
Services revenue decreased by 16% on a 
constant currency basis, whilst decreasing 
by 19% on a reported basis. The decrease in 
revenue is mainly due to revenues generated 
in .com markets, predominately from marketing 
services and the loss of the contract with 
Poker Stars for Pokerstrategy. Revenues from 
regulated markets grew by almost 46% led 
by increase in live services revenues, which 
enjoyed a double digit growth and from the 
structured agreements with Caliente and Marca.
As discussed above, the Sun Bingo contract 
generated a significant Adjusted EBITDA loss 
due to the high levels of minimum guarantees 
payable to News UK. Playtech is in discussions 
with News UK following a thorough analysis of 
the issues encountered with the contract.
Sport revenue increased in 2017 by 58% 
on a constant currency basis and by 53% 
on a reported basis. The increase is due to 
the acquisition of BGT and when excluding 
acquisitions, on a constant currency basis, Sport 
revenue has decreased by 7%. The decrease, 
as previously indicated, is mainly due to the loss 
of three Mobenga contracts with UK licensees 
and when excluding the loss in revenues, 
underlying sport revenue has increased by  
8% in 2017.
 
Bingo revenue increased by 47% on a constant 
currency basis and by 38% on a reported 
basis. When excluding the increase in revenue 
generated by the acquisition of ECM, Bingo 
revenue on a constant currency basis were 
down 6% compared to 2016. While macro 
events such as the effective increase in UK 
gaming tax has pressured the revenues down, 
the underlying performance of the bingo 
network has increased in 2017. 
Poker reported revenue has increased by 5% 
compared to 2016 and by 7% on a constant 
currency basis. The increase in revenues, which 
is mainly driven by growth in regulated markets, 
although from a low base, is a positive sign 
after several consecutive years of decline and 
reflects the importance of this vertical in the 
operators’ offering.
Other revenue grew by 48% mainly due to 
increase in revenues from new order of the IGS 
casino management system by Rank and other 
customers, Videobet machines sold in 2017, 
mainly to Elite Gaming and by increase  
in revenues from dedicated teams.
REVENUE IN FINANCIALS DIVISION
2017 revenue in the Financials division was 
€84.9 million, up 29% versus 2016. When 
excluding the revenue generated by CFH 
and Alpha, acquired in November 2016 and 
October 2017 respectively, revenue decreased 
3% to €61.7 million.
PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
50 The momentum reported at the full year 2016 
results has continued into 2017. The steps 
taken in 2016 to deliver an efficient, competitive 
and sustainable business model are bearing 
fruit in 2017, with growth in revenue and a 76% 
increase in Adjusted EBITDA to €27.0 million 
in 2017.
Underlying Adjusted EBITDA remained flat 
compared to 2016 with growth in many parts of 
the business offset by the significant headwinds 
discussed earlier.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Financials division 
was €27.0 million, against an Adjusted EBITDA 
of €15.4 million in 2016. The year-on-year 
improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was a 
consequence of the business enhancements 
taken in 2016, both in terms of growing 
the, higher margin, B2B offering as well as 
optimising the underlying cost base to ensure 
the business is lean and efficient.
COST OF OPERATIONS
NEW PRESENTATION OF COST  
OF OPERATIONS
The new presentation of cost categories  
strips out the B2C and Financials division  
costs, similar to the new presentation of 
revenue and therefore provides better  
margin analysis as well as clearly setting  
out the research and development cost.
Research and development (R&D) cost 
comprises of employee related costs, 
dedicated teams, their direct expenses 
and proportional office cost. Research and 
development cost decreased 2% in 2017 to 
€80.7 million mainly as a result from increased 
capitalisation of development costs. In B2B 
gaming capitalised development cost as a 
percentage of total R&D cost increased from 
26% to 35%. The development cost grew by 
50% year on year with 25% of this growth 
coming from rent capitalisation introduced for 
the first time in 2017. On a like for like basis, 
excluding acquisitions and excluding office rent 
cost, the percentage has increased from 26% 
to 29%. This underlying increase in capitalised 
cost of 7% derives from the development of the 
GPAS and Marketplace projects as well as from 
a change done to the cost mode during 2017. 
Operations cost includes mainly employee 
related cost and their direct expenses, 
operational marketing cost, hosting, license 
fees paid to third parties, branded content, 
terminal hardware cost & maintenance, feeds, 
chat moderators and proportional office cost. 
Operations cost increased by 14% from €146.7 
million to €166.8 million in 2017. The main 
reason for the increase is the cost of terminals 
hardware which is in line with the increase in 
revenue from the sale of terminal hardware, 
increase in BGT terminal maintenance and 
feeds cost, as the cost for 2016 included only 
six months of BGT cost, from the date of its 
acquisition. Excluding acquisitions operations 
cost increased slightly by 1% where the increase 
in terminal hardware cost was offset by the 
reduction in the employee related cost.
Administrative cost increased by 19% mainly 
due to increase in employee related cost,  
legal fees, and compliance related cost. 
 
Sales and marketing cost mainly include 
employee related cost, their direct expenses, 
marketing and exhibition costs. Sales and 
marketing cost increased by 42% to €17.6 
million where most of the increase relates to 
acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions S&M cost 
increased by only 3%.
The 62% increase in B2C Gaming cost from 
€59.9 million in 2016 to €96.9 million in 2017 
mainly relates to the additional cost of the 
Sun Bingo contract which was launched in 
September 2016. The B2C costs comprises 
brand fees, gaming taxes, operational 
marketing cost, employee related cost and 
processing fees. These fees are typically 
calculated as a share of the licensee  
revenue generated. 
Cost of operations in the Financials division 
increased by €7.7 million in 2017. However, 
2017 includes the full year of operational costs 
for CFH (2016 included only one month) and 
three months of operational costs for Alpha. 
Excluding acquisitions, operational costs  
in the Financials division decreased by 
€8.3 million, which is reflective of the 
aforementioned underlying cost optimisation 
undertaken during 2016 to ensure an efficient, 
robust and sustainable business mode.

Underlying Adjusted profit – attributable to owners of the parent    240.2 237.5 
charge in 2017 was €17.5 million (2016: €6.3 
million). The increase is mainly due to acquired 
companies registered for taxation in higher tax 
jurisdictions as well as profits being recognised 
in higher taxing territories increasing Playtech’s 
effective tax rate. 
Adjusted diluted EPS was up 14% and the 
underlying Adjusted diluted EPS on a constant 
currency basis excluding acquisition was 1% 
above 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated 
on the basis of a weighted average number of 
shares in issue during 2017 of 348.5 million.
CASH FLOW 
Playtech continues to be highly cash generative 
and once again delivered strong operating 
cash flows of €306.7 million. 
DEPRECIATION, AMORTISATION, 
FINANCE INCOME, FINANCIAL 
COST AND TAX
Depreciation increased in 2017 by 32% 
to €26.5 million. Excluding acquisitions, 
depreciation increased 10%. 
Amortisation cost, excluding amortisation  
of intangibles on acquisition, has increased  
17% to €36.0 million, in line with the increase  
in capitalised development cost. 
Adjusted net finance cost was €5.0 million in 
the period compared to €37.2 million in 2016. 
The decrease is predominantly due to lower 
foreign exchange rate losses of €19.7 million 
during 2017, compared to a €44.7 million loss  
in 2016, together with higher dividends from the 
available for sale investment from Ladbrokes of 
€5.9 million (2016: €3.7 million) and €11.2 million 
from Plus500 (2016: €8.2 million). 
The Company is tax registered, managed and 
controlled from the Isle of Man, where the 
corporate tax rate is set at zero. The Group’s 
main trading subsidiaries are registered either 
in the Isle of Man, Alderney or Cyprus, where 
effective tax rates are low or set at zero. 
Other subsidiaries, related to the Group's 
development centres are located in other 
jurisdictions and operate on a cost-plus basis, 
and are taxed on their residual profits. The tax 
Operating cash conversion from Adjusted 
EBITDA decreased slightly in line with the 
conversion level in 2016 when adjusted for 
jackpots, security deposits and client equity. 
Since the timing of cash inflows and outflows 
for jackpots, security deposits and client equity 
only affects the reported operating cash 
flow and not EBITDA, adjusting these cash 
fluctuations is essential to truly reflect the quality 
of revenue and cash collection. 
Net cash outflows from investing activities 
totalled €140.2 million in the period, of which 
€46.3 million (2016: €140.0 million) relates to 
acquisitions, mainly of Eyecon and Alpha. Cash 
outflows from financing activities included 
€104.7 million (2016: €245.7 million) of annual 
dividend payment.

52 BALANCE SHEET AND FINANCING
As at 31 December 2017, cash and cash 
equivalents amounted to €584.0 million (2016: 
€544.8 million), with cash net of client funds, 
progressive jackpot and security deposit, being 
€412.6 million (2016: €392.0 million).
Total available-for-sale investments were 
€381.3 million, a 66% increase compared  
to the end of 2016, due to the appreciation  
in value of holdings in Plus500 and in  
Ladbrokes Coral.
Contingent consideration and redemption 
liability decreased to €157.7 million, mainly  
due to the write off of the Markets earn-out  
and earn-out payments, and comprise of  
the above.
The value of the contingent consideration 
relating to Markets.com in Playtech’s balance 
is zero, as the threshold for achieving an 
additional earnout has not been met.
DIVIDEND
To provide greater certainty and consistency 
of dividend payments, the Board adopted a 
progressive dividend policy in 2016 which 
allows the Board to reflect its confidence in the 
growth and cash generation of the business 
without being tied to a fixed percentage payout 
as one-off items can impact results, such as the 
impact from foreign exchange which we saw in 
2016 and 2017. 
Playtech’s intention is to grow dividends from 
the current level in line with the underlying 
performance of the business on a smoothed 
basis and to continue to pay the dividend split 
approximately one-third as an interim dividend 
and two-thirds as a final dividend.
Accordingly, the Board has declared a final 
dividend of 23.9 €cents per share (2016:  
21.7 €cents), an increase of 10% over 2016’s  
final dividend, taking the 2017 full year dividend 
to 36.0 €cents per share, an increase of 10%  
over 2016.
For those shareholders wishing to receive their 
dividends in Sterling the last date for currency 
elections is 11 May 2018.

53 REGULATORY RISKS MITIGATION
Regulation – Licensing Requirements (both Gaming and Financials)
Playtech holds several licences for its activities from regulators. The 
review and/or loss of all or any of these licences may adversely impact 
on the operations, revenues and/or reputation of the Group.
 
Likelihood: Low          Impact: High
Playtech has a fully resourced Compliance team, which advises 
and supports the Board and executive management to ensure 
implementation of the policies, procedures and controls in place to 
protect its licence to operate. The Compliance team advises, approves 
and monitors Group activities to ensure that the organisation  
is compliant with regulatory and licensing requirements.
Regulation – Local Technical Regulatory Requirements (both Gaming and Financials)
Local regulators have their own specific requirements, which often 
vary on a country to country basis. In addition, new requirements may 
be imposed. For example, a requirement to locate significant technical 
infrastructure within the relevant territory or to establish and maintain 
real-time data interfaces with the regulator. Such conditions present 
operational challenges and may prohibit the ability of licensees to 
offer the full range of the Group’s products.
Likelihood: Low          Impact: Medium
Playtech works closely with regulators to understand specific local 
requirements along with any new requirements when operating and/
or entering into a market. The Compliance team advises the business 
on these local requirements to ensure Playtech is compliant with 
existing requirements, whilst anticipating new requirements and 
engaging with local regulators on a frequent basis. 
Taxation (both Gaming and Financials)
Given the environment in which the Group operates, the business  
is exposed to continuously evolving rules and practices governing  
the taxation of e-commerce activity in various jurisdictions. It is 
imperative to ensure compliance with all relevant tax regulations  
and requirements in each jurisdiction that Playtech operates.
Likelihood: Medium         Impact: Medium
The Head of Tax keeps the Board and executive management fully 
informed of developments in domestic and international tax laws 
within jurisdictions where the Group has a local presence.
The Head of Tax is responsible for ensuring that effective policies  
and procedures in respect of tax are in place, maintained and  
used consistently across the Group.

54 REGULATORY RISKS MITIGATION
Regulatory – Capital Adequacy (Financials only)
The requirement to maintain adequate regulatory capital may  
affect the Group’s ability to conduct its business and may  
reduce profitability.
Likelihood: Low          Impact: Medium
Our proprietary automated reporting system is used to monitor capital 
adequacy 24 hours a day on a real-time basis. This is considered 
within pre-determined limits, set by the risk management committee, 
which include an approved level of ‘buffer’ to ensure that levels 
determined by our regulators are not breached. Where the capital 
adequacy levels approach the pre-determined limits, necessary steps 
are taken to ensure that exposures are managed so as to not fall foul 
of regulatory requirements. 
Regulatory – Data Protection (both Gaming and Financials)
The requirements of the new EU General Data Protection Regulations 
(GDPR) will come into force in May 2018. Data controllers and 
processors, who have users in the EU regardless of where the  
data is held or processed, will have to comply with these regulations.
Likelihood: Medium          Impact: High
A Group wide project is underway to ensure compliance with GDPR. 
This covers governance, risk assessment, policies and processes, 
training, incident management, monitoring and data cleansing. This 
has helped drive the right behaviours to ensure obligations are met 
with regards to the handling of personal data. 
Throughout 2017, GDPR readiness has been a priority issue for the 
Playtech Board and executive management. They have endorsed 
a fully comprehensive roadmap and been provided with frequent 
progress updates from the Group Data Protection Office.
Playtech is aiming to be fully compliant with the new  
EU general data protection regulations by May 2018.
Regulatory – Preventing Financial Crime (both Gaming and Financials)
Policymakers in the EU and at national levels have taken steps to 
strengthen financial crime legislation covering Anti-Money Laundering 
(AML), prevention of facilitation of tax evasion and Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption (ABC). Non-compliance could result in investigations, 
prosecutions, loss of licences and/or an adverse reputational impact. 
Likelihood: Medium          Impact: Medium
The Group takes a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. 
Policies and operational procedures are refreshed to ensure 
alignment with evolving regulatory frameworks. The Board and Risk 
Committee have oversight of AML, ABC and tax risk. The Compliance 
team have day to day oversight of AML and ABC policy and 
implementation including training. 
Regulatory – Responsible Gambling (both Gaming and Financials)
Responsible gambling is a material concern to society as well as a 
regulatory priority. In addition, licensing requirements are regularly 
updated to ensure that companies in the sector provide a safe 
environment for consumers. Recent trends have seen an additional 
regulatory focus on treating customers fairly and conducting 
marketing and advertising in a responsible manner. 
 
Likelihood: High          Impact: Medium
Playtech is committed to provide a safe, fun and empowering 
consumer experience and has taken steps to enhance its responsible 
gambling capability in both the B2C and B2B operations. 
Playtech’s long-term strategic objective is to develop and offer best 
in class tools and data that can help raise standards in operations and 
across the industry to: 
• Promote safer and responsible play; 
• Empower licensees and players with advanced customer 
engagement and responsible gambling tools to reduce harm; and 
• Improve the quality and use of data to reduce harm.

BUSINESS OPERATIONS MITIGATION
Mergers and Acquisitions (both Gaming and Financials)
Playtech has made a number of acquisitions over the years. Such 
acquisitions may not deliver the expected synergies and/or benefits 
and may destroy shareholder value.
Likelihood: Low          Impact: Medium
The Company has made a number of very successful, value creating 
acquisitions and has an established process in place and experienced 
staff to conduct thorough due diligence before completing any 
transaction. 
There is an integration team in place that works to integrate each 
acquisition as smoothly as possible.
Key Employees (both Gaming and Financials)
The Group’s future success depends in large part on the continued 
service of a broad leadership team including Executive Directors, 
senior managers and key personnel. The development and retention 
of these employees, along with the attraction and integration of new 
talent, cannot be guaranteed.
Likelihood: Medium          Impact: Medium
The Group provides a stimulating professional environment and  
has a comprehensive performance evaluation system to identify  
key talent and to ensure that key personnel are appropriately 
rewarded and incentivised through a mixture of salary, annual 
bonuses and long-term incentives linked to the attainment of  
business objectives and revenue growth.
IT Security (both Gaming and Financials)
System downtime or a security breach, whether through cyber and 
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or technology failure, 
could significantly affect the services offered to our licensees.
Likelihood: Medium          Impact: High
The Group adopts industry standard protections to detect any 
intrusion or other security breaches, together with preventative 
measures safeguarding against sabotage, hacking, viruses and 
cybercrime. The Group works continuously to improve the robustness 
and security of the Group’s information technology systems.
Business Continuity Planning (both Gaming and Financials)
Loss of revenue, reputational damage or breach of regulatory 
requirements may occur as a result of a business or location  
disruptive event. 
Likelihood: Medium          Impact: Medium
Business continuity plans are in place for all key Playtech sites, 
covering the significant majority of the Group. The remaining sites  
will be provided with a fully functioning business continuity plan  
in line with the project roadmap.
Completed plans will be tested to ensure effectiveness and training 
will be provided to key staff members as part of the business 
continuity program.

56 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT MITIGATION
Economic Environment (both Gaming and Financials)
A downturn in consumer discretionary spend or macroeconomic 
factors outside of Playtech’s control could result in reduced spend 
by consumers on gambling and financial trading and the Group’s 
revenues may fall.
Likelihood: Medium          Impact: Medium
Playtech’s customers and licensees are geographically diverse, which 
should mitigate reliance on any particular region. Management closely 
monitors business performance and if a downturn were to occur, 
remedial action commensurate with the nature and scale of  
the slowdown would be taken.
Cash Management – Cash Balances
Foreign exchange volatility could impact the Group's financial position
Likelihood: High          Impact: Medium
The Group holds currency in various denominations and our operations 
are geographically diverse. The Group finance team continually review 
cash balances to ensure that this risk is mitigated effectively.
Market Exposure (Financials only)
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities could 
adversely fluctuate due to movements in market prices of foreign 
exchange rates, commodity prices, equity and index prices.
 
Likelihood: Medium          Impact: Medium
Market exposure is monitored 24 hours a day on a real-time basis, 
using our proprietary automated reporting systems to measure client 
exposure on all open positions. Where exposure levels and client 
behaviour reaches certain levels, whether in total or on specific 
instruments, our risk management policy requires that mitigating 
actions, such as reducing exposure through hedging or liquidity 
arrangements, are considered.
Trading Volume (Financials only)
Low volatility within foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, equity 
and index prices may reduce profitability.
Likelihood: Low          Impact: Medium
Trading volumes are monitored in real-time and the number of 
instruments available for clients to trade continues to increase in order 
to ensure that potential for market volatility is captured within our 
offering. Where markets become volatile within specific instruments, 
our technology allows for specific and tailored material to be released 
which highlights such instances to attract trading volume.

58 INTRODUCTION
This year, 2017, saw increased interest from 
regulators, policymakers and consumers on 
a range of policy and social issues relating 
to the gaming industry. The areas of concern 
include social responsibility and player 
protection, consumer fairness, anti-money 
laundering, tax and data protection. At Playtech, 
we are factoring these considerations and 
developments into our future strategy.
1
GAMBLING REGULATION
Playtech is focused on regulated and newly 
regulated jurisdictions. We are also active in 
promoting sensible and effective regulation  
in emerging markets.
Regulations continue to evolve in mature, 
regulated markets. During 2017, the Gambling 
Commission of Great Britain, along with 
others, took significant steps to strengthen its 
regulatory and enforcement regime in areas 
covering advertising, customer fairness, social 
responsibility and anti-money laundering. 2018 
will see regulatory changes continue to come 
into force, including new technical standards 
and a new online self-exclusion scheme. At 
Playtech, we are investing time and resource  
to meet these requirements in our operations. 
Despite the first online gambling sites being 
launched over twenty years ago, many 
countries still lack a regulatory framework 
for online gambling. Between 2018 and 
2019 licensing regimes are expected to be 
introduced in several European countries, 
including the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland 
and Germany. In Latin America, regulatory 
discussions are taking place in numerous 
countries, with Peru and Brazil in the lead. In the 
US, the outcome of the judicial review on sports 
betting could represent a milestone towards 
the regulation of sports betting at a federal 
level, while at the moment some online games 
are regulated only in Nevada, New Jersey, 
Delaware and Pennsylvania. 
Financial crime also came into focus in 2017. 
The implementation of the fourth European 
Union Anti-Money Laundering Directive 
(AMLD) increased the profile and requirements 
for enhancing Anti-Money Laundering 
(AML) controls and the fifth AMLD is now in 
progression. 2017 also saw the introduction 
the UK Criminal Finances Act, introducing new 
requirements to prevent tax evasion. 
Finally, one of the most important and significant 
regulatory developments in a decade, the EU 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 
comes into force in May 2018. 
2
GOVERNANCE AND ENGAGEMENT
Throughout 2017, the Board continued to 
closely oversee and monitor regulatory 
affairs, compliance and social responsibility. 
The Global Head of Regulatory Affairs and 
Compliance is on the Management Committee, 
with a direct reporting line into the CEO. The 
Board of Directors receives monthly updates 
and the Risk Committee receives quarterly 
reports on compliance issues.
During the past year, Playtech updated and 
strengthened its Anti-Bribery Corruption (ABC), 
Ethics, Information Security and Data Protection 
policies. In drafting and reviewing our policies, 
Playtech engaged the Institute for Business 
Ethics (IBE) and external counsel to ensure 
alignment with best practice in our peer group. 
Playtech also published our Statement on 
Human Rights and Modern Slavery. Looking  
to the future, Playtech will publish a new tax 
policy in 2018, ensuring relevant elements  
are reflected in other related policies.
As part of Playtech’s risk management process, 
the Compliance and Regulatory Affairs function 
has day-to-day oversight of the regulatory, 
compliance and reputational issues contained 
in the Group risk register. Playtech has 
strengthened its risk management processes 
and controls and has taken steps to: 
• Strengthen communications, awareness  
and training amongst staff;
• Integrate compliance into core functions 
and decision-making process and systems, 
including mergers & acquisitions;
• Enhance due diligence processes and 
controls for third parties and mergers and 
acquisitions; 
• Improve guidance on gifts and hospitality; and
• Hardwire compliance considerations into  
all internal audits conducted throughout  
the year.
In 2017, Playtech also updated its compliance 
risk assessment procedure for licensees, 
Playtech will continue the roll-out of these 
measures in 2018.
TRAINING, COMMUNICATIONS  
AND AWARENESS
Throughout 2017, Playtech implemented a
comprehensive internal communications,
awareness and training program designed
to increase awareness about compliance. This
included the development of new materials
such as The Way We Do Business booklets,
posters, bespoke induction materials and a
quarterly compliance newsletter featuring
updates for employees.
Playtech invested significantly in a new,
interactive face-to-face compliance training
programme for senior and middle managers.
This programme aims to ensure our senior
leaders are champions in driving a culture
of compliance and ethical behaviour. During
the year, 447 employees across ten of
Playtech’s key markets underwent training
in 2017. The sessions covered ABC, AML,
business ethics and other compliance issues.
Using an interactive format and case studies, 
the objectives were to ensure participants 
understand their personal responsibilities and 
provide them with the tools for more effective 
decision-making. 96% of participants said  
they were extremely or very satisfied with  
the training programme.
PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION
Playtech is committed to build strong
stakeholder relationships, share learning and
support research on responsible gambling,
AML and social responsibility more broadly.
To this effect, we engage with peers, opinion 
formers, charities, industry associations and 
stakeholders outside of gambling to help 
deliver solutions to the big challenges facing 
the sector.
Playtech remains an active participant in
industry trade associations and industry groups
such as the Remote Gambling Association
(RGA) and the Gambling Anti-Money Laundering
Group (GAMLG). During 2017, Playtech also
engaged with the Institute for Business Ethics,
the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board,
GamCare, Gambling Therapy and other  
multi-stakeholder initiatives.
PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT
59 PARTNERSHIP AND  
COLLABORATION CONTINUED
During 2017, Playtech brought together a diverse 
set of stakeholders for a series of roundtable 
discussions. These explored how, in an 
increasingly data-driven world, companies can 
protect, empower and serve their consumers  
as well as win customers’ trust and be responsible 
corporate citizens. 
Playtech works with other industry leaders to 
encourage the regulation of online gambling 
across all jurisdictions and raise awareness of the 
regulatory options that have been adopted and 
successful in regulated markets. When engaging 
with local policy makers, Playtech shares its 
experience in regulated markets to promulgate 
best practices regarding responsible gambling 
and consumer protection. Playtech encourages 
regulators and lawmakers to support solutions that 
are good for a safer, more responsible consumer 
experience and business alike. 
3
MINIMISING INTEGRITY RISK
Playtech takes a zero-tolerance approach  
to bribery, corruption and money laundering. In 
2017, Playtech refreshed its Ethics and Business 
Conduct Policy. The policy was updated in order 
to reflect external best practice as well as the 
Company’s new and evolving policies covering its 
approach on Speak Up, treating customers fairly, 
human and labour rights, diversity, the environment 
and responsible gambling. Playtech also updated 
its ABC policy, introducing new thresholds for 
declaring, reporting and securing approval for 
gifts and hospitality. The updated policies were 
communicated through training across the 
Company. In addition, Playtech completed its 
annual anti-money laundering risk assessment 
utlising the GAMLG’s methodology for the AML 
risk assessment; which is a formal and published 
industry standard for AML risk assessment. The 
Internal Audit function also participated, reviewed 
and challenged the risk assessment to ensure a 
robust approach. As a result of new regulatory 
guidance and the outcome of the AML risk 
assessment, Playtech enhanced its operational 
procedures for managing money laundering risk. 
In 2018, Playtech will further update all of its 
policies and procedures to factor in regulatory 
developments, such as the Criminal Finances 
Bill 2017 as well as the forthcoming fifth EU AML 
regulation and new requirements related to tax 
evasion. Playtech will continue to enhance its  
AML monitoring and review its risk and controls  
on a quarterly basis. Playtech will continue to  
use both internal audit and external counsel to 
review, challenge and make recommendations  
to enhance our risk assessment procedures.

TAX GOVERNANCE
TAX GOVERNANCE AND POLICIES
Playtech’s tax strategy is governed by the 
Board and monitored by the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee reviews the tax strategy 
annually. The Head of Tax is responsible for 
ensuring that policies and procedures that 
support the approach to tax are in place, 
maintained and used consistently around the 
world. The Head of Tax reports to the Board 
on how tax risks are managed, monitored and 
assured
Approach to tax
Playtech is committed to complying with all 
relevant tax laws in a responsible manner. The 
Company manages its tax affairs in line with 
the Group’s governance framework and tax 
strategy. Playtech is headquartered in the Isle of 
Man, where its Parent Company is tax resident. 
This location was chosen as a jurisdiction in 
which to develop the head office function due 
to shareholders benefiting from an Isle of Man 
company falling under the remit of the City Code 
on Takeovers and Mergers. 
Playtech has offices in 17 countries with the 
majority of its development and technical 
operations in Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria 
and Gibraltar. These locations are well known 
for being among the best technology hubs 
with a large population of well educated, 
technical experts. The Company’s presence in 
some markets, such as Austria, Australia and 
Denmark is a result of acquisitions. In these 
locations, business activities result in payments 
to government which include corporate income 
taxes, royalty withholding tax, employment 
taxes, property taxes, duties and other taxes. In 
addition, Playtech collects and pays employee 
taxes as well as indirect taxes such as VAT and 
sales tax. The taxes paid and collected form a 
significant part of our economic contribution  
to the countries in which we operate.
The corporate tax charge for 2017 was €17.5 
million (2016: €6.3 million), and our effective 
tax rate was 6.6% (2016: 3%). Please refer to 
taxation Note 8 for additional information.
TAX PLANNING
As a global company, Playtech operates 
in many markets. Playtech engages in tax 
planning that supports the business and reflects 
commercial and economic activity. Playtech 
selects the location of its operations based on 
commercial and operational factors that extend 
well beyond tax, including: 
• the prevailing regulatory environment
 available; 
• a widely available pool of technical talent; 
• the linguistic capabilities in these 
jurisdictions; 
• the location of our licensees; and 
• labour and operational cost factors. 
Playtech adheres to relevant tax law and seeks 
to minimise the risk of uncertainty or disputes. 
Playtech conducts transactions between Group 
companies on an arm’s-length basis. Playtech 
engages constructively with local tax authorities, 
either directly or through trade associations and 
other similar bodies, as appropriate.

SAFEGUARDING DATA
The safe and secure handling of data and 
protection of personal data are critical 
to Playtech’s long-term success. During 
2017, Playtech continued to strengthen its 
capabilities, ensuring resilience plans comply 
with national data protection laws, governing 
the collection, use, and disclosure of personal 
data in our countries of operation.
Playtech launched a Group wide program 
to ensure compliance with the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR). The project 
covers governance, risk assessment, policies 
and processes, training, incident management, 
monitoring and data cleansing in order to 
drive the right behaviours regarding the 
handling of personal data. Playtech aims to be 
fully compliant with the new EU general data 
protection regulations by May 2018.
SUMMARY OF PLAYTECH GDPR  
GOVERNANCE AND PROGRAM  
MANAGEMENT 
Governance 
Throughout 2017, GDPR readiness has been 
a priority issue for the Playtech Board and 
Executive Management. The Risk Committee 
of the Board has primary oversight over 
data protection and nominated Claire Milne 
as the Board level champion. The Board 
and Executive team have fully endorsed a 
comprehensive roadmap, developed by the 
Group Data Protection Office. The Group 
Data Protection Office has oversight for 
data protection and is supported by a cross-
functional GDPR project team. The GDPR 
project team is overseeing the implementation 
of the EU GDPR requirements across the 
Playtech Group. 
Training and Awareness 
Throughout 2017, the Playtech Group Data 
Protection Office, supported by the GDPR 
project team, has been raising awareness 
about GDPR through workshops and training. 
The internal awareness activities are fully 
supported and reiterated by executive and 
divisional management, who are instrumental 
in delivering the tone from the top on all 
compliance issues. 
Programme Management 
The Group Data Protection Office has 
developed a detailed road map for 
implementing GDPR and is currently on track 
to meet the May 2018 deadline. The roadmap 
includes a review of all Playtech systems, 
policies and processes currently in place. In 
addition, Playtech is working with each division 
to ensure that organisational controls are in line 
with the GDPR requirements for data handling.
The Group Data Protection Office has been 
holding workshops for all relevant departments 
and functions. The objectives were to raise 
awareness amongst key divisions, functions 
and employees, review current processes and 
procedures and implement detailed GDPR 
Privacy Management Activities (PMAs). The 
workshops allowed internal stakeholders to 
understand their role, responsibilities and 
accountabilities for GDPR implementation.  
The workshops also provided senior leaders 
with an in depth understanding of actions  
and timelines required for compliance. 
The GDPR project team is also working to 
ensure that operator/licensee requirements 
are taken into consideration as part of the 
overall project plan. With respect to contractual 
obligations, Playtech primarily acts as a ‘Data 
Processor’ with respect to platform services. 
Accordingly, Playtech will process personal 
data only on documented instructions from the 
Data Controller. In Playtech’s B2B operations,  
it serves as a data processor, and cannot 
collect consent from consumers (players) nor 
hold records of player consent or purpose  
for which it was given. 
On that basis, Playtech is engaging with 
licensees on GDPR; reinforcing respective 
responsibilities and encouraging necessary 
updates on processes or policies and/or to 
instructions for Playtech on changes required  
to the contractually agreed services.

ENABLING RESPONSIBLE 
GAMBLING AND PLAYER 
PROTECTION 
Playtech is committed to provide a safe, fun 
and empowering experience for consumers 
and has taken steps to enhance its responsible 
gambling capability in both the B2C and B2B 
operations. During 2017, the Company updated 
its processes and launched advanced tools to 
identify and minimise harmful play, fraud and 
money laundering risks. 
Playtech’s long-term strategic objective is to
develop and offer best in class tools that can 
help raise standards in operations and across 
the industry to:
• promote safer and responsible play; 
• empower licensees and players with 
advanced customer engagement and 
responsible gambling tools to reduce  
harm; and 
• improve the quality and use of data  
to reduce harm. 
Currently, Playtech’s integrated management 
system (IMS) provides operators and licensees 
with the latest responsible gambling protocols. 
The IMS includes controls to ensure fair 
play through fraud-detection services and 
responsible gambling tools for players. Playtech 
also provides licensees with advanced data 
analytics tools. 
To build on Playtech’s market-leading position, 
the Company acquired BetBuddy, a leading 
responsible gambling analytics solution 
provider, in late 2017. With this acquisition, 
Playtech will be able to more seamlessly 
provide its licensees with tools and data to 
promote safer play, identify and mitigate at-
risk behaviour and improve the use of data to 
reduce harm. 
PLAYER PROTECTION AND GAME DESIGN
In 2017, Playtech and BetBuddy conducted 
an exploratory project to review how data 
analytics could be used to better understand 
gaming risks. The team analysed the play 
of regular players across casino games and 
began developing a multi-year roadmap 
for sustainable game design. Playtech is 
now exploring options for future advanced 
responsible gambling tools to assist game 
designers, licensees and players. The first 
phase of work in 2018 will focus on additional 
data collection and game risk assessment, 
upon completion of which potential solutions 
and pilots will be developed. 
PLAYER PROTECTION AND KEEPING CRIME 
OUT OF GAMBLING IN POKER PLATFORM 
Within the poker network, Playtech employs its
analytical skills to proactively identify ‘at-risk’
play and unusual betting patterns that could
indicate a potential responsible gambling and/
or anti-money laundering issue. Once the
team identifies potential issues, it escalates
these issues to licensees to take action. In
2016, iPoker started informing poker licensees
of players whose financial returns fit a pattern
of sustained losses and sends a monthly
responsible gaming report. The report provided 
to the licensee is done so on an information 
only basis and is to be used in conjunction with 
any existing responsible gaming procedures 
the licensee already has in place. Due to the
limited information available to iPoker, the team
cannot decide whether a player has a gambling
problem, but can help flag potential at risk
play for licensees.
The following table outlines the percentage
of unique cases escalated to licensees on
AML, collusion and responsible gambling
over the past three years.
PLAYER PROTECTION IN LIVE CASINO 
Playtech’s Live operations provides licensees 
with information about player behaviour that 
could indicate that players are at-risk. As with 
iPoker, the Live Casino operation has very 
limited access to personal information, but 
Live’s customer support personnel have been 
trained to identify risky player behaviour and 
employ a machine learning application that 
analyses chat for phrases that could indicate  
a player is at risk. 
Upon noticing such behaviour, the players must 
be documented and reported to licensees. 
Prior to doing so, Customer Service personnel 
view the particular player’s chat and previous 
months sessions to evaluate if the player is 
displaying problematic behaviour. Customer 
Service then informs the licensee via email 
with a report table and chat excerpt as soon 
as possible. Licensees can then use the 
information from Live, along with all of the 
gameplay and financial information that the 
licensee holds, in order to further analyse the 
player behaviour and decide if and what further 
actions are needed.
 
ENABLING RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING AND 
KEEPING CRIME OUT OF GAMBLING IN  
B2C OPERATIONS 
The governance, oversight and management  
of player protection measures in Playtech’s B2C 
operations were also subject to improvements 
during 2017. During this period, Playtech 
completed an AML risk assessment for its 
B2C operations, using the Gambling Anti-
Money Laundering Group’s methodology. 
As a result of the assessment, Playtech has 
enhanced its operational procedures relating 
to VIP & high-risk players, e-wallets and 
customers changing personal details online. 
The AML risk assessment will be conducted 
annually alongside a broader compliance risk 
assessment. During 2018, Playtech will continue 
to enhance its AML monitoring, reviewing risks 
and controls on a quarterly basis.
In addition, the operations continued its reviews 
of players that exhibit significant increases  
and changes in deposits, wagering and  
gaming activity that could indicate AML  
and/or responsible gambling risk.

across B2C operations, including customer 
service staff, chat moderators, product leads, 
VIP teams and senior managers. This was 
complemented with efforts to improve awareness 
and adherence to responsible advertising and 
marketing practices, anti-money laundering and 
data protection.

TREATING CUSTOMERS FAIRLY 
Playtech is committed to treating its consumer 
and commercial customers fairly. As one of 
the largest suppliers of software to the gaming 
sector, we work hard to ensure our systems 
comply with all relevant requirements of the 
jurisdictions in which our licensees operate. 
All of Playtech’s products undergo 
comprehensive testing by independent third 
parties. As part of the certification process, our 
games and their software engines – including 
the random number generators – are regularly 
tested and certified by leading industry bodies 
to ensure consistency and fair play. 
In the B2C operations, Playtech is committed 
to advertising and marketing products fairly, 
providing players with clear and accurate 
information and easy access to customer 
services. All customers have the option to 
refer complaints to the Independent Betting 
Service (IBAS), our independent Alternative 
Dispute Resolution (ADR) body. In 2017, 
we reengineered our processes for bonus, 
promotion and advertisements to ensure 
that they are developed and approved with 
three key principles in mind: Compliance, 
Transparency, Fairness.
In October 2017, the Gambling Commission  
of Great Britain and UK’s Competition and 
Markets Authority (CMA) initiated a joint initiative 
to address concerns about consumer fairness 
by online gambling operators. The focus of the 
investigation was on unfair practices around 
gaming sign-up and free bet promotions. 
One of Playtech’s wholly owned subsidiaries, 
PT Entertainment Services Limited, gave 
undertakings to the CMA and made the 
required changes to its operations. Because  
of the new CMA requirements, Playtech is 
deploying the necessary changes within  
IMS to help our operations and licensees  
meet the new requirements.

63 GIRLS IN TECH GIBRALTAR –  
EMPOWERING THE NEXT  
GENERATION OF WOMEN IN TECH
Playtech is proud to support the launch 
of the Girls in Tech Gibraltar chapter, 
which opened its doors in early 2017. 
The chapter, which is part of a global 
network of 64+ chapters across the 
globe, was established to inspire, 
engage and empower women in  
STEM fields. 
Throughout the year, the Gibraltar 
chapter delivered a wide range 
of events to facilitate exchange of 
experiences and inspiring stories, 
to build new programming skills and 
to help deliver solutions for social 
challenges. 
Through its two day programming 
Bootcamp, the chapter enabled 24 
participants, with little to no technical 
knowledge, to deliver a fully functional 
blog application; launching their own 
deployments of the software to the 
internet. Not only did participants 
learn new skills but a number are 
also contemplating continuing their 
education with a view towards 
changing their career to a  
technical focus.
The chapter also sponsored a 
‘Hacking for Humanity’ initiative 
to engage local communities and 
charities on their challenges in order 
to explore and create innovative and 
forward-thinking solutions for important 
causes. Participating charities included 
Childline, Animals in Need and 
Understanding Gibraltar.  
The Gibraltar Finance Centre joined the 
sponsors list and provided monetary 
prizes for the top three places, with 
first place receiving £2,000 in prize 
money for their winning solution that 
provided a complete and modern 
solution to replace Childline’s legacy 
call centre and management software. 
This initiative provided positive and 
sustainable benefit in the future.
Throughout the year, the Gibraltar 
chapter has attracted the attention  
and support of professionals in both 
the public and private sector as well  
as the Chief Minister of Gibraltar and 
the newly appointed Mayor. 
In addition, their work has caught the 
attention of educational institutions 
who want to provide their students  
with the excitement and potential that 
the STEM fields present to today’s 
younger generation.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION 
Playtech has approximately 5,000 people  
in 17 different countries and relies on diverse 
backgrounds, cultures and perspectives 
to remain successful. We embrace people 
from different cultures, ethnicities, social 
backgrounds and beliefs. Playtech recognises  
it must do more to attract, recruit, and promote 
a diverse workforce across all levels. The
Company’s immediate focus is on creating
and supporting a diverse pipeline of future
leaders within the Company.
 
In 2017, Playtech took a number of steps 
to improve its recruitment, promotion, and 
mentoring practices and procedures to  
support our commitments. These included 
testing blind CVs.
In addition to reviewing internal processes, 
Playtech engaged with various diversity 
initiatives aimed at furthering inclusion and 
equality within our markets and the gaming  
& technology sector.
 
Playtech initiated, engaged and joined
initiatives aimed at empowering women and
underserved segments of society to access
and be successful in the digital economy. For
example, Playtech Estonia has continued to
support the Tech Sisters community, a nonprofit
organisation with a vision to inspire,
educate and encourage women and girls
in technology and IT. In 2017, Playtech was
proud to host the kick-off of the Tech Sisters
Tartu chapter. Playtech Estonia also participated 
in a government initiative called ‘Choose IT’; 
an adult retraining programme aiming to give 
participants basic software developer skills. 
Participants receive a basic intensive
training and internship in IT companies.  
In 2017, Playtech Estonia was proud to welcome
two such interns in the Playtech Tallinn office.
In addition, Playtech Estonia participated in
a government initiative aimed at improving
employment opportunities in IT for people with
(partial) disabilities and Playtech Estonia is also
donating its expertise and hardware to a local
NGO that unites people with physical disability.

MANAGING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL 
FOOTPRINT 
Playtech’s environmental footprint is limited 
compared to that of our peers with industrial 
operations. However, Playtech recognises 
that the energy it consumes in offices and 
data centres creates greenhouse gases (GHG) 
that contributes to climate change. Climate 
change remains one of the biggest challenges 
facing humanity, and Playtech is committed 
to reducing its GHG footprint by being as 
efficient as possible. To date, as a young but 
fast-growing business, Playtech has focused 
on strengthening its approach to energy data 
collection and analysis. In the next phase, 
Playtech plans to identify energy hotspots 
within its operations and put in place plans  
to reduce emissions.
10
CONTRIBUTING TO LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES 
Playtech people are at the forefront of 
innovation. Together, employees have a wealth 
of valuable skills and experience. In 2017, 
Playtech began to develop and formalise a new 
program to support and encourage employees 
to use their skills to make a positive social 
impact in the communities where the Company 
operates. This program will be fully deployed 
in 2018, providing employees with support to 
connect with the causes they are passionate 
about, taking time off for volunteering as well as 
contributing to individual and team fundraising.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNANCE
The Board believes that high standards of corporate governance 
contribute to Playtech’s performance and continued success.
Alan Jackson
Chairman
DEAR SHAREHOLDER 
I am pleased to present Playtech’s 
Governance Reports to shareholders.
This was a busy year for the Group during 
which time the Board has been able to 
provide strategic leadership and I would like 
to pass on my gratitude for the enthusiasm 
and dedication which the Directors and 
senior management have demonstrated.  
We have continued to focus on ensuring 
that we have an appropriate governance 
framework in place. The Board believes  
that high standards of corporate governance 
contribute to Playtech’s performance and 
continued success and these standards are 
central to the effective management of the 
business and to maintaining the confidence 
of investors.
The Board has confidence in the future 
of the Group and sees significant growth 
opportunities, and remains focused on 
looking for such opportunities in regulated 
and soon-to-be regulated markets. We 
continue to work closely with regulators in 
various markets to ensure our compliance 
with local laws and regulations.
Following the strengthening of our Internal 
Audit Team in 2016, we have continued  
with our commitment to having a dedicated 
in-house function and this underlines our 
focus on the increasing levels of complexity 
in relation to internal controls and processes. 
The historical Internal Audit Relationship  
with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) 
remains in place and Playtech is therefore 
a co-sourced arrangement, with PwC 
continuing to provide support to the Internal 
Audit Team given their experience of the 
Group and the specialist services they offer.
We continued to listen to and understand  
the views of our shareholders. In addition  
to the usual processes, we met with 
institutional shareholders, particularly 
around our proposals for changes to our 
Remuneration Policy which were approved 
at our general meeting in May, together 
with results announcements and at different 
investor conferences with a focus on the 
strategic vision of the Group.
The Board continues to strive to ensure that 
the Group’s governance structure protects 
the sustainability of its businesses and the 
communities in which it operates, while 
maximising shareholder value and treating all 
shareholders fairly. The Board also sets the 
tone for the Company. The way in which it 
conducts itself, its attitude to ethical matters, 
its definitions of success and the assessment 
of appropriate risk, all define the atmosphere 
within which the executive team works. 
The Board is cognisant of the need to strike 
a careful balance to ensure that shareholders 
and other stakeholders are appropriately 
protected by robust processes and 
procedures while providing an environment 
that fosters an entrepreneurial spirit that 
allows our senior management team and 
employees to continue to deliver the year-on-
year growth that we have achieved in recent 
years. This balance enables us to clearly 
focus on the key risks facing the Group 
but to be flexible enough in our approach 
to accommodate changes resulting from 
developments in our strategy or changes in 
the regulatory environment. 
We have set out in the following sections 
how we seek to manage the principal risks 
and uncertainties facing the business with 
further details on our governance framework, 
to explain how our corporate governance 
practices support our strategy. 
 
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is  
an important opportunity for the Board to 
meet with shareholders, particularly those 
who may not otherwise have the chance 
to engage with the Board and senior 
management. Our 2018 AGM is scheduled  
for 10.00 am on 16 May 2018 at The Sefton 
Hotel, Douglas, Isle of Man and we look 
forward to seeing you there.

DIRECTORS’ GOVERNANCE REPORT 
INTRODUCTION 
Responsibility for corporate governance  
lies with the Board, which is committed  
to maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance and is ultimately accountable 
to shareholders. The report which follows 
explains our most important governance 
processes and how they support the  
Group’s business. In particular, we have 
applied the principles of good governance 
advocated by the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”). The Code applied  
to Playtech throughout the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017. A copy of the 
Code is available at www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/
Codes-Standards/Corporate-governance/UK-
Corporate-Governance-Code.aspx.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT 
We continued to make improvements during 
the year both to our Board structure and our 
governance procedures and I am delighted 
to be able to report that it is the view of 
the Board that the Company has been fully 
compliant with the principles of the Code 
during 2017. 
Claire Milne was appointed as a Non-
executive Director on 8 July 2016. Claire 
is a recognised expert in eGaming and 
technology law and regulation, with 20 years’ 
experience advising gaming and financial 
services clients as an in-house and private 
practice lawyer and was, at the time of her 
appointment, and continues to be, a Partner 
and Team Leader within the Intellectual 
Property and Science and Technology teams 
for Appleby (Isle of Man) LLC (the “Firm”).  
The Firm has provided, and continues to 
provide, regulatory and legal advice to 
the Company from time to time, however, 
given the overall size of the Firm and the 
relatively small scale of fees received, this 
relationship was not considered to impact 
on her independence. In addition, in order to 
reinforce her independence, it was agreed 
that following her appointment, Claire would 
not be involved in the provision of advice 
by the Firm to the Group, her remuneration 
from the Firm would not be linked, directly 
or indirectly, to the receipt of fees from 
the Group, and that any potential residual 
conflicts will be managed carefully.
The Company’s auditor, BDO LLP, is required 
to review whether the above statement 
reflects the Company’s compliance with the 
Code by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority and to report if it does not reflect 
such compliance. No such negative report 
has been made.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders for good governance and  
the statement set out below describes  
how the Group applies the principles 
identified in the Code. 
 
THE BOARD
COMPOSITION 
As at 31 December 2017, the Board 
comprised the Non-executive Chairman,

and Chief Financial Officer on 10 January 
2017, the Directors served throughout the 
financial year. 
Ron Hoffman stepped down as an Executive 
Director and Chief Financial Officer on  
10 January 2017.
The Non-executive Directors are all 
considered by the Board to be independent 
of management and free of any relationship 
which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement,  
as explained above. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary 
to the Board and its Committees and his 
appointment and removal is a matter for the 
Board as a whole. The Company Secretary  
is a member of the Group’s management 
team and all the Directors have access

DIRECTORS’ GOVERNANCE REPORT CONT.
HOW THE BOARD FUNCTIONS 
In accordance with the Code, the Board 
is collectively responsible for the long-
term success of the Company. The Board 
provides entrepreneurial leadership for the 
Company within a framework of prudent 
and effective controls that enable risk to be 
assessed and managed. The Board sets the 
Company’s strategic aims, and ensures that 
the necessary resources are in place for the 
Company to meet its objectives and reviews 
management performance. 
The Board meets regularly and frequently, 
with 9 meetings scheduled and held in 2017. 
During the year, it was also necessary for 
the Board to hold one unscheduled Board 
meeting by telephone in accordance with the 
articles of association, in connection with the 
trading update announced in November 2017. 
During the year, the Chairman met the other 
Non-executive Directors in the absence of 
the Executive Directors to re-confirm and 
take account of their views. All Non-executive 
Directors have sufficient time to fulfil their 
commitments to the Company.
In addition to receiving reports from the 
Board’s Committees, reviewing the financial 
and operational performance of the Group 
and receiving regular reports on M&A, legal, 
regulatory and investor relations matters at 
the Board meetings, the other key matters 
considered by the Board during 2017  
are set out in the table on page 71.
Board meetings are generally held at the 
registered office of the Company on the  
Isle of Man, although during the year a 
meeting was held in each of Vienna,  
Gibraltar and Milan.
Directors are provided with comprehensive 
background information for each meeting 
and all Directors were available to participate 
fully and on an informed basis in Board 
decisions. In addition, certain members  
of the senior management team including  
the Chief Operating Officer, the General 
Counsel, the Head of Regulatory and 
Compliance and the Head of Investor 
Relations are invited to attend the whole or 
parts of the meetings to deliver their reports 
on the business. Any specific actions arising 
during meetings are agreed by the Board 
and a comprehensive follow-up procedure 
ensures their completion.
Details of the attendance of the Directors at 
meetings of the Board and its Committees 
are set out in the table below.
RESPONSIBILITY AND DELEGATION
The Chairman is primarily responsible for  
the efficient functioning of the Board. He 
ensures that all Directors receive sufficient 
relevant information on financial, business 
and corporate issues prior to meetings.  
The Chief Executive Officer’s responsibilities 
focus on co-ordinating the Group’s business 
and implementing Group strategy. Regular 
interaction between the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer between meetings 
ensures the Board remains fully informed of 
developments in the business at all times.
There remains in place a formal schedule 
of matters specifically reserved for Board 
consideration and approval, which includes 
the matters set out below: 
• Approval of the Group’s long-term 
objectives and commercial strategy; 
• Approval of the annual operating and 
capital expenditure budgets and any 
changes to them;

any new business or geographic areas, or

Accounts, preliminary and half-yearly 
financial statements; interim management

responsibilities to a number of Committees 
of the Board to assist in the discharge of its 
duties. The principal Committees currently

Committee, the Risk & Compliance Committee 
and the Nominations Committee. The minutes 
of each of these Committees are circulated 
to and reviewed by their members. The 
Company Secretary is secretary to each of 
these Committees. The terms of reference  
for each of the Committees are available  
to view on the Company’s website  
www.playtech.com.
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee’s key objectives are 
the provision of effective governance over 
the appropriateness of the Group’s financial 
reporting, including the adequacy of related 
disclosures, the performance of both the 
internal and external audit function, and  
the management of the Group’s systems  
of internal control, business risks and  
related compliance activities.
The Audit Committee’s report is set out 
on pages 77 to 79 and details the Audit 
Committee’s membership, activities during 
the year, significant issues that it considered 
in relation to the financial statements and

the Committee assessed the effectiveness of 
the external audit process and the approach 
taken in relation to the appointment or 
reappointment of the auditors. 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for making recommendations to the Board 
on Remuneration Policy for the Chairman, 
Executive Directors and senior management.

details the Remuneration Committee’s 
membership, activities during the year and 
the policy on remuneration. The Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee attends the 
Annual General Meeting to respond to any 
questions that shareholders might raise on 
the Remuneration Committee’s activities. 
 
RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE 
Under the Code, the Board is responsible 
for determining the nature and extent of 
the significant risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives. The Board

by Paul Hewitt. The other members of the 
Committee are Alan Jackson (Non-executive 
Chairman), Andrew Thomas (Non-executive 
Director), John Jackson (Non-executive 
Director) and Claire Milne (Non-executive 
Director). Ian Ince (Head of Regulatory and 
Compliance) and Robert Penfold (Head of

In addition, PwC LLP, in their capacity as

adequate; and

DIRECTORS’ GOVERNANCE REPORT CONT.
The Risk & Compliance Committee met 
formally four times during the year and in 
addition held a number of conference calls 
throughout the year, and a summary of the 
key matters considered by the Committee 
during 2017 are set out below: 
• Monitor the regulatory position in a number 
of jurisdictions including those which are of 
relative importance to the Group financially 
and those where changes may represent  
a risk or opportunity for the Group; 
• Consider the costs and regulatory 
requirements for the Group to seek relevant 
licences in newly regulating markets; 
• Applications by or on behalf of the  
Group for licences in existing or newly 
regulated markets; 
• Monitor developments in relation to 
changes in the regulatory regime in the 
United Kingdom and receiving reports in 
relation to the likely impact on the Group 
and the need for entities within the Group 
to apply for licences; 
• Consider the overall effectiveness  
of the compliance strategy and the 
regulatory risks to the Group’s operations 
and revenues; 
• Receive and consider reports on 
discussions with, and the results  
of audits by regulators; 
• Monitoring compliance with regulatory 
licences held in all jurisdictions and 
adapting procedures, products and 
technology as appropriate;
• Review reports by PwC as external advisers 
on risk management; consideration of the 
risks identified from the Group’s risk register 
and of the effectiveness of actions taken  
to mitigate such risks; and
• Consideration of the key risks associated 
with the Financials division.
The Committee has been kept informed  
of any changes to the regulatory position  
in any significant jurisdiction where the 
Group, through its licensees, and Financials 
division, may be exposed and updated on 
progress in relation to agreed action items 
on a regular basis. The Committee can also 
convene meetings on a more frequent basis 
or as when matters arise, if it is determined 
that enhanced monitoring of a specific risk  
is warranted. 
A table setting out the principal significant 
risks identified by the Group (including 
with the oversight and input of the Risk & 
Compliance Committee) and the mitigating 
actions that have been undertaken by  
the Group in relation to these is set out on 
pages 54 to 57 of this report. 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE 
The Board is required by the Code to 
establish a Nominations Committee 
which should lead the process for Board 
appointments and make recommendations 
for appointments to the Board. A majority 
of members of the Nominations Committee 
should be independent Non-executive 
Directors. The Nominations Committee’s 
key objective is to ensure that the Board 
comprises individuals with the necessary 
skills, knowledge and experience to  
ensure that it is effective in discharging  
its responsibilities.
The Nominations Committee comprises Alan 
Jackson (Chairman), Andrew Thomas, Paul 
Hewitt, John Jackson and Claire Milne. 
The Nominations Committee reviews the 
structure, size and composition of the 
Board and its Committees and makes 
recommendations with regard to any 
changes considered necessary in the 
identification and nomination of new 
Directors, the reappointment of existing 
Directors and appointment of members to 
the Board’s Committees. It also assesses 
the roles of the existing Directors in 
office to ensure that there continues to 
be a balanced Board in terms of skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity. The 
Nominations Committee reviews the senior 
leadership needs of the Group to enable it 
to compete effectively in the marketplace. 
The Nominations Committee also advises the 
Board on succession planning for Executive 
Director appointments although the Board 
itself is responsible for succession generally.
The Nominations Committee has not set itself 
any formal targets for diversity, including 
gender, and believes that appointments 
should be based on merit, compared against 
objective criteria, with the ultimate aim 
of ensuring the Board has the right skills, 
knowledge and experience that enable it to 
discharge its responsibilities properly. 
The Nominations Committee meets on 
an as-needed basis. One formal meeting 
was held in 2017. The meeting focused 
on the consideration of candidates for the 
appointment of Executive Director and Chief 
Financial Officer. This led, after a process 
involving the review of a number of potential 
candidates, to the appointment of Andrew 
Smith in January 2017. No external search 
consultancy was used in the appointment of 
Andrew Smith; however, a list of candidates 
from a range of backgrounds was prepared. 
The Nominations Committee went on to 
recommend Andrew Smith’s appointment 
as an Executive Director and Chief Financial 
Officer of the Company having considered  
in detail his skills, knowledge, experience  
and contribution to the business in his  
role as Head of Investor Relations. 
DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE 
The Disclosure Committee ensures accuracy 
and timeliness of public announcements of 
the Company and monitors the Company’s 
obligations under the Listing Rules and 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the 
UK Listing Authority. Meetings are held 
as required. At the date of this report the 
Disclosure Committee comprises Andrew 
Thomas (Chairman of the Audit Committee), 
Andrew Smith (Chief Financial Officer), Alex 
Latner (General Counsel) and Brian Moore 
(Company Secretary).  PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE 
The senior management committee is the 
key management committee for the Group. 
The standing members of the Committee 
are Mor Weizer (Chief Executive Officer), 
Andrew Smith (Chief Financial Officer), 
Shimon Akad (Chief Operating Officer), 
Uri Levy (VP Business Development), Ian 
Ince (Head of Regulatory and Compliance), 
Brian Moore (Company Secretary) and Alex 
Latner (General Counsel). Other members 
of senior management are invited to the 
Committee as and when required. The 
Committee considers and discusses plans 
and recommendations coming from the 
operational side of the business and from 
the various product verticals, in the light of 
the Group’s strategy and capital expenditure 
and investment budgets, including the 
implications of those plans (in areas such  
as resources, budget, legal and compliance). 
The Committee either approves the plans or 
as necessary refers the proposal for formal 
Board review and approval in accordance 
with the Company’s formal matters reserved 
for the Board. 
BOARD TENURE 
In accordance with the Company’s articles of 
association, every new Director appointed in 
the year is required to stand for re-election by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) next following their appointment. Also, 
under the articles of association, at each 
AGM one-third of the Directors (excluding 
any Director who has been appointed by 
the Board since the previous AGM) or, if their 
number is not an integral multiple of three, 
the number nearest to one-third but not 
exceeding one-third shall retire from office 
(but so that if there are fewer than three 
Directors who are subject to retirement by 
rotation under the articles one shall retire).
Notwithstanding the provisions of the articles 
of association, the Board has decided to 
comply with the Code requirements that 
Directors of companies in the FTSE 250 
Index submit themselves for re-election 
annually. Therefore, all Directors are seeking 
their reappointment at this year’s AGM. 
The Board has collectively agreed that 
the Directors proposed for re-election 
at this year’s AGM have made significant 
contributions to the business since their last 
re-election and each has a key role to play in 
the formulation of the Group’s future strategy.
In certain circumstances, Directors are 
entitled to seek independent professional 
advice under an agreed Board procedure, 
which would then be organised by the 
Company Secretary, and in this regard  
the Company would meet their reasonable 
legal expenses. 
BALANCE OF THE BOARD 
The Board comprises individuals with  
wide business experience gained in  
various industry sectors related to the 
Group’s current business and it is the 
intention of the Board to ensure that the 
balance of the Directors reflects the  
changing needs of the business. 
The Board considers that it is of a size 
and has the balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience and independence that is 
appropriate for the Group’s current business. 
While not having a specific policy regarding 
the constitution and balance of the Board, 
potential new Directors are considered on 
their own merits with regard to their skills, 
knowledge, experience and credentials.
The Non-executive Directors continue to 
contribute their considerable collective 
experience and wide-ranging skills to the 
Board and provide a valuable independent 
perspective; where necessary constructively 
challenging proposals, policy and practices of 
executive management. In addition, they help 
formulate the Group’s strategy. 
EVALUATION 
The Board is committed to an ongoing 
evaluation process of itself and its 
Committees to assess their performance and 
identify areas in which their effectiveness, 
policies and processes might be enhanced. 
Alan Jackson, in discussion with the Senior 
Non-executive Director, undertook a review 
of the performance of individual Directors. 
Andrew Thomas as Senior Non-executive 
Director considered the performance of Mr 
Jackson taking into account the views of the 
Executive Directors. There were no material 
areas of concern highlighted and the main 
outcome of the evaluation this year was to 
shape and define the Board’s objectives for 
the coming year, continuing the focus on 
Group strategy and ensuring the structures, 
capabilities and reporting are in place to 
achieve the Board’s goals. 
A review of the Board’s effectiveness 
commenced in late 2017. This review was 
facilitated by Independent Audit Limited, 
using their Thinking Board online assessment 
service. Independent Audit Limited have no 
other connection to the Company and are 
considered by the Board to be independent. 
The Company Secretary is in the process 
of finalising this review, following which the 
board members will discuss the findings and 
will continue to adopt and implement plans 
to further develop the effectiveness of the 
Board during 2018. 
Newly appointed Directors can expect  
a detailed and systematic induction on  
joining the Board. They meet various 
members of senior management and 
familiarise themselves with all core aspects  
of the Group’s operations. On request, 
meetings can be arranged with major 
shareholders. Members of senior 
management are invited to attend Board 
meetings from time to time to present  
on specific areas of the Group’s business.  PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

DIRECTORS’ GOVERNANCE REPORT CONT.
RELATIONSHIP WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS 
Primary responsibility for effective 
communication with shareholders lies  
with the Chairman, but all the Company’s 
Directors are available to meet with 
shareholders throughout the year. Alan 
Jackson, Mor Weizer, Andrew Smith 
and John Jackson met with a number of 
shareholders to discuss the Company’s 
business and remuneration strategies 
throughout the year. The Executive Directors 
prepare a general presentation for analysts 
and institutional shareholders following 
the interim and full-year announcements. 
Details of these presentations together with 
the Group’s financial statements and other 
announcements can be found on the investor 
relations section of the Company’s website. 
Further presentations are also prepared 
following significant acquisitions and 
whenever the Board considers it beneficial  
to shareholders to do so. Regular meetings 
with shareholders and potential shareholders 
are also held by the Head of Investor 
Relations, and in conjunction with either  
the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief 
Financial Officer. The Company held an 
Investor Day in November 2017.
The Company endeavours to answer all 
queries raised by shareholders promptly.
Brickington Trading Limited (“Brickington”) 
is a wholly owned subsidiary of a trust, the 
ultimate beneficiary of which is Teddy Sagi, 
one of the Group’s founders. On 2 December 
2016, the Company and Brickington entered 
into a variation to the relationship agreement 
(the “Relationship Agreement”), whereby the 
rights afforded to Playtech in the Relationship 
Agreement will remain in place for so long 
as Brickington’s holding (together with its 
associates) remains at least 15% of the issued 
share capital. 
During 2017, Brickington reduced its 
shareholding in the Company to 6.3% by 
the sale of 13.0 million shares in March 2017 
and a further sale of 36.5 million shares 
in June 2017. Accordingly, following the 
completion of the second sale in June 2017, 
the Relationship Agreement was terminated 
in accordance with its terms. 
The Board confirms that up until its 
termination in 2017:
• The Company complied with the 
independence provisions included  
in the Relationship Agreement;
• So far as the Company is aware, the 
independence provisions included in the 
Relationship Agreement had been complied 
with by Brickington and its associates; and
• So far as the Company is aware, the 
procurement obligations included in 
the Relationship Agreement, had been 
complied with by Brickington and  
its associates. 
Separately, Mr Sagi entered into an 
agreement with the Company in 2012 
pursuant to which he will, as and when 
requested to do so by the Board, provide 
advisory services to the Company for a 
nominal fee of €1 per annum until either 
Mr Sagi ceases to be interested (whether 
legally or beneficially) in any ordinary shares 
or either party terminates the agreement 
following its fifth anniversary, whichever is 
the earlier. During the year, the Company 
has sought advisory services on occasion in 
relation to certain significant strategic matters. 
This agreement to provide advisory services 
remains in place.
Shareholders are encouraged to participate 
in the Company’s AGM, at which the 
Chairman will present the key highlights  
of the Group’s performance. The Board will 
be available at the AGM to answer questions 
from shareholders.
INVESTOR RELATIONS  
AND COMMUNICATIONS 
The Company has well-established Investor 
Relations (IR) processes, which support a 
structured programme of communications 
with existing and potential investors 
and analysts. Executive Directors and 
members of the IR team participated in 
a number of investor events, attending 
industry conferences and regularly meet 
or are in contact with existing and potential 
institutional investors from around the world, 
ensuring that Group performance and 
strategy is effectively communicated, within 
regulatory constraints. Other representatives 
of the Board and senior management meet 
with investors from time to time. The Head 
of IR provides regular reports to the Board 
on related matters, issues of concern to 
investors, and analysts’ views and opinions. 
Whenever required, the Executive Directors 
and the Chairman communicate with our 
joint brokers Goodbody and UBS to confirm 
shareholder sentiment and to consult on 
governance issues. 
During 2017, 49 regulatory announcements 
were released informing the market of 
acquisitions, corporate actions, important 
customer contracts, financial results, the 
results of Annual General Meetings, the 
results of General Meetings and Board 
changes. Copies of these announcements, 
together with other IR information and 
documents, are available on the Group 
website www.playtech.com. 
SUMMARY 
In presenting this report, and having 
monitored, reviewed or approved all 
shareholder communications in 2017 and 
since the end of the financial year, the Board 
is confident that it has presented a balanced 
and understandable assessment of the 
Company’s position and prospects.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
COMPOSITION 
The Audit Committee comprises four 
independent Non-executive Directors and 
is chaired by Andrew Thomas, who is a 
qualified Chartered Accountant and member 
of the Institute of Taxation. Therefore Andrew 
has recent relevant financial experience, in 
compliance with the Code provision C3.1, and 
was appointed to chair the Committee on his 
appointment to the Board in June 2012. The 
other members of the Audit Committee are 
Paul Hewitt, John Jackson and Claire Milne, 
all Non-executive Directors. The Committee 
is authorised to obtain independent advice if 
considered necessary. 
The Chief Financial Officer attended 
all meetings of the Audit Committee by 
invitation, and the Vice President of Finance 
was invited to attend the meetings of the 
Committee that considered the audited 
accounts and the interim financial statements, 
as was the external auditor, BDO LLP (BDO). 
The members of the Committee were 
also able to meet the auditors without any 
Executive Directors being present in order to 
receive feedback from them on matters such 
as the quality of interaction with management. 
The Chairman of the Committee also met 
with BDO separately on several occasions to 
discuss matters involving the audit process. 
During the year, the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee met, individually and in 
private, with members of the management 
team in order to understand more fully 
the context and challenges of Playtech’s 
business operations and thereby ensure the 
Committee’s time was used most effectively. 
The activities of the Committee members 
during the last year have enabled it to gain 
a good understanding of the culture of the 
organisation, the risks and challenges faced 
and the adequacy and timeliness of the 
action being taken to address them. 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Audit Committee’s primary function is 
to assist the Board in fulfilling its financial 
oversight responsibilities. The Board 
is required by the Code to establish 
formal and transparent arrangements for 
considering how it should apply required 
financial reporting standards and internal 
control principles and also for maintaining 
appropriate relationships with the Company’s 
external auditors, BDO. The Committee’s 
terms of reference can be viewed on the 
Company’s website www.playtech.com. 
In particular, the Code calls for the description 
of the work of the Audit Committee to include 
the significant issues considered in relation to 
the financial statements and how they were 
addressed, how the Committee assessed 
the effectiveness of the external audit 
process, the approach of the Committee to 
appointing the auditors and how objectivity 
and independence are safeguarded relative 
to non-audit services. 
The primary responsibilities delegated to,  
and discharged by, the Committee included: 
• Monitoring and challenging the 
effectiveness of internal control and 
associated functions; 
• Approving and amending Group  
accounting policies; 
• Reviewing and ensuring the integrity of 
interim and annual financial statements, 
in particular the actions and judgements 
of management in relation thereto before 
submission to the Board; 
• Monitoring the implementation of the 
Company’s Code of Business Ethics  
(“Code of Ethics”) and compliance with  
their provisions; 
• Reviewing the Company’s arrangements 
for its employees to raise concerns, 
anonymously or in confidence and 
without fear of retaliation, about possible 
wrongdoing in financial reporting or other 
matters arising under the Code of Ethics; 
• Reviewing promptly all reports on the 
Company from the internal auditors  
and reviewing and assessing the annual 
internal audit plan; 
• Monitoring the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity, including  
the effectiveness of the audit services;
• Monitoring and approving the scope and 
costs of audit; and 
• Ensuring audit independence and  
pre-approving any significant non-audit 
services to be provided by the auditor.
 
AUDIT COMMITTEE’S ACTIVITIES 
In 2017, the Audit Committee met formally 
four times.
Matters that were considered by the 
Committee during the year included:
• Adoption of an updated risk register  
for the Group;
• Effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls and risk management; 
• Updates on people risk, and  
cybersecurity risks;
• Review of internal audit plan;
• Results of internal audit reviews, 
management action plans to resolve any 
issues arising and the tracking  
of their resolution;
• Post acquisition reviews; and
• Review of Committee terms of reference.
Its work also included reviewing the final 
and interim financial statements and matters 
raised by management and BDO. After 
discussions with both management and the 
external auditor, including the consideration 
of acquisition accounting relating to business 
combinations, and related contingent 
consideration and impairments, made in 
the current and prior years, the Committee 
determined that the key risks of misstatement 
of the Group’s financial statements, related to 
the following areas (which are described in 
the relevant accounting policies and detailed 
in the Notes to the financial statements on 
pages 115 to 156).
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
The Audit Committee reviewed  
the judgements made in respect of  
revenue recognition, in particular to 
assess the recognition of revenue from 
arrangements with customers and partners 
where the Group is to be remunerated other 
than by way of a simple revenue share 
arrangement, and undertook a review  
of key contracts. Following this review,  
the Committee concluded that the timing  
of revenue recognition continues to be in 
line with IFRS requirements. BDO performed 
detailed audit procedures on revenue 
recognition and reported their findings  
to the Committee, which was satisfied  
as a result of the review process that the 
approach taken by the Group in the  
financial statements was appropriate.  PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
GOVERNANCE

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONT.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The Audit Committee reviewed the 
judgements made in connection with 
the accounting treatment for business 
combinations during the year, together 
with the assessment of related liabilities in 
connection with deferred and contingent 
consideration, and any impairment of the 
underlying investments of previous years’ 
acquisitions. The Committee reviewed the 
purchase price allocations (prepared by 
professional advisers), together with the 
underlying judgements and forecasts used 
to determine the fair value of intangible 
assets, put and call options, and contingent 
consideration, and satisfied itself that the 
approach to the accounting treatment 
taken by the Group was appropriate and 
in accordance with IFRS requirements 
and accounting practice. In particular, the 
Committee reviewed and considered Board 
papers prepared to support assessments of 
the fair value of contingent consideration, and 
any impairment considerations, in respect 
of the acquisitions of TradeTech Markets 
Limited, Consolidated Financial Holdings A/S, 
and ACM Group Limited.
GOODWILL AND  
INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
During the year, the Audit Committee also 
considered the judgements made in relation 
to the valuation methodology adopted by 
management to support the carrying value 
of goodwill and other intangible assets 
to determine whether there was a risk of 
material misstatement in the carrying value 
of these assets and whether an impairment 
should be recognised. The Committee 
considered the assumptions, estimates and 
judgements made by management to support 
the models that underpin the valuation 
of intangible assets in the balance sheet. 
Business plans and cash-flow forecasts 
prepared by management supporting the 
future performance expectations used 
in the calculations were reviewed. The 
Committee received a report on the outcome 
of the impairment reviews performed by 
management, together with a specific board 
memorandum in connection with the cash 
generating units in the Financials Division. 
The impairment reviews were also an 
area of focus for the external auditor, who 
reported their findings to the Committee. The 
Committee satisfied itself that no material 
impairments were required to the carrying 
value of goodwill or other intangible assets.
LEGAL, REGULATORY  
AND TAXATION
Given the developing nature of the gambling 
sector in many countries across the world, 
and evolving regulation in the financial 
trading sector, there is a risk that potential 
material legal or regulatory matters are not 
disclosed or provided for in the financial 
statements and therefore the Committee 
considered with the Group’s compliance 
and legal departments whether there were 
any known instances of material breaches 
in regulatory and licence compliance that 
needed to be disclosed or other claims 
that required provisions to be made in 
the financial statements. In particular, the 
Committee considered forthcoming changes 
in the regulatory environment in a number of 
jurisdictions in which the Group’s licensees 
operate, together with the implementation 
of revised financial services regulations. The 
Committee considered the control systems 
adopted to identify potential regulatory 
issues and the compliance control systems 
operating in the Group. Discussions were 
held with the Head of Regulatory and 
Compliance. Following this review, the 
Committee were satisfied that adequate 
provisions and disclosures were being made 
for any potential contingent liabilities.
The Audit Committee reviewed and 
approved the overall tax management and 
strategy of the Group during the year in light 
of external and internal advice sought by 
management and reviewed how the Group 
considers tax as part of its overall business 
planning. Consideration was given to transfer 
pricing studies carried out on behalf of the 
Group in the period, and assessed, in respect 
of earlier studies, whether there had been 
any change in the basis of operations in the 
relevant territories. Furthermore, given that 
the tax rules and practices governing the 
e-commerce environment in which the Group 
operates continue to evolve, based on the 
aforementioned external and internal advice 
received, the Audit Committee considered 
developments and pending changes in 
domestic and international tax laws and 
was satisfied that adequate tax provisions 
and disclosures were being made for any 
potential liabilities. 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Audit Committee examined the practices 
and procedures adopted by the Group 
to ensure that related party transactions 
are conducted on arm’s length terms. The 
Committee considered the processes 
followed in relation to such transactions that 
were entered into during 2017 and concluded 
that the process had worked effectively 
and that the related party transactions 
with entities that are related by virtue of a 
common significant shareholder had been 
properly conducted on an arm’s length basis 
and appropriately disclosed in the financial 
statements. On 27 June 2017, Brickington 
Trading Limited (Brickington) decreased 
its holding to 6.3% and from this date 
Brickington no longer meets the definition of 
a related party. BDO undertook a review of 
this area as part of its audit work.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Group’s financial statements are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee in advance 
of their consideration by the Board. The 
Committee confirms that it is satisfied that the 
auditor has fulfilled its responsibilities with 
diligence and professionalism.
Having undertaken the processes described 
above, the Committee is satisfied that the 
financial statements appropriately address 
the critical judgements and key estimates 
(both in respect to the amounts reported and 
the disclosures).
Based on the above, the Committee consider 
that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced, understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

INTERNAL CONTROL 
In recognition of the increasing levels of 
complexity in relation to internal controls and 
a desired commitment to have a dedicated 
in-house function, we strengthened our 
Internal Audit Team during 2016. The 
historical Internal Audit relationship between 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) and 
Playtech continues and is therefore a co-
sourced arrangement, with PwC continuing 
to provide support to the Internal Audit Team 
given their experience of the Group and the 
specialist services they offer.
During the year, the Internal Audit Team 
performed a number of reviews over  
both individual entities and central functions 
across the Group. The results of these audits 
were reported to the Audit Committee on 
a regular basis, with recommendations 
made by Internal Audit and corresponding 
management actions being reviewed and 
challenged, where appropriate. In addition  
to regular feedback of audit results, the 
Internal Audit Team monitor completion  
of management actions and provide  
updates of these to the Audit Committee  
on a quarterly basis.
An Internal Audit Plan for 2018 was 
developed by the Internal Audit Team 
and agreed with the Audit Committee 
at the November 2017 Audit Committee 
meeting. Internal Audit will carry out audits 
in accordance with this plan using a risk 
based approach and continue to maintain 
effective lines of communication with the 
Audit Committee and key management. 
The Internal Audit Team will also be utilised 
to provide assurance over corporate 
governance matters and for ad hoc  
projects, where necessary.
The Board confirms that any necessary  
action will be taken to remedy any significant 
failings or weaknesses identified from any 
Internal Audit reviews. The system of internal 
controls and audit is designed to ensure  
local legal and regulatory compliance and 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives. It 
can therefore only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
AUDITOR’S INDEPENDENCE 
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the  
Board, undertakes a formal assessment  
of the auditor’s independence each year, 
which includes: 
• A review of non-audit related services 
provided by BDO and related fees; 
• A discussion with the auditor of a written 
report detailing all relationships with the 
Group and any other parties which could 
affect independence or the perception  
of independence; 
• A review of the auditor’s own procedures 
for ensuring independence of the audit  
firm and partners and staff involved in the 
audit, including the periodic rotation of the 
audit partner; 
• Obtaining written confirmation from the 
auditors that they are independent; and 
• A review of fees paid to the auditors in 
respect of audit and non-audit services. 
During the year the auditors undertook 
certain specific pieces of non-audit work 
(including work in relation to tax matters 
and the evaluation of potential acquisition 
targets). BDO were selected to undertake 
these tasks due to their familiarity with the 
gambling industry. In order to maintain 
BDO’s independence and objectivity, BDO 
undertook its standard independence 
procedures in relation to those engagements. 
Further details of the non-audit fees  
are included in Note 6 to the financial 
statements on page 128.
The Audit Committee will continue to assess 
the effectiveness and independence of 
the external auditors. In doing so, the Audit 
Committee will consider a formal tender 
process in accordance with the provisions  
of the Code. The Audit Committee will 
continue to comply with the Competition 
Commission Order relating to the statutory 
audit market for FTSE 350 companies, which 
came into effect from 1 October 2014. The 
Audit Committee expects a formal tender 
process to begin in the latter half of 2018.

STATEMENT BY THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
REMUNERATION REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER 
On behalf of the Board, I welcome  
the opportunity to present the Remuneration 
Committee’s report on Directors’ 
remuneration for the year to 31 December 
2017. This report, describes how the  
Board has applied the principles of  
the UK Corporate Governance Code  
to Directors’ remuneration. 
Although Playtech is an Isle of Man 
incorporated entity and, as such, is not 
required to comply with the UK regulations 
on Directors’ remuneration, we recognise 
the importance of shareholder transparency. 
Accordingly, we can confirm that the 
Company adheres to the UK regulations and 
the report below is divided into: (i) this Annual 
Statement; (ii) the Remuneration Policy Report 
containing the Group’s Remuneration Policy, 
and (iii) the Annual Report on Remuneration 
(or ARR) that reports on the implementation 
of the Company’s stated Remuneration Policy 
for the year to 31 December 2017. 
As the Company, so far as practicable, takes 
account of the UK legislation applicable to 
a premium listed main market company, the 
Remuneration Policy was put to a vote at a 
general meeting held immediately after the 
Annual General Meeting in May 2017.  
The resolution to consider the Remuneration 
Policy was approved with 83.89% of votes 
cast being in favour.
The Committee wishes to ensure that  
the policy:
• Is aligned to the delivery of the Group’s 
business strategy;
• Is appropriate in terms of quantum  
taking into account the experience  
of the executives and market data  
for organisations of a similar size  
and complexity;
• Is sufficiently flexible to cope with changes 
to the Group over the life of the policy; and
• Will strengthen the alignment between 
executives and shareholders
and therefore, will be in the best interests of 
shareholders to ensure future growth of the 
Group. 
The ARR and this Statement will be the 
subject of an advisory shareholder resolution 
at the forthcoming AGM. 
 
PHILOSOPHY
Our Remuneration Policy, which is set out 
in more detail in this report, is designed 
to reward the contributions of senior 
management as well as incentivise them to 
maintain and enhance Playtech’s position as 
the software and services provider of choice 
to the gambling sector and deliver in line with 
Playtech’s M&A strategy. 
Remuneration is delivered via fixed 
remuneration and simple and transparent 
incentive-based plans enabling the Executive 
Directors to be rewarded for delivering strong 
financial performance and sustainable returns 
to shareholders. In fast moving sectors such 
as ours we need to apply the policy flexibly in 
order to deliver the right level of overall pay 
to Directors.
Remuneration is delivered via fixed remuneration

PERFORMANCE OUTCOME  
FOR 2017 
2017 was another year of strong  
operational and financial performance. 
Progress has been driven through strong 
organic growth, successful acquisitions  
and strategic agreements. 
In November 2017, we issued a trading 
update and noted the impact of certain 
Asian markets and Sun Bingo performance 
on the Group’s performance for the full year. 
We noted our intention to continue with 
our strategy of focusing on both organic 
growth and inorganic revenue growth in 
regulated and to-be-regulated markets. 
Our M&A pipeline remains very strong and 
the Company is in active discussions with 
a range of Gaming businesses consistent 
with executing this strategy and with the 
expectation that the relative contribution  
from Asia to the Group will consistently 
reduce over time. 
This focus on our strategy resulted in 
achieving strong results across our key 
financial performance measures including 
growth, on a reported basis, in revenue of 
14%, Adjusted EBITDA 7%, Adjusted Net Profit 
14% and diluted EPS increased by 14%. 
Given the strong financial and operational 
results, the Remuneration Committee 
considered that the Executive Directors had 
performed exceptionally well against both the 
challenging financial targets and the other 
strategic objectives given to them at the start 
of 2017, including successful negotiations 
with new and existing customers, expanding 
the business in regulated and soon-to-be 
regulated markets, strengthening the Group’s 
regulatory functions in light of increased 
regulation in the UK and elsewhere and our 
new acquisitions during the year including 
Eyecon Group and ACM Group together with 
a new agreement with OPAP. Accordingly, 
in recognition of this strong performance, 
the Committee has, consistent with our 
Remuneration Policy, awarded a bonus of 
186% of actual salary earned during the year 
to the CEO and 139% of actual salary earned 
during the year to the CFO. The Committee 
is very comfortable that this level of bonus 
reflects the delivery of superior financial 
performance together with the strong 
personal performance and commitment of 
the Executive Directors during 2017. Further 
details of the bonuses are set out in the ARR.
The Remuneration Committee considered 
the position of awards to Executive Directors 
pursuant to the Group’s Long-Term Incentive 
Plan 2012 and made grants to them in  
June 2017. Further details of the grants  
are set out in the ARR. The LTIP awards 
granted in 2015 reached the end of their 
three-year performance period on 31 
December 2017. The 70% of the award based 
on EPS vested in full as the stretching targets 
were met, The 30% of the award based on 
TSR just failed to achieve the necessary 
performance threshold and so lapsed.
As stated in our Remuneration Policy, salaries 
for the executive directors are normally 
reviewed in June and salary increases were 
awarded to both the CEO and CFO in June 
2017. Further details are set out in the ARR. 
As regards the salary increase for the CEO, 
the Committee took into account a number 
of key factors, including his unparalleled 
contribution to the Group over an extended 
period. The Committee was also cognisant 
of the competitive landscape in the gaming 
industry and the CEO’s proven ability to 
grow the business in a challenging market 
environment. The Committee felt that the 
time was right to recognize his enormous 
contribution and continuing dedication to 
the business. Taking these and other factors 
into account, it was decided to increase 
the CEO’s salary from GBP600,000 to 
GBP1,000,000 with effect from 1 June 2017.
The Committee is satisfied that the total 
remuneration of the Executive Directors 
is reasonable and not excessive in the 
context of performance delivered and is in 
line with the total remuneration delivered in 
comparable businesses in the Gaming sector.
During 2017 the Committee sought 
shareholder approval for a special one-
off share award to the CEO. Although we 
believe that the award was appropriate in 
the context of the specific circumstances, 
we recognise that a majority of shareholders 
did not support the proposal. We considered 
the feedback received from shareholders 
and, after further consideration, we decided 
not to return to shareholders with a revised 
proposal in 2017. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF 
REMUNERATION POLICY  
FOR 2018
The Remuneration Committee believes the 
current Policy reinforces the Company’s 
strategy to create a business with significant 
scale and a full product and service 
capability, underpinned by a pre-eminent 
technology platform. We believe that the 
policy and incentive framework we have in 
place can support the Company’s strategy in 
the current economic environment and help 
to retain and incentivise our management 
team in order to assist in driving strong 
returns for our shareholders. Details of how 
we intend to implement the Remuneration 
Policy for 2018 are set out on page 90.
The Remuneration Committee encourages 
dialogue with the Company’s shareholders 
and would welcome any comments or 
questions from investors ahead of the  
2018 AGM. The Committee and I hope we 
can count on your support at the 2018 AGM 
for the application of a Remuneration Policy

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
REMUNERATION REPORT
At the time of publication of last year’s report, 
the Committee was still in consultation 
with shareholders on a proposed revised 
Remuneration Policy. Shareholders were 
asked to formally approve the revised Policy 
at a General Meeting held immediately after 
the 2017 AGM. The resolution to consider our 
revised Remuneration Policy was approved 
with 83.89% of votes cast being in favour.
 
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the Company’s remuneration philosophy 
and structure each year to ensure that the 
remuneration framework remains effective 
in supporting the Company’s strategic 
objectives, is in line with best practice and 
fairly rewards individuals for the contribution 
that they make to the business, having 
regard to the international nature, size and 
complexity of the Group’s operations and the 
need to attract and motivate employees of 
the highest calibre. 
Remuneration packages are designed to 
reward the Executive Directors and members 
of the senior management team fairly for 
their contributions, whilst remaining within 
the range of benefits offered by similar 
companies in the sector. 
The Committee believes that the individual 
contributions made by Executive Directors 
and senior management are fundamental to 
the successful performance of the Company. 
The Committee, after discussion with the 
Executive Directors and its advisers, has 
therefore adopted a Remuneration Policy 
with the following objectives: 
• Seek to pay executives competitively, 
recognising that they have highly 
marketable skills to companies already in 
(and those considering entry to) the online 
gambling industry, but acknowledge local 
market levels, and where appropriate, 
practices; 
• Incentivise and reward behaviours that 
will contribute to superior Company 
performance; 
• Enable the Company to attract and retain 
international executives at the required 
calibre, particularly in potential new 
markets; 
• Be simple and understandable; 
• Provide good lock-in of key employees 
through deferred elements; and 
• Avoid reward for failure. 
The Committee believes that its 
Remuneration Policy creates a coherent and 
appropriate framework for remunerating 
Executive Directors and other senior 
executives of the Company and draws 
a clearer link between performance and 
reward. The details of this policy are clearly 
set out in the following pages.
 
The Committee considers that the targets set 
for the different components of performance 
related remuneration are both appropriate 
and sufficiently demanding in the context of 
the business environment and the challenges 
with which the Group is faced as well as 
complying with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.

EXPLANATION OF CHOSEN 
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND 
TARGET SETTING 
Performance measures have been  
selected to reflect the key performance 
indicators which are critical to the realisation 
of our business strategy and delivery of 
shareholder returns. 
The performance targets are reviewed each 
year to ensure that they are sufficiently 
challenging. When setting these targets the 
Committee will take into account a number 
of different reference points including, for 
financial targets, the Company’s business 
plan and consensus analyst forecasts of the 
Company’s performance. Full vesting will only 
occur for what the Remuneration Committee 
considers to be stretching performance. 
POLICY ON RECRUITMENT OR 
PROMOTION OF EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS 
Base salary levels will be set to reflect the 
experience of the individual, appropriate 
market data and internal relativities. The 
Remuneration Committee may feel it is 
appropriate to appoint a new Director 
on a below market salary with a view to 
making above market and workforce annual 
increases over a number of years to reach 
the desired salary positioning subject to 
individual and Company performance.
Normal policy will be for the new Director 
to participate in the remuneration structure 
detailed above, including the maximum 
incentive levels of 400% and 300% of salary 
for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer respectively. Depending 
on the timing of the appointment, the 
Remuneration Committee may decide to 
set different annual bonus performance 
conditions for the first performance year of 
appointment from those stated in the policy 
above. The Committee may also provide 
relocation expenses/arrangements, legal fees 
and costs.
The variable pay elements that may be 
offered will be subject to the maximum limits 
stated in the policy table. The Remuneration 
Committee may consider it necessary and 
in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders to offer additional cash and/
or make a grant of shares (including use 
of awards made under section 9.4.2 of the 
Listing Rules) in order to compensate the 
individual for remuneration that would be 
forfeited from the current employer. To the 
extent practicable such awards would be 
structured to mirror the value, form and 
structure of the forfeited awards or to provide 
alignment with existing shareholders. 
In the case of an internal promotion,  
any commitments entered into prior to 
the promotion shall continue to apply. Any 
variable pay elements shall be entitled to pay 
out according to its original terms on grant. 
For the appointment of a new Chairman or 
Non-executive Director, the fee arrangement 
would be set in accordance with the 
approved Remuneration Policy in force  
at that time.

SERVICE CONTRACTS  
AND EXIT PAYMENTS 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The service agreements of the Executive 
Directors are with PTVB Management 
Limited, a wholly owned Isle of Man 
incorporated subsidiary of the Company.  
The service agreement of the Chief Executive 
Officer was amended effective from  
1 January 2013. His service agreement  
is for an indefinite term and provides for 
formal notice of 12 months to be served 
to terminate the agreement, either by the 
Company or the Director. Andrew Smith  
was appointed as an Executive Director and 
Chief Financial Officer on 10 January 2017.  
His service agreement is for an indefinite 
term and provides for formal notice of 
six months to be served to terminate the 
agreement, either by the Company or the 
Director. Set out in the table below are the 
other key terms of the Executive Directors’ 
terms and conditions of employment. 
A bonus is not ordinarily payable unless 
the individual is employed and not under 
notice on the payment date. However, the 
Remuneration Committee may exercise its 
discretion to award a bonus payment for the 
notice period served (not on garden leave).
The LTIP rules provide that other than in 
certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances awards 
lapse on cessation of employment. Where an 
individual is a ‘good leaver’ the Committee’s 
policy is for the award to vest on the normal 
vesting date (or cessation of employment in 
the event of death) following the application 
of performance targets and a pro-rata 
reduction to take account of the proportion 
of the vesting period that has elapsed. 
The Committee has discretion to partly or 
completely dis-apply pro-rating or to permit 
awards to vest on cessation of employment. 
The Committee acknowledges that Executive 
Directors leave for a variety of reasons that 
do not necessarily fall within the prescribed 
categories in the plan rules. It therefore 
retains discretion to deem an individual  
to be a ‘good leaver’ in accordance with  
the plan rules and in making that decision  
will take into account the performance of  
the individual in office and their reason  
for leaving. 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The Non-executive Directors each have 
specific letters of appointment, rather than 
service contracts. Their remuneration is 
determined by the Board within limits set 
by the articles of association and is set 
taking into account market data as obtained 
from independent Non-executive Director 
fee surveys and their responsibilities. 
Non-executive Directors are appointed for 
an initial term of three years and, under 
normal circumstances would be expected 
to serve for additional three-year terms, 
up to a maximum of nine years, subject to 
satisfactory performance and re-election at 
the Annual General Meeting as required. 
On his appointment as Chairman of the Board 
being announced, Alan Jackson entered 
into a new letter of appointment (effective 
from 9 October 2013) when Roger Withers 
announced his decision to retire as Chairman 
of the Board in August 2013. 
The table on page 87 is a summary of the key 
terms of the letters of appointment for the 
Non-executive Directors. 
In accordance with provision B.3.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code the letters of 
appointment of the Non-executive Directors 
are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office and will be available before 
and after the forthcoming AGM.
CONSIDERATION OF 
EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS 
ELSEWHERE 
The Remuneration Committee when setting 
the policy for Executive Directors takes into 
consideration the pay and employment 
conditions through the Company as a whole. 
In determining salary increases for Executive 
Directors, the Committee considers the 
general level of salary increase across the 
Company. Typically salary increases will 
be aligned with those received elsewhere 
in the Company unless the Remuneration 
Committee considers that specific 
circumstances require a different level of 
salary increase for Executive Directors. 
The Company extends its annual bonus plan 
and share awards to senior management 
and other key members of the workforce 
as the Remuneration Committee feels that it 
is important to incentivise and retain these 
employees in order for the Company to 
continue its development.

CONSIDERATION OF 
SHAREHOLDER VIEWS 
The Company is committed to engagement 
with shareholders and will seek major 
shareholders’ views in advance of making 
significant changes to its Remuneration Policy. 
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS 
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the 
Remuneration Policy, authority is given to 
the Company to honour any commitments 
previously entered into with current or former 
Directors that have been disclosed previously 
to shareholders.
DISCRETION VESTED IN THE 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
The Remuneration Committee will operate 
the annual bonus and LTIP according to their 
respective rules (or relevant documents) 
and in accordance with the Listing Rules 
where relevant. The Committee retains 
discretion, consistent with market practice, 
in a number of regards to the operation and 
administration of these plans. These include, 
but are not limited to, the following in relation 
to the LTIP: 
• The participants; 
• The timing of grant of an award; 
• The size of an award; 
• The determination of vesting; 
• Discretion required when dealing  
with a change of control or restructuring  
of the Group; 
• Determination of the treatment of leavers 
based on the rules of the plan and the 
appropriate treatment chosen; 
• Adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate 
restructuring events and special dividends); 
and 
• The annual review of performance 
measures and weighting, and targets for the 
LTIP from year to year. 
In relation to the annual bonus plan,  
the Remuneration Committee retains 
discretion over: 
• The participants; 
• The timing of a payment; 
• The determination of the amount  
of a bonus payment; 
• Determination of the treatment of leavers; 
and 
• The annual review of performance 
measures and weighting, and targets  
for the annual bonus plan from year to year. 
In relation to both the Company’s LTIP and 
annual bonus plan, the Committee retains 
the ability to adjust the targets and/or set 
different measures if events occur (e.g. 
material acquisition and/or divestment of a 
Group business) which cause it to determine 
that the conditions are no longer appropriate 
and the amendment is required so that the 
conditions achieve their original purpose 
and are not materially less difficult to 
satisfy. Given the unique, fast-changing and 
challenging environment in which the Group 
operates, the Remuneration Committee 
considers that it needs some discretion if, 
acting fairly and reasonably, it feels that the 
pay-out is inconsistent with the Company’s 
overall performance taking account of any 
factors it considers relevant. Any use of the 
above discretions would, where relevant, 
be explained in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration and may, as appropriate, 
be the subject of consultation with the 
Company’s major shareholders.

DETERMINATION OF 2017 BONUS 
In accordance with the Company’s Remuneration Policy, the CEO and CFO had the opportunity to earn a normal bonus in respect of 2017  
of 200% and 150% of salary respectively. The 2017 performance was assessed against a mixture of financial and non-financial targets. 
The financial targets (representing 70% of bonus opportunity) used a target of Adjusted EBITDA of €347 million as a reference point, payable  
on a sliding scale of 0% for threshold to 100% for maximum performance.
 
Adjusted EBITDA was selected as an appropriate measure as it is the key financial performance metric of the Company, most closely representing 
the underlying trading performance of the business and is calculated after adding back certain non-cash charges, cash expenses relating to 
professional costs on acquisitions, gains on sale of investments and certain one-off charges as set out in the financial statements on page 127. 
The non-financial performance targets were selected to underpin key strategic objectives of the Group, in particular recognising the challenges of 
expanding the business into regulated and soon-to-be regulated markets and strengthening the Group’s regulatory functions in light of increased 
regulation in the UK and elsewhere. 
When reviewing the performance during 2017 the Committee noted that the Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 
was €322.1 million. Although this level of Adjusted EBITDA was below the reference point of €347 million, it was above the threshold target 
and also represented a 7% increase on the prior year. The Committee also took account of currency factors, ongoing provisions and research 
and development costs as well as the overall achievements of management during a challenging period in some of the markets in which 
the Company operates. The operational highlights set out in the Strategic Report on page 4 demonstrate that a number of the key strategic 
objectives set for executives have already been successfully implemented, particularly in regards to securing business in regulated and  
soon-to-be regulated markets. The Committee also took account of the exceptional work and effort undertaken as part of the continuing 
integration of Tradetech, the acquisitions of Eyecon Group and ACM Group and the new agreement with OPAP. 
The Committee considered that, overall, performance in 2017 was very strong in the context of challenging markets. The Committee felt it was fair 
and reasonable to recognise this strong Group and individual performance of the Executive Directors.  PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
GOVERNANCE

Accordingly, the Committee determined that the bonus payable for 2017 was €1,746,034 for the CEO (186% of salary earned in 2017) and a bonus 
of €533,949 for the CFO (139% of salary earned in 2017). 
25% of these amounts will be deferred in shares for two years.
 
The Committee is satisfied that the annual bonus payments to Executive Directors are a fair reflection of corporate and individual performance 
during the year and that overall remuneration is not excessive given the size and complexity of the Group’s business and the industry in which  
it operates.
LTIP AWARDS (AUDITED)

1 Awards represent 200% of salary for Mor Weizer and 150% of salary for Andrew Smith based on a share price on grant of 962.5 pence.
In the normal course of events these awards will vest on 1 March 2020, subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions. 
Awards granted in 2017 are subject to the achievement of a mixture of performance conditions: 70% of the award is subject to a performance 
condition that the Company’s simple annual EPS growth must match a threshold determined by the Committee for 25% of this portion of the 
award to vest, increasing to full vesting for achieving a maximum performance level. EPS will be measured over three financial years commencing 
with the financial year in which the award is granted. The remaining 30% of the award is subject to a performance condition comparing the 
Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) against the FTSE 250 (on a ranked basis). The TSR tranche shall vest 25% for median performance 
increasing straight line to full vesting for upper quartile performance. 
The EPS tranche shall vest over a number of shares determined as follows:
Company’s simple annual EPS growth % of EPS tranche that vests 
15% or more per annum 100%
Between 6% and 15% per annum On a straight line basis between 25% and 100% 
6% per annum 25%
Less than 6% per annum 0%
When setting the EPS performance range, the Committee considered both internal financial targets and external market consensus. The target 
range is considered to be challenging given the current view of the business and wider macroeconomic factors, but is achievable without 
incentivising any undue risk behaviour.
The LTIP awards granted in December 2015 vested subject to performance measured over the three-year period 1 January 2015 to 
31 December 2017. The outcome was as follows:
Measure Weighting Performance condition How fulfilled % of this award vesting

IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY FOR 2018 
SALARY PAY REVIEW 
The Remuneration Committee takes into account individual performance and experience, the size and nature of the role, the relative performance 
of the Company, pay policy within the Company (including the general pay and employment terms of all employees in the Group) and salaries in 
comparable companies. 
Mr Weizer’s salary was set at £1,000,000 with effect from 1 June 2017. The Committee recognises that this represents a significant increase over 
his previous salary of £600,000. However, the Committee is of the view that the increase was fully justified in light of the significant growth of 
the Company in recent years and Mr Weizer’s exceptional leadership during this period. The Committee was also cognisant of the competitive 
landscape in the gaming industry and Mr Weizer’s proven ability to grow the business in a challenging market environment. For a number of 
years during the Company’s growth period, Mr Weizer’s salary was unchanged. The Committee feels that his salary should fairly reflect his 
achievements and leadership of a large UK-listed company in a fast-moving, competitive sector.
Mr Smith was appointed as an Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer on 10 January 2017. His salary was set at £325,000 with effect  
from appointment. Following the normal annual salary review in June 2017, his salary was increased to £350,000 with effect from 1 June 2017.  
This increase reflected his growth in the role since his appointment in January and brought his salary closer to the mid-market level when 
compared against remuneration paid at companies of a similar size to Playtech.
The Executive Directors’ salaries will be reviewed, but not necessarily increased, as part of the annual review in 2018, which is expected  
to commence in June.
The current basic salary levels of the Executive Directors are: 
• M. Weizer: £1,000,000 (equivalent to €1,126,474 at 31 December 2017 exchange rate between Sterling and Euro used in the accounts) which 
was effective from 1 June 2017; and 
• A. Smith £350,000 (equivalent to €394,266 at 31 December 2017 exchange rate between Sterling and Euro used in the accounts) which was 
effective from 10 January 2017.
Fees currently payable to Non-executive Directors are:
• Chairman: £384,000 (equivalent to €432,566 at 31 December 2017 exchange rate between Sterling and Euro used in the accounts); and
• Non-executive Director base fee: £105,000 (equivalent to €118,280 at 31 December 2017 exchange rate between Sterling and Euro used in the 
accounts). These fees were increased by 2.5% with effect from 1 January 2017 and by 2.5% with effect from 1 June 2018.
The Non-executive Director fees recognise core responsibilities and additional duties as Chair of a Board Committee. 
BENEFITS AND PENSION
Benefit and pension provision will continue to be set in line with the approved policy.
ANNUAL BONUS 
For 2018, bonuses for the Executive Directors will be based on the following: 
 Performance target Weighting
Adjusted EBITDA Commercially confidential 70%
Non-financial and strategic objectives Commercially confidential 30%
When setting the Adjusted EBITDA target, the Committee will be mindful of a number of factors and the targets will be very challenging.
The level of bonus payable by reference to the financial performance of the Company will be determined on a sliding scale based on the 
Company’s budget for the forthcoming financial year. There will be retrospective disclosure of the target and performance in next year’s report.
The annual bonus will be subject to recovery and withholding provisions in relation to material misstatement, gross misconduct, material error  
in calculation and for a serious reputational event. These provisions will apply for a period of three years after payment.  PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) 
Awards made to Executive Directors will vest on the third anniversary of grant subject to (i) participants remaining in employment (other than in 
certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances) and (ii) achievement of challenging performance targets.
Awards granted in 2018 will continue to be subject to a combination of EPS growth (70% of awards) and relative TSR (30% of awards).  
Threshold performance will result in 25% of each element vesting.
As with the awards granted in 2017, the relative TSR measure will be measured against the FTSE 250 (on a ranked basis) over three financial 
years and require at least median performance for 25% of this portion of the award to vest, increasing to full vesting for upper quartile 
performance. 
EPS will be measured over three financial years. At the time of preparing this report EPS targets for 2018 have not been determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. The EPS targets will be stretching and demanding and will be set out in Stock Exchange announcements when made.
LTIP awards granted from 2017 will be subject to recovery and withholding provisions in relation to material misstatement, gross misconduct, 
material error in calculation and for a serious reputational event. These provisions will apply for a period of three years post vesting. 
Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares, market purchase shares or may be cashed-out, subject to the tax treatment in the hands  
of the recipient. 
DILUTION LIMITS 
All of the Company’s equity based incentive plans (other than the Option Plan which was established before the Company’s admission to  
AIM in 2006) incorporate the current Investment Association Guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans  
should not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Company’s issued share capital (or reissue of treasury shares), with a further 
limitation of 5% in any ten-year period for executive plans. The Committee monitors the position and prior to the making of any award considers 
the effect of potential vesting of options or share awards to ensure that the Company remains within these limits. Any awards which are required 
to be satisfied by market purchased shares are excluded from such calculations. No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended  
31 December 2017.

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
In the financial year ended 31 December 2017, Mr Weizer’s salary was increased by 67% effective 1 June 2017 and was awarded an bonus of 
186% of salary compared with 200% of salary in the year ended 31 December 2016. On the basis of salary received for the year, the increase was 
35%, which also in part reflected movements in exchange rates. The average percentage changes for all UK-based full-time employees were a 
5.9% increase and a 41% decrease in salary and benefits respectively mainly due to significant fluctuations in exchange rates in the period, and 
44.9% increase in bonus payments. The UK workforce was chosen as a comparator group as the Remuneration Committee looks to benchmark 
the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer with reference mainly to the UK market (albeit that he has a global role and responsibilities, and 
remuneration packages across the Group vary widely depending on local market practices and conditions).

ROLE AND MEMBERSHIP 
The Remuneration Committee is currently comprised entirely of five independent Non-executive Directors as defined in the Code. John Jackson 
was appointed as Chair on 1 February 2016. The other members are Andrew Thomas, Alan Jackson, Paul Hewitt and Claire Milne. 
Details of attendance at the Remuneration Committee are set out on page 72 and their biographies and experience on pages 68 and 69. 
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference detailing its authority and responsibilities. The Committee’s terms of reference were 
reviewed and updated during 2016 and are available for inspection on the Company’s website www.playtech.com and include: 
• Determining and agreeing the policy for the remuneration of the CEO, CFO, the Chairman and other members of the senior management team; 
• Review of the broad policy framework for remuneration to ensure it remains appropriate and relevant; 
• Review of the design of and determine targets for any performance-related pay and the annual level of payments under such plans; 
• Review of the design of and approve any changes to long-term incentive or option plans; and 
• Ensuring that contractual terms on termination and payments made are fair to the individual and the Company and that failure is not rewarded.
The Remuneration Committee also considers the terms and conditions of employment and overall remuneration of Executive Directors, the 
Company Secretary and members of the senior management team and has regard to the Company’s overall approach to the remuneration of 
all employees. Within this context the Committee determines the overall level of salaries, incentive payments and performance related pay due 
to Executive Directors and senior management. The Committee also determines the performance targets and the extent of their achievement 
for both annual and long-term incentive awards operated by the Company and affecting the senior management. No Director is involved in any 
decisions as to his/her own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee takes advice from both inside and outside the Group on a range of matters, including the scale and composition 
of the total remuneration package payable to people with similar responsibilities, skills and experience in comparable companies that have 
extensive operations inside and outside the UK.
During the year the Remuneration Committee received material assistance and advice from the Company Secretary (who is also secretary  
to the Committee). 
The Remuneration Committee has a planned schedule of at least four meetings throughout the year, with additional meetings and calls held when 
necessary. During 2017, the Committee met in person 9 times and these meetings, together with a number of conference calls, addressed a wide 
variety of issues, including: 
Month Principal activity
January Review of bonus and other incentivisation arrangements in relation to Executive Directors  
and certain members of senior management.
Review of Remuneration Policy.
February Finalise bonus payments for Executive Directors.
March Fix bonus targets for 2017 – Executive Directors.
Review proposed one-off arrangement for CEO.
May Review of General Meeting voting results.
Review of performance share plan.
June Approval of grant of Nil cost options for a limited number of Group personnel.
Review of salaries for Executive Salaries.

Korn Ferry is the Committee’s independent adviser. New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited) also provided advice during 2017. 
Neither Korn Ferry or New Bridge Street provide any other services to the Company. Korn Ferry was paid €8,426 in relation to advice provided 
during 2017 and New Bridge Street was paid €37,027. 
ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND SHAREHOLDER VOTING 
The Remuneration Committee is committed to ensuring open dialogue with shareholders in relation to remuneration and would normally consult 
with major shareholders regarding any significant future changes to the Remuneration Policy. The Committee consulted with major shareholders 
ahead of presenting the new Policy to a formal shareholder vote in 2017.
The voting outcome at the AGM held on 17 May 2017 in respect of the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 
as follows: 
For Against Withheld
Approval of Remuneration Report 154,617,671 74,130,890 706,590
 (67.58%) (32.42%)
The voting outcome at the General Meeting held on 17 May 2017 in respect of the revised Directors’ Remuneration Policy was as follows:
For Against Withheld
Approval of Remuneration Policy 189,349,986 36,346,573 706,475
 (83.89%) (16.11%)
The voting outcome at the General Meeting held on 17 May 2017 in respect of the proposed one-off share award to the CEO was as follows:
For Against Withheld
Approval of One-Off Share Grant 99,596,350 126,792,955 13,730
 (43.98%) (56.02%)
The Committee is grateful for the support of shareholders for the revised Remuneration Policy. The Committee also recognises that a significant 
minority of shareholders voted against the ARR at the 2017 AGM, and that a majority of shareholders did not support the proposed one-off award 
to the CEO at the General Meeting. The Committee has reflected on the feedback received on these matters and among other things  
we determined not to return to shareholders with a revised proposal for a one-off share award for the CEO during 2017.
At 17 May 2017, the issued share capital of the Company was 317,344,603 ordinary shares of no par value.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 
The Disclosure and Transparency Rules require certain information to be included in a corporate governance statement in the Directors’ Report. 
Information that fulfils the requirements of the corporate governance statement can be found in the Governance Report on pages 67 to 94 and is 
incorporated into this report by reference. 
DISCLAIMER 
The purpose of these financial statements (including this report) is to provide information to the members of the Company. The financial 
statements have been prepared for, and only for, the members of the Company, as a body, and no other persons. The Company, its Directors 
and employees, agents and advisers do not accept or assume responsibility to any other person to whom this document is shown or into whose 
hands it may come and any such responsibility or liability is expressly disclaimed. 
The financial statements contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the operations, performance and financial condition of the 
Group. By their nature, these statements involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can cause results and developments to differ 
materially from those anticipated. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of these 
financial statements and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Nothing in this document should be 
construed as a profit forecast. 
RESULTS AND DIVIDEND 
The results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 are set out on pages 104 to 156. On 20 February 2018, the Board recommended 
the payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 23.9 €cents per share which will be paid to shareholders on the register 
as at 5 May 2018. The payment of the final dividend requires shareholder approval which will be sought at the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting to be held at the Sefton Hotel, Douglas, Isle of Man on 16 May 2018. If approved, the final dividend will be paid on 1 June 2018 and 
together with the interim dividend of 12.1 €cents per share paid on 24 October 2017 makes a total dividend (expressed in €) of 36 €cents per 
share for the year.
Shareholders who wish to receive their final dividend in Sterling rather than Euros will be required to return currency election forms to the 
Company’s registrars by 11 May 2018. Currency election forms are contained with the notice of Annual General Meeting that accompanies the 
Annual Report and further copies are available from the Company’s website www.playtech.com.
GOING CONCERN, VIABILITY, RESPONSIBILITIES AND DISCLOSURE
The current activities of the Group and those factors likely to affect its future development, together with a description of its financial position, are 
described in the Strategic Report. Principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group, and the steps taken to mitigate these risks are described 
on pages 54 to 57. Critical accounting estimates affecting the carrying values of assets and liabilities of the Group are discussed in Note 3 to the 
financial statements. 
During 2017, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those factors that would threaten its 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. This ongoing assessment forms part of the Group’s three-year strategic plan. 
After making appropriate enquiries and having regard to the Group’s cash balances and normal business planning and control procedures, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a 
period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. As part of this assessment, the Directors prepared a three-year 
forecast considering the going concern status for the period to December 2018 in accordance with the Company’s Three-Year Plan, which is 
considered to be an appropriate period over which the Group can predict its revenue, cost base and cash flows with a higher degree of certainty, 
as opposed to more arbitrary forms of forecasts based solely on percentage increases. Notwithstanding, due to the significant cash reserves and 
projected profitability over the next 12 months, the Directors have no reason to believe that the Group’s viability will be threatened over a period 
longer than that covered by the positive confirmation of long-term viability above. Given the above, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDINGS 
As of 13 February 2018, the Company had been advised of the following significant shareholders each holding more than 3% of the Company’s

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors have elected to prepare the Annual Report and the financial statements for the Company and the Group in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS). 
The Directors are responsible under applicable law and regulation for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group, for safeguarding the assets and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
International Accounting Standard 1 (revised) requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will 
be achieved by compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards. A fair presentation also requires the Directors to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• State whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
In addition, the Directors at the date of this report consider that the financial statements taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. 
WEBSITE PUBLICATION
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of 
the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES PURSUANT TO DTR4
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed within the Governance section on pages 67 to 94 confirm that, to the best  
of their knowledge: 
• The Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and 
• The Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the financial position of the Group and the 
Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
The Annual General Meeting in 2017 was held in May in Douglas, Isle of Man. All Directors were present and made themselves available to 
answer questions from shareholders. The Annual General Meeting provides an opportunity for the Directors to communicate personally the 
performance and future strategy to non-institutional shareholders and for those shareholders to meet with and question the Board. All Directors 
plan to be present at the 2018 Annual General Meeting. All results of proxy votes are read out, made available for review at the meeting, 
recorded in the minutes of the meeting and communicated to the market and via the Group website.
The Annual General Meeting for 2018 will be held at the Sefton Hotel, Douglas, Isle of Man, IM1 2RW on Wednesday 16 May 2018 at 10.00 am.  
The notice convening the Annual General Meeting for this year, and an explanation of the items of non-routine business, are set out in the circular 
that accompanies the Annual Report. 
AUDITORS 
So far as each Director is aware, at the date of the approval of the financial statements there is no relevant audit information of which  
the Company’s auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make 
themselves aware of any information needed by the Group’s auditors for the purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditors  
are aware of that information. 
A resolution to reappoint BDO LLP as the Company’s auditors will be submitted to the shareholders at this year’s AGM.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
OPINION
We have audited the financial statements of Playtech Plc (the ‘Parent Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 December 
2017 which comprise Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income; Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets; Consolidated 
and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity; Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flows, and notes to the financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the 
Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  
our opinion.
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO PRINCIPAL RISKS, GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENT
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the Annual Report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to 
you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the Annual Report set out on page 54 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation set out on page 96 in the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the directors’ statement set out on page 96 in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification of any material uncertainties to the Group and 
the Parent Company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• the directors’ explanation set out on page 96 in the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in  
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT CONT.
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
Revenue recognition (with reference to Note 2)
Key audit matter 
The Group has a number of revenue streams. The details of the 
accounting policies applied during the period are given in Note 2 to 
the financial statements.
Management make certain judgements around revenue recognition 
and the treatment of contractual arrangements for revenue streams 
entered into by both the Gaming (including B2B and B2C) and 
Financials divisions. There is a potential risk that revenue is recorded 
incorrectly from a timing perspective and that it is inappropriately 
recognised on a gross versus net basis. 
Our response
We assessed the design and implementation of the controls over the 
Group’s revenue cycles. 
We assessed whether the revenue recognition policies adopted by 
the Group comply with IFRS and Industry standard.
We tested revenue through substantive procedures. Our work 
included the use of IT audit data analytic techniques to underpin our 
substantive testing of the revenue recognised by both the Gaming 
(including B2B and B2C) and Financials Divisions. 
We reviewed a sample of key contracts entered into during the year 
to assess whether the revenue had been recognised in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policy, appropriately from a timing as well 
as a gross v net perspective and whether any other terms within the 
contract had any material accounting or disclosure implications. 
Impairment of goodwill, capitalised development costs and other 
intangibles (with reference to Note 12)
Key audit matter 
In accordance with IAS 36, the Group monitors the carrying value 
of goodwill and other intangibles for indications of impairment. The 
Group performs annual impairment reviews for goodwill and for 
other intangibles where there are indicators of impairment and for 
capitalised development costs relating to projects not launched as at 
the year end. 
Impairment reviews require significant judgement from management 
and are inherently based on assumptions in respect of future 
profitability.
IAS 36 also requires management to test intangible assets not yet 
available for use (such as projects in development) for impairment.
If the carrying value of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount 
there is a risk of material misstatement in the carrying value of these 
assets. 
Our response
We considered management’s assessment as to whether there were 
any indications of impairment in respect of intangible assets. 
The audit team, which includes valuation specialists, challenged the 
appropriateness of the key assumptions used in the discounted cash 
flow models prepared by management and applied sensitivities to 
assess the potential impairment of goodwill and those assets where 
indications of impairment were present. Our work was based on our 
assessment of the historical accuracy of the Group’s estimates in 
previous periods, our understanding of the commercial prospects of 
the assets, identification and analysis of changes in assumptions from 
prior periods and an assessment of the consistency of assumptions 
across the impairment reviews.
We selected a sample of projects not yet launched at the balance 
sheet date and confirmed that there remains a future intent to launch. 
Further to this we reviewed the results of management’s impairment 
review of these assets on a portfolio basis.
We considered the appropriateness of the related disclosure provided 
in the Group financial statements. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

Compliance risk – Legal, regulatory and taxation  
(with reference to Notes 3 and 31)
Key audit matter 
The Group has compliance obligations that range from administration 
of their licences to assessing the impact of changes in country-
specific and pan-regional rules and regulations on its businesses. 
The nature of the e-commerce business and operational structure of 
the Playtech Group requires management judgement with regard to 
the assessment and interpretation of domestic and international tax 
laws. The taxation of e-commerce is still an evolving matter for tax 
authorities.
Management consider whether any provisions or disclosures are 
required under IFRS for outstanding legal and regulatory disputes 
based on management’s best estimate of where there is a probable 
outflow of economic benefits. Where the Group does not consider the 
likelihood of a provision being probable, the Group will disclose the 
existence of a contingent liability (unless that likelihood of occurrence 
is considered to be remote when no disclosure is required).
Given the continual changes in the regulatory environment of the 
gambling and financial trading sectors in many countries across the 
world, there is a risk that potential material legal, regulatory or taxation 
matters are not disclosed or provided for.
Our response
We considered how the Group monitors legal and regulatory 
developments and their assessment of the potential impact on the 
business, and also considered the internal and external advice taken 
in respect of these developments. We discussed with management 
how they manage, control and operate Group companies in the 
countries in which they are registered. This included how the Group 
manages its tax strategy as part of the overall business planning 
and how the Group monitors the rules and practices governing the 
taxation of e-commerce activity that is evolving in many countries.
We discussed with the Group’s Compliance and Legal teams whether 
there were any known instances of material breaches in regulatory 
and licence compliance that required disclosure or required 
provisions to be made in the financial statements. We discussed 
the assertions of the Group’s Compliance and Legal teams with the 
Group’s principal external legal advisors.
As part of the audit team, we have tax specialists who reviewed 
and evaluated the risks in the jurisdictions in which Playtech has 
a significant physical presence. As part of this process we liaised 
with the local audit teams and tax specialists in those jurisdictions to 
assess the provisioning for current and deferred taxes. We considered 
the latest externally prepared advice received by management with 
regard to any exposure to taxation in existing or proposed territories 
in which the Group operates or intends to operate.
We reviewed disclosures prepared by the Group in respect  
of contingent liabilities.
Business combinations (with reference to Notes 26 and 27)
Key audit matter 
The Group completed the following principal acquisitions in the year: 
• Eyecon
• ACM Group
Management are required to make significant judgements in 
assessing the fair values of consideration including contingent 
consideration (whether arising on acquisitions made in the current 
year or previous years) and of the assets and liabilities acquired. 
Management have engaged external valuations experts to undertake 
the purchase price allocation exercise required. 
In respect of acquisitions in previous years’ significant contingent 
consideration has been included within the consideration payable. 
The fair value of contingent consideration is reassessed at each 
reporting date.
Our response
We challenged the assumptions underpinning the significant 
judgements and estimates used by management in the assessment of 
the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired and consideration 
paid including; underlying cash flow projections, royalty rates, 
discount rates applied and the long term growth rates. 
We used our valuation specialists to review and evaluate the 
identified intangible assets and consider the judgemental areas and 
those subject to significant estimation.
We challenged management’s assessment of the fair value of 
contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions made in the 
current year and previous periods, including principally the level  
of expected profitability over the forecast period.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
CHANGES IN KEY AUDIT MATTERS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AUDIT
Related Parties Transactions was previously considered a key audit matter. Following the reduction of the shareholding of the then significant 
shareholder during the course of 2017 this was not considered a key audit matter for the 2017 year end audit.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. For planning, 
we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of 
reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements. In order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that 
any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed. 
Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified 
misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
Level of materiality applied and rationale
We consider Adjusted Profit Before Tax to be the most appropriate performance measure for the basis of materiality in respect of the audit 
of the Group as this measure reflects the Group’s profitability excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items. Adjusted Profit Before Tax 
is calculated for this purpose as Profit Before Tax adjusted for certain non-recurring items (totalling to a net €96.6m reduction in profit) which 
principally related to the release of contingent consideration in respect of the Markets acquisition and impairments of goodwill and investments 
recorded in the year. Using this benchmark, we set materiality at €8.5m (2016: €13.0m) being 5% (2016: 4.4% of Adjusted EBITDA) of Adjusted 
Profit Before Tax. Our materiality level is reduced from the previous years as a result of the change of the basis of materiality from adjusted 
EBITDA to Adjusted Profit Before Tax.
Materiality in respect of the audit of the Parent Company has been set at €4.3m (2016: €6.5m) using a benchmark of 2% of total assets, limited 
to 50% of Group materiality (2016: 2% of total assets, limited to 50% of Group materiality). We consider total assets to be the most appropriate 
measure for the basis of materiality as the Parent Company is primarily an investment holding company.
Performance materiality was set at 70% of materiality for both the Group and Parent Company audits. In setting the level of performance 
materiality we considered a number of factors including the expected total value of known and likely misstatements (based on past experience 
and other factors) and management’s attitude towards proposed adjustments.
Component materiality
We set materiality for each component of the Group based on a percentage of materiality dependent on the size and our assessment of the risk 
of material misstatement of that component. Component materiality ranged from €2.1m to €4.3m. 
Agreement with the Audit Committee
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences individually in excess of €340k (2016: €500k). 
We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including the Group’s system of internal control, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements at the Group level. 
In determining the scope of our audit we considered the level of work to be performed at each component in order to ensure sufficient assurance 
was gained to allow us to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group as a whole. 
We tailored the extent of the work to be performed at each component, either by us, as the Group audit team, component auditors within the 
BDO network or non-BDO member firms based on our assessment of the risk of material misstatement at each component. 
We obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls of the Group as a whole which assisted us in identifying and assessing risks of material 
misstatement due to fraud or error, as well as assisting us in determining the most appropriate audit strategy.
We consider that the audit procedures we planned and performed in accordance with ISAs (UK) have provided us with reasonable assurance 
that irregularities, including fraud, would have been detected to the extent that they could have resulted in material misstatements in the financial 
statements. Our audit was not designed to identify misstatements or other irregularities that would not be considered to be material to the 
financial statements. 
Classification of components
The 3 components that are considered significant (defined as those that were greater than 15% of Adjusted Profit Before Tax, or where the risks of 
the component were significantly different to the Group risks) were audited by the Group audit team. 
The Group audit team centrally performed the audit of 97% of Group revenue and the audit of 100% of intangible assets including development 
costs using the materiality levels set out above.
For the 22 components not considered significant, the component auditors were asked to perform review procedures or specific scope 
procedures on certain balances based on their relative size, risks in the business and our knowledge of those entities appropriate to respond to 
the risk of material misstatement.
 
Review and specific scope procedures were performed by the Group audit team or BDO network firms on 20 reporting components and by 2 
non-BDO member firms on a further 2 reporting components. 
SUMMARY AUDIT SCOPE
 Full audit: 97.2%
 Specific procedures: 0.0%
 Group level procedures: 2.8%

OTHER INFORMATION
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with 
our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we 
identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement 
in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information 
and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions:
•  Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 96 – the statement given by the directors that they consider the Annual Report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
•  Audit committee reporting set out on page 77 – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 96 – the parts of the directors’ statement required 
under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for 
review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 96, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 80C of the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters that we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

OTHER MATTERS WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the Board of Directors to audit the financial statements for the year 
ending 31 December 2017 and we note that a resolution to reappoint BDO LLP as the Company’s auditors will be submitted to the shareholders 
at this year’s AGM. The period of our total uninterrupted engagement as the Group’s auditors is 13 years, covering the years ending 31 December 
2005 to 31 December 2017.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain 
independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 – GENERAL
Playtech plc and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) develop unified software platforms for the online and land-based gambling industry, targeting  
online and land-based operators. Since May 2015 the Group also offered an online trading platform to retail customers which enabled them  
to trade CFD (Contracts for Differences) on a variety of instruments which fall under the general categories of Foreign exchange, Commodities, 
Equities and indices. In the context of this activity, the Group acts as a market-maker in a predominantly B2C environment. Following the 
acquisition of CFH in November 2016, the Group also provides B2B clients with technology for liquidity and clearing. Playtech’s gaming 
applications – online casino, poker and other P2P games, bingo, mobile, live gaming, land-based terminal and fixed-odds game are fully  
inter-compatible and can be freely incorporated as stand-alone applications, accessed and funded by the operators’ players through the  
same user account and managed by the operator by means of a single, powerful management interface. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that  
it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting 
Standards and interpretations (collectively, “IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the 
European Union (“adopted IFRSs”).
NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial information, on a consistent basis, are:
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
This financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting  
standards and interpretations (collectively IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European  
Union (“adopted IFRSs”). In the current year the Group has adopted all of the new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the  
IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB, as they have been adopted by the European Union, 
that are relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2017. None of these adoptions has had a material 
impact on the results or reporting of the Group.
New standards, interpretations and amendments effective from 1 January 2018
There are no new standards, interpretations or amendments which are effective for periods beginning on or before 1 January 2018 which have  
a material effect on the Group’s financial information, including IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers, and IFRS 9: Financial Instruments, 
although there may be presentational changes.
IFRS 16 Leases
Adoption of IFRS 16 will result in the Group recognising right of use assets and lease liabilities for all contracts that are, or contain, a lease.  
For leases currently classified as operating leases, under current accounting requirements the Group does not recognise related assets  
or liabilities, and instead spreads the lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term, disclosing in its annual financial statements  
the total commitment.
At 31 December 2017 operating lease commitments amounted to €63.4 million. The effect of discounting those commitments is anticipated  
to result in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of €50.0- €60.0 million being recognised on 1 January 2018.
However, further work still needs to be carried out to determine whether and when extension and termination options are likely to be exercised, 
which will result in the actual liability recognised being higher than this.
The Board still considering if it will apply the modified retrospective or the restatement approach in IFRS 16. 
Instead of recognising an operating expense for its operating lease payments, the Group will instead recognise interest on its lease liabilities  
and amortisation on its right-of-use assets. This will increase reported EBITDA which will approximate to its current operating lease cost, which  
for the year ended 31 December 2017 was approximately €13.5 million.
Other than as noted, the Directors do not expect that any other new standards, interpretations and amendments which are effective for periods 
beginning after 1 January 2018 to have a material effect on the Group’s future financial information.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
Where the Company has control over an investee it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all three of the following 
elements are present: power over the investee; exposure to variable returns from the investee; and the ability of the investor to use its power 
to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these 
elements of control.
The consolidated financial information presents the results of the Group as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and  
balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. In the statement  
of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date  
on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on which control ceases.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The financial information of the gaming division, which includes the Company and some of its subsidiaries is prepared in Euros (the functional 
currency), which is the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to the gaming 
division. Transactions and balances in foreign currencies are converted into Euros in accordance with the principles set forth by IAS 21  
(“The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”). Accordingly, transactions and balances have been converted into the presentation 
currency of Euros as follows: 
• Monetary assets and liabilities – at the rate of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date; 
• Income and expense items – at exchange rates applicable as of the date of recognition of those items. Non-monetary items are converted  
at the rate of exchange used to convert the related balance sheet items i.e. at the time of the transaction. Exchange gains and losses from  
the aforementioned conversion are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The financial information of the financial division is prepared in US Dollars (the functional currency), which is the currency that best reflects the 
economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to the financial division. The transactions and balances are converted 
into the presentation currency of Euros as follows: 
• Assets and liabilities – at the rate of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date; 
• Income and expense items – at average exchange rates applicable at the period of recognition of those items; 
• Equity – at historic rate.
Exchange gains and losses from the aforementioned conversion are recognised in the foreign exchange reserve.
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
The Group’s principal revenue streams and their respective accounting treatments are discussed below:
Royalty income
Royalty income relating to licensed technology and the provision of certain services provided via various distribution channels (online, mobile or 
land-based interfaces). Royalty income is based on the underlying gaming revenue earned by our licensees and is recognised in the accounting 
periods in which the gaming transactions occur.
Trading income
Trading income represents gains (including commission) and losses arising on client trading activity, primarily in contracts for difference on shares, 
indexes, commodities and foreign exchange. Open client positions are carried at fair market value and gains and losses arising on this valuation 
are recognised in revenue as well as gains and losses realised on positions that have closed.
Fixed-fee income
Other revenue includes revenue derived from the provision of certain services and licensed technology for which charges are based on  
a fixed-fee and stepped according to the usage of the service/technology in each accounting period. Income is recognised over the period  
of service once the obligations under the contracts have passed. Where amounts are billed and obligations not met, revenue is deferred.
Fixed-term arrangements
Other income receivable under fixed-term arrangements is recognised as revenue over the term of the agreement on a straight line basis.
DISTRIBUTION COSTS
Distribution costs represent the direct costs of the function of providing services to customers, costs of the development function and  
advertising costs.  PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Certain employees participate in the Group’s share option plans which commenced with effect from 1 December 2005. The fair value of the equity 
settled options granted is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the vesting period and 
the credit is taken to equity, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is determined by the Black-Scholes and 
Binomial valuation model. The share options plan does not have any performance conditions other than continued service. Where equity settled 
share options are settled in cash at the Group’s discretion the debit is taken to equity.
The Group has also granted awards to be distributed from the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust. The fair value of these awards is based on the 
market price at the date of the grant, some of the grants have performance conditions. 
INCOME TAXES AND DEFERRED TAXATION
Provision for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the tax legislations and applicable tax rates in force at the balance sheet date in the 
countries in which the Group companies are tax registered and for Group branches based on place where the branch is established.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet differs from 
its tax base, except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting or taxable profit; and
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and it is 
probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are 
expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the 
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
• the same taxable Group company; or
• different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION
Final dividends are recorded in the Group’s financial information in the period in which they are approved by the Group’s shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment comprise computers and gaming machines, buildings and leasehold and buildings improvements, office furniture 
and equipment, and motor vehicles and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Carrying amounts are reviewed on each balance sheet 
date for impairment. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.  
The principal annual rates used for this purpose, which are consistent with those of the previous years, are: 
%
Computers and gaming machines 20-33
Office furniture and equipment 7-33
Freehold and leasehold buildings and improvements 10-20, or over the length of the lease
Motor vehicles 15
Subsequent expenditures are included in the asset carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are 
charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are included in the consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The consolidated financial information incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the consolidated balance 
sheet, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The 
results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. 
PUT/CALL OPTIONS
Where a put/call option is entered into over the non-controlling interest the ownership risks and rewards of the shares relating to the option are 
analysed to determine whether the equity is attributable to the non-controlling interest or the parent. The non-controlling interest is recognised  
if the risks and rewards of ownership of those shares remain with them. 
A financial liability is recorded to reflect the option. All subsequent changes to the liability (other than the cash settlement) are recognised  
in profit or loss.
Where the significant risks and rewards of ownership remain with the non-controlling interest the non-controlling interest continues to be 
recognised and is allocated its share of profits and losses.
Where the significant risks and rewards of ownership reside with the controlling interest, the financial liability recognised offsets the  
non-controlling interest.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are recognised at cost less, if any, provision for impairment.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets comprise externally acquired patents, domains and customer lists. Intangible assets also include internally generated capitalised 
software development costs. All such intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Where intangible assets are acquired 
as part of a business combination they are recorded initially at their fair value. Carrying amounts are reviewed on each balance sheet date for 
impairment. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to its recoverable amount.
 
Amortisation is calculated at annual rates estimated to write off the costs of the assets over their expected useful lives and is charged to operating 
expenses from the point the asset is brought into use. The principal annual rates used for this purpose, which are consistent with those of the 
previous years, are:
 %
Domain names Nil
Internally generated capitalised development costs 20-33
Technology IP 13-33
Customer lists In line with projected cash flows or 7-20
Affiliate contracts 5-12.5
Patents and license 10-33
Management believes that the useful life of the domain names is indefinite. Domain names are reviewed for impairment annually.
Expenditure incurred on development activities including the Group’s software development is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead 
to new or substantially improved products, the products are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to 
complete development. 
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from 
the asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain an intangible assets current level of performance,  
is expensed as incurred. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over, in the case of business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, 
the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and, in the case of business combinations 
completed on or after 1 January 2010, the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, cost comprised the fair value of assets given, and liabilities assumed, plus any 
direct costs of acquisition. Changes in the estimated value of contingent consideration arising on business combinations completed by this date 
were treated as an adjustment to cost and, in consequence, resulted in a change in the carrying value of goodwill.
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, cost comprises the fair value of assets given and liabilities assumed, plus the 
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired business. Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value 
and, in the case of contingent consideration classified as a financial liability, remeasured subsequently through profit or loss. For combinations 
completed on or after 1 January 2010, direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, within administrative costs.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement. Goodwill 
is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment, annually or more specifically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may be impaired.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial year end. 
Other non-financial assets are subject to annual impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair 
value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to establish the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the asset’s cash 
generating unit (i.e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows). Goodwill is 
allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 
giving rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in the administrative expenses line item in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except  
to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised 
for goodwill is not reversed.
ASSOCIATES AND STRUCTURED AGREEMENTS
Where the Group has the power to participate in (but not control) the financial and operating policy decisions of another entity, it is classified  
as an associate or structured agreements, as appropriate. Associates are initially recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position 
at cost. Subsequently associates are accounted for using the equity method, where the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits and losses and 
other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income (except for losses 
in excess of the Group’s investment in the associate unless there is an obligation to make good those losses).
Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors’ interests 
in the associate. The investor’s share in the associate’s profits and losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value 
of the associate.
Any premium paid for an associate above the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired 
is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the associate. Where there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate has 
been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

JOINT VENTURES
The Group is a party to a joint arrangement when there is a contractual arrangement that confers joint control over the relevant activities of the 
arrangement to the Group and at least one other party. Joint control is assessed under the same principles as control over subsidiaries.
The Group classifies its interests in joint arrangements as either:
• Joint ventures – where the Group has rights to only the net assets of the joint arrangement; or
• Joint operations – where the Group has rights to both the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement.
In assessing the classification of interests in joint arrangements, the Group considers:
• The structure of the joint arrangement;
• The legal form of joint arrangements structured through a separate vehicle;
• The contractual terms of the joint arrangement agreement; and
• Any other facts and circumstances (including any other contractual arrangements).
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures in the same manner as investments in
Associates (i.e. using the equity method – refer above).
Any premium paid for an investment in a joint venture above the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and  
contingent liabilities acquired is capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the investment in joint venture. Where there is objective 
evidence that the investment in a joint venture has been impaired the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in the same  
way as other non-financial assets.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint operations by recognising its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in accordance  
with its contractually conferred rights and obligations.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. 
The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity. The Group does not hold any financial assets at fair value through profit 
and loss.
Loans and receivables 
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise 
principally through the provision of services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. 
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
The Group’s receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and loans to customers in the balance sheet.
Trade receivables which principally represent amounts due from licensees are carried at original invoice value less an estimate made for  
bad and doubtful debts based on a review of all outstanding amounts at the year-end. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when there  
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Bad debts are  
written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. Where cash is on deposit with maturity dates greater than three months, it is disclosed within other receivables. 
Loans to customers are in respect of formal loan agreements entered into between the Group and its customers, which are carried at original 
advanced value less provision for impairment (or fair value on inception, if different). They are classified between current and non-current assets  
in accordance with the contractual repayment terms of each loan agreement.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, 
associates or jointly controlled entities. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value generally recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the available for sale reserve. In accordance with IAS 39, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an 
available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and 
settlement date being recognised in the available-for-sale reserve. On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that 
asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

121
NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using  
the effective interest method.
Several of the Group’s licensees participate in progressive jackpot games. Each time a progressive jackpot game is played, a preset amount 
is added to a cumulative jackpot for that specific game. The accrual for the jackpot at the consolidated balance sheet date is included in 
progressive jackpot and other operator’s jackpot liabilities.
The Group’s liability in connection with client funds includes customer deposits offset by the fair value of open positions, the movement on which 
is recognised through profit or loss. Such open positions are classified as short term financial derivatives in the balance sheet. Where customer’s 
trading positions are hedged, or partly hedged, for risk management purposes, the fair value of those open hedge positions are carried at fair 
market value in trade receivables or trade payables (depending on whether the positions are in or out of the money) and classified as short term 
financial derivatives in the balance sheet.
Liability components of convertible loan notes are measured as described further below.
Loans and bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. 
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any 
interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and premia payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable 
while the liability is outstanding.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY
IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 requires certain disclosure which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value 
using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement (see Note 30). The fair value 
hierarchy has the following levels:
a) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
b) Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly  
(i.e. – derived from prices) (Level 2); and
c) Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorised is determined on the basis of the lowest  
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety into only one  
of the three levels. The Group measures its available-for-sale investments at fair value – refer to Note 14 for more detailed information in respect 
of the fair value measurement.
SHARE CAPITAL
Ordinary shares are classified as equity and are stated at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST
Consideration paid/received for the purchase/sale of shares subsequently put in the Employee Benefit Trust is recognised directly in equity.  
The cost of treasury shares held is presented as a separate reserve (the “Employee Benefit Trust reserve”). Any excess of the consideration 
received on the sale of treasury shares over the weighted average cost of the shares sold is credited to retained earnings.
SHARE BUY BACK
The Group cannot hold treasury shares under the Group’s memorandum and article of association and therefore the shares are cancelled  
after the buy back.
CONVERTIBLE BOND
The proceeds received on issue of the Group’s convertible bond are allocated into their liability and equity components. The amount initially 
attributed to the debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a market rate of interest that would be payable on a similar debt 
instrument that does not include an option to convert. Subsequently, the debt component is accounted for as a financial liability measured  
at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bond, where the option meets the definition of an equity instrument.  
The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in the “Convertible bond option reserve” within 
shareholders’ equity. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
LONG TERM LIABILITIES
Long term liabilities are those liabilities that are due for repayment or settlement in more than twelve months from balance sheet date.
PROVISIONS 
Provisions, which are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past  
events, if it is probable that an outflow of funds will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation  
can be made.
LEASES
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group (an “operating lease”), the total rentals 
payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
Non-controlling interest is recognised at the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. The total comprehensive income of non-wholly owned subsidiaries is attributed to owners of the parent and to the  
non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
ADJUSTED RESULTS
The Directors believe that in order to best represent the trading performance and results of the Group, the reported numbers should exclude 
certain non-cash and one-off items including the below. 
Management regularly uses the adjusted financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the business and make operating 
decisions. These adjusted measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. 
Furthermore, compensation of the executives is based in part on the performance of the business based on these adjusted measures.
Accordingly, these are the key performance metrics used by the Board when assessing the Group’s financial performance. Such exclusions include:
• Material non-cash items, e.g. amortisation of intangibles on acquisition, change in fair value of available-for-sale investments in the income 
statement and Employee Share Option Plan expenses. Management regularly monitors the operating cash conversion to adjusted EBITDA. 
These items are excluded to better analyse the underlying cash transactions of the business. 
• Material one-off items, e.g. gain on sale of investment in associates, professional services cost related to acquisitions and other exceptional 
projects. In the last few years the Group has acquired new businesses on a regular basis, however, the costs incurred due to these acquisitions 
are not considered to be an ongoing trading cost and usually cannot be changed or influenced by management.
Underlying adjusted results excludes the following items in order to present a more accurate ‘like for like’ comparison over the comparable period:
• The impact of acquisitions made in the period or in the comparable period; and
• Specific material agreements, adjustments to previous years or currency fluctuations affecting the results in the period and the  
comparable period.
As these are non-GAAP measures, they should not be considered as replacements for IFRS measures. The Group’s definition of these non-GAAP 
measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A full reconciliation of adjustments is included 
in Note 5. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

NOTE 3 – CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial information in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the  
financial information and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are  
based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgments that may potentially have a significant impact on the Group’s earnings  
and financial position are detailed below.
 
ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill, intangible assets not yet in use and indefinite life assets have suffered  
any impairment. The Group is required to test other intangibles if events of changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation 
of future cash flows and the choice of a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. Such estimates are based on 
management’s experience of the business, but actual outcomes may vary. More details including carrying values are included in Note 12.
Amortisation of development costs and other intangible assets and the useful life of property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management’s 
estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. 
Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the amounts charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income  
in specific periods. More details including carrying values are included in Notes 11 and 12.
Compliance risk – Legal, regulatory and taxation
Legal proceedings and contingent liabilities
Legal proceedings and contingent liabilities Management regularly monitors the key risks affecting the Group, including the regulatory 
environment in which the Group operates. A provision will be made where there is a present obligation from a past event, a transfer of economic 
benefits is probable and the amount of costs of the transfer can be estimated reliably. In instances where the criteria are not met, a contingent 
liability may be disclosed in the notes to the financial information. More details are included in Note 32.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income tax in jurisdictions in which its companies are incorporated and registered and judgment is required in 
determining the provision for income taxes. The Group is basing its tax provisions on current (and enacted but not yet implemented) tax rules 
and practices, together with advice received from professional advisers, and believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open 
enquiry years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. The Group constantly monitors 
changes in legislation and update its accruals accordingly. The principal risks relating to the Group’s tax liabilities, and the sustainability of the 
underlying effective tax rate, arise from domestic and international tax laws and practices in the e-commerce environment continuing to evolve, 
including the corporate tax rates in jurisdictions where the Group has a significant asset or people presence. More details are included in Note 8.
Regulatory
The Group’s subsidiaries, Safecap investments Limited, Magansale Trading Limited, CFH Clearing Limited and TradeTech Alpha Limited, are 
regulated by either the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Conduct Authority. The regulatory environment is regularly 
changing and imposes significant demands of the resources of the subsidiaries. As the subsidiaries’ activities expand, offering new products and 
penetrating new markets, these regulatory demands will inevitably increase. The increasing complexity of the Group’s operations require training 
and recruitment be tailored to meet these regulatory demands and the costs of compliance are expected to increase.
In addition to the above, the regulated subsidiaries manage their capital resources on the basis of capital adequacy requirements as prescribed 
by each of the regulators, together with their own assessments of other business risks and sensitivities which may impact the business. Capital 
adequacy requirements are monitored on a real-time basis, including a ‘buffer’ which is deemed sufficient by management to ensure that capital 
requirements are not breached at any time. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

NOTE 3 – CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED
Structured agreements
For all arrangements structured in separate vehicles the Group must assess the substance of the arrangement in determining whether it meets 
the definition to be classified as an associate or joint venture. Factors the Group must consider include:
• Structure
• Legal form
• Contractual agreement
• Other facts and circumstances.
Upon consideration of these factors, the Group has determined that all of its arrangements structured through separate vehicles give it significant 
influence but not joint control rights to the net assets and are therefore classified as associates.
Share-based payments
The Group has a share-based remuneration scheme for employees. The fair value of share options is estimated by using the Black-Scholes  
and Binomial models, on the date of grant based on certain assumptions. Those assumptions are described in Note 10 and include, among 
others, the dividend growth rate, expected share price volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest. 
Determination of fair value of intangible assets acquired on business combinations 
The fair value of the intangible assets acquired is based on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use of the asset. Further 
information in relation to the determination of fair value of intangible assets acquired is given in Notes 26 and 27.
Determination of the fair value of contingent consideration and redemption liability
The fair value of contingent consideration and redemption liability is based on the probability of expected cash flow outcomes and the 
assessment of present values using appropriate discount rates. Recognition of put/call options over non-controlling interest is based on 
consideration of the ownership risks and rewards of the shares relating to the option to determine whether the equity is attributable to the  
non-controlling interest or the parent. Further information in relation to the determination of the fair value of contingent consideration is given  
in Notes 26 and 27.
Provision for loss from onerous contracts
Management considers the requirement for a creation of a provision from a loss-making contract by forecasting the cash flow outcomes in the 
remain period of the contract. The assessment of the cash flow outcomes includes the probability of future changes in commercial terms and  
the steps taking to mitigate the issues encountered with the contract.
NOTE 4 – SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group’s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision maker has been identified as the management team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
The operating segments identified are:
• Gaming B2B: including Casino, Services, Sport, Bingo, Poker and Other
• Gaming B2C
• Financial: including B2C and B2B CFD
The Group-wide profit measures are adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net profit (see Note 5). Management believes the adjusted profit measures 
represent more closely the underlying trading performance of the business. No other differences exist between the basis of preparation of the 
performance measures used by management and the figures in the Group financial information.
In 2017 following the growth in the business to customer (B2C) segment and due to the fundamental difference in its margin profiles, the Group 
has changed the internal and external reporting and split out from the gaming segment the B2C element. 
There is no allocation of operating expenses, profit measures, assets and liabilities to individual products within the gaming segment, as allocation 
would be arbitrary.  PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

The key Group companies are incorporated, managed and controlled and tax resident in the Isle of Man and the majority of the profits arise in 
these companies for which the headline corporate tax rate is set to zero. The Group’s subsidiaries are located in different jurisdictions and these 
subsidiaries are taxed locally on their respective profits.
 
The deferred tax movement arises due to the reversal of temporary differences arising on the identification of the intangible assets acquired  
in the current and prior years.
NOTE 9 – EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share have been calculated using the weighted average number of shares in issue during the relevant financial periods.

price is greater than the weighted average share price during the year (i.e. they are out of the money) and therefore it would not be advantageous 
for the holders to exercise those options. The total number of options in issue is disclosed in Note 10.

The Group has the following employee share option plans (ESOP) for the granting of non-transferable options to certain employees: 
• Playtech 2005 Share Option Plan (“the Plan”) and Israeli plans, options granted under the plans vest on the first day on which they become 
exercisable which is typically between one to four years after grant date. 
• GTS 2010 Company Share Option Plan (CSOP), options granted under the plan vest on the first day on which they become exercisable which is 
three years after grant date.
• Long Term Incentive Plan 2012 (LTIP), awards (options, conditional awards or a forfeitable share award) granted under the plan vest on the

in USD or GBP, depending on the option grant terms.

to settle fully vested and exercisable options for cash instead of issuing shares. 
The Group granted 1,615,579 and 1,500,529 nil cost awards in 2017 and 2016 respectively at fair value per share of between £9.625 and £10.06

NOTE 12 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets, including goodwill. Goodwill is allocated to 
thirteen (2016: eleven) cash generating units (CGU). Following the restructure of the Sports division, the previous CGU’s of Mobenga, Geneity, 
BGT and other acquisitions were combined to form the Sports CGU. Also, Quickspin and other gaming studios were combined with the Casino 
product in accordance with IAS 36. Management determines which of those CGU’s are significant in relation to the total carrying value of goodwill 
as follows:
• Carrying value exceeds 10% of total goodwill; or
• Acquisition during the year; or
• Contingent consideration exists at the balance sheet date.
Based on the above criteria in respect of the goodwill, management has concluded that the following are significant:
• Markets, with a carrying value of $265.3 million, €221.5 million (2016: $265.3 million, €252.3 million);
• Services, with a carrying value of €95.2 million (2016: €100.0 million);
• Sport, with a carrying value of €132.5 million (2016: €126.1 million, BGT €88.3 million);
• Casino product, with a carrying value of €81.8 million (2016: current presentation €67.1 million, previous presentation €34.0 million,  
Quickspin €26.8 million, Other acquisitions €6.3 million); and
• Tradetech Alpha, with a carrying value of €63.5 million (2016: €0.9 million).
The recoverable amounts of all the CGUs have been determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow projections from  
formally approved budgets covering one year period to 31 December 2018 in addition to 2-3 years forecasts. Beyond this period, management 
has applied an annual growth rate of between 2% and 5% based on the underlying economic environment in which the CGU operates. 
Management has applied discount rates to the cash flow projections between 10.53% and 24.53% (2016: between 11.9% and 13.9%).
In 2017 the results of the review indicated that there was an impairment of goodwill of the 1 CGU in a total amount of €7.8 million  
(2016: €12.3 million) which has been charged to the income statement.
The Directors’ sensitivity analysis does not result in an impairment charge of any other CGU and, given the level of headroom in value in use they 
show, the Directors do not envisage reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions would be sufficient to cause an impairment at this time.
Management has also reviewed the key assumptions and forecasts for the customer lists, brands and affiliates, applying the above same key 
assumptions. The results of the reviews indicated there was no impairment of the intangible assets at 31 December 2017.

Ladbrokes software and services agreement
In 2013, the Group entered into a landmark transaction with Ladbrokes plc (“Ladbrokes”), which includes three significant agreements covering 
software licensing, marketing and advisory services.
As part of the advisory services agreement, the Group through its marketing division will have significant influence over the financial and 
operational decision making of the Ladbrokes digital business. The Group will receive a share of profit based on the EBITDA performance  
of the Ladbrokes digital business in the financial year ended 31 December 2017 over and above that achieved in the financial year ended  
31 December 2012, as adjusted (the “Base EBITDA”). 
On 27 July 2015, the Group agreed to an early settlement of its marketing services subject to the completion of the merger between Ladbrokes 
and Coral.
On 1 November 2016, the merger was completed. The Group received €44.5 million (£40 million) satisfied by way of the issue of shares in 
Ladbrokes Coral plc. A further £35 million in cash is to be received upon delivery of key operational milestones by the Group but, in any event, 
within 42 months following completion of the merger.

NOTE 21 – CONVERTIBLE BONDS
On 12 November 2014 the Group issued €297.0 million of senior, unsecured convertible bonds due 2019 and convertible into fully paid Ordinary 
Shares of Playtech plc (the “Bonds”). The net proceeds of issuing the Bonds, after deducting commissions and other direct costs of issue, totalled 
€291.1 million. 
The Bonds were issued at par and will be redeemed (if not converted before) on 19 November 2019 at their principal amount. The Bonds bear 
interest at 0.5% per annum, payable annually in arrears on 19 November. 
Upon conversion, Bondholders are entitled to receive Ordinary Shares at the conversion price of €8.8542 per Ordinary Share, subject to 
adjustment in respect of (i) any dividend or distribution by the Company, (ii) a change of control and (iii) customary anti-dilution adjustments for, 
inter alia, share consolidations, share splits and rights issues. 
The fair value of the liability component, included in non-current borrowings, at inception was calculated using a market interest rate for an 
equivalent instrument without conversion option of 4%.
The fair value of the liability component of the bond at 31 December 2017 was €342.4 million (2016: €341.3 million), based on readily available 
quoted prices. 
The amortised cost of the liability component of the Bonds (including accrued interest) at 31 December 2017 amounted to €276.6 million  
(2016: €266.2 million), which was calculated using cash flow projections discounted at 4%.

The Group paid total cash consideration of €208 million and additional cash consideration, capped at €250 million, was to be payable based on 
2017 EBITDA multiple, less initial consideration. Following the completion of the 2017 results, which were negatively impacted by one-sided crypto 
currency trading in the final quarter of 2017, compounded by a lack of volatility in other asset classes for the majority of the second half of 2017, 
the Directors calculate that there is no further consideration payable and so the contingent consideration liability was released to the income

• The discount rate assumed is equivalent to the WACC for the Brand.
• The growth rates and attrition rates were based on market analysis.
The key assumptions used by management to determine the value in use of the IP Technology within Eyecon are as follows:
• The with and without model, taking into account the time and additional expenses required to recreate the IP Technology and the level of lost 
cash flows in the period.
• The discount rate assumed is equivalent to the WACC for the IP Technology.
• The growth rates and attrition rates were based on market analysis.

The main factor leading to the recognition of goodwill is ACM’s well-known brand and market in the CFD industry with strong customer 
relationship, key personnel and future revenue and cost synergies. In accordance with IAS36, the Group will regularly monitor the carrying value 
of its interest in ACM Group assets.
The key assumptions used by management to determine the value in use of the Customer relationships within ACM Group assets are as follows:
• The MPEEM income approach.
• The discount rate assumed is equivalent to the WACC for the Customer relationships.
• The growth rates and attrition rates were based on market analysis.
Management has not disclosed ACM contribution to the Group profit since the acquisition, because the amounts are not material. The combined 
Group revenue as if ACM acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017 would have been higher by €9.2 million, the combined Group adjusted 
EBITDA and adjusted net profit would have been higher by €2.1 million.
C. OTHER ACQUISITIONS

The main factor leading to the recognition of goodwill is the frontend framework and its software integration, unique workforce and future 
revenue and cost synergies. In accordance with IAS 36, the Group will regularly monitor the carrying value of its interest in these acquisitions.
The key assumptions used by management to determine the value in use of the IP Technology and Customers relationship within these 
acquisitions are as follows:
• The income approach, in particular, the MPEEM method and the with and without models.
• The discount rate assumed is equivalent to the WACC for the IP Technology and the Customer relationship.
• The growth rates and attrition rates were based on market analysis.
Management has not disclosed other acquisitions contribution to the Group profit since these acquisitions nor has the impact the acquisition

NOTE 30 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks, which results from its financing, operating and investing activities. The objective of financial 
risk management is to contain, where appropriate, exposures in these financial risks to limit any negative impact on the Group’s financial 
performance and position. The Group’s financial instruments are its cash, available-for-sale financial assets, trade receivables, loan receivables, 
bank borrowings, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s 
operation. The Group actively measures, monitors and manages its financial risk exposures by various functions pursuant to the segregation of 
duties and principals. The risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk and market price risk, which include interest rate risk, 
currency risk and equity price risk. The risk management policies employed by the Group to manage these risks are discussed below. 
A. MARKET RISK 
Market risk changes in line with fluctuations in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equities and commodities prices. 
These market prices affect the Group’s income or the value of its holding in financial instruments.
Exposure to market risk
In the financial trading division, the Group has exposure to market risk to the extent that it has open positions. The Group’s exposure to market 
risk at any point in time depends primarily on short-term market conditions and client activities during the trading day. The exposure at each 
reporting date is therefore not considered representative of the market risk exposure faced by the Group over the year.
The Group’s exposure to market risk is mainly determined by the clients’ open position. The most significant market risk faced by the Group on 
the CFD products it offers changes in line with market changes and the volume of clients’ transactions.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. The Group’s income and 
operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest changes. The management monitors interest rate fluctuations on 
a continuous basis and acts accordingly. 
Where the Group has generated a significant amount of cash, it will invest in higher earning interest deposit accounts. These deposit accounts are 
short term and the Group is not unduly exposed to market interest rate fluctuations.
During the year the Group advanced loans to affiliates and associates for a total amount of €8.5 million (2016: €5.5 million). The average interest 
on the loans is 5%.
A 1% change in deposit interest rates would impact on the profit before tax by €85 thousands.
B. CREDIT RISK
Credit risk arises when a failure by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows from financial 
assets on hand at the balance sheet date.
The Group closely monitors the activities of its counterparties and controls the access to its intellectual property which enables it to ensure the 
prompt collection of customers’ balances.
The Group’s main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents as well as trade and other receivables and represent the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk in connection with its financial assets. Trade and other receivables are carried on the balance sheet net of bad debt 
provisions estimated by the Directors based on prior year experience and an evaluation of prevailing economic circumstances. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 30 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
B. CREDIT RISK CONTINUED
Wherever possible and commercially practical the Group invests cash with major financial institutions that have a rating of at least A- as defined 
by Standard & Poors. While the majority of money is held in line with the above policy, a small amount is held at various institutions with no rating. 
The Group also holds small deposits in Cypriot and Spanish financial institutions, as required by the respective gaming regulators that have a 
rating below A-. The Group holds approximately 3% of its funds (2016: 4%) in financial institutions below A- rate and 8% in payment methods with 
no rating (2016:2%).

At 31 December 2016 544,843 476,904 67,939
The Group has no credit risk to clients since all accounts have an automatic margin call, which relates to a guaranteed stop such that the client’s 
maximum loss is covered by the deposit. The Group has risk management and monitoring processes for clients’ accounts and this is achieved via 
margin calling and close-out process. 
The ageing of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired can be analysed as follows:

The above balances relate to customers with no default history and management estimate full recoverability given the provision below.
A provision for doubtful debtors is included within trade receivables that can be reconciled as follows:
2017 2016
€’000 €’000
Provision at the beginning of the year 1,132 86
Charged to income statement 565 795
Provision acquired through business combination – 404
Utilised (267) (153)
Provision at end of year 1,430 1,132
Related party receivables included in Note 16 are not past due. 
C. CURRENCY RISK
Currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has operations located in various parts of the world. However, the functional currency of those 
operations is the same as the Group’s primary functional currency (Euro) and the Group is not substantially exposed to fluctuations in exchange 
rates in respect of assets held overseas.
Foreign exchange risk also arises when Group operations are entered into, and when the Group holds cash balances, in currencies denominated 
in a currency other than the functional currency. 
The Group’s policy is not to enter into any currency hedging transactions. PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

NOTE 30 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
D. EQUITY PRICE RISK
The Group’s balance sheet is exposed to market risk by way of holding some investments in other companies on a short term basis (Note 14). 
Variations in market value over the life of these investments have or will have an impact on the balance sheet and the income statement.
The Directors believe that the exposure to market price risk is acceptable in the Group’s circumstances.
The Group’s balance sheet at 31 December 2017 includes available-for-sale investments with a value of €381.3 million (2016: €230.3 million)  
which are subject to fluctuations in the underlying share price. 
A change of 1% in price will have an impact of €3.8 million on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the fair value of the 
available for sale investments will change by the same amount.
E. CAPITAL DISCLOSURES
The Group seeks to maintain a capital structure which enables it to continue as a going concern and which supports its business strategy.  
The Group’s capital is provided by equity and debt funding. The Group manages its capital structure through cash flow from operations,  
returns to shareholders primarily in the form of dividends and the raising or repayment of debt.
F. LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the financial charges on its debt instruments. 
Financial division liquidity risk
Positions can be closed at any time by clients and can also be closed by the Group, in accordance with the Group’s margining rules. If after 
closing a position a client is in surplus, then the amount owing is repayable on demand by the Group. When client positions are closed, any 
corresponding positions relating to the hedged position (if applicable) are closed with brokers.
Liquidity risk arises if the Group encounters difficulty in meeting obligations which arise following profitable positions being closed by clients.  
This risk is managed through the Group holding client funds in separately segregated accounts whereby cash is transferred to or from the 
segregated accounts on a daily basis to ensure that no material mismatch arises between the aggregate of client deposits and the fair value  
of open positions, and segregated cash. Through this risk management process, the Group considers liquidity risk to be low.

CFH trades on a matched principal basis and financial instruments are used to hedge all client positions. The management of market risk in 
respect of matching of derivatives is through automated tools, together with active monitoring and management by senior personnel under the 
supervision of its Directors. CFH’s liquidity obligations are monitored daily and it is adequately capitalised with a steady revenue stream to meet  
its day to day obligations. CFH client deposits balance as at 31 December 2017 was €71.6 million (2016: €76.2 million). PLAYTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017

NOTE 31 – CHANGES IN LIABILITIES ARISING FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES
The Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 7 for the first time in the current year. The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures 
that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and non-cash 
changes. The Group’s liabilities arising from financing activities consist of loans and borrowings (Note 20), convertible bonds (Note 21) and 
contingent consideration and redemption liability (Note 22). Consistent with the transition provisions of the amendments, the Group has not 
disclosed comparative information for the prior year. Apart from the additional disclosure below, the application of these amendments has had  
no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

On 12 November 2014 the Company issued €297.0 million of senior, unsecured convertible bonds due 2019 and convertible into fully paid

interest at 0.5% per annum, payable annually in arrears on 19 November. 
Upon conversion, Bondholders are entitled to receive Ordinary Shares at the conversion price of €8.8542 per Ordinary Share, subject to

The fair value of the liability component, included in non-current borrowings, at inception was calculated using a market interest rate for an 
equivalent instrument without conversion option of 4%.
The fair value of the liability component, which is immateriality different to the amortised cost, of the Bonds (including accrued interest) at  
31 December 2017 amounted to €276.6 million million (2016: €266.2 million), which was calculated using cash flow projections discounted at 4%.
