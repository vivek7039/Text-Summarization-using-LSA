p26 Chief Financial Officer’s Review
(1) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, onerous leases and other non-cash items, impairments and 
reversals of impairments, transaction and reorganisation costs, gains and losses on disposals of assets and subsidiaries and the settlement of the defined 
benefit pension liability. Adjusted EBITDA is considered an accurate and consistent measure of the Group’s trading performance; items adjusted to arrive 
at Adjusted EBITDA are considered to be outside of the Group’s ongoing trading activities. 
(2)  Adjusted profit before tax is calculated by adding back amortisation of intangible assets (excluding acquired movie distribution rights), and certain 
non-cash items and foreign exchange as set out in Note 5 to the financial statements. Adjusted profit before tax is used an internal measure by 
management, as they believe it better reflects the underlying performance of the Group and therefore a more meaningful comparison of performance 
from period to period. Adjusted profit after tax is arrived at by applying an effective tax rate to taxable adjustments and deducting the total from 
adjusted profit before tax.
(3) To provide information on a comparable basis, where percentage change vs prior year information includes performance generated in currencies other 
than Sterling, the percentage is presented on a constant currency basis. Constant currency movements have been calculated by applying the 2017 
average exchange rates to 2016 performance.
(4) ROW is defined as the Rest of the World and includes Poland, Israel, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Slovakia.
(5) In accordance with IAS33 the basic and diluted EPS figures have been adjusted for the bonus element rights issue as part of the Regal Entertainment 
Group acquisition.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Chairman’s Letter
Another record year
Æ Æ the refurbishment of the existing 
estate by introducing state-of-the-art 
design and installing the latest cutting 
edge screening and other technology; 
Æ Æ a consistent focus on reducing costs;
Æ Æ implementing a continuous 
programme to optimise the customer 
experience; and,
Æ Æ ensuring that we live up to our vision to 
be “The Best Place To Watch a Movie”.
I am pleased to report that these 
objectives were met during the year 
and we will continue with their 
implementation in the UK, ROW 
and US in the forthcoming year. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s 
Balance Sheet was strong with the 
Adjusted EBITDA to net debt ratio at 
1.4 times. It should be noted that this 
ratio significantly decreased in the four 
years after the Cinema City transaction, 
an achievement demonstrating the 
strong cash flows in the business and 
an ability to reduce debt, which is likely 
to have played a major part in the 
willingness of our banks to provide the 
finance and underwriting arrangements 
for the Regal transaction. 
On the strength of the Balance Sheet and 
an increase in statutory profit after tax to 
£100.6m (2016: £82.0m), the Board 
increased the cash dividend paid for the 
full year by 14.5%. The proposed final 
dividend per share is 15.4p (3.1p on a 
rights adjusted basis). 
Regal Acquisition
The acquisition of Regal completed on 
28 February 2018. Due to the size of the 
proposed acquisition it was classed as a 
reverse takeover under the Listing Rules. 
The acquisition of Regal will provide 
Cineworld with a major presence in the 
US cinema market, the largest box office 
market in the world. The North American 
box office grossed over US$11.0bn in 
2016 with annual attendance of 
approximately 1.3bn, and represented 
approximately 29% of global box office 
revenue. The US cinema market is also 
of major importance as the home to 
some of the world’s largest and most 
influential movie production studios. 
Following completion, the enlarged 
Group became a global cinema 
exhibition business of significant scale, 
with operations in ten countries covering 
an addressable market of approximately 
500m people. In the 12 months to 
30 June 2017, the enlarged Group would 
have had over 310m annual admissions, 
pro forma revenues of US$4,370m 
(£3,173m) and pro forma Adjusted 
EBITDA of US$907m (£659m). As at 
16 January 2018 the enlarged Group 
would have had 9,538 screens across 
the US and Europe, making it the 
second largest operator in the world 
(by number of screens).
The enlarged Group’s diverse 
geographic footprint will help to mitigate 
year on year volatility in the global 
cinema industry resulting from regional, 
economic, weather and movie 
performance variables and enable the 
Group to diversify its movie offerings. 
The Board believes that the enlarged 
Group will generate strong total returns 
for shareholders through top-line 
growth, delivery of operational 
improvements and dividends. 
The Regal acquisition is an ambitious 
and bold move which was very 
carefully considered by the Board 
which took a wide array of advice from 
professionals in the accounting, legal, 
strategic consultancy and environmental 
fields. We are confident that there is 
significant potential for value creation, 
Overview
2017 was an exciting year for the 
Cineworld Group – the most momentous 
since its formation in 1995. 
For the year ended 31 December 2017, 
the Group’s operations in the UK and 
ROW once again posted record results 
and then in December we announced 
the acquisition of Regal Entertainment 
Group (“Regal”) which successfully 
completed on 28 February 2018. 
Group revenue for the year increased by 
11.6% to £890.7m (2016: £797.8m), and 
Adjusted EBITDA rose to £198.2m (2016: 
£175.8m). The strong operating 
performance was driven by the 
implementation of the Group’s 
Operating Strategic Plan, adopted by 
the Executive Management Team in 2014 
after the combination with Cinema City. 
This entails: 
Æ Æ opening new cinemas in areas which 
were considered to have the potential 
to achieve double digit growth rates; 
Æ Æ the pursuit of suitable acquisition 
opportunities;
“ 2017 was an exciting 
year for the Cineworld 
Group – the most 
momentous since its 
formation in 1995”
08
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 and I have high expectations for the 
future of the Group. It is particularly 
gratifying that the Regal acquisition 
received strong support from our 
shareholders – 87.3% of votes cast 
were in favour of the acquisition at the 
General Meeting on 2 February 2018, 
and a 96.3% acceptance rate in respect 
of the subsequent rights issue. 
Board and Management
As a Board we take corporate 
governance standards extremely 
seriously and we always strive to attain 
the highest standards possible. We 
regularly review areas such as gender, 
diversity, health and safety and the 
environment and where appropriate 
improve our practices in those areas.
I would like to express appreciation to 
our Executive Management Team and 
all the Group employees for their 
dedication, commitment and hard work 
during the year. They are competently 
led by our CEO, Mooky Greidinger, and 
Israel Greidinger, our Deputy CEO – 
whose experience, competence and 
professionalism are recognised 
throughout the industry. Importantly 
they are substantial shareholders in the 
Company and accordingly their interests 
are fully aligned with those of all 
shareholders. Their confidence in the 
Regal acquisition was demonstrated by 
the fact that they took up all their rights 
in the rights issue by the Company.
Complementing them is a highly 
dedicated team of Senior Management 
at the Vice President level who have a 
long tenure within the Group. This deep 
experience in the industry is invaluable.
Our management and employees are 
our greatest asset and performed 
exceptionally well during the 2017 
financial year – it was a significant 
achievement to produce record results 
and at the same time to identify, 
negotiate and complete a $3.4bn 
acquisition in the US. 
The following Board changes took place 
at the start of the year:
Æ Æ Martina King, Non-Executive Director, 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
and member of the Audit Committee, 
stepped down following six years of 
service to focus on her other business 
interests. 
Æ Æ Nisan Cohen was appointed as Chief 
Financial Officer and joined the Board 
as an Executive Director. Nisan has 
been part of the Cineworld Group, 
and formerly the Cinema City Group 
for 17 years. 
Æ Æ Dean Moore, the previous interim 
Chief Financial Officer, was appointed 
to the Board as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director, Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and a 
member of the Audit Committee. 
Dean brings over 20 years of 
experience as a plc executive director. 
The Board was satisfied that Dean 
meets the requisite criteria to be 
considered as independent, 
notwithstanding his brief ten month 
interim employment with the Group, 
during which his mandate was to 
focus primarily on the CFO 
succession planning process.
It has been a pleasure working with both 
Nisan and Dean during 2017 as they took 
on their new roles.
Outlook
As we go into 2018, I look forward with 
confidence at the prospects for the 
enlarged Group. We will have an 
excellent geographically diversified 
estate, and the movie release slate looks 
strong. We will continue to implement 
our strategic objectives in the UK and 
ROW, and begin to implement them in 
the US. We will focus on maximising 
cash flow to expand and refurbish 
our cinemas, while at the same time 
reducing borrowing levels and 
maintaining our well established 
dividend policy. I am aware that this is a 
formidable challenge but am confident 
that we have the people and resources 
to meet it.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Chief Executive Officer’s Review
A strategy that 
delivers real results
“ We believe it’s the Tiny 
Noticeable Things that 
our people do which 
make the difference 
to our customers’ 
experience”
Our Strategy
2017 has seen the Group make great 
strides in delivering on our strategy and 
vision to be “The Best Place to Watch 
a Movie”. 
Our strategy is to:
Æ Æ deliver the best cinema experience 
for all cinemagoers every time – give 
our customers a choice of how to 
watch a movie, with a range of retail 
offerings, all underpinned by the best 
customer service;
Æ Æ be technological leaders in the 
industry – to offer the latest audio 
and visual technology;
Æ Æ expand and enhance our estate – 
to provide consistent, high quality, 
modern cinemas; and, 
Æ Æ drive value for shareholders – by 
delivering our growth plans in an 
efficient and effective way.
An overview of our key achievements 
in 2017 is provided below.
Customer Experience
We want to provide our customers with 
a choice of how to watch a movie. Our 
cinemas offer up to six different formats 
of how to watch movies: regular screens, 
3D, 4DX, IMAX, Superscreen and VIP 
offerings. Through both our expansion 
and our refurbishment programme, we 
are focused on ensuring as many of our 
sites provide a range of these formats for 
our customers.
We believe it’s the Tiny Noticeable Things 
that our people do which make the 
difference to our customers’ experience. 
We want to ensure our customers return 
to our cinemas again and again. We are 
very proud of our internal training 
programmes. We are committed 
to ensuring our people have the 
opportunity to develop themselves and 
reach their full potential. We continue to 
nurture our talent and promote internally 
wherever possible.
Integral to our people strategy is our 
fair wage policy – we are among 
the highest payers in the industry 
and we pay more than our statutory 
obligations, across all age groups and 
in all territories.
As well as developing our exhibition 
offerings and ensuring first class 
customer service we continue to pay 
particular attention to our retail products 
and services. Our on-site concessions 
aim to be best in class, providing a 
variety of food, drink and snack options. 
During 2017, the Group has opened five 
new Starbucks coffee outlets in the UK, 
in Hemel Hempstead, South Ruislip, 
Solihull, Basildon and Leeds, taking the 
total number to 29 at 31 December 2017. 
We have expanded the number of VIP 
locations where customers experience a 
premium offering from the moment they 
walk through the door. A VIP ticket 
includes access to a private lounge 
ahead of the movie screening where 
customers can enjoy unlimited buffet 
food, popcorn and soft drinks before 
watching the movie in a dedicated 
auditorium with luxurious reclining seats. 
Three new VIP locations were opened 
during the year in Zichron (Israel), 
Chodov (Czech Republic) and Wroclaw 
(Poland). At 31 December 2017 we had 
12 VIP locations across the Group.
Our membership schemes, the most 
significant being the Cineworld Unlimited 
programme, continue to provide our 
customers with a range of benefits, and 
are one of the pillars of our strategy for 
growing revenues and admissions. The 
schemes also bring operational benefits 
by encouraging repeat visits, often at 
off-peak times. The Unlimited 
programme was launched in Poland at 
the end of 2015 and has performed 
strongly during 2017.
Our wider communities are also 
important to us. Every year we 
undertake a range of activities and 
initiatives with charities, schools and 
community groups. We were proud to 
partner with the BBC’s Children in Need 
fundraising initiative for the second year, 
where we raised over £450,000.

are the Group’s values and cultures.

and passion for all aspects of 
our business. 
Passion for our people
We are passionate about nurturing our 
talent and aim to promote internally 
wherever possible.

Passion for achieving
We are passionate about reaching our

p23 Resources and Relationships
Technology and Innovation
We continued to invest in the latest 
audio and visual technology to ensure 
we remain fit for the future. In 2017 
we opened a further 11 4DX screens, 
seven in the UK and four across the 
ROW, two IMAX screens, one in the 
UK and one in the ROW, and two 
Superscreens in the UK. Many customers 
have now experienced 4DX in the UK 
since we launched the first screen in 
Milton Keynes in 2015. The 4DX 
experience is constantly evolving to 
give cinema-goers an even more 
immersive experience. 
In the UK, more tickets are now 
purchased online than in our cinemas, 
with 20% of the online purchases being 
made on mobile applications. 
Expansion and Refurbishments
We opened nine additional cinemas, a 
total of 109 screens, during 2017, four in 
the UK and five in the ROW. 
One year on from the acquisition of the 
five Empire cinemas we have completed 
the refurbishment of Hemel Hempstead, 
which now includes a Starbucks, and 
Basildon, which now has a 4DX screen 
and a Starbucks, and we have started 
work on the Leicester Square and 
Bromley sites. 
We have continued to proactively 
manage our existing estate through our 
refurbishment and selective site closure 
programme. During 2017 we completed 
four refurbishments in the UK and two 
in Poland. At the year end there were a 
number of refurbishments ongoing, 
including two in London, in Leicester 
Square and The O2. 
During 2017, we closed three sites, two in 
the UK (Chelsea and Stockport) and one 
in the ROW (MOM Park, Hungary) as the 
lease terms expired and it was not 
commercially beneficial or feasible to 
renew these leases. We also handed over 
the Haymarket site in the UK to Empire 
as part of the agreed 2016 Empire 
acquisition consideration. 
We have a further 75 screens scheduled 
to open in 2018. New sites will be opened 
across both the UK and ROW. 
Value for Shareholders
The cash generative nature of our 
business underpins our business model. 
Our priorities for the use of our cash 
have remained consistent: to invest 
in the business to support growth in 
revenue and earnings, for selective 
merger and acquisition opportunities 
and to grow the dividend. During 2017 
we have been able to reward 
shareholders with growth of 12.3% in 
the rights adjusted, adjusted diluted 
earnings per share. The Group 
maintained its dividend pay-out ratio 
for another year, increasing the full 
year cash dividend paid by 14.5%. The 
proposed final rights adjusted dividend 
is 3.1p per share.
Future Outlook
Towards the end of 2017 we announced 
the Regal acquisition which completed 
on 28 February 2018. Cineworld Group 
is now the second largest circuit in the 
world operating over 9,500 screens in 
almost 800 locations in ten countries. 
Although a huge challenge, we as 
management are confident that our 
team together with the Regal team will 
successfully lead the Group to new 
achievements. Through our success and 
experience in the UK we have learnt and 
proved that the potential in a mature 
market is at least as big as in the 
emerging markets.
The US is the biggest cinema market 
in the world and we believe that by 
combining new sites with refurbished 
sites to enhance the “cinema experience” 
for our customers this new addition will 
be a great success. In addition we are 
finalising our integration plan which has 
already started, and we are confident 
in achieving our goals on both sides of 
the Atlantic.
Through the year the media paid a lot 
of attention to the early P-VOD release 
period, known as the “window”. Despite 
many rumours and much speculation 
it seems now that most of the big 
players in the industry support and 
believe in the importance of the cinemas 
being the platform to exclusively release 
movies. I believe the studios will continue 
to provide great content, while our 
commitment is to provide the 
infrastructure and the great service that 
will keep the big screen as the best way 
to watch a movie. 
There is a strong movie slate for 2018, 
which includes “Jurassic World: Fallen 
Kingdom”, “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes 
of Grindelwald“, “Avengers: Infinity War”, 
“Incredibles 2”, “Mamma Mia! Here We 
Go Again”, “Solo: A Star Wars Story”, 
“Deadpool 2”, “Fifty Shades Freed”, 
“Mary Poppins Returns” and many more.
Without our motivated and engaged 
teams we would not be able to achieve 
our vision to be the “Best Place to 
Watch a Movie”. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank the whole 
Cineworld team for their continued 
hard work and dedication across all 
departments and territories during 2017. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
alongside the existing and enlarged 
team in 2018.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Market Drivers
Addressing our biggest 
opportunities and challenges
Market drivers What is happening? The impact How our strategy is optimised to respond
Technology and 
innovation
Developments in technology have brought new innovative 
audio and visual experiences to the cinema industry.
Technology impacts the whole customer journey from 
booking tickets to purchasing concessions as well as the 
audio and visual experience. 
The digitalisation of cinemas has resulted in both a greater 
range of films being offered and also the streaming of live 
events such as opera, theatre and ballet.
Investment in technology is key pillar of the Group’s strategy – we want to be 
leaders in this field. The Group was the first to launch 4DX in the UK in 2015 and 
continues to invest and open more 4DX, IMAX and Superscreens every year. 
The Group is continually reviewing and analysing the latest technology available 
to ensure the right technology is selected. 
The Group is also evolving its IT systems to provide customers with the ability 
to book online more easily and through mobile applications.
Property market 
and development
The rate of new cinema openings is often dependent upon 
local market conditions. Planning laws, the economic 
environment and the ability of developers to finance their 
projects are factors which impact on cinema location.
The local market conditions impact the rate and feasibility 
of new openings as well as which sites which can be 
refurbished. 
The Group has been successful in opening 17 new sites over the past two years. 
As the estate is generally older in the mature markets, refurbishment of existing 
cinemas, in particular in the UK, is a key focus for the Group. Where there are site 
closures, especially of older sites in the UK, this also provides further opportunities 
for new investments.
Market maturity Where a market is in the maturity continuum this impacts 
the level and trend of cinema admissions per capita.
The more mature markets such as the UK and Israel tend 
to be characterised by higher admissions per capita, higher 
average ticket prices and a lower population per screen 
ratio. Growth markets have the opposite characteristics 
and provide great expansion potential for the Group. 
The geographic spread of the Group provides diversification benefits and 
opportunities across both the more mature and growth markets. This includes the 
opportunity to open new sites as well as refurbish older sites, particularly in the 
more mature markets where the estate is generally older.
Competing 
media and 
leisure activities
Throughout the decades the cinema industry has always 
faced competition from other forms of media delivering 
content, for example video, DVD and Blu-ray.
Although online streaming and downloading of films at 
home is increasingly popular, an outing to the cinema 
provides a unique experience which cannot be replicated 
at home, especially with superior experiences offered by 
technologies such as IMAX and 4DX. A trip to the cinema 
is a social occasion and watching a movie on a large screen 
with superb sound is attractive to all age groups. Visiting 
the cinema remains a convenient, affordable out-of-home 
activity, especially when compared with other leisure 
activities such as concerts and sporting events.
The Group continues to invest in new technology to ensure the experience is unique 
while remaining an affordable activity for the whole family. Going to the cinema has 
also become more than just watching a movie, and that is why the Group has 
invested in its retail offerings such as Starbucks and our VIP offerings.
GDP and the 
economic 
environment
The cinema industry is dependent on the customer 
choosing to spend disposable income on watching 
a movie.
Value for money remains an important factor and cinema 
has tended to be a less expensive form of entertainment 
in the wider leisure market in which the cinema industry 
competes. Historical trends and patterns show that cinema 
attendance is most closely related to the quality of the 
movies rather than the gross domestic product (GDP) 
of a country.
The Group monitors local and national markets to ensure ticket and concession 
prices remain a competitively priced form of entertainment. The Group invests in 
both the estate and technology to ensure customers receive a positive experience 
during every visit while getting value for money.
Consolidation 
of the industry
The cinema industry globally has recently seen an increase 
in acquisition activity and consolidation within the market. 
In 2016 AMC Entertainment acquired Odeon in the UK and 
the Nordic Cinema Group in Stockholm. In Europe, outside 
of the top four chains, the rest of the market is represented 
by smaller multiplex operators which only operate in one 
or two territories, and independent operators which are 
specific to local markets.
The Group’s strategy includes identifying potential profitable opportunities to grow 
and expand the business. This has included the acquisition of five Empire cinemas in 
the UK in 2016 and the Empire Newcastle cinema in 2017. 
Following completion of acquisition with Regal post year end the enlarged Group is 
now the second largest operator in the world (by number of screens). 
Cinematic 
window
There have been ongoing discussions for a number of 
years about the cinematic window, the period between the 
release of a film in a cinema and on any other platform.
A material reduction in the cinematic window could reduce 
the cinema admissions per capita.
There is no expectation that the current cinema window will significantly change 
in the near future, however, the Group continually monitors the status of this and 
regularly engages with the distributors to discuss this subject.

Our Business Model and Strategy
Creating long-term value
Our people
Our people are the face of our business. 
They are focused on ensuring that our 
customers feel more from the very start 
of their cinema experience. A well 
established training and development 
programme is used to maintain and 
continually improve standards.
Our trusted commercial relationships
Delivering a high quality film slate is 
one of the key external drivers of our 
business. While we do not have control 
over the content, our close and long 
standing relationships with the film 
distributors are fundamental to providing 
the best and most varied selection for 
our customers at the right time. Our 
brands are important to our commercial 
partners, helping to deepen our 
relationships with the film distributors, 
retail suppliers, advertisers and landlords.
Our financial strength
Focus on cost enables us to maintain 
healthy margins, which in turn drives the 
cash flow needed to continue to invest in 
and expand our estate. This continued 
investment ensures that we are able to 
reach as many customers as possible with 
the high quality experience we believe 
in. We manage investment in our estate 
in conjunction with the maintenance of 
a strong Balance Sheet, making the 
business financially secure, flexible and 
able to make returns to shareholders.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Risk Management
Supporting growth through 
effective risk management
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Operating as a cinema chain that is now 
in ten different territories presents a 
number of risks and uncertainties that 
continue to be the focus of the Board’s 
ongoing attention.
Risk Management Approach
The Group’s approach to risk management 
and internal control is designed to 
manage risk at all levels. Where possible, 
the Group has implemented appropriate 
mitigation strategies to reduce the 
overall risk exposure in line with the 
Board’s risk appetite. For further details 
please see the Group approach to risk 
management set out on pages 42 and 43. 
During the year the Group further 
strengthened the components of the 
Risk Management Framework with the 
introduction of an executive Risk 
Committee (consisting of the Deputy 
CEO, CFO, Head of Risk and Assurance 
and alternating business representatives) 
that meets quarterly. This has helped 
ensure that the risk profile remains 
up-to-date and accurately reflects the 
Group’s risk exposure.

Principal Risk Assessment
The Board has undertaken a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group during the year, including 
those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity. 
The time-frame horizon for consideration 
of the principal risks is aligned to the 
three year period used when considering 
the future viability of the Group. For 
further details please see the Group’s 
viability statement on page 22. 
The acquisition of Regal will have a direct 
impact on the principal risks of the 
enlarged Group over this time-frame 
horizon and therefore consideration is 
being given by the Board as to its impact 
on the existing principal risks and the 
requirement for any additional principal 
risks that should be added. 
Two examples of the additional risk 
factors being considered include: 
integration of the enlarged Group; 
and the economic and environment 
conditions of operating in the US.
In addition, the Board remains vigilant 
on the possible impact of Brexit, but 
currently does not believe the UK’s exit 
from the European Union will have a 
significant impact on the underlying 
trading performance of the Group going 
forward. This is on the basis that we 
do not trade across borders but within 
territories, we are an attractive place 
to work and therefore have many 
applications for roles, and the nature 
of our business has a proven consumer 
appeal throughout all economic cycles.
Appetite 
The Board undertook a formal annual 
review of risk appetite, ensuring that 
the view it has established for each of 
the principal risks reflects its current 
perspective and its willingness to accept 
risk in pursuit of the strategic objectives 
of the Group. For further details please 
see the Group approach to risk 
management set out on pages 42 and 43.
Viability
In addition, the Directors’ viability 
assessment has taken into consideration 
the potential impact of the principal risks 
in the business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity over the period, 
including principal mitigating actions 
such as reducing capital expenditure. 
More details about the viability 
assessment may be found on page 22.

Impact
Any critical system interruption for a 
sustained period could have a significant 
impact on the Group’s performance. In 
addition, any breach (cyber or otherwise) of 
data protection rules or security measures 
surrounding the storage of confidential and 
proprietary information (including movie 
content) could result in unauthorised 
access, loss or disclosure of this information. 
This could lead to claims, regulatory 
penalties, disruption of operations of the 
Group and ultimately reputational damage.
Impact
Underpinning the overall success of the 
Group is the quality of the movie slate, the 
timeliness of release, the release window 
and the appeal of such movies to our 
customers. Where the movie studios do 
not produce sufficiently attractive movies, 
or movies underperform, this has a direct 
impact on cinema attendance and, 
therefore, box office revenue for the Group 
may decline. 
Impact
Growth in the estate is dependent on the 
development of new sites or the acquisition 
of existing cinemas. Planning laws, the 
economic environment, availability of capital 
for developers and location choice are some 
of the factors that may impact the Group’s 
development and growth plans.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ The Group IT function monitors, 
manages and optimises our systems, 
including ensuring their resilience 
through regular back-ups and the 
implementation of security measures.
Æ Æ External experts are employed where 
necessary to oversee and help manage 
major projects involving the upgrading 
or replacement of key systems.
Æ Æ The Group continually reviews its 
approach to information security, 
specifically controlling the sensitive data 
it holds through restricted access.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ We work closely with distributors to 
acquaint ourselves, as early as possible, 
with the upcoming film slate in order to 
forecast likely movie performance. 
Æ Æ Although access to the latest movie slate 
is reliant on our relationship with the 
distributors, the Group’s strategy is to 
show a wide range of movies over and 
above the traditional Hollywood 
blockbusters. This allows us to capitalise 
on specific local area demand for type 
and content of movies shown.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ The Group devotes a considerable 
amount of time assessing new site 
opportunities as part of our future 
growth strategy.
Æ Æ We also maintain good relationships with 
potential key development partners. This 
allows us to be aware of the availability 
of space in new developments and to 
ensure factors such as local planning 
laws and demographic changes are 
understood and monitored.
Æ Æ Board approval is obtained for all new 
sites and significant refurbishments.
Changes in the year
Æ Æ The number of international cyber 
attacks has shown how all companies 
are vulnerable in the current climate. 
Although we have not experienced any 
breaches from these, cyber risk has been 
a Board focus throughout the year.
Æ Æ The impending introduction of the 
General Data Protection Regulation 
(“GDPR”) in 2018 has meant a review has 
been undertaken of all relevant systems, 
processes and procedures. To set out 
and monitor the journey to compliance 
a road map has been developed.
Changes in the year
Æ Æ The level of admissions in 2017 
has continued to demonstrate an 
undiminished appetite for cinema 
attendance. 
Æ Æ In the ROW territories locally produced 
movies continue to be very popular, 
often outperforming the Hollywood 
blockbusters, especially in Poland. 
Changes in the year
Æ Æ The Group grew the estate as a further 
nine new cinemas, four in the UK and five 
in the ROW, opened during the year.
Æ Æ In addition, the acquisition of Empire 
Newcastle has added a further 16 
screens.
Æ Æ Four smaller sites, originally scheduled 
for Q4 2017, will now open in early 2018.
Æ Æ The Group proactively managed 
its existing estate through the 
refurbishment and selective closure 
of certain sites. 
For further details please see the Chief 
Executive Officer’s Review on page 10.
Opportunity
Æ Æ Continuing the programme of 
investment in systems and ensuring our 
processes are robust will strengthen the 
day-to day operations across the Group.
Opportunity
Æ Æ There is a strong movie release 
programme for 2018 and therefore we 
expect these to drive continued growth 
in admissions.
Æ Æ The increase in geographic footprint will 
further enhance our ability to mitigate 
against year on year volatility to the 
individual cinema markets.
Opportunity
Æ Æ The acquisition of Regal will provide a 
platform for entering into a new territory 
and be transformational in terms of the 
growth in the estate.

Impact
Although cinema admissions are 
predominantly driven by the quality and 
availability of films, ensuring that the Group 
continually enhances the viewer experience 
is crucial. Any decrease in the quality of the 
services we offer, from the ease of booking 
and the technology we use to a friendly 
farewell on departure, could result in loss 
of customers to competitors and/or other 
leisure/entertainment attractions.
Impact
Retail/concession sales generally fluctuate 
in line with admissions and the genre of film 
on show. Therefore, if admissions were to 
fall, revenue from retail sales could 
decrease. Retail spend may also decrease 
due to changes in customer preferences, 
decreased disposable income or other 
economic and cultural factors. In addition, 
the cost of items such as energy and 
foodstuffs as well as the potential 
introduction of the Soft Drinks Industry 
Levy has a direct impact on price.
Impact
Operating cinemas well is pivotal to 
the overall success of the Group. Key to 
this is to ensure that cinema management 
understand the local market (film 
scheduling, pricing and retail offerings), 
effectively manage their employees, 
maintain service standards, and are able 
to react to incidents should they occur. 
A reduction in performance in any area can 
have a direct effect on the overall viewer 
experience, reputation of the cinemas and 
ultimately the Group’s financial performance.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ Our strategy is focused on continually 
improving the quality of services we 
offer to customers and making a visit 
to our cinemas a unique experience.
Æ Æ This includes increasing the efficiency 
of online booking, cutting edge cinema 
design, removing clutter from the foyers, 
investing in technical innovation and 
premium offerings (4DX and other large 
screen formats), upgrading seating 
options (further rollout of the VIP 
offering to 12 sites in total) and 
improving retail offers.
Æ Æ We also focus on our approach to 
customer interaction with the Group 
outside of the cinema environment.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ Through our ongoing monitoring of 
various metrics, including spend per 
person, we have the ability to 
understand and react quickly to the 
changing customer needs.
Æ Æ A key strategy for the Group is to 
maintain a strong relationship with 
the principal retail suppliers.
Æ Æ We run targeted promotions and bring 
in different ranges of products to meet 
changing customer demand.
Æ Æ The introduction of franchising models 
for some of the key suppliers has also 
been an important way of enhancing the 
range of offerings.
Æ Æ We are working closely with our drinks 
partners to reduce and where possible 
mitigate the potential impact of the 
proposed Soft Drinks Industry Levy. 
We are doing this by broadening our 
ranges of diet and sugar free options 
along with water and trialing innovation 
with reformulated products whilst 
still providing consumer choice based 
on preferences.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ Cinema management continually 
monitor their staffing requirements, 
making adjustments to scheduling based 
on customer demand, forecasts and film 
scheduling.
Æ Æ On a monthly basis detailed operational 
and financial reviews are undertaken by 
cinema management teams to ensure 
performance matches expected targets.
Æ Æ Ongoing evolution and updating 
of cinema operational processes 
and procedures. 
Changes in the year
Æ Æ Our investment in ensuring we can offer 
as many screen formats as possible 
continued with a further eleven 4DX 
screens, two IMAX screens and two 
Superscreens added across the Group 
during 2017.
Æ Æ The increasing popularity of our VIP 
offering across the twelve sites where 
it is available.
Changes in the year
Æ Æ Retail revenue remains a function of 
admissions and spending trends in each 
local market. This has been positively 
impacted by the expansion of the 
Group’s retail offerings including five 
new Starbucks and three new VIP sites. 
For further details see the Chief Executive 
Officer’s Review on page 10 and Financial 
Officer’s Review on page 26
Changes in the year
Æ Æ There is continual improvement in the 
operating effectiveness of the cinemas

Impact
The Group’s business and operations are 
affected by regulations covering such 
matters as planning, the environment, health 
and safety (cinemas and construction sites), 
licensing, food and drink retailing, data 
protection and the minimum wage. Failure 
to ensure ongoing compliance with 
regulation/legislation could result in fines 
and/or suspension of activity.
Impact
Although the overall strategy for the Group 
is not a complex one, it is key that this 
is executed.
Any diversion from this strategy could result 
in loss of market share to competitors, 
failure to capitalise on emerging market 
opportunities, reduction in potential 
revenue/profits and therefore loss in 
shareholder value.
Impact
The Group’s performance and its ability to 
mitigate significant risks within its control 
depend on its employees and Senior 
Management teams. Therefore, reliance 
is placed on the Group’s ability to recruit, 
develop and retain Senior Management and 
other key employees. If the Group loses key 
people this could have an impact on its 
ability to deliver business objectives.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ Management operate an ongoing 
cinema compliance programme, 
supplemented by independent 
compliance assurance reviews by 
external advisors where appropriate.
Æ Æ Group support functions use a 
combination of ongoing staff 
development as well as updates 
from professional advisors to ensure 
management are aware of the latest 
regulations in key areas.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ A structure is in place to support 
effective strategy development, as well 
as ongoing reporting and monitoring of 
business performance on a daily, weekly, 
monthly, quarterly and annual basis. 
Monitoring Senior Management 
performance against their agreed 
personal objectives is an ongoing exercise.
Æ Æ There are various communication 
strategies (emails, meetings and 
conferences) used to ensure the 
strategic goals of the Group are 
clearly understood and executed 
by Senior Management.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ To ensure the long-term success of the 
Group, it uses a variety of techniques to 
attract, retain and motivate its staff, with 
particular attention to those in key roles.
Æ Æ These techniques include the regular 
review of remuneration packages, share 
incentive schemes, training, regular 
communication with staff and an annual 
performance review process.
Æ Æ Nurturing talent across the Group is a key 
part of our strategy and, in support of that, 
internal succession plays a key part with 
more than 50% of cinema management 
positions filled by internal applicants.
Changes in the year
Æ Æ The results of our cinema compliance 
programmes, health and safety 
assessments and wider assurance 
activity continue to indicate no 
significant increase in risk exposure, 
with standards of compliance in all 
areas remaining high. 
Æ Æ One focus in the year has been on 
working towards compliance with GDPR 
that will be mandatory from May 2018. 
A combination of data audits and 
data mapping exercises have been 
undertaken across the Group to help 
prioritise key areas for improvement. 
For further details please see Risk Management 
and Internal Controls section pages 42 and 43.
Changes in the year
Æ Æ On 28 February 2018 the Group 
completed the acquisition of Regal. The 
enlarged Group is now a global cinema 
exhibition business of significant scale. 
Changes in the year
Æ Æ There have been a number of additional 
Senior Vice Presidents promoted and/or 
recruited to help support the expanded 
Executive Management Team.
Æ Æ As the requirements for individuals with 
specific skills and experience becomes 
more focused, recruitment of the level of 
talent required has been a challenge for 
some departments.
For further details please see Resources and 
Relationships on page 23.
Opportunity
Æ Æ Continue the evolution of our approach 
to managing compliance to ensure it is 
embedded in our day-to-day operations 
and therefore ensures efficient processes 
and procedures.
Opportunity
Æ Æ Continual focus on and review of 
strategy ensures the Board are well 
placed to assess value adding 
opportunities as they arise.
Æ Æ The acquisition of Regal has resulted 
in the enlarged Group becoming the 
second largest operator in the world 
(by number of screens).
Opportunity
Æ Æ As the Group grows there are increasing 
opportunities for further internal 
promotion, and transfers.

Impact
Maintaining corporate governance 
standards and an effective and efficient 
risk management and internal control 
system, proportionate to the needs of 
the Group, is a key part of short and 
long-term success. Any failure and/or 
weakness in this area (financial and 
non-financial) could have an impact 
on the efficient and effective operations 
of the Group.
Impact
Cinema businesses could be affected 
by civil unrest or terrorist acts/threats, 
resulting in the public avoiding going 
to the cinema. The Group may be 
subject to an increased risk of 
boycott, targeted civil unrest or 
terrorist action/threat as a result 
of operating in and being linked to 
certain countries or types of film. 
This could adversely impact the 
financial performance of the Group.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ The Group uses various mechanisms 
to support the implementation and 
effectiveness of controls.
Æ Æ These include:
 — implementation of the Group Risk 
Management Framework;
 — ongoing self-assessment process 
for monitoring cinema 
compliance and financial control 
standards;
 — regular consultation and advice 
from external advisors;
 — a risk-based cinema compliance 
and financial control audit 
programme;
 — the delivery of targeted risk-
based internal audit reviews; and
 — the use of technology for live 
forensic monitoring.
Mitigation activity
Æ Æ We receive communications from 
relevant government authorities 
and law enforcement agencies 
which keep us informed and allow 
us, when needed, to monitor any 
potential impact external events 
could have on the security of our 
cinema estate.
Æ Æ Should an incident occur at one 
of the Group’s sites, business 
continuity and disaster recovery 
plans are in place to ensure that 
management can react 
appropriately.
Æ Æ Appropriate insurance is in place 
to mitigate the financial 
consequences.
Changes in the year
Æ Æ Continued evolution of the Group’s 
risk management programme and 
the delivery of supporting assurance 
activity are providing ongoing 
improvements to the overall system 
of internal control.
For further details please see Risk 
Management and Internal Control report 
on pages 42 and 43.

Viability Statement
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of the 
enlarged Group over a period longer than one year, 
taking into account the Group’s current position, the 
recent acquisition of Regal and the potential impact of 
the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 
19 to 22. 
The Directors have determined that a three year 
period from the date of approving the financial 
statements constitutes an appropriate period over 
which to provide its viability statement. Three years 
was determined based on the visibility of the future 
film slate, the enlarged Group’s property expansion 
and renovation plans, investment in technology and 
relationships with the film distributors. 
The Group’s business model and strategy, which are 
not expected to change significantly as a result of the 
Regal acquisition, other than to be implemented in the 
US following the completion of acquisition, are central 
to an understanding of the Group’s prospects, and 
details can be found on pages 14 to 15. The nature of 
the enlarged Group’s activities are long-term and the 
business model is open-ended. The Group’s current 
overall strategy has been in place for several years, 
subject to the ongoing monitoring and development. 
The Directors’ viability assessment has taken into 
consideration the potential impacts of the principal 
risks in the business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity over the period, including 
principal mitigating actions such as reducing capital 
expenditure and dividend payments. For the purpose 
of assessing the enlarged Group’s viability, the 
Directors identified that, of the principal risks detailed 
on pages 19 to 22 are the most important to the 
assessment of the viability of the enlarged Group: 
availability and performance of film content, viewer 
experience and competition, and the expansion and 
growth of our cinema estate.
Based on the principal risks identified above, scenario 
based assessments were performed for the enlarged 
Group. The scenarios applied included: 
Æ Æ reducing both admissions, as a result of lack of film 
content/or increased competition through the 
emergence of new technology or alternative 
formats to watch movies,
Æ Æ reducing average ticket price, as a result of lack 
of film content, and/or increased competition 
through the emergence of new technology 
or alternative formats to watch movies,
Æ Æ no further expansion of the cinema estate, and 
Æ Æ a combination of the above. 
In performing the scenario assessments the enlarged 
Group would still be able to continue to meet its 
day-to-day liabilities as they fall due over the three 
year period. 
Whilst this review does not consider all of the risks 
that the enlarged Group may face, the Directors 
consider that the scenario-based assessment 
prepared on the enlarged Group’s prospects is 
reasonable in the circumstances given the inherent 
uncertainty involved. 
The Directors believe the risk management and 
internal control systems in place allow them to 
monitor the key variables that have the ability to 
impact the liquidity and the solvency of the enlarged 
Group and are confident that management are able 
to sufficiently mitigate certain situations should they 
arise. Mitigating actions that could be taken include 
reducing capital expenditure, reducing dividend 
payments and reducing variable costs.
Based on this robust assessment, and having considered 
the established and expected controls for the risks and 
the available mitigating actions, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
enlarged Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period.

Resources and Relationships
Our business model and strategy 
are underpinned by key resources 
and relationships

Our 12 Ethical Principles 
Introduction
The Group’s key relationships are 
with our customers, our people, our 
commercial partners and our wider 
communities. How we behave and 
interact with each of these parties 
reflects on our reputation, which is a 
key asset underpinning the successful 
delivery of our strategy.
Our Group policy on ethics seeks to 
guide the behaviour of our people by 
specifying 12 principles which establish 
common values through which we do 
business. We strive to ensure that we 
act in appropriate ways to maintain 
and enhance our reputation. The Group 
seeks to act with honesty and integrity 
in its dealings with customers, 
employees, shareholders, regulators, 
suppliers and our wider community.
Health and safety is of major importance 
to us when considering the day-to-day 
health, safety and welfare of our 
customers, employees and contractors. 
With over 100 million customer visits 
a year and over 10,000 employees, the 
Group seeks to maintain the highest 
standards in the effective management 
of our health and safety obligations, 
and our duty of care to our customers 
and staff.
Each year, every cinema in the Group is 
subject to health and safety assessments 
(including aspects of fire, food and 
occupational). Results are compared 
year on year and any significant issues 
are followed up with the assistance of 
specialist external consultants where 
needed. Overall, the results have shown 
that standards remain high. All incidents 
are logged, investigated and action 
taken, where appropriate, to ensure 
that the chances of a reoccurrence are 
reduced as far as reasonably possible.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Resources and Relationships continued
to employees. These include 
Whistleblowing, Gifts and Hospitality, 
and Health and Safety. The Group fully 
supports the requirements of the UK 
Bribery Act as well as similar legislation in 
all its business regions. The company has 
implemented policies and procedures 
to ensure it is prepared, to the extent 
possible, to prevent and deter corrupt 
practices across our business 
relationships (including an Anti-Fraud 
Policy, a Whistleblowing Policy, an Ethics 
Policy, and a Policy for the Acceptance of 
Gifts). The Group maintains such policies 
and procedures which assist its 
businesses in monitoring and preventing 
potential Bribery and Corruption and in 
dealing with such practices appropriately 
if they are discovered. The Group 
endeavours to conduct its business with 
integrity, and aims to be a responsible 
employer and adopt values and standards 
designed to help guide our staff in their 
conduct and business relationships.
Our Customers
Our customers are fundamental to our 
success. We focus on providing them 
with a wide variety of movie genres, as 
well as a choice of how to watch the 
movie in modern state-of-the-art 
cinemas with the latest technology and a 
variety of retail offerings, all underpinned 
by great customer service. 
We also have initiatives which aim to 
extend the relationship with the customer 
beyond a single visit. In the UK, we have 
the long established Unlimited 
membership service for a fixed monthly 
(or annual) subscription enabling 
customers to watch as many 2D films as 
they wish. This scheme was successfully 
extended to Poland at the end of 2015. 
We also have a number of other 
membership schemes across the UK and 
other territories which offer discounts 
and allow us to interact frequently with 
our customer base.
As many of our customers still associate 
going to the cinema as a treat or special 
occasion, they expect traditional cinema 
snacks as part of their experience. 
However, we offer a range of products 
to our customers, and we work closely 
with our partners to provide healthier 
alternatives where appropriate. We 
ensure that we provide good nutrition 
and allergen advice to enable our 
customers to make informed choices, 
with the latter also being available on our 
website. At our Picturehouse circuit, the 
food and drink proposition is more akin 
to that found in restaurants and closely 
tailored to the audience to which it 
caters. A wide range of snacks and 
meals are available, many of which 
include ingredients sourced from local 
producers and suppliers.
Event cinema screenings bring a wider 
range of content to our customers, 
enabling our audiences to see live 
shows taking place around the world. 
Operating in this way supports such 
productions, making them more 
commercially viable, accessible to more 
people and, in turn, brings more people 
to the cinema and, frequently, a different 
type of customer.
The Group actively encourages our 
future film-going audience by 
specifically tailoring film schedules 
to attract families and young people. 
Where necessary, these performances 
are dubbed into the native language to 
ensure that all customers can enjoy the 
full cinema experience. Concessionary 
rates are offered for senior citizens and 
students at certain times of the day. 
Throughout the Group, all national 
regulators’ film classification guidelines 
are followed, unless the local regulators 
require otherwise. In some of our 
territories, there are no classification 
guidelines, and in such cases we provide 
information to customers about films so 
they can make informed choices about 
the type of film being shown. We also 
ensure that all trailers are complementary 
in terms of suitability to the main feature.
The Group promotes a philosophy of 
access for all by offering accessible 
cinemas for the disabled that show a 
wide range of films and event cinema. 
Employees receive disability awareness 
training and specific advice on 
welcoming disabled customers. Many 
of our cinemas offer audio-descriptive, 
autism-friendly and subtitled 
performances, and in some territories, 
the Group allows customers with 
disabilities to be accompanied by a carer, 
free of charge. All new cinemas are 
designed to exceed current statutory 
requirements and to provide buildings 
which are technically advanced, 
accessible and safe.
When cinemas undergo major 
refurbishment as part of an ongoing 
programme of improvements and 
renovations, the opportunity is taken to 
enhance access within cinemas where 
practicable to do so.
Our People
Once again, 2017 saw considerable 
investment and focus in a number of 
people related areas.
We continued to focus on the whole 
area of reward and, yet again, we made 
considerable investment in pay and 
bonus schemes meaning our rates of pay 
are among the highest in the industry 
and above all statutory minimums.
We restructured our cinema leadership 
teams which enabled us to further 
increase our customer focus, while 
also ensuring our people have more 
meaningful roles and increased rewards. 
These changes allowed over 500 
employees to move from zero hours 
contracts to fully contracted hours.
We rolled out a new Human Resources 
system which has amongst its features 
a self-serve facility. Each one of our 
Cineworld UK employees now has more 
control over their personal details and 
quicker access to key information such 
as hours and pay. The implementation 
included a mobile platform to ensure 
the system was accessible to our ever 
more “tech savvy” workforce. We are 
continuing to develop this platform to

means that Cineworld retains its most 
talented people. In 2017, we saw 21 
BeMore candidates promoted or 
transferred to more complex cinemas. 
Our 24 month apprenticeship programme 
has gone from strength to strength since 
its introduction in 2013. It aims to 
promote the cinema industry as a viable 
career option and it attracts school 
leavers who are not in full-time education 
and are looking for an alternative route to 
pursuing a career. In 2017, we saw one of 
our apprentices, Zoe Simpson, shortlisted 
for the Retail Week Rising Stars Awards 
where she achieved runner-up, winning 
the ‘Mark of Excellence’ Award in the 
Above & Beyond category. 
We are also very proud of Ranjeet 
Nanrah and Raymond Prkye who were 
part of the first apprentice cohort in 2013 
and are the first apprentices to become 
Cinema Managers in 2017. 
In summary, we strive for excellence in 
our approach to attracting, retaining and 
developing our people because we 
recognise they are vital to ongoing 
business success. 
Diversity and Human Rights
The Group is an equal opportunity 
employer and seeks to recruit, retain 
and promote staff on the basis of 
their qualifications, skills, aptitude and 
attitude. A wide range of applicants 
are encouraged to apply for all roles. 
In employment related decisions, the 
business complies with all relevant 
legislation, including that specifically 
targeted at preventing discrimination, 
and such principles are embedded 
through the business by requisite policies.
Our Commercial Relationships
As well as our customers, having strong 
commercial relationships is key to 
operating our business successfully. 
With years of experience in the cinema 
industry our teams have worked hard to 
develop strong working relationships 
with a range of film studios and 
distributors, both major and independent.
Our focus on driving cinema admissions 
and on providing our customers with a 
wide range of movies has resulted in 
many opportunities for us to work with 
film studios on simplifying the film 
buying process and on promoting 
smaller films to a wider audience. We 
also work closely with industry bodies, 
including the Film Content Protection 
Agency (“FCPA”), to combat film piracy. 
During 2017 the Group awarded a total 
of 19 out of a possible 35 awards from the 
FCPA, demonstrating our dedication to 
the UK’s theatrical protection programme.
The Group is committed to protecting 
the intellectual property rights of films 
and event cinema. Policies and 
procedures are constantly reviewed 
and developed to ensure cinema 
management are able to effectively 
monitor and prevent film piracy. 
Night-vision technology is utilised and 
there is an increased vigilance around 
high profile titles which are particularly 
vulnerable. The Group will continue to 
work closely with relevant industry and 
law enforcement organisations in order 
to help reduce and prevent film piracy.
Building relationships with developers, 
landlords and local planners is very 
important to be able to ensure we can 
maintain an appropriate pipeline of new 
sites for the future and undertake our 
refurbishment programme. 
We also work very closely with suppliers 
of technological enhancements, for 
instance IMAX and 4DX, which enables 
us to ensure that we are delivering the 
best possible experience to our 
customers, as well as looking to 
maximise box office revenues.
Strong relationships with our principal 
retail suppliers enable us to work 
together on promotions that help drive 
retail sales. We seek to manage 
relationships with our suppliers fairly, 
and to work in accordance with our 
aspirations as set out in our ethical policy.
During the year we worked with a variety 
of partners to deliver a wide range of 
educational screenings and talks for 
primary and secondary schools and 
community groups which are further 
detailed below. 
Our Communities
Our work with charities, schools and 
community groups across all our 
territories is very important to us. We are 
involved with a wide range of activities 
including working with distributors on 
charity screenings, providing free shows 
for organisations and working closely 
with local schools and organisations.
In 2017, for the second year, Cineworld 
partnered with BBC’s Children in Need 
initiative, where as a team we raised 
£450,000. 
Examples of the programmes we run 
are: Saturday morning Kids’ Club 
Screenings, Toddler Time, Autism 
Friendly Screenings, Dementia Friendly 
Screenings, Adult Education and our 
Schools Programme. 
The Group also works as a venue partner 
for numerous film festivals. While many 
are well known and high profile, in certain 
territories the Group sponsors festivals 
showcasing local film producers’ work 
and runs short film competitions for 
students encouraging the development 
of future talent. This involvement once 
again helps to promote the Group’s 
brands through the wider film industry.
We seek to comply with all relevant 
environmental legislation and to operate 
in an environmentally sensitive manner. 
The Directors acknowledge the impact 
that the business has on the environment 
and seek to mitigate it. Often changes 
which help to mitigate our environmental 
impact also reduce our operating costs.
Being a multisite business, the Group is 
conscious of its total energy consumption 
and amount of waste materials 
generated and is actively working on 
reducing both. The Group’s mandatory 
greenhouse gas report can be found in 
the Directors’ Report on pages 68 to 72.
Our cinema websites enable e-tickets 
to be purchased and used, avoiding 
the need to print tickets. In new and 
refurbished cinemas, poster cases are 
now digital reducing the need to deliver, 
install, and ultimately throw away large 
paper posters. All these efforts help 
to reduce our use of resources and 
carbon footprint.
“ The skills I gained from the apprenticeship gave me the 
confidence to apply for a supervisor position and progress 
within the Company. After being a Supervisor for over a year 
I was then put on the BeMore programme at Wembley. At the 
start of 2017 I transferred over to Hemel Hempstead where I 
worked closely with the Deputy General Manager and General 
Manager in developing my skills to become a Cinema Manager. 
By constantly pushing myself and using the skills I had gained 
from the apprenticeship and my experience as a supervisor. 
I was promoted to a Cinema Manager – I firmly believe 
the apprenticeship was successful in helping forge my 
Cineworld career.”

Delivering 
strong growth
“ The Group Adjusted 
EBITDA increased by 
12.7% to £198.2m”
office revenues of 6.4%. Spend per 
person increased by 7.6% to £2.12 
resulting in retail revenue growth of 11.1%. 
Other revenues increased by 5.4%.
The principal income for the Group is 
box office revenue. Box office revenue is 
a function of the number of admissions 
and the ticket price per admission, less 
VAT. In addition, the Group operates 
membership schemes which provide 
customers with access to screening 
in exchange for subscriptions fees, and 
this revenue is also reported as part of 
box office. Admissions (one of our key 
performance indicators) depend on 
the number, timing and popularity 
of the movies we are able to show in 
our cinemas.
Admissions are also a key driver for the 
two other main revenues for the Group. 
These are retail revenue, the sale of food 
and drink for consumption within our 
cinemas, and screen advertising income, 
from advertisements shown on our 
screens prior to feature presentations.
UK and Ireland
The results for the UK and Ireland 
include the two cinema chain brands 
in the UK, Cineworld and Picturehouse, 
and also include the six Empire cinemas 
acquired (five sites were acquired in 2016 
and one in 2017). 
Box Office
Box office revenue represented 65.8% 
(2016: 65.6%) of total revenues for the 
UK and Ireland. Admissions in the year 
increased by 2.3%, which is reflective of 
the movie slate as well as the additional 
cinemas acquired and opened in 2016 
and 2017. The increased admissions 
combined with an increase in the 
average ticket price of 4.1% this resulted 
in total revenue growth of 6.5%. This is a 
pleasing result as admissions in the UK 
and Ireland cinema industry as a whole 
were up only 1.4% during the same 
period (Source: UK Cinema Association).
The overall box office performance in 
2017 was underpinned by a strong film 
slate, despite a weaker Q3 compared 
with 2016. In 2017, in the UK overall, 
the top three films grossed £197.4m 
(“Beauty and the Beast” – £72.4m, 
“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” – £68.3m and 
“Dunkirk” – £56.7m) compared with the 
top three films in 2016 which grossed 
£149.4m (“Star Wars: Rogue One” – 
£50.7m, “Fantastic Beasts and Where

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 to Find Them” – £50.6m and “Bridget 
Jones’s Baby” – £48.1m). 
The average ticket price achieved in the 
UK and Ireland increased to £6.51 (2016: 
£6.25). The increase in average ticket 
price was in part due to price rises 
during the period, but is mainly reflective 
of the continued expansion and 
popularity of premium offerings and 
a result of the renovation programme 
we started three years ago. The most 
popular IMAX films during the year were 
“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and “Dunkirk” 
and 4DX films were “Star Wars: The Last 
Jedi” and “The Fate and the Furious”.
Retail
Food and drink sales are the second 
most important source of revenue and 
represented 24.0% (2016: 23.8%) of total 
revenues for the UK and Ireland. Total 
retail revenues in the UK and Ireland 
were £125.8m (2016: £117.5m) increasing 
by 7.1%.
Net retail spend per admission increased 
by 4.4% in the year to £2.37 (2016: 
£2.27). This was partly due to the film 
mix, but predominantly reflects the 
expansion of our cinemas’ retail 
offerings, strong promotions and 
operational improvements. A further 
five Starbucks outlets were opened 
during the year taking the total to 
29 at 31 December 2017. 
Other Income
Other Income includes all revenue 
streams other than box office and retail 
and represents 10.2% (2016: 10.6%) of 
total revenue. It increased to £53.7m 
(2016: £52.5m) and grew by 2.3%.
The largest single element of other 
income is screen advertising revenue. 
Screen advertising revenue is earned 
through our shareholding in Digital 
Cinema Media Limited (“DCM”), our joint 
venture screen advertising business. 
DCM’s primary function is to sell 
advertising time on cinema screens on 
behalf of the UK cinema industry. It also 
engages in related promotional work 
between advertisers and cinemas. 
Screen advertising revenue varies 
depending on the type of films screened, 
the number of minutes and value of 
advertising sold, the number of 
attendees who view the film and the 
placement of advertisements in relation 
to the start of the film. As a result of 
the nature of the film slate and the 
admissions levels in 2017 the advertising 
revenues were higher than in 2016. In 
February 2017 the Group disposed of a 
small element of the Group’s distribution 
arm in Picturehouse. This distribution 
income is recorded in other income and 
therefore has reduced the overall growth 
from the prior period. Also included 
within other income is the online booking 
fee. The trend towards booking online 
continues with more than half of tickets 
now purchased online. 
Rest of the World
The results for the ROW include the 
cinema chain brands – Cinema City 
in the Central and Eastern Europe 
territories and Yes Planet and Rav-Chen 
in Israel. The information is presented on 
a constant currency basis to provide 
information on a comparable basis 
unless otherwise stated.
Box Office
Box office revenue represented 57.0% 
(2016: 58.2%) of total revenues for the 
ROW. Admissions in the year increased 
by 4.7%, and average ticket prices 
increased on a constant currency basis 
to £4.11 resulting in an overall increase in 
box office revenues of 8.2%. Admissions 
growth was achieved in Poland, 
Romania, Israel and Slovakia. Admissions 
have increased in these territories as a 
result of the opening of new sites in the 
prior and current year, investment in the 
latest technologies, the strong film slate 
for the period and the growth in the local 
economies. Hungary experienced a 
slight decline in admissions as a result of 
two site closures, one in the period and 
one in the prior year, however on a like 
for like basis growth was achieved. There 
were marginal declines in admissions in 
Bulgaria and Czech Republic due to the 
nature of the movie slate and the higher 
base in 2016. 
The average ticket price increase has 
been driven by a mixture of expanding 
our premium offerings, inflationary price 
increases alongside the growth of the 
local economies and the movie slate. 
Movie performance was underpinned by 
the success of films that also performed 
strongly in the UK such as “Star Wars: 
The Last Jedi” and “Beauty and the 
Beast” as well a locally produced movies 
which continued to be popular 
particularly in Poland where “Listy Do 
Movie 3” and “Botoks” were the top 
performing movies for the year.
Food and drink sales are the second 
most important source of revenue and 
represent 25.8% (2016: 24.11%) of total 
revenues for the ROW. Total retail 
revenues were £94.6m (2016: £73.3m) 
increasing by 18.7%.
Retail spend per admission increased 
by 13.4% to £1.86 (2016: £1.64 
constant currency). The increase was 
predominantly driven by the film mix 
and growth of the local economies but 
also the expansion of offerings, with 
three new VIP sites, one in Israel – 
Zichron, and two in Poland – Chodov 
and Wroclaw, as well as ongoing 
operational improvements.
Other Income
Other income includes distribution, 
advertising and other revenues and 
represents 17.2% (2016: 17.7%) of the total 
revenues. Forum Film is the Group’s film 
distribution business for the ROW. 
Forum Film operates across the ROW 
region and distributes films on behalf 
of major Hollywood studios as well as 
owning the distribution rights to certain 
independent movies. New Age Media is 
the Group’s advertising and sponsorship 
arm for the ROW. The main driver for the 
overall increase in other income was the 
advertising revenue which performed 
very strongly in 2017, predominantly as a 
result of the increase in admissions. The 
distribution revenues were broadly inline 
year on year. 
The following commentary focuses on 
Group profitability, cash flow and the 
Statement of Financial Position except 
where stated.
Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Profit
Overall, the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA 
increased by 12.7% to £198.2m (2016: 
£175.8m). the Adjusted EBITDA margin 
remained broadly consistent with the 
prior year at 22.3% (2016: 22.0%).

Adjusted EBITDA generated by the UK 
and Ireland increased by 2.7% during the 
year to £99.7m (2016: £97.1m). The UK 
and Ireland Adjusted EBITDA margin 
of 19.0% represented a 0.7 percentage 
point decline from 2016, largely as a 
result of no Virtual Print Fee (“VPF”) 
income during the year and increases 
in business rates. Adjusted EBITDA 
generated by the ROW increased by 
25.2% to £98.5m (2016: £78.7m). The 
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.9% 
represented a 1.0 percentage point 
improvement from 2016, predominantly 
driven from the increase in admissions, 
growing economies and higher retail 
spend per person and our continued 
efforts on cost management. 
As the Group operates in nine territories, 
it is exposed to exchange rate 
fluctuations. Wherever possible, cash 
income and expenditure are settled in 
local currency to mitigate exchange 
losses. However, there are translation 
exchange differences arising when 
presenting the year on year performance 
of the ROW in the reporting currency of 
the Group.
Operating profit of £128.2m was 
13.7% higher than the prior year (2016: 
£112.8m). Operating profit included a 
number of non-trade related items that 
have a net negative impact of £1.9m 
(2016: £4.4m). These primarily related 
to the following:
Æ Æ Transaction and reorganisation costs 
of £7.8m (2016: £1.5m) – £3.6m 
related to the UK operations 
restructuring and redundancy costs 
(2016: £0.8m), £0.6m of cost was 
incurred on the acquisition of the 
six Empire cinemas (2016: £0.5m), 
and £2.8m (2016: £nil) incurred 
with respect to the acquisition 
of Regal and £0.8m (2016: £nil) of 
costs in respect of the termination 
of contracts. 
Æ Æ A charge of £1.3m (2016: net credit 
£1.5m) primarily relating to a change 
in trading assumptions for specific 
onerous lease provisions. 
Æ Æ A one-off gain of £2.0m relating to 
the profit on disposal of Picturehouse 
Entertainment of £1.8m and the gain 
on the transfer of Haymarket of 
£0.2m (2016: £nil).
Æ Æ A net credit in relation to impairments 
of £5.2m (2016: net credit of £0.4m) 
– £5.6m related to the writeback 
of capital expenditure for sites 
previously impaired where 
performance has improved and 
£0.4m related to the write off of 
capital expenditure for sites which 
were not performing satisfactorily. 
Æ Æ There are no one-off costs in 2017 
related to the MGM defined benefit 
pension scheme buyout which 
occurred in 2016 (2016: £4.8m). 
The total depreciation and amortisation 
charge (included in administrative 
expenses) in the year totalled £68.1m 
(2016: £58.6m). Of this, £32.8m related 
to depreciation and amortisation in the 
UK and Ireland (2016: £28.9m) and 
£35.3m related to depreciation and 
amortisation in the ROW (2016: £29.7m). 
The increase year on year is 
predominantly due to the additional 
number of sites in the Group and the 
foreign exchange in the ROW. 
Finance Costs
On 29 July 2015 the Group signed an 
amendment and extension to its existing 
banking facility which was effective 
immediately upon signing and extends 
the facility to June 2020. As a result, the 
term loans were reduced from £157.5m 
and £126.0m to £130.0m and £63.0m 
respectively. In August 2016 the Group 
extended the single currency revolving 
credit facility of £190.0m to £215.0m to 
partly fund the Empire acquisition.
At 31 December 2017 the facility 
remained subject to the existing two 
covenants: the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA 
(as defined in Note 1 to the financial 
statements) to net debt and the ratio 
of EBITDAR (pre-rent EBITDA) to net 
finance charges. A margin, determined 
by the results of the covenant tests at 
a given date, is added to LIBOR or 
EURIBOR. The margins applicable to the 
Group were 1.40% on the term loans and 
1.15% on the revolving credit facility.
The Group has hedging arrangements in 
place to mitigate the potential risk of a 
material impact arising from interest rate 
fluctuations. At 31 December 2017, the 
Group had three (2016: seven) interest 
rate swaps, two GBP denominated 
swaps which hedged 81% (2016: 82%) of 
the Group’s variable rate GBP unsecured 
term loan, and one Euro denominated 
swap hedging 83% (2016: 100%) of the 
Euro denominated unsecured loan. Net 
financing costs totalled £7.8m during the 
year (2016: £14.6m) which is a net 
decrease of £6.8m. In the prior year 
there was a £6.1m negative impact on 
foreign exchange, primarily relating to 
the translation of the Euro term loan at 
the Balance Sheet date. In the second 
half of 2016 the Group entered into a net 
investment hedge in respect of the Euro 
term loan and the gains and losses are 
now recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income, in line with current 
accounting practice and standards.
Finance income of £2.0m (2016: £3.0m) 
included a gain of £1.3m (2016: £1.9m) 
primarily from foreign exchange gains 
on monetary assets and £0.7m (2016: 
£0.7m) related to interest income. As the 
defined benefit pension scheme was 
bought out by Aviva at the end of 2016 
there was no finance income on assets 
held by defined benefit pension schemes 
(2016: £0.4m).

amortisation of prepaid finance costs of 
£1.5m (2016: £1.4m) and £1.4m (2016: 
£1.7m) in respect of the unwind of 
discount and interest charges on 
property related leases.
Taxation
The overall tax charge during the year 
was £19.9m giving an overall effective 
tax rate of 16.5% (2016: 16.5%).The 
consistent rate reflects the Group’s 
geographical mix of profits. The 
corporation tax charge in respect of the 
current year was £24.1m (2016: £16.5m) 
and the deferred tax credit was (£2.6m) 
(2016: £1.3m charge), resulting in a 
current year effective tax rate of 17.9% 
(2016: 17.8%). The deferred tax credit 
principally related to movements on 
temporary differences relating to 
fixed assets, intangible assets and 
employee benefits. 
In the medium term we expect our 
effective tax rate to remain at a similar 
level for the existing markets in which 
we operated at 31 December 2017. 
The Group takes a responsible attitude 
to tax, recognising that it affects all of 
our stakeholders. The Group seeks at all 
times to comply with the law in each of 
the jurisdictions in which we operate, 
and to build open and transparent 
relationships with those jurisdictions’ tax 
authorities. The Group’s tax strategy 
is aligned with commercial activities 
of the business, and within our overall 
governance structure the governance of 
tax and tax risk is given a high priority by 
the Board.
Earnings
Profit on ordinary activities after tax for 
the year was £100.6m (2016: £82.0m). 
The profit after tax has increased as a 
result of the growth in Adjusted EBITDA, 
partly netted by the increase in 
depreciation and amortisation charges in 
the year, the reduction year on year of 
the one-off items and the overall 
reduction in net finance costs. 
The rights adjusted basic earnings per 
share amounted to 16.4p (2016: 13.7p). 
Eliminating the one-off, non-trade 
related items described above (totalling 
£7.0m within operating profit), 
amortisation of intangibles of £5.1m, 
transaction and reorganisation costs of 
£7.8m, the profit on disposals of £2.0m, 
the net impairment reversal of £5.2m 
and the onerous lease charge of £1.3m, 
the rights adjusted, adjusted diluted 
earnings per share were 17.3p (2016: 15.4p).
Business Combinations
On 15 June 2017 the Group completed 
the acquisition of the Empire Newcastle 
cinema from Cinema Holdings Limited 
by means of an acquisition of 100% of 
the shares. Cash consideration was paid 
on acquisition and there is also an 
element of contingent consideration to 
be paid based on the performance of 
the site over a 24 month period post 
completion of the refurbishment.
Disposals
On 7 February 2017 the Group sold 
100% of the shares in Picturehouse 
Entertainment Limited, a Company 
which operated an element of the 
Group’s distribution arm in the UK. 
The consideration received was £2.0m, 
resulting in a gain on disposal of £1.8m.
Balance Sheet
Overall, net assets have increased by 
£112.0m, to £775.4m since 31 December 
2016. This is due to the acquisition of the 
Empire Newcastle cinema with net 
assets of £10.3m, movements in other 
non-current assets of £82.2m, which 
predominantly relates to the foreign 
currency gains on translation and the 
opening of new sites, refurbishments 
completed during the year and 
movements in other net liabilities 
and current assets of £18.9m.
Cash Flow and Net Debt
The Group continued to be cash 
generative at the operating level. Total 
net cash generated from operations in 
the year was £172.8m (2016: £150.1m). 
Net cash spent on investing activities 
during the year was £110.7m (2016: 
£130.3m), £7.0m for the acquisition 
of the Empire Newcastle cinemas, 
£106.2m on the development of new 
sites, refurbishments and technology, 
£2.0m was received from the proceeds 
of the disposal of Picturehouse 
Entertainment Limited and £0.6m 
related to interest received.
Net debt decreased by £4.0m to 
£278.3m at 31 December 2017 (2016: 
£282.3m). The main movements were 
due to the repayments during the year 
on the term loans (net of foreign 
exchange movements), of £7.5m, net 
cash inflows of £11.2m (net of foreign 
exchange movements) an additional 
finance lease liability of £0.9m and fair 
value gains in respect of financial 
instruments of £1.2m. Net debt at the 
year end represented 1.4 times the 
rolling 12 month Adjusted EBITDA figure 
for the Group.
Dividends
The Board has proposed a final dividend 
of 15.4p per share (3.1p on a rights 
adjusted basis), in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2017. The interim 
dividend of 6.0p per share was paid in 
September 2017. The record date for the 
final dividend is 8 June 2018 and the 
payment date will be 6 July 2018.
Post Balance Sheet Events
On 5 December 2017, the Group 
announced the acquisition of Regal by 
means of an acquisition of the entire 
issued, and to be issued, share capital of 
Regal. The acquisition was based on an 
implied enterprise value of US$5.8bn. 
Due to the size of the acquisition it was 
classed as a reverse takeover under the 
UK Listing Rules. The acquisition of 
Regal completed on 28 February 2018. 
Consideration for the acquisition of 
$3.4bn was settled fully in cash, funded 
by the proceeds of the fully underwritten 
rights issue at the rights issue price of 
157.0p per New Ordinary Share, which 
raised £1.7bn plus an additional US$4.1bn 
was raised through committed Debt 
Facilities. The restructured debt 
arrangement consists of a USD and 
Euro term loan totalling $4.1bn and 
a $300.0m revolving credit facility. 
The previous financing arrangements 
in place as at 31 December 2017 for the 
Group and Regal have been terminated 
and superseded with the new financing 
arrangements from 28 February 2018.
As the consideration was entirely paid 
in cash the acquisition is expected to 
be accounted for as an acquisition under 
IFRS 3 rather than as a reverse takeover 
acquisition under IFRS 3, notwithstanding 
the size of the acquisition.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Chairman’s Introduction to Governance
“ As we embark on this 
exciting new chapter 
following the successful 
acquisition of Regal, good 
governance will remain 
a key focus going forward”
A strong and effective 
governance structure
Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to present the Corporate 
Governance Statement for 2017.
One of our core objectives is ensuring 
that we make good governance an 
essential part of our corporate culture. 
It supports the implementation of our 
strategy, helps ensure we can meet 
our business goals, and provides the 
foundation for creating long-term value 
for shareholders. 
Good governance is a discipline that 
is particularly important during times 
of growth and, as we embark on this 
exciting new chapter for the Group, 
following the successful acquisition 
of Regal, it will remain a key focus 
going forward.
However, strong corporate governance 
is only part of the equation for success. It 
must be underpinned by a sound culture, 
and how we “get things done”, how 
our people act in their day-to-day roles, 
is a matter that is of importance to 
the Board. It is important for the Board 
to understand how our people feel 
about working for the Company, and 
what they think we could do better. 
So I am very pleased to report that our 
employee engagement survey for 2017 
showed that employee engagement 
across the circuit continued to increase. 
We know from previous tracking that 
there is a clear link between employee 
engagement and customer experience, 
as our customer satisfaction scores are 
consistently higher where employee 
engagement is highest. Clearly, 
engagement has a real impact on 
Cineworld being the ‘Best Place To 
Watch a Movie’. More details of how 
we engage with our key stakeholders 
are set out on page 40.
Our shareholders are a vital part of 
our broad stakeholder base. In the 
context of the Regal acquisition, we 
were delighted to receive strong support 
from shareholders in approving the 
transaction, and by strong levels of 
take-up in respect of the rights issue: 
over 96%. As stated previously, on  
behalf of the Board, I would like to 
express appreciation to shareholders  
for this support, and to reiterate the 
confidence that the Board has in this 
important development for the Group. 
As for the composition of our Board, 
we made a number of changes to 
membership early in 2017. Nisan Cohen 
was appointed as CFO, and joined the 
Board as an Executive Director. Dean 
Moore, who had been interim CFO, 
was appointed as an independent 
Non-Executive Director. Both Nisan and 
Dean bring extensive experience to the 
Board, something we have already seen 
in action since their appointments. Also 
in the reporting year, Martina King 
stepped down as a Non-Executive 
Director and we are grateful to Martina 
for her valuable contribution to the 
Company over the six years she served 
on the Board. Further details of the 
work of the Nomination Committee 
throughout the year may be found 
on page 41. 
30
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 During the year we undertook an 
internal evaluation of the composition 
and effectiveness of the Board, and I am 
pleased to report that it supported the 
view that the Board and its Committees 
are operating efficiently and 
productively. An external evaluation 
is conducted at least every third year, 
in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”).
Good governance means ensuring 
we have rigorous risk management 
and control procedures. Details of the 
annual risk review are contained in the 
Accountability section starting on page 
42. The Audit Committee plays a key role 
in overseeing our internal control and 
risk management systems, which this 
year included a comprehensive review 
of the effectiveness of our internal audit 
systems and controls, in accordance 
with the requirements of the Code. In 
addition, this year the Audit Committee 
engaged with the Financial Reporting 
Council (“FRC”) in relation to its thematic 
review of significant accounting 
judgements and sources of estimation 
uncertainty. More details of the outcome 
of the review are set out in the Audit 
Committee Report on page 44, but no 
material financial reporting changes 
were required.
The Remuneration Committee 
conducted a full review of the 
Company’s Remuneration Policy 
and, following a detailed consultation 
process, proposes to make some 
changes to the Policy this year to 
ensure it remains fit for purpose in 
the context of the Regal acquisition. 
Further details of the work of the 
Remuneration Committee in this 
area may be found on pages 48 to 67.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Leadership
Board Statements
Requirement Board statement
Compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code
The principal governance rules applying to companies with a premium listing for the year 
covered by this statement are contained in the Code published by the UK Financial Reporting 
Council in April 2016, and a copy is available on its website www.frc.org.uk. For the year ended 
31 December 2017, the Board considers that the Company was compliant with the provisions 
of the Code.
Going Concern The Directors consider that the Group (as enlarged by the Regal acquisition) has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of signing 
these accounts. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual 
financial statements. In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements, 
the Directors have considered the business activities as set out on pages 1 to 29 and the 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 18 to 22. The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities, as well as the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing capital, are described on pages 26 to 29. Financial risk management 
objectives, details of financial instruments and hedging activities, and exposure to credit risk 
and liquidity risk are described in Note 21 to the financial statements.
Viability The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three year period, taking into 
account the Group’s current position, the Regal acquisition, and the potential impact of the 
principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 18 to 22. Based on this assessment, and  
having considered the established controls for the risks, and the available mitigating actions, 
the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the enlarged Group will  
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year  
period to 2020. For more information on the viability assessment, please see page 22.
Robust Assessment 
of Principal Risks
The Directors consider they have undertaken a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity. Please refer to pages 18 to 22 for further information on the Company’s principal 
risks and uncertainties, and their impact on the prospects of the Group.
Review of Internal Control 
and Risk Management
The Directors have carried out a review of internal control and risk management. Please refer 
to pages 42 to 43 for further information.
Fair, Balanced and 
Understandable
The Directors consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy. Please refer to page 45.

members of the Board informally following the formal 
business of the meeting.

The Board
The Group is ultimately controlled by the Board of Directors 
of the Company. The Board is responsible for the overall 
leadership of the Group and for determining its long-term 
objectives and commercial strategy to create and deliver 
strong and sustainable financial performance to enhance 
shareholder value. In fulfilling its role, the Board ensures that 
necessary financial and other resources are available to enable 
the Group’s objectives to be met. The basis on which the Board 
seeks to preserve value over the longer term and the strategy 
for delivering the objectives is set out in the Strategic Report 
on pages 1 to 29.
The Board meets regularly at least six times a year and also 
once for a strategy session. Ad hoc meetings of the Board take 
place as required. The meetings follow a formal agenda, which 
includes matters specifically reserved for decision by the 
Board. The Board also meets, as and when necessary, to 
discuss and approve, if appropriate, specific issues. All 
Directors receive notice of such meetings and are given the 
opportunity to comment on the issues being discussed if  
they are unable to attend the meeting.
A schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by the 
Board has been agreed and adopted. These matters include: 
setting Group strategy; approving an annual budget and 
medium-term forecasts; reviewing operational and financial 
performance; approving major acquisitions, divestments and 
capital expenditure; approval of site selection; succession 
planning; approving appointments to the Board and of the 
Company Secretary and approving policies relating to 
Directors’ remuneration and contracts.
The Board is supplied on a monthly basis with detailed 
management accounts and an overview of Group financial 
and operational information. Regular briefings by the  
Executive Management team are given to the Board, to 
deepen the collective understanding of the business,  
leading in turn to more effective debate.
Membership of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees
At the start of the financial year, membership of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees was as follows:
Chair Member Member
Audit Committee Julie Southern Martina King Alicja Kornasiewicz

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Effectiveness
Directors and Directors’ Independence
At the start of the year, the Board was composed of nine 
members, five of whom were considered independent. On 
11 January 2017, Martina King stepped down from the Board, 
and Dean Moore and Nisan Cohen were appointed to the 
Board (as Independent Non-Executive Director and Chief 
Financial Officer respectively). At the end of the year, the 
Board was therefore composed of ten members, five of 
whom were considered independent.
The Board is satisfied that Mr Moore meets the requisite 
criteria to be considered independent, notwithstanding his 
previous interim employment within the Group, given the 
nature of the role he performed in the ten month period 
from March 2016, where his mandate was to focus on the 
Chief Financial Officer succession planning process.
Scott Rosenblum is not viewed as independent because 
of his previous business dealings with the Greidinger family 
and its interests, and as he is the GCT appointee under the 
Relationship Agreement as described on page 69 of the 
Directors’ Report. The names of the Directors at the year end, 
together with their biographical details, are set out on pages 
32 to 33.
For a FTSE 350 company, the Code recommends that a 
majority of non-executive members of the Board of Directors 
(excluding the Chairman) should be independent in character 
and judgement, and free from relationships or circumstances 
which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their 
judgement. The Board considers that Martina King, Alicja 
Kornasiewicz, Dean Moore, Arni Samuelsson, Rick Senat and 
Julie Southern were, for the year (or the portion of the year in 
which they served as Non-Executive Directors), independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-
Executive Directors are set out in letters of appointment 
and are made available for inspection by any person at the 
Company’s registered office during normal business hours, 
and will be available at the AGM. Further details of the letters 
of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors and the service 
contracts of the Executive Directors can be found in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
The independent Non-Executive Directors bring an objective 
viewpoint and range of experience to the Group and ensure 
that no individual or group of individuals is able to dominate 
the Board’s decision-making. They play a key role in reviewing 
proposals and providing constructive challenge generally and 
in particular in respect of strategy. They also ensure that 
appropriate standards are maintained. All the Non-Executive 
Directors have access to independent legal advice subject to 
consulting with the Board and following the agreed procedure.
Rick Senat, the Senior Independent Director, is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the 
normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Deputy 
Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer has failed 
to resolve or for which contact is inappropriate.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising and 
supporting the Chairman and the Board on corporate 
governance matters, ensuring Board procedures are 
followed and facilitating the good information flow 
within the Board and the Board-appointed Committees.
Performance Evaluation
Towards the end of the year, a performance evaluation was 
carried out in respect of the Board, the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees and each individual Director, 
including the Chairman. As an external facilitator had been 
engaged for the 2016 performance evaluation, the Board 
decided to carry out the exercise without external assistance 
in 2017. The process adopted involved the completion of 
assessment questionnaires by each of the Directors and 
Committee members. The results were then collated by the 
Company Secretary, and a summary presented to the relevant 
Committee and the Board. The process was constructive 
and confirmed that the Board and its Committees are 
operating effectively.
Re-election
All the Directors will be retiring and will be offering themselves 
for re-election at this year’s AGM, reflecting current best 
practice under the Code. Biographical details of all the current 
Directors are set out on pages 32 and 33. In view of the 
performance evaluation, the Board is satisfied that each 
Director standing for re-election continues to show the 
necessary commitment and continues to be an effective 
member of the Board due to his or her skills, expertise and 
business acumen.
The Board believes that the re-election of Anthony Bloom as 
Chairman of the Board is in the best interests of shareholders. 
Anthony has a comprehensive understanding of the Group’s 
business and operations and played a key role in the Company’s 
combination with Cinema City in 2014 and the recently 
completed acquisition of Regal. He also brings to the role 
extensive board-level and chairman experience in a range 
of companies, sectors and jurisdictions.
Chairman’s Commitments
The Chairman performs a limited number of external roles, but 
the Board is satisfied that these are not such as to interfere 
with the performance of the Chairman’s duties to the Group.
39
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Effectiveness continued
Stakeholder Engagement
The Directors value contact with the Company’s institutional 
and private investors. An Annual Report is sent to all new 
shareholders and is otherwise made available to shareholders 
via the Company’s website unless they have specifically 
requested that a copy is sent to them. Presentations are given 
to shareholders and analysts following the announcement 
of the interim results and the preliminary announcement of 
the full year results. Trading updates are typically issued in 
advance of the full year end results in March and the interim 
results in August. Separate announcements of all material 
events are made as necessary. 
In addition to the Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, who have 
regular contact with investors over such matters, the Chairman 
and the Senior Independent Director are available to meet with 
shareholders as and when required. Additionally, the Chief 
Executive Officer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer provide focal points for shareholders’ 
enquiries and dialogue throughout the year. The whole Board 
is kept up-to-date at its regular meetings with the views of 
shareholders and analysts and it receives reports on changes 
in the Company’s share register and market movements.
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with private 
and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. 
The Chairman aims to ensure that the Chairs of the Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee and Nomination 
Committee are available at the AGM to answer questions, 
and that all Directors attend.
The Company’s website (www.cineworldplc.com) provides 
an overview of the business. Major Group announcements 
are available on the website and new announcements are 
published without delay. All major announcements are 
approved by the Chairman and Executive Directors and 
circulated to the Board prior to issue. The Group also has 
internal and external checks to guard against unauthorised 
release of information.

The Company Secretary acts 
as Secretary to the Committee
Composition
During the year, the Committee comprised three Non-
Executive Directors (namely Scott Rosenblum, Arni 
Samuelsson and Rick Senat). While Rick Senat and Arni 
Samuelsson are considered to be independent, Scott 
Rosenblum is not. The majority of the Committee are 
independent as required by the Code.
The Role, Responsibilities and Activities of the 
Nomination Committee
The Committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities 
relating to the composition of the Board. It is responsible for 
evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on 
the Board, the size, structure and composition of the Board, 
retirements and appointments of additional and replacement 
Directors, the independence of Directors, and it makes 
appropriate recommendations to the Board on such matters. It is 
also responsible for ensuring that Directors have sufficient time to 
discharge their duties on appointment, and thereafter, with such 
matters being specifically addressed in the letters of appointment 
of the Non-Executive Directors. The terms of reference of  
the Committee are available on the Company’s website  
(www.cineworldplc.com/about-us/corporate-governance).
The Committee met for two scheduled meetings during the 
financial year and for other meetings as required on an ad hoc 
basis. Due to the important role that the Directors play in 
the success of the Group, the Chairman is invited to attend 
meetings, and does so, except when his own position or his 
successor is being discussed.
During the year, the Committee reviewed its own performance, 
reviewed the structure of the Board and the three Committees, 
and discussed succession and diversity issues.
Board Diversity Policy
While the Committee considers diversity to be important 
when reviewing the composition of the Board and possible 
new appointees, it believes that the single most important 
factor is to identify, recruit and retain the people it considers, 
on merit, to be the best candidates for each particular role. It 
is not currently in favour of setting specific targets for Board 
representation to be achieved by particular dates. As part 
of the process of recruiting new Directors, it has agreed that 
candidates from a wide variety of backgrounds, including 
different ethnic backgrounds, should be considered and, 
where reasonably possible, shortlists should comprise 
candidates of different genders. At the start of the year, there 
was over 30% female representation on the Board. However, 
this percentage lowered following Martina King’s stepping 
down in January 2017, and the appointments of Nisan Cohen 
and Dean Moore.
Recruitment Process for Board Directors
It was announced on 11 January 2017 that Nisan Cohen 
had been appointed to the position of CFO, and that he 
would join the Board as an Executive Director. It was also 
announced that Dean Moore had been appointed to the 
Board as an independent Non-Executive Director, and would 
become Chair of the Remuneration Committee and a member 
of the Audit Committee. Given the process undertaken at 
the time of Dean’s appointment as interim CFO, an external 
search consultancy was not engaged in connection with his 
appointment as an independent Non-Executive Director.
The Board is satisfied that Mr Moore meets the requisite 
criteria to be considered independent, notwithstanding his 
previous interim employment within the Group, given the 
nature of the role he performed in the ten month period 
from March 2016, where his mandate was to focus on the 
CFO succession planning process.
Norman Broadbent, the external search consultancy used for 
the search conducted in 2016, has no connections with the 
Group or any of its Directors, and was chosen following a 
consideration of a number of prospective search consultancies.
Chair’s Introduction
Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to present our report on the Nomination 
Committee and its activities during the year.
One of the key roles of the Committee is to assist the Board  
in discharging its responsibilities relating to the composition  
of the Board. We spend time as a Committee considering and 
evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on 
the Board and its size, structure and composition. We made a 
number of changes to membership of the Board in early 2017, 
announcing the appointment of Nisan Cohen as the new Chief 
Financial Officer (“CFO”) in January. The Committee played a 
key role in the planning process for this nomination, working at 
the time in conjunction with the Chair of the Audit Committee.
Also, in January 2017, we considered and recommended the 
appointment of Dean Moore as an independent Non-Executive 
Director, in place of Martina King, who stepped down from the 
Board at that time. Dean Moore brings with him a wealth of 
financial and commercial experience and skills, which the 
Committee felt would be of tremendous benefit to the Board 
and the Group, something that we have already seen in action 
since his appointment.
Further details of the Committee’s work in relation to the 
appointments of Dean Moore and Nisan Cohen are set out 
in the report below.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Accountability
Accountability, Audit and Financial
The Board is responsible for the preparation of the Annual 
Report and ensuring that the financial statements present a 
fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s 
financial position and prospects. The detailed work to ensure 
this, and to substantiate the fair, balanced and understandable 
statement, is undertaken by the Audit Committee.
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board has overall responsibility for establishing, 
monitoring and maintaining an effective system of risk 
management and internal control. These systems provide 
reasonable assurance that the Group’s assets are safeguarded 
and that material financial errors and irregularities are 
prevented or detected with a minimum of delay. The Group 
approach is implemented using the principles of the Three 
Lines of Defence model, as illustrated in the diagram below.
During the year, the Board has directly, and through 
delegated authority to the Executive Management Team 
and the Audit Committee, overseen and reviewed the 
performance and evolution of the approach to risk 
management and internal control.
The ongoing review and evaluation of risk management and 
internal control is undertaken by the Risk and Assurance team 
whose key responsibilities are:
Æ Æ Risk Management
Æ Æ Internal Audit
Æ Æ Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention
Æ Æ Insurance
The Board confirms that, in accordance with the Code:
Æ Æ there is an ongoing and robust process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principal risks faced by the 
Group (for more details please see Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties on pages 18 to 22);
Æ Æ the Company’s systems of risk management and internal 
control have been in place for the year under review, are 
regularly reviewed by the Executive Directors and the 
Board, and are deemed to be effective with no significant 
weaknesses identified; and
Æ Æ the systems comply with the FRC guidance on risk 
management, internal control and related financial 
business reporting.
Risk Management
The Board, supported by the Audit Committee and the 
Executive Management Team, has overall responsibility for 
implementing an effective risk management approach. 
The Group approach is governed by its Risk Management 
Framework that sets out the policy, oversight structure, 
accountability and processes for monitoring and reporting  
of risk within the Group, and facilitates the following objectives 
for risk management:
Æ Æ to identify, measure, control and report on business risk that 
would potentially undermine the achievement of the Group 
strategic objectives, both strategically and operationally, 
through appropriate analysis and assessment criteria;
Æ Æ to better allocate effort and resources for the management 
of key and emerging risks;
Æ Æ to drive business improvements and improve intelligence 
for key decision-making; and
Æ Æ to support and develop the Company’s reputation as a well 
governed and trusted organisation.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The application of the key components of the Risk 
Management Framework have been as follows:
Oversight structure and accountability – The risk management 
oversight and accountability structure has ensured that risk 
consideration is from both a “top-down” and “bottom-up” 
perspective. The Group maintains a Principal Risk Register 
as well as operational risk registers for support functions, 
cinema operations and specific projects.
Ongoing process – At each level the risk assessment process 
is based on five key steps:
1. Risk identification (using cause and effect analysis)
2. Assessment of inherent risk severity
3.  Identification of existing controls and assessment 
of effectiveness
4. Assessment of residual risk severity
5. Development and implementation of risk mitigation
Details of the Group’s principal risks and how they are being 
managed or mitigated are provided on pages 18 to 22.
As part of this process, risk appetite is considered by the 
Board annually for each of the principal risks, allowing them 
to clearly set out the nature and extent of the risk the Group 
is willing to accept, and the level of investment in control in 
pursuit of the Group’s strategic objectives.
Escalation, monitoring and reporting – A clear escalation policy 
is in place to ensure changes to risk exposure are notified up 
through the governance structure as required. Risk leads are 
identified for all risks and have the responsibility for ongoing 
monitoring of the effectiveness of current controls and the 
progress against the implementation of further mitigating actions.
There is a cycle of ongoing monitoring and reporting activities 
in place with risk information being presented to the Board 
and Audit Committee. During the year an executive Risk 
Committee was introduced to provide quarterly checks and 
challenge for the principal and operational risks.
Culture – To support embedding the application of the Risk 
Management Framework into the culture and behaviours of 
the Group, ongoing training and communication have been 
delivered by the Risk and Assurance team.
Internal Control
Whilst the Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, 
it has delegated responsibility for the operation of the system 
of internal control to the Executive Management Team. The 
detailed review of internal control has been delegated to 
the Audit Committee. Senior Management within each part 
of the Group are responsible for internal control and risk 
management within their own area and for ensuring 
compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures.
The Audit Committee has oversight of the programme of 
assurance activities to allow for its ongoing review of the 
effectiveness of internal control. The delivery of this assurance 
programme is undertaken by the Risk and Assurance team, 
which is supported by specialist advisors as required.
Details of the activities the Audit Committee during 2017 are 
set out on pages 44 to 46.
Internal audit – The internal audit plan is a combination of 
Group-wide risk-based reviews (providing assurance over  
the key controls relied upon for the principal risks) as well as 
additional specific reviews requested by management. The Risk 
and Assurance team is supported by PwC to deliver the plan.
Cinema compliance – The Cinema Compliance Plan is a 
combination of one and three day reviews that are delivered 
across the Group. Each cinema in the Group is risk assessed 
based on financial, operational and management information 
to determine which cinemas would be included in the audit 
programme for the year.
Quarterly management reporting of key themes and trends 
help support the Group to make continued improvements.
In addition to the programme of on-site reviews conducted by 
the Risk and Assurance team, an annual self-assessment audit 
is undertaken by each cinema.
Fraud detection and loss prevention – To support the Group in 
fraud detection and loss prevention a software tool is used for 
ongoing analysis of our key data sources to swiftly identify any 
irregular transaction activity that could indicate instances of 
fraud, loss or failure of procedural compliance. In addition, 
anonymous site visits are undertaken to review the customer 
journey (from ticket purchase to cinema departure).
External audit – The External Auditor provides a supplementary, 
independent and autonomous perspective on those areas of 
the internal control system which it assesses in the course of  
its work. Its findings are reported to the Audit Committee.
Operational controls – The Executive Directors, on a day-to-
day basis, are involved in reviewing the key operations 
of the business through their interaction with their Senior 
Management teams across the Group and their discussions 
on operational performance and delivery.
Financial control – The Group has internal control and risk 
management arrangements in relation to the Group’s financial 
reporting processes and the preparation of its consolidated 
accounts. The arrangements include procedures to ensure the 
maintenance of records which accurately and fairly reflect 
transactions, to enable the preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU or FRS 101, as appropriate, with reasonable 
assurance, and that require reported data to be reviewed and 
reconciled, with appropriate monitoring internally and by the 
Audit Committee.
Ongoing financial performance is monitored through regular 
reporting to the Executive Directors and monthly reporting 
to the Board. Capital investment and all revenue expenditure 
is regulated by a budgetary process and authorisation levels, 
with post-investment and period end reviews as required. 
A comprehensive budgeting system allows managers to submit 
detailed budgets which are reviewed and amended by the 
Executive Directors prior to submission to the Board for approval.
Across all territories, a financial controls checklist is in place for 
all Finance Directors. On an annual basis a programme of 
internal audit reviews is undertaken for compliance validation.
Other assurance activities – A programme of health and safety 
audits (delivered by outsourced providers) takes place for each 
cinema throughout the year as well as an annual self-assessment.
Customer surveys and mystery shopper visits also take place to 
ensure customers are receiving the optimum viewer experience.
Due to the upcoming changes in data protection under the 
“GDPR” in 2018, additional assurance activity has also been 
undertaken in the form of a readiness assessment, data audit 
and data mapping exercises.
Policies and procedures – The Group has in place a range of 
governance related policies which are regularly reviewed and 
communicated to employees. These include Whistleblowing, Gifts 
and Hospitality, and Health and Safety. For more details of the 
Group’s policies see “Anti-bribery and Corruption” on page 23.

Chair’s Introduction
Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to present this report on the activities of the 
Audit Committee for 2017. 
The Committee supports the Board in its oversight and 
monitoring of the robustness and integrity of financial 
reporting, and the supervision of the External Auditor. The 
Committee is also tasked with providing assurance to the 
Board in respect of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems. The report below 
describes the work that we have undertaken as a Committee 
during the reporting year, in order to achieve these objectives.
An area of focus for the Committee in 2017 was the 
consideration of the significant risks, issues and areas of 
judgement in relation to the financial statements. As you 
will see in the report on page 45, the number of areas which 
we consider to be of significant risk has reduced for the 
reporting year, with only “Property, Plant and Equipment” 
being identified. We spent time as a Committee analysing the 
reports from management and the External Auditor in relation 
to significant risks, to ensure that we have understood the 
issues involved, and in order to form our own view on how 
these should be addressed. 
In addition, the Committee engaged during the year with 
the FRC in relation to its thematic review of significant 
accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty 
(which was conducted in respect of our 2016 accounts). More 
details of the outcome of the review are set out in the report 
on page 45, but there were no material financial reporting 
changes required as a result of the review.
In 2017, the Committee received reports from management 
in respect of planning for the implementation of various 
upcoming changes to accounting standards, in particular in 
relation to IFRS 15 (revenue recognition) and IFRS 16 (lease 
accounting). This project, led by management and supported 
by external advisors, will continue to be monitored by the 
Committee, to ensure a smooth transition process to the new 
standards. We also reviewed and assessed management’s 
proposals in relation to the Going Concern and Viability 
Statements.
A significant portion of the Committee’s time was dedicated 
to the area of risk management. Supported by the Risk and 
Assurance team, we have reviewed our principal risks and 
uncertainties, and considered the potential impact of these 
risks on our business model, future performance, solvency and 
liquidity. Details of our principal risks and uncertainties may be 
found on pages 18 to 22, including details of how we consider 
these risks in the context of our strategic objectives. The work 
of the Risk and Assurance team is supported by the internal 
audit team at PwC, which focuses specifically on risk-based 
audits, and the Committee continued to review the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of risk management  
and internal controls. More details of our work in these  
areas may be found on page 45 and also in the Accountability 
section starting on page 42. Indeed, the Committee will need 
to carefully consider this key area of risk management and 
internal control going forward, in light of the acquisition of 
Regal, and the Risk and Assurance team has already  
instigated this process.
As for Committee membership, we made some changes 
in early 2017, welcoming Dean Moore as a member following 
the stepping down of Martina King. The Committee is already 
benefitting from Dean’s extensive commercial and financial 
experience. Lastly, I would like to extend my thanks to Martina, 
for her significant contribution to the Committee during  
her membership.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 What the Committee did in 2017
The Committee met four times during the year, during  
which time it:
Æ Æ monitored the financial reporting process and reviewed 
the interim and annual financial statements (including 
the preliminary announcement) with particular reference 
to accounting policies, principal risks and uncertainties, 
together with significant estimates and financial reporting 
judgements and the disclosures made therein;
Æ Æ considered the interim results and the Annual Report and 
Accounts in the context of the requirement that they are 
fair, balanced and understandable, by reviewing papers 
prepared by management with regard to this principle. 
This included reviewing the documents to ensure that 
the description of the business agrees with the Committee’s 
own understanding, the risks reflect the issues that concern 
the Group, the discussion of performance properly reflects 
the relevant period, and there is a clear link between all  
the areas of disclosure;
Æ Æ received and discussed (in the absence of management, 
where appropriate) reports from the External Auditor in 
respect of its review of the interim results, the internal audit 
plan for the year and the results of the annual audit. These 
reports included the scope for the interim review and 
annual audit, the approach to be adopted by the External 
Auditor to evaluate and conclude on key areas of the audit, 
its assessment of materiality, the terms of engagement and 
raising awareness to the Committee of the likely impact of 
future changes to regulation and accounting standards;
Æ Æ monitored the performance of the Risk and Assurance team 
(including input from PwC), reviewed the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal financial controls together with its 
broader internal control and Risk Management Framework, 
to ensure consistent and appropriate financial controls 
across the Group;
Æ Æ communicated with the FRC regarding the Company’s 
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2016, in 
relation to their thematic review of significant accounting 
judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty. The 
letter from the FRC and the Group’s responses were 
reviewed by the Committee. There were no major financial 
reporting changes arising from this communication. 
However, some areas previously reported as significant 
accounting judgements or sources of estimation uncertainty 
have been removed in the 2017 Annual Report, and for 
other areas further clarity has been provided to explain why 
items are deemed to be significant. The FRC’s review only 
covered the specific disclosures relating to this thematic 
review and provides no assurance that the Annual Report 
and Accounts are correct in all material respects; the FRC’s 
role is not to verify the information provided but to consider 
compliance with reporting requirements;
Æ Æ considered the combined Prospectus and Circular in 
relation to the acquisition of Regal;
Æ Æ reviewed the accounting papers provided by management 
on the upcoming changes to IFRS accounting standards 
and their potential impact on the Group’s financial 
statements;
Æ Æ monitored the implementation of the Group’s internal  
audit plan for 2017, including further embedding the Risk 
Management Framework, the risk-based assurance plan for 
the financial control environment, and the Group-wide 
cinema compliance programme;
Æ Æ reviewed the results of non-financial audits (including  
food hygiene and fire safety) and where applicable  
agreed enhancements to procedures and reviewed  
remedial actions;
Æ Æ made recommendations to the Board with regard to 
continuing the appointment and remuneration of the 
External Auditor, oversaw the Group’s relations with the 
External Auditor, determined its independence and 
monitored the effectiveness of the audit process;
Æ Æ discussed the requirements for a longer-term viability 
statement and the related assessment work to enable the 
Board to make such a statement;
Æ Æ continued to monitor the ongoing requirements regarding 
audit tender; and
Æ Æ reviewed the Committee’s terms of reference and carried 
out a performance evaluation as required by the Code. 
The results of the evaluation confirmed that the Committee 
is performing satisfactorily and providing strong support to 
the Board.
Going Concern
In recommending the adoption of the going concern basis 
for preparing the financial statements, the Committee 
considered the business activities, as well as the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties, as set out on pages 18 to 22, 
the financial position of the Group (as enlarged by the Regal 
acquisition), its cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing 
facilities, as well as the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing capital, as described on pages 26 to 
29 and the financial risk management objectives, details of 
financial instruments and hedging activities, and exposures 
to credit risk and liquidity risk as set out in Note 21 to the 
financial statements.
Viability
Part of the Committee’s work in the year has been to discuss 
and consider the requirement under the Code for a longer-
term viability statement, and the related assessment work 
needed in order to enable the Directors to make such 
a statement. The Directors’ Viability Statement, together with 
details of the assessment work, is set out on page 22 (with 
a summary on page 34, “Board Statements”).
Significant Issues Considered in Relation to the 
Financial Statements
During the year the Committee, management and the 
External Auditor considered and concluded what the 
significant risks and issues were in relation to the financial 
statements and how these would be addressed. In relation 
to the 2017 Group financial statements, only one significant 
risk has been identified, being the Valuation of Property,  
Plant and Equipment (“PPE”).
Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment
As detailed in Note 9 to the financial statements, there 
is a significant inherent risk that elements of the Group’s 
considerable PPE balances may prove to be irrecoverable, 
due to fluctuations in the underlying performance of cinemas 
or one-off events. Given the number of factors involved in 
predicting the performance of cinema sites operated by the 
Group, in multiple territories, this gives rise to an element of 
judgement being applied to the potential level of impairments 
to be recognised on a cash generating unit (“CGU”) basis, 
predominantly at cinema site level.
At each Balance Sheet date, management prepares an 
assessment which estimates the value in use of the CGUs  
to which the tangible fixed assets are allocated. Where 
individual sites’ cash flows are not considered independent 
from one another, mainly due to strategic or managerial 
decisions being made across more than one site, they may  
be combined into a single CGU.
The resulting calculation is sensitive to the assumptions in 
respect of future cash flows and the discount rate applied.  
The main assumptions over growth rates, the impact of 
one-off events, expected cost increases and discount rates  
are updated to reflect management’s best estimate. When 
considering the appropriateness of the discount rate, 
management assess the territory specific discount rates,  
45
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Audit Committee Report continued
and ensure that they are updated for current market 
information and the Group’s current leverage.
At the year end management prepared their valuation 
models for the Committee’s consideration, together with 
their proposed site impairments, and drew the Committee’s 
attention to any specific judgements taken within the 
models, including focusing particularly on one site in Israel 
with a large carrying value, which is expected to mature over 
a longer period than most of the Group’s sites. Management 
confirmed to the Committee that they have applied a 
consistent Group-wide methodology in the preparation of 
the valuation models. The Committee satisfied itself that the 
approach was appropriate, the assumptions reasonable and 
the impairments proposed were complete and accurate. The 
Committee also satisfied itself through enquiry of management 
and review of the Board papers that all significant events 
which may have impacted on the valuation of PPE had been 
appropriately captured in management’s assumptions and 
reflected in the valuation models and that appropriate 
disclosures, including in relation to sensitivities, had been 
included in the financial statements.
External Audit
The Committee reviews the appointment of the External 
Auditor each year before the cycle of audit commences and 
in deciding whether to renew the appointment takes note of 
the quality of the service received, the proposed fees and the 
Auditor’s independence. Management and all members of the 
Committee are consulted during the process. Further details 
of these processes are set out below.
Effectiveness
During the year, the Committee evaluated the performance 
and objectivity of KPMG and reviewed its effectiveness as 
External Auditor. The effectiveness of the 2016 audit was 
assessed by reference to the following:
Æ Æ the effectiveness of the lead audit, engagement partner, 
including the support provided to the Committee;
Æ Æ the planning and scope of the audit including identification 
of areas of audit risk and communication of any changes 
to the plan, and changes in perceived audit risks;
Æ Æ the quality of communication with the Committee,  
including the regular reports on accounting matters, 
governance and control;
Æ Æ the competence with which the External Auditor handled 
key accounting and audit judgements and communication 
of those to management and the Committee;
Æ Æ KPMG’s reputation and standing, including its independence 
and objectivity and its internal quality procedures; and
Æ Æ the quality of the formal report to shareholders.
Further, at the conclusion of each year’s audit, the Committee 
discusses the performance of the External Auditor with the 
Executive Directors and relevant senior finance managers 
considering areas such as the quality of the audit team, 
business understanding, audit approach and management. 
Where appropriate, actions are agreed against points raised 
and subsequently monitored for progress. There were no 
significant findings from the evaluation this year.
After taking into account all of the above factors, the 
Committee concluded that the External Auditor was effective. 
In addition, the Committee is satisfied that it has sufficient 
oversight of the External Auditor and its independence and 
objectivity is not compromised due to the safeguards in place.
Independence, Appointment and Tender
The Committee last conducted a tender process in February 
2016 and, following that process, decided to recommend to 
the Board that KPMG be reappointed as External Auditor.
The Company will continue to comply with the relevant 
tendering and auditor rotation requirements applicable under 
UK and EU regulations, which require the next external audit 
tender to occur by 2026. In addition, the External Auditor will 
be required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the 
Group audit every five years and, as a result, the current  
lead audit partner will be required to change in 2021. The 
Committee continues to review the auditor appointment  
and the need to tender the audit.
The External Auditor is also required to periodically assess 
whether, in its professional opinion, it is independent and 
confirm this to the Committee. KPMG has provided this 
confirmation. In addition, the Company considers it has 
complied with the Competition and Markets Authority’s 
Statutory Audit Services Order.
Non-Audit Services
The Committee considers the independence of the External 
Auditor on an ongoing basis and has established policies to 
consider the appropriateness or otherwise of appointing the 
External Auditor to perform non-audit services. In particular, 
under its terms of reference, all non-audit work and the 
associated fees need to be approved by the Committee if  
the value of such work is likely to be greater than £30,000. 
During 2017 the Group initiated the process which led to its 
recent Rights Issue and its acquisition of Regal on 28 February 
2018. This process involved a significant amount of regulatory 
and other reporting that the Committee considered that KPMG 
in its role as the Group’s auditor was in the best position to 
provide. KPMG’s fees for its non-audit work in respect of capital 
markets assurance services and corporate finance services in 
connection with this process were £1.30m, reflecting the 
unusually large scale of this transaction. The Committee 
determined that work in relation to tax advice and synergistic 
benefits arising from the acquisition should best be performed 
by advisors another than KPMG. KPMG’s work on this project 
was performed between October 2017 and February 2018. 
£0.4m of the above fees have been reflected in the Group’s 2017 
financial statements and the balance will be included in 2018.
The only other non-audit service provided by KPMG to the 
Group during 2017 related to its review of the Group’s interim 
statement, for which fees of £0.04m were agreed. 
The Committee is satisfied that the above work was best 
undertaken by KPMG and that its objectivity as auditor has  
not been impaired by reason of this further work. An analysis 
of audit and non-audit fees may be found in Note 4 to the 
financial statements.
Insurance
It is not practical or possible to insure against every risk to the 
fullest extent. The Group has in place an insurance programme 
to help protect it against certain insurable risks. The portfolio 
of insurance policies is kept under regular review with the 
Company’s insurance broker to ensure that the policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s activities and exposures taking 
into account cost, and the likelihood and magnitude of the 
risks involved.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Remuneration Committee
Composition
For the duration of the year, the Company’s Remuneration 
Committee comprised three independent Non-Executive 
Directors. At the start of the year, the Committee members 
were Martina King (Chair), Rick Senat, and Julie Southern).  
On 11 January 2017, Martina King stepped down from her role 
as a Non-Executive Director and as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, and Dean Moore was appointed in her place and  
is the Chair of the Committee. The Committee met four times 
during the year and, in addition, held a number of ad hoc 
meetings to deal with specific issues. 
Roles and Responsibilities
The activities of the Committee are covered in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 67, and are incorporated 
into this Corporate Governance Statement by reference.
The Committee assists the Board in determining its responsibilities 
in relation to remuneration, including making recommendations 
to the Board on the Group’s policy on executive remuneration, 
determining the individual remuneration and benefits package 
of each of the Executive Directors, and monitoring and approving 
the remuneration of Senior Management below Board level.
The Committee appointed Willis Towers Watson as external 
advisors in November 2008 and took advice from it during the 
year until September 2017. In September 2017, the Committee 
appointed PwC as advisors to the Committee following a 
competitive selection process, replacing Willis Towers Watson. 
Willis Towers Watson had no other connection with the Group 
except as the actuary to the pension schemes of Adelphi-
Carlton Limited, the Group’s operating company in Ireland. 
PwC has no other connections with Cineworld except the 
provision internal audit support to the Risk and Assurance 
team. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided  
by PwC is objective and independent. 
The Committee is comfortable that the PwC engagement 
partner and team that provide remuneration advice to the 
Committee do not have connections with the Company that may 
impair their independence. On appointment as advisors, the 
Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and 
judged that there were no conflicts or potential conflicts arising.
The Company receives advice in relation to the Remuneration 
Policy and its implementation in respect of the Chairman, 
Executive Directors, Company Secretary and Senior Management. 
The terms of engagement with both Willis Towers Watson and 
PwC are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Chief Executive Officer is consulted on the remuneration 
packages of the other senior executives and attends discussions 
by invitation except when his own position is being discussed. 
Given the essential part remuneration plays in the success of 
the Group, the Chairman of the Board is also invited to attend 
meetings of the Committee and does so except when his  
own remuneration is being considered. The Committee does 
not deal with the fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors.  
The report of the Remuneration Committee is set out on  
pages 48 to 67.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the 
Company’s website (www.cineworldplc.com/about-us/
corporate-governance).

“ The Committee has always aimed to 
be clear and transparent in matters of 
remuneration, and we hope that this 
report continues this approach”
A remuneration 
philosophy aligned to 
long-term value creation
Annual Statement
Dear Shareholders
As Chair of Cineworld’s Remuneration Committee (the 
“Committee”), I am pleased to present our Remuneration 
Report for the year to 31 December 2017, including a revised 
Remuneration Policy for which we will be seeking your 
approval at our Annual General Meeting in May 2018.
2017 Performance and Remuneration
The Group delivered a successful year of trading in 2017 with 
total revenue increasing 11.6% to £890.7m (2016: £797.8m),  
and Adjusted EBITDA up 12.7% at £198.2m (2016: £175.8m).  
The decisions in relation to executive remuneration outcomes 
made by the Committee were taken in the context of this 
performance. Annual bonuses for the Executive Directors,  
which are based on a matrix of Group Adjusted EBITDA 
performance against budget and the achievement of stretching 
individual objectives, paid out at the level of 78.6%, 78.6% and 
44.4% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), 
Deputy CEO and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) respectively.  
As EPS performance targets for the PSP were reached in full 
over the three year period 2015–2017, 100% of the awards  
made in 2015 will vest.
The Company receives advice in relation to the Remuneration 
Policy and its implementation in respect of the Chairman, 
Executive Directors, Company Secretary and Senior 
Management. In September 2017, the Committee appointed 
PwC as advisors to the Committee following a competitive 
selection process, replacing Willis Towers Watson. Further 
details are provided on page 60.
2018 Remuneration Policy
Cineworld’s current Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”) was 
approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2017 and was based 
on the profile of Cineworld before the acquisition of Regal. 
As such, the Committee considered that it was an appropriate 
time to review the Policy and, following a detailed analysis 
of our current arrangements, taking into account developing 
market practice, feedback received from shareholders, and 
the transformational nature of the Regal transaction, will be 
putting a new Policy forward for shareholder approval at our 
AGM this year.
The Committee believes it is appropriate to amend the 
Remuneration Policy for the following key reasons:
Æ Æ Scale and complexity of the new business – The acquisition 
of Regal is anticipated to move the Group from a 
multinational operation onto a truly global platform. Given 
the significant impact the deal will have on the scale and 
complexity of the Group, the Committee believes it is 
appropriate that the remuneration structure incentivises 
management to achieve the expected combined growth 
story and cost savings.
Æ Æ Focus on long-term performance – The proposed changes 
to the Policy are weighted towards the variable elements of 
the package, albeit we are also proposing to make changes 
to the base salaries to reflect the enlarged scope of the roles.
Æ Æ Delivery of synergies – The bonus arrangements will be linked 
to the effective integration of Regal into the Group and the 
synergies which are expected to be delivered as a result.
48
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Summary of Changes
Having carefully reviewed our base salary and incentive 
arrangements, the Committee has decided to make the 
following salary changes and adjustments to the Policy:
Æ Æ Salary increases from £577,844 to £630,000 for the CEO, 
from £393,984 to £505,000 for the Deputy CEO and from 
£290,000 to £395,000 for the CFO. The proposed base 
salaries reflect the substantial increase in the scale and 
complexity of the Group as a result of the Regal acquisition 
and the pursuant responsibilities of the Executive Directors, 
as well as the CFO’s progression in role since his 
appointment last year.
Æ Æ Increase in the maximum annual bonus potential to 150% of 
salary with any bonus earned above 100% of salary deferred 
into shares for a period of two years. The majority of the 
annual bonus will continue to be based on performance 
against financial targets.
Æ Æ The Committee does not propose to increase the long-term 
incentive plan (“LTIP”) opportunity; however, it does intend 
to utilise the maximum opportunity of 200% of salary in 
future years. The LTIP will continue to measure performance 
against stretching EPS growth targets over a three year period.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, the UKLA Listing 
Rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code. The report is 
split into three parts:

Remuneration Policy
This section describes the Committee’s Policy on the remuneration of Directors. The Policy will be put to shareholders for 
approval at the AGM in May 2018. If approved it will come into effect from the date of the AGM and is intended to apply for 
a period of three years. Following approval at the AGM, remuneration payments and payment for loss of office to Directors 
can only be made if they are consistent with this Policy or otherwise approved by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders.
The objective of the Group’s Remuneration Policy is that Executive Directors should receive appropriate remuneration for their 
performance, responsibility, skills and experience. Remuneration packages are designed to enable the Group to attract and retain 
key employees by ensuring they are remunerated appropriately and competitively, and that they are motivated to achieve the 
highest level of Group performance in line with the best interests of shareholders. This is balanced with the need to mitigate risk 
and accordingly incentives are structured to ensure that no Director is encouraged to take inappropriate risks because of the 
level of potential variable rewards.
To determine the elements and level of remuneration appropriate for each Executive Director, the Committee considers, when 
appropriate, benchmark remuneration data for selected comparable companies and seeks to ensure that an appropriately 
significant proportion of potential pay is performance-related, and that total pay opportunity is consistent with appropriate 
superior levels of pay for superior performance.
The policy of the Committee is to set performance conditions for annual bonuses and long-term incentives which are appropriately 
stretching but fair given the environment in which the Group operates, taking into account internal and external expectations.
While the Board’s normal practice is to operate within the above parameters, it will take account of individual circumstances and 
tailor remuneration packages accordingly. In cases of material variance, it would seek to take account of major shareholders’ views.
Changes to the remuneration policy that was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM
The Committee has undertaken a review of the existing remuneration policy in light of the acquisition of Regal and is proposing 
a revised remuneration policy that reflects the scale and complexity of the enlarged Group. The acquisition is transformational 
for the Group and is expected to deliver significant value to shareholders from an earnings perspective. To reflect this, the 
Committee proposes to increase the maximum opportunity under the annual bonus plan (together with a deferral on a portion 
of the award) and increase the normal maximum opportunity under the long term incentive plan within the limit of the current 
policy, as outlined below.

Opportunity Operation
Base salary
To provide a 
core level of 
remuneration

Company to attract

executives to 
deliver its strategy
Salaries may be adjusted and any 
increase will ordinarily be (in 
percentage terms) in line with 
those across the Group, in 
aggregate, allowing for location.
Percentage increases beyond 
those granted to the wider 
workforce may be awarded in 
certain circumstances such as 
where there is a change in 
responsibility, progression in the 
role, experience or a significant 
increase in the scale of the role 
and/or size value and/or 
complexity of the Group.
Executive Directors’ salary levels are agreed on joining and thereafter 
reviewed annually, generally on 1 July each year.
The Committee considers both the nature and the status of the 
Company’s operations and the responsibilities, skills, experience and 
performance of each Executive Director. The Committee compares the 
Group’s remuneration packages for its Executive Directors and 
employees with those of Directors and employees of similar seniority 
in companies whose activities are comparable with the Group. The 
Committee also takes into account the progress made by the Group, 
contractual considerations and salary increases across the rest of 
the Group.
Pension
To provide market-
competitive 
retirement benefits
Monthly employer contribution up 
to 20% of basic salary or in the 
form of a cash pension allowance.
All employees, including Executive Directors, are invited to participate 
in a Group Personal Pension Plan which is a money purchase plan. 
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Executive Directors may choose to opt out of the Group scheme and 
instead receive a cash pension allowance equivalent to employer 
pension contribution (i.e. currently up to 20% of base salary).
The Company’s pension contribution may be conditional on the 
Executive Director contributing a percentage of their base salary to the 
pension scheme in line with general scheme requirements. Executives 
may make pension contributions under “salary sacrifice” arrangements. 
Savings as a result of such an arrangement may be shared with the 
Executive Director in the form of an additional pension contribution.

Other benefits
To provide market-
competitive 
benefits and 
support the 
health and safety 
of individuals
The cost to the Group of 
providing such benefits will 
vary from year to year in 
accordance with the cost of 
insuring such benefits.
Benefits in kind for Executive Directors currently include the 
provision of a company car or car allowance, private mileage, life 
insurance, permanent health insurance, private medical cover and 
a disturbance allowance.
Benefits are tailored to the individual circumstances of Directors to 
ensure that overall packages are attractive and additional benefits 
may be introduced where appropriate.
A limited flexible benefits scheme operates for all employees (including 
Directors) and the intention is to expand it over a period of time.
Annual bonus
To incentivise the 
annual delivery of 
financial and 
operational targets
Maximum opportunity for 
Executive Directors of 150% 
of salary.
Two-thirds of the bonus is based on overall Group performance in 
meeting its primary financial objectives in Adjusted EBITDA for the 
financial period. The level of this element of the bonus is determined 
by a matrix of budgeted Adjusted EBITDA and personal performance 
levels. The weighting of these measures is circa 80% Adjusted EBITDA 
and 20% personal performance which incorporates the reduction in 
net debt.
The Committee seeks to ensure that the Adjusted EBITDA budget is 
challenging and so there is a clear link between the short-term Group 
performance and payout under the arrangements:
Æ Æ None of this element of the bonus is payable if a minimum threshold 
of 90% of budgeted Adjusted EBITDA is not achieved. At this level 
(assuming “good” performance against individual objectives), a 
bonus of 30% of maximum opportunity would be payable.
Æ Æ The maximum level of this element of the bonus is only payable if 
both 110% of budgeted Adjusted EBITDA and exceptional 
performance against individual objectives is achieved.
The remaining third of the bonus is based on performance against 
strategic targets, which for FY18 and FY19 will be based on the delivery 
of synergy benefits as a result of the acquisition of Regal 
Entertainment.
The choice of these measures reflects the Committee’s belief that any 
incentive compensation should be tied both to the overall performance 
of the Group and to those areas of the business that the relevant 
individual can directly influence.
The performance measures and targets are reviewed annually to 
ensure alignment to strategy.
The bonus will be paid in cash save for any bonus earned above 100% 
of salary which will be deferred into shares for a period of two years.
Where a Director leaves and is considered a good leaver, he/she will be 
paid on the usual payment date a proportion of any bonus entitlement, 
which would have otherwise accrued, reflecting that part of the bonus 
period which was actually worked.

Annual awards of conditional shares or nil cost options are made to 
Executive Directors and members of the Senior Management Team at 
the discretion of the Committee. Since the AGM in 2017, The Cineworld 
Group plc 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan has been in force and all 
future awards will be made under this plan. Prior to this, awards were 
made under The Cineworld Group Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’).
Awards may vest after three years, subject to continuing employment 
and the achievement of stretching three-year EPS growth performance 
conditions.
The Committee will review and calibrate the EPS growth targets on an 
annual basis for each award to ensure they are sufficiently stretching in 
light of both internal and external performance expectations. Threshold 
performance is generally intended to align to the performance of the 
relevant market and/or of competitors. If the stretch performance level 
is achieved, it would be expected that the Company would have 
significantly outperformed the relevant market and/or competitors.
At the threshold performance level, 25% of an award will vest. At the 
stretch level of performance, 100% of an award will vest. Between these 
levels, vesting will be determined on a straight-line basis.
On vesting, participants will also receive additional shares or a cash 
sum equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on the 
vested shares in respect of dividend record dates occurring between 
grant and vesting.
At the discretion of the Committee, each participant may have a 
proportional part of their Performance Share award replaced by an 
HMRC approved share option granted under the CSOP schedule to 
The Cineworld Group plc 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan (“CSOP Plan”), 
up to the maximum value of options permitted by legislation (currently 
£30,000). Such awards are subject to identical performance vesting 
conditions as the Performance Shares they replace.
The conditions applicable to awards may be varied in exceptional 
circumstances following the grant of an award so as to achieve their 
original purpose, but not so as to make their achievement any more 
or less difficult to satisfy. Awards may also be adjusted to reflect 
corporate events, such as rights issues, to maintain a holder’s position, 
but not so as to enhance it.
It is the Committee’s intention to settle awards in shares, but the plan 
rules allow for flexibility to settle in cash if required.
Share Ownership Guidelines
To provide 
alignment between 
Executive Directors 
and Shareholders
N/A Each Executive Director is expected to build up a shareholding equal 
to 150% of their base salary.
In order to achieve this level of shareholding, Executive Directors are 
expected to retain 50% of any shares they acquire under the PSP or 
on the exercise of options, after allowing for the sale of shares to pay 
tax and other deductions, until such time as they have built up such a 
holding. For the purposes of these guidelines, only beneficially owned 
shares will generally count towards the holding – however, the 
Remuneration Committee retains discretion to determine whether 
the requirement has been met in specific circumstances.
Cineworld Group Sharesave Scheme
To enable Group 
employees to 
become Cineworld 
shareholders, 
encouraging 
alignment and 
rewarding for 
Group performance
The maximum saving level is 
aligned with that for all employees 
and the limit under legislation 
(currently £500 per month).
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme, 
which is an HM Revenue and Customs-approved scheme open to all 
employees of nominated Group companies.
Under the Sharesave Scheme, employees are eligible to acquire shares 
in the Company at a discount of up to 20% of the market value at grant 
if they agree to enter into a savings contract for a three-year period. 
Consistent with the relevant legislation, no performance conditions apply.
Awards may also be adjusted to reflect corporate events, such as rights 
issues, to maintain a holder’s position, but not so as to enhance it.
This Policy also provides the ability for Executive Directors to 
participate in any other all-employee plan which may be introduced 
in future up to the limits which apply to other employees.

Non-Executive Director fees
To attract and 
retain high calibre 
Non-Executive 
Directors
The Non-Executive Directors 
receive a fixed fee for their 
services as members of the Board 
and its Committees.
Non-Executive Directors do not 
participate in the Company’s 
share incentives or otherwise 
receive performance-related pay 
but may receive reimbursement 
for travel and incidental costs 
incurred in furtherance of 
Company business.
The level of fees is determined by the Board after taking into account 
appropriate advice (except in the case of the Chairman whose level 
of fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee), in line with 
prevailing market conditions and at a level that will attract individuals 
with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant 
contribution to the Company’s affairs.
No Director participates in discussions relating to the setting of his 
or her own remuneration.
Fee levels are reviewed on an annual basis.
Malus and clawback
The Remuneration Committee reserves the discretion to apply ‘malus’ by reducing or withholding annual bonus payments from 
the formulaic outcome based on Adjusted EBITDA performance (for example, in the event of misconduct or misstatement of 
financial results). Following payment, the Committee will retain the discretion to ‘claw back’ bonuses in the case of misconduct 
or misstatement of financial results.
The rules of the LTIP include ‘claw-back’ provisions that will apply to Awards granted to Executive Directors and may, if the 
Committee determines, apply to any other Award other than an option granted pursuant to the CSOP Plan.
The provisions apply where it is found (within two years of the vesting of an Award) that there has been a material misstatement 
in the financial results of the Company and/or an act of gross misconduct on the part of the Award Holder (that takes place 
before the vesting date of the Award but only comes to light after the Award vests) and such misstatement or gross misconduct 
has resulted in an Award vesting to a greater extent than it otherwise should have done (“Excessive Award”).
In these circumstances, the Committee may make reductions (up to the value of the Excessive Award) to other Awards held by 
the Award Holder in question which would otherwise vest under the LTIP (including cash awards) and/or require the Award 
holder in question to pay an amount equal to the value of the Excessive Award which has not otherwise been recovered (after 
taking into account any income tax and social security paid by the Award holder in relation to the Excessive Award).
Satisfaction of Share Options and Share Awards
Awards under the LTIP, the PSP, the Sharesave Scheme and the CSOP adopted by the Company in 2010 (“2010 CSOP”) can be 
satisfied using new issue shares, shares held in treasury or shares purchased in the market in conjunction with the Cineworld Group 
Employee Benefit Trust (the “Trust”), established by the Company on 24 March 2006 with independent trustees based in Jersey.
If new issue shares are used, the following limits will be followed:
Æ Æ In any ten-year period, the number of shares which may be issued under the LTIP, the PSP and under any other executive 
share or option scheme established by the Company, and operated on a discretionary basis, may not exceed 5% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time.
Æ Æ In any ten-year period, the number of shares which may be issued under any employees’ share or option scheme established 
by the Company may not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time.
Resulting Total Pay Levels Under Different Scenarios
The chart below illustrates how the potential future compensation of the Executive Directors may vary at different levels of 
performance and the percentage each element may form together with the possible total value.
For the purpose of this chart, the following assumptions have been made:
Æ Æ The base salary levels are those in effect as at the date of the 2018 AGM. Bonus opportunity and LTIP award levels are the 
maximum levels set out in the Policy Table above.
Æ Æ Fixed elements comprise base salary, pension and other benefits.
Æ Æ Benefits levels are assumed to be the same as in 2017 for each Executive Director.
Æ Æ For target performance, assumptions of bonus payout of 67% of maximum and threshold vesting (25%) for LTIP awards have 
been made.
Æ Æ For maximum performance, assumptions of bonus payout of 100% of maximum and maximum vesting (100%) for LTIP awards 
have been made.
Æ Æ No share price increase has been assumed.

Recruitment Remuneration Policy
New Executive Directors will generally be appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and elements as 
described in the Policy Table above. On appointment, base salary level will be set taking into account a range of factors including 
market levels, experience, internal relativities and cost. Annual bonus opportunity will be no greater than 150% of salary and the 
maximum performance share award will be 200% of salary.
For external appointments, although there are no plans to offer additional benefits, cash and/or share-based elements on 
recruitment, the Committee reserves the right to do so when it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company and 
shareholders. Such payments will take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and, to the 
extent possible, would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration.
If it is necessary in the circumstances, the Committee reserves the right to offer a longer initial notice period than one year. 
In such a circumstance, this would reduce to a notice period of at most 12 months.
Shareholders will be informed of any Director appointment and the individual’s remuneration arrangements as soon as 
practicable following the appointment via an announcement to the regulatory news services and on the Group’s website.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according 
to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue.
Service Contracts
The Group’s policy in entering into service contracts with Executive Directors is to enable the recruitment of high-quality 
executives and to obtain protection from their sudden departure, whether or not to competitor companies.
In addition, service contracts are an important element in maintaining protection for the Group’s business and its commercially 
sensitive information.
A summary of the key terms of the Executive Directors’ service contracts is set out below:

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Loss of Office Policy
The Company’s policy is to endeavour to minimise any payment on early termination by insisting on mitigation of any loss where 
possible. To allow the Company to terminate an Executive Director’s employment contract legally so it would not face a claim for 
wrongful termination (although a claim for unfair dismissal could still exist), its policy is to pre-agree arrangements which would 
apply on termination. Only the Company has the right to trigger such arrangements and it has complete discretion as to whether 
it does.
Under the terms of their contracts, the Company may, in lieu of giving notice, terminate an Executive Director’s service contract 
by making a payment equivalent to 100% of base salary and contractual benefits for the notice period. In this event, the 
Executive Director would not be entitled to any bonus for the unworked portion of his notice period, but would be eligible for a 
pro rata bonus for the period up to the date of the termination of his contract.
Where an Executive Director works their notice, pension, benefits and bonus will continue to accrue as normal up until the date 
of the termination. Any bonus entitlement will be paid as normal on a pro-rated basis.
Leaving arrangements under the Share and Share Option Schemes vary:
A. Under the Cineworld Group PLC 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan:
An award will normally lapse upon a participant leaving the employment of the Group unless the participant is a ‘good leaver’ 
(including death, injury, ill-health or disability and redundancy) or the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion otherwise 
determines. Any such discretion would only be applied by the Committee where it considers that continued participation is 
justified by reference to past performance to the date of leaving or because of prevailing circumstances. In such cases, the award 
would generally become exercisable on the original vesting date on a reduced basis taking into account only that part of the 
three-year performance period which has elapsed and subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines other arrangements are justified. In the case of death, options will remain exercisable for a 
period of 12 months following the date of death. Options that have already vested before an Award holder ceases to be employed 
by the Company or by one of its subsidiaries but which have not yet been exercised at the time that the Award holder ceases to be 
so employed (for whatever reason), will remain capable of exercise in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
In the event of a change of control, scheme of arrangement or winding-up of the Company all awards will vest to the extent that 
any performance targets have, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, been satisfied at that time, on a reduced basis 
taking into account only that part of the three-year performance period which has elapsed unless the Remuneration Committee 
in its absolute discretion otherwise determines. Alternatively, with the agreement of the acquiring company, the participants may 
exchange their awards for equivalent options to acquire shares in the acquiring company or its parent company.
B. Under the PSP:
An award will normally lapse upon a participant leaving the employment of the Group due to resignation or ‘for cause’. If a 
participant leaves employment for any other reason, the award would generally become exercisable on the original vesting date 
on a reduced basis taking into account only that part of the three-year performance period which has elapsed and subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions unless the Remuneration Committee determines other arrangements are justified.
In the event of a change of control, scheme of arrangement or winding-up of the Company all awards will vest to the extent that 
any performance targets have, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, been satisfied at that time, on a reduced basis 
taking into account only that part of the three-year performance period which has elapsed unless the Remuneration Committee 
in its absolute discretion otherwise determines. An award, to the extent it becomes exercisable, may be exercised during the 
period of one month after which, to the extent unexercised, the award will lapse. Alternatively, with the agreement of the 
acquiring company, the participants may exchange their awards for equivalent options to acquire shares in the acquiring 
company or its parent company.
C. Under the CSOP:
An option will normally lapse upon a participant leaving the employment of the Group. However, if a participant leaves the Group 
by reason of death, injury, ill health, disability, redundancy, retirement or any other reason as determined by the Remuneration 
Committee or if the company or business for which he works ceases to be part of the Group, then unless the Remuneration 
Committee in its absolute discretion otherwise determines, his option will become exercisable on the original vesting date on 
a reduced basis taking into account only that part of the three-year performance period which has elapsed. An option, to the 
extent it becomes exercisable, may be exercised during the period of six months after which, to the extent unexercised, the 
option shall lapse automatically.
In the event of a change of control, scheme of arrangement or winding-up of the Company all options will vest to the extent that 
any performance targets have, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, been satisfied at that time, on a reduced basis 
taking into account only that part of the three-year performance period which has elapsed unless the Remuneration Committee 
in its absolute discretion otherwise determines. Such options become exercisable for a limited period of time. Alternatively, in the 
case of a takeover, with the agreement of the acquiring company, the participants may exchange their options for equivalent 
options to acquire shares in the acquiring company or its parent company.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 D. Under the Sharesave Scheme:
An option granted may normally not be exercised until the option holder has completed their savings contract and then not more 
than six months thereafter. However, if a participant leaves the Group by reason of death, injury, ill health, disability, redundancy, 
retirement (on reaching 60 years or any other contractual retirement age), or if the company or business for which he works 
ceases to be part of the Group, the option will become exercisable. An option, to the extent it becomes exercisable, may be 
exercised during the period of six months (12 months in the case of death) after which, to the extent unexercised, the option will 
lapse automatically.
In the event of a change of control, scheme of arrangement and/or a winding-up of the Company, options may be exercised for a 
limited period of time. Alternatively, in the case of a takeover, with the agreement of the acquiring company, the participants may 
exchange their options for equivalent options to acquire shares in the acquiring company or its parent company.
Non-Executive Directors
Letters of Appointment
The dates of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors and their notice periods are as follows:
Non-Executive Director Date of appointment Notice period
Anthony Bloom (Chairman) 7 October 2004 1 month
Alicja Kornasiewicz 26 May 2015 1 month
Dean Moore 11 January 2017 1 month
Scott Rosenblum 27 February 2014 1 month
Arni Samuelsson 27 February 2014 1 month
Rick Senat 2 July 2010 1 month
Julie Southern 26 May 2015 1 month
The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, do not have service contracts with the Company. The terms and conditions 
of their appointment as Non-Executive Directors are set out in letters of appointment, which are subject to the provisions of the 
Articles of Association.
It is the Board’s policy that the appointment of each Non-Executive Director is terminable on a short notice unless their 
appointment is terminated by a resolution of the shareholders in general meeting or if they fail to be re-elected by shareholders 
in general meeting when it aims to ensure no notice is necessary.
Where a Non-Executive Director does not serve until the end of his or her term, the policy is to pay the fees due pro rata to the 
date of cessation.
Consideration of Wider Employee Pay
Each year, prior to reviewing the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Team, the 
Remuneration Committee takes into account average levels of salary increases awarded to employees generally. Salary increases 
will normally be broadly in line with those for other employees.
Whilst the Company does not formally consult employees in relation to the Remuneration policy, thorough consideration is given 
to the wider employee workforce when setting executive pay and ensuring appropriate alignment with executives. In addition, 
the Company regularly carries out engagement surveys which enable employees to share their views with management.
Consideration of Shareholder Views in Developing Policy
The Committee is grateful that shareholders have been supportive of its Policy in the past. As appropriate, the Committee will 
continue to engage and communicate with shareholders regarding Cineworld’s Remuneration Policy and take suitable action 
when required.
In considering the proposed changes to this Policy, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account feedback received from 
some shareholders. We also consulted with major shareholders on the proposed changes to the previous Policy introduced in 2017.

Annual Report on Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee and its Role
The Company’s Remuneration Committee comprises Dean Moore, Julie Southern and Rick Senat, who are all considered to be 
independent. The Chair of the Committee is Dean Moore, who took over from Martina King on 11 January 2017.
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are to:
Æ Æ make recommendations to the Board for approval of the Group’s broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the 
Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and the Company’s Senior Management;
Æ Æ determine the specific remuneration packages of the Chairman, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and  
Senior Management;
Æ Æ approve the terms of the service agreements of the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and Senior Management; and
Æ Æ approve the design of, and determine the targets for, any performance related pay schemes and LTIPs.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company’s website (www.cineworldplc.com/about-us/
corporate-governance). The terms are reviewed annually.
The Committee met for four scheduled meetings during the period and details of the members’ attendance record is set out on 
page 38. 
Remuneration Committee Advisors
The Company receives advice in relation to the Remuneration Policy and its implementation in respect of the Chairman, 
Executive Directors, Company Secretary and Senior Management. In September 2017, the Committee appointed PwC as advisors 
to the Committee following a competitive selection process, replacing Willis Towers Watson. The terms of engagement with 
Willis Towers Watson and PwC are available on request from the Company Secretary. 
Willis Towers Watson attended three scheduled meetings during the year at the request of the Committee. Willis Towers 
Watson’s fees for advice to the Committee in 2017 were £44,322 (2016: £80,428). Following the appointment of PwC, there 
were no further scheduled meetings for the remainder of the year. However, PwC will attend scheduled meetings going forward 
at the request of the Committee. No fees were payable to PwC in 2017.
As founder members of the Remuneration Consultants Group, Willis Towers Watson and PwC operate under the Voluntary  
Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. Additionally as a member firm of the ICAEW,  
PwC complies with the ICAEW’s ethical guidelines. As a result, both PwC and Willis Towers Watson operate under rigorous  
rules on independence, compliance and quality assurance. 
Willis Towers Watson has no other connections with the Company except as the actuary to the pension scheme of Adelphi-
Carlton Limited, the Group’s operating company in Ireland. The Committee is satisfied that the advice that Willis Towers Watson 
provided on executive remuneration was objective and independent and that no conflict of interest arose as a result of these 
other services.
PwC has no other connections with Cineworld except as providing internal audit support to the Company’s Risk and Assurance 
team. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by PwC is objective and independent. The Committee is comfortable 
that the PwC engagement partner and team that provide remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with 
the Company that may impair their independence. On appointment as advisors, the Committee reviewed the potential for 
conflicts of interest and judged that there were no conflicts or potential conflicts arising.
The Committee also received assistance from the Chairman of the Company (Anthony Bloom), the Chief Executive Officer 
(Moshe Greidinger), the Deputy Chief Executive Officer (Israel Greidinger), the Senior Vice President of Human Resources  
(Tara Rooney) and the Company Secretary (Fiona Smith), although they did not participate in discussions relating to the  
setting of their own remuneration. The Committee also consulted with the Chief Executive Officer and received 
recommendations from him in respect of changes to remuneration packages for Senior Management.
Board Changes in 2017
As announced last year, on 11 January 2017, Martina King stepped down from the Board, and Nisan Cohen and Dean Moore 
were appointed to the Board. Nisan Cohen became Chief Financial Officer and Dean Moore was appointed as an independent 
Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee and a member of the Audit Committee.

Notes:
(1) See page 62 for details of the other benefits provided to the Executive Directors.
(2) The value of PSP shares vesting in respect of the period has been calculated using a share price of £6.349 being the average price for the last three 
months of the period (as the PSP will not vest until 23 April 2018), and includes payment of a cash sum equivalent to the dividends that would have been 
paid on the vested shares in respect of dividend record dates occurring between grant and vesting. Currently, the dividend equivalent payment to Moshe 
Greidinger would amount to £89,625, the dividend equivalent payment to Israel Greidinger would amount to £61,108, and the dividend equivalent 
payment to Nisan Cohen would amount to £1,711. 
(3) Nisan Cohen and Dean Moore were appointed to the Board on 11 January 2017.
(4) Martina King left the Company on 11 January 2017.
(5) Details of the actual gains made are set out on page 66. The actual figures set out in the table above differ from those included in the 2016 Annual Report 
as last year an estimated value of £5.525 per share was used to calculate the theoretical gain, as the awards had not yet vested. The figures above reflect 
the share price of £7.00 on the date of vesting, 6 June 2017.
Base Salary (audited information)
The base salaries of the Executive Directors are usually reviewed on an annual basis. As described in the Policy, the Committee 
compares the Group’s remuneration packages for its Executive Directors and employees with those for Directors and employees 
of similar seniority in companies whose activities are broadly comparable with the Group. It also takes into account the progress 
made by the Group, contractual considerations and salary increases across the rest of the Group.
The salaries of the CEO and Deputy CEO were increased by 2.5% with effect from 1 July 2017. Following his appointment to the 
Board in January 2017, the CFO did not receive a base salary increase during the year. Average salaries across the Group were 
increased by 2.5%.
Salary levels as at the end of the financial period were:
Moshe Greidinger £577,844 p.a.
(1)
Israel Greidinger £393,984 p.a.
(1)
Nisan Cohen £290,000 p.a.
(1) Part of Moshe Greidinger’s and Israel Greidinger’s salaries are paid in Israel to enable social security and government healthcare deductions to be made.

Pension (audited information)
Executive Directors are invited to participate in a Group Personal Pension Plan, which is a money purchase plan, or alternatively 
may receive a pension allowance in cash. The Executive Directors have elected not to participate in this scheme and instead 
receive a cash pension allowance. For 2017 this was 20% of salary for the CEO and Deputy CEO, and 14.8% of salary for the CFO.
Company pension contributions/allowances for the period were:

Moshe Greidinger 114
Israel Greidinger 78

Other Benefits (audited information)
Benefits in kind for Executive Directors comprised the provision of a company car or car allowance, private mileage, life 
insurance, permanent health insurance and private medical cover.

Israel Greidinger and Moshe Greidinger both received a disturbance allowance of £40,000 for the period as, under the terms 
of their employment contracts, they are required to spend a sufficient and proportionate amount of time at the Company’s head 
office in Brentford, Greater London. The decision was taken to also pay a disturbance allowance to Nisan Cohen of £40,000 
for the period to reflect the significant amount of travel he was required to undertake as part of the Regal acquisition process.
Annual Bonus (audited information)
Annual bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors in the year was a maximum of 100% of base salary. As described in the 
Policy, the annual bonus for the year was determined by a matrix of Adjusted EBITDA compared to budget, and the achievement 
of specified individual objectives. The choice of these measures reflects the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation 
should be tied both to the overall performance of the Group and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can 
directly influence. The weighting between the Group’s financial performance and personal performance was circa 80%:20%. 
The Committee retains the absolute discretion to apply “malus” by reducing or withholding annual bonus payments from the 
formulaic outcome based on Adjusted EBITDA performance (for example, in the event of misconduct or misstatement of 
financial results). 
Personal Objectives
The individual performance element for the CEO, Deputy CEO and CFO for 2017 focused on the strategic growth agenda of 
the Group. For the CEO and Deputy CEO, emphasis was placed on the identification and development of acquisition targets. In 
addition, objectives focused on the successful opening of new cinemas on time and on budget, and the subsequent management 
of those new sites from an operational point of view, the successful delivery of results from the Group’s renovation programme, 
the effectiveness of steps taken to improve the customer experience, the introduction of the latest technology, and maintaining 
strong employee relations. For the CFO, objectives also included ensuring that appropriate financial controls and systems are 
maintained across the Group, maintaining focus on investor relations, and ensuring that the Group’s financial Key Performance 
Indicators are driven and monitored, based on the Group’s strategy.
Performance Against Objectives
The Committee judged the individual objectives to have been achieved at the top level out of five for the CEO, Deputy CEO, and 
the CFO. In making this assessment, the Committee considered a number of factors, including the transformational acquisition of 
Regal Entertainment, the continued profitable growth of the Company, the nine additional cinemas (a total of 109 screens) that 
were opened across the Group during 2017, the completion of four refurbishments in the UK and two in Poland, the introduction 
of a further 11 4DX screens, two new IMAX screens and two new Superscreens, and the progress made in implementing the 
Group’s IT programme. For the customer focused element of the objectives, the continued drive in improving the customer 
experience was considered, including the opening of five new Starbucks sites in the UK, and the expansion of the VIP locations 
(now 12 across the Group). In addition, the strong shareholder support for the Regal acquisition was taken into account in relation 
to the investor focused element of the CFO’s objective, and work in relation to the further strengthening of the finance team and 
the success of the shared service centre in Poland, delivering significant cost savings to the Group.

(1) Relates to unvested awards under the PSP. This figure includes awards made in 2015, 2016 and 2017 as the vesting of the 2015 awards described above 
will not happen until April 2018. No performance conditions apply to Nisan Cohen’s PSP awards granted in 2015 and 2016 as these were granted before 
he became a Director.
(2) Includes ordinary shares held by the Global City Theatres B.V (“Major Shareholder”). Shares in the Major Shareholder are held in trust for the benefit of the 
children of Moshe Greidinger and Israel Greidinger (Israel Greidinger’s entire interest in the Major Shareholder was transferred to a trust for the benefit of 
his children on 6 September 2015 and Moshe Greidinger’s entire interest in the Major Shareholder was transferred to a trust for the benefit of his children  
on 13 October 2016). Following the transfers, Moshe and Israel Greidinger ceased to be beneficially interested in ordinary shares in the Company. However, 
given the family connection described above, the Committee has determined that they will both be considered as meeting the shareholding requirement 
under the Policy. Figures stated above also include individual shareholdings of Moshe and Israel Greidinger following the exercise of their PSP awards in 
June 2017.
(3) Shares are held by a nominee for trusts of which Anthony Bloom is one of the potential discretionary beneficiaries.
The interests of Directors and their connected persons in ordinary shares as at 31 December 2017, including any interests 
in shares and share options provisionally granted under the PSP are presented above.
As described in the Policy, each Executive Director is expected to build up, over a period of time, a holding in shares equal 
to 150% of their base salary. Given the family connection described above in Footnote 2 of the table above, the Remuneration 
Committee has determined that the CEO and Deputy CEO will both be considered as meeting the shareholding requirement.

(1) Up to 2013 these figures solely relate to Stephen Wiener who was CEO up to and including 27 February 2014. For 2014, it represents a combination of two 
months of Stephen Wiener and ten months of Moshe Greidinger who both held the office of CEO during 2014.
(2) The increase in the CEO single figure between 2015 and 2016 primarily relates to the first vesting of a PSP award to the CEO since appointment. The value 
of this award vesting increased due to the significant increase in the Company’s share price over the vesting period.
(3) Moshe Greidinger, CEO, did not have an LTIP which vested in this year. For those who did, the proportion was 100%.
Percentage Increase in CEO Remuneration
The percentage changes in the value of salary, non-pension benefits and bonus between 2016 and 2017 for the CEO and 
employees generally are set out in the table below:

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Cineworld Group Company Share Option Plan
No Director was granted an option during the period and no options vested during the period.
No Director, past or present, holds a CSOP option which will vest in 2018 financial year.
Cineworld Group Sharesave Scheme
No Directors currently participate in the Company’s Sharesave Scheme.
Implementation of Policy in 2018
The Remuneration Committee intends to implement the Policy for 2018 as set out below.
The new salaries of the Executive Directors will be as follows, with increases being effective from 28 February 2018, being the 
closing date of the Regal acquisition:
Moshe Greidinger  £630,000
Israel Greidinger  £505,000
Nisan Cohen  £395,000
For the 2018 financial period the benefits of the Executive Directors will be reviewed in the usual manner.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity will be 150% of salary for the CEO and Deputy CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO.  
In line with the Policy, two-thirds of the bonus will be based on performance against Adjusted EBITDA targets and individual 
strategic objectives, with the remaining third being based on strategic targets, which for FY18 and FY19 will be based on the 
delivery of synergy benefits as a result of the Regal acquisition. Bonus payments will be subject to Committee discretion to 
apply “malus”. Following payment the Committee will retain the discretion to “claw back” bonuses in the case of misconduct 
or misstatement of financial results.
The face value of awards granted under the LTIP in 2018 will be 200% of salary for the CEO and Deputy CEO and 150% of salary 
for the CFO. The calibration of targets for these awards is set out in the table below.
EPS growth performance Vesting level
Less than 8% p.a. Nil
8% p.a. 25%
15% p.a. 100%
Between 8% and 15% p.a. Straight-line basis
In considering the appropriate calibration of targets, the Committee has taken into account both the internal business plan and 
external analyst estimates based on the enlarged Group following the acquisition of Regal. The Committee believes that the 
growth targets are stretching and, if they are achieved, a significant amount of value will have been created for shareholders. 
Given the international nature of the Group, the Committee continues to believe that UK retail price index inflation is a less 
directly relevant factor and will therefore express the targets as absolute growth levels. 
As with the 2017 awards, in addition to the EPS performance condition, the Committee, in its absolute discretion, will need to be 
satisfied that an award holder has performed their duties at a satisfactory level over the three years from date of grant in order 
for awards to vest. The Committee, therefore, will retain the absolute discretion to apply “malus” to unvested awards, by reducing 
or withholding vesting. Following vesting, the Committee will also retain the discretion to claw back LTIP shares in the case of 
misconduct or misstatement of financial result.

on the register on 8 June 2018.

68
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Major Shareholder Voting Arrangements
Global City Theatres B.V. (“GCT”) is interested in aggregate in 
28% of the rights to vote at general meetings of the Company. 
The Company and GCT entered into a relationship agreement 
dated 5 December 2017 to regulate the relationship between 
them. This agreement replaces the agreement between Global 
City Holdings and the Company of 10 January 2014 and is on 
the same terms as the previous relationship agreement. Under 
the relationship agreement, the parties acknowledge that the 
Group is capable of carrying on business independently, and 
that all arrangements between the Company and GCT will be 
on arm’s length terms. The relationship agreement contains 
a requirement (where reasonably practical) to consult with 
and consider the reasonable views of the Chairman or Senior 
Independent Director of the Company prior to a disposal of 
ordinary shares in the Company.
Share Capital and Control
The Company has only one class of share capital formed of 
ordinary shares. All shares forming part of the ordinary share 
capital have the same rights and each carries one vote. Details 
of the share capital, and changes in it over the year, are shown 
in Note 20 to the financial statements.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
Company reports and accounts, to attend and speak at 
general meetings of the Company, to appoint proxies and 
to exercise voting rights.
There are no restrictions on transfers of, or limitations on the 
holding of, ordinary shares and there is also no requirement of 
any prior approval of any transfers other than (i) those which 
may be applicable from time to time under existing laws or 
regulation or (ii) if a person with an interest in 0.25% of the 
issued share capital held in certificated form has been served 
with a disclosure notice and fails to respond with the required 
information concerning interests in that share capital, and (iii) 
in respect of shares issued as consideration in respect of 
the Empire acquisition which were subject to a lock up of 
12 months from 12 August 2016.
No ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard 
to control of the Company. Except as set out in the Major 
Shareholder Voting Arrangements or Share Capital and 
Control sections above, there are no restrictions on voting 
rights attaching to the ordinary shares and the Company is not 
aware of any known agreements between shareholders that 
restrict the transfer of voting rights attached to ordinary 
shares. No treasury shares are held by the Company and no 
shares are held by any trustee in connection with any share 
scheme operated by the Group.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association (“Articles”), together 
with English law, define the Board’s powers. Changes to the 
Articles must be approved by shareholders in accordance 
with the Articles themselves and legislation in force at the 
relevant time.
Change of Control
There are no significant agreements which take effect, alter or 
terminate in the event of a change of control of the Company 
except that under its current banking arrangements a change 
of control may trigger a right for lenders to require early 
repayment of all sums outstanding.
No Director or employee is contractually entitled to 
compensation for loss of office or employment as a result  
of a change in control; however, provisions in the Company’s 
share schemes may cause options or awards granted to 
employees to vest on a change of control.
Issue of New Shares and Authority to Purchase Shares
At the AGM held on 18 May 2017, shareholders gave authority 
for the allotment of shares up to an aggregate nominal value 
of £897,000 subject to certain conditions. This authority will 
expire at the 2018 AGM of the Company or on 17 August 2018, 
whichever is earlier.
Between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017, a total of 
6,334,529 shares were issued. Further details of the 6,334,529 
shares issued in this period are set out in Note 20.
At the AGM held on 18 May 2017, shareholders gave authority 
for the purchase of up to 26,900,000 ordinary shares in the 
Company for cancellation or placing into treasury. No shares 
have been acquired under this authority.
The Board proposes to seek shareholder approval at the 
AGM to renew both the Company’s authority to issue new 
shares and its authority to purchase its own ordinary shares 
for cancellation or placing in treasury. Details of the proposed 
resolutions are set out in the Notice of AGM (the “AGM 
circular”) dispatched or made available to shareholders 
with the Annual Report and Accounts (or on notification 
of its availability).

The Directors who held office at the end of the financial year 
had interests in the ordinary shares of the Company at the 
beginning and end of the year under review as set out in the 
table above.
Details of the interests in the ordinary shares of the Company 
arising under the Group’s share and option schemes are set 
out in the Remuneration Report on page 64. No rights to 
subscribe for shares in or debentures of other Group 
companies were granted to any of the Directors or their 
immediate families, or exercised by them, during the year. 
None of the Directors had any disclosable interest in the 
shares of Group companies other than the Company:
Appointment and Replacement of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association (“Articles”) set out the 
rules governing the appointment and replacement of Directors. 
Under the Articles, one-third of the Directors must retire by 
rotation at the AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for 
re-election each year. A Director must retire (excluding as 
Chairman of the Board and will be counted in the one-third to 
retire), if he was last appointed or reappointed three years or 
more prior to the AGM or has served more than eight years as 
a Non-Executive Director. In addition, any Director appointed 
during the year must stand for election as well. In accordance 
with best practice, however, all the Directors are retiring and 
are offering themselves for re-election or election this year at 
the AGM.
Following the Board evaluation process undertaken in 2017, the 
Board is satisfied that each Director standing for re-election or 
election continues to show the necessary commitment, and to 
be an effective member of the Board due to their skills, 
expertise and business acumen.
Under the terms of the relationship agreement between the 
Company and GCT (described further in the Major Shareholder 
Voting Arrangements section above), GCT has the right to 
appoint one Non-Executive Director (but only if none of Moshe 
Greidinger, Israel Greidinger and Scott Rosenblum are on the 
Board) for so long as it holds at least 10% of the voting rights 
in the Company.
Details of the Directors’ remuneration, and information on their 
service contracts, are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 48 to 67.
Conflicts of Interest
The Articles permit the Board to consider and, if it sees fit, 
to authorise situations where a Director has an interest that 
conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the 
Company. There is in place a formal system for the Board to 
consider authorising such conflicts whereby the Directors 
who have no interest in the matter decide whether to authorise 
the conflict. In deciding whether to authorise the conflict, the 
non-conflicted Directors are required to act in the way which 
they consider would be most likely to promote the success 
of the Company for the benefit of all shareholders and they 
may, and do, impose conditions to be attached to such 
authorisations. The Board believes that the arrangements for 
reporting and considering such conflicts operate effectively.
Directors’ Interests in Contracts
The Group has a number of property lease agreements 
in place with Global City Holdings N.V. (“GCH”) (and or its 
subsidiary undertakings). Further details of the amounts 
paid under these agreements can be found in Note 24 to 
the financial statements. Shares in GCH are held in trust 
for the benefit of the children of Moshe Greidinger and 
Israel Greidinger.
None of the Directors has a material interest in any contract  
of significance to which the Company or a subsidiary was a 
party during the financial year, other than as disclosed above, 
in their service contracts or letters of appointment described 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and in Note 24 to the 
financial statements.
Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance and Indemnity
The Company maintains insurance cover for all Directors and 
Officers of Group companies against liabilities which may be 
incurred by them whilst acting as Directors and Officers.
As at the date of this report, indemnities are in force under 
which the Company has agreed to indemnify the Directors 
as permitted by law and by the Articles against liabilities 
they may incur in the execution of their duties as Directors 
of the Company.
Political Donations
The Group’s policy, which it has followed, is to make no 
donations to political parties.
70
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Employees
The policy is to recruit, employ and develop staff on the 
basis of the suitability of their qualifications and experience, 
regardless of sex, marital status, race, nationality, age, sexual 
orientation or religion. It is Company policy to give full and fair 
consideration to applications for employment from disabled 
people, having regard to their particular abilities and aptitudes. 
Full consideration is given to continuing the employment of 
staff who become disabled, including considering them for 
other reasonable positions and arranging appropriate training.
The health, welfare and development of the Group’s employees 
remain a priority. With the intent of attracting, recruiting, 
developing and retaining key employees, Cineworld maintains 
a number of policies and procedures for the benefit of its 
employees, which can be accessed by employees via the 
Human Resources department and in the UK via the Human 
Resources manual on the Company’s intranet. Continuing 
education, training and development are important to ensure 
the future success of the Group and employee development is 
encouraged through appropriate training. The Group supports 
individuals who wish to obtain appropriate further education 
qualifications and reimburses tuition fees up to a specified level.
Regular and open communication between management and 
employees is essential for motivating the workforce. Briefings 
are held regularly to provide updates on the Group’s business 
and to provide opportunity for questions and feedback. The 
Company also maintains both an internet website which is 
freely accessible and an intranet site accessible to all head 
office employees and at all cinemas in the UK.
The Group encourages the involvement of employees in its 
performance through the operation of a Sharesave Scheme 
in the UK and bonus schemes throughout the Group.
Environmental Matters and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“Defra”) 
have been included in this report (see also “Estimates and 
Exclusions” below).
Table 1 shows Defra’s stated mandatory areas for reporting and how the stated categories apply to the Group.

GHG Emissions Data
The GHG emissions for the Group for the calendar year to 31 December 2017 are shown in Table 2 below in tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).

(1)  Our “facility operation” emissions are entirely made up of refrigerant gas emissions from our air conditioning units. Changes in these emission levels are 
primarily driven by our maintenance regimes. The more servicing and replacement of air conditioning units is undertaken in a particular year, the higher 
this figure is. Therefore, from a carbon management perspective, minimal significance should be placed on fluctuations to this figure, which represents 
1% of total emissions.
(2)  Due to a correction in certain data in relation to electricity in Romania in these categories, these numbers have been corrected and differ from the figures 
reported in the 2016 Annual Report (previously reported as 22,855 and 132,181 respectively).

Estimates and Exclusions
A minimal amount of estimated data was used for electricity 
and gas emissions for some UK meters for December 2017. 
This affects less than 0.1% of total emissions.
Data on fugitive emissions from ROW jurisdictions other than 
Czech Republic and Poland were not available and are 
excluded from the emissions figures given above. Also, Polish 
gas data was captured in local currency and converted into 
kWh. This affects less than 4% of total Group emissions.
Emissions Intensity
The chosen carbon intensity measure is financial turnover. This 
was chosen due to ready availability of the data. The value for 
the year was 161.8 tonnes CO 2e per £m turnover.
For comparison, 2016’s emissions were 151,002 tonnes CO 2e  
at an intensity of 189.3 tonnes CO 2e per £m turnover (using 
corrected figures).
Methodology and Emissions Factors
This report was calculated using the methodology set out  
in Defra’s updated greenhouse gas reporting guidance, 
Environmental Reporting Guidelines (ref. PB 13944), issued  
by Defra in June 2013. Emissions factors are taken from the 
DECC/Defra 2015 update.
Emissions factors for fuels use scope 3 well-to-tank upstream 
additions to account for emissions from sourcing and 
processing fuel. Owned transport emissions include outside-
of-scope additions for biogenic additions. Electricity emissions 
include transmission and distribution losses.

Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware; and each Director has taken all steps that 
he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information, and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
In respect of the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent Company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(“IFRSs as adopted by the EU”) and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 
”Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
Æ Æ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
Æ Æ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, 
relevant, reliable and prudent; 
Æ Æ for the Group financial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU; 
Æ Æ for the parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent Company financial statements; 
Æ Æ assess the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern; and 
Æ Æ use the going concern basis of accounting unless they 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such 
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included  
on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement of the Directors in Respect  
of the Annual Financial Report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
Æ Æ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
Æ Æ the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Independent Auditor’s Report
to the Members of Cineworld Group plc
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Cineworld Group 
plc (“The Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 
which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, 
the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company 
Statement of Financial Position, the Company Statement of 
Changes in Equity and the related notes, including the 
accounting policies in note 1 of the Group financial statements 
and note 26 of the Company financial statements:
In our opinion:
• 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
• 
the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; 
• 
the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting 
standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework; and 
 •
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our 
report to the Audit Committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the directors on 23 August 
2004 prior to the Company becoming a public interest entity. 
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 
11 financial years ended 31 December 2017 as a public interest 
entity and 14 years in total. We have fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the 
Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including 
the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest 
entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard 
were provided.
2  Key audit matters: our assessment of risks  
of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements and include the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect 
on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing 
order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion 
above, together with our key audit procedures to address 
those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our 
results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, 
and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the 
context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The risk Our response
Potential impairment 
of property, plant 
and equipment, 
in relation to an 
individual site 
in Israel.
Risk vs 2016 
Refer to page 44 
(Audit Committee 
Report), page 84 
(accounting policy) 
and page 101 
(financial 
disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
The carrying value of property, 
plant and equipment balances 
at an individual cinema level 
may not be recoverable 
through future cash flows as 
national and local factors, such 
as movie slates or increased 
competition, can materially 
affect site performance. 
One particular cinema in Israel 
is in a developing market that  
is highly sensitive to external 
social and political conditions. 
As such, its low valuation 
headroom presents a risk that 
its carrying value will not be 
supported by the continuing 
operations. 
Impairment testing valuations 
are based upon highly 
judgmental input assumptions. 
The key sensitivities in the 
calculation are the difficulties  
in accurately predicting site 
performance, some of  
which are due to external 
uncontrollable factors. In 
particular, the valuation of  
the site in Israel is materially 
sensitive to future growth 
assumptions for revenue.
Our procedures included evaluating the Group’s key assumptions 
and methodology used in the value in use calculations supporting 
the carrying value of the properly, plant and equipment.
Our sector experience: Evaluating assumptions used, in particular 
those relating to forecast revenue growth and profit margins, 
based on our existing knowledge of the business.
Historical comparisons: Challenging growth assumptions and 
cash flow projections by comparing to recent historical trading 
performance. Assessing the Group’s forecasting process through 
comparison of previous forecasts to actual results and considering 
whether the forecasts used in the most recent impairment tests 
appropriately take into account actual performance during 2017.
Benchmarking assumptions: Comparing the Group’s assumptions 
to internally and externally derived data in relation to key inputs 
such as projected economic growth rates, cost inflation and 
discount rates.
Sensitivity analysis: Performing breakeven analysis on growth 
rate for admissions. 
Assessing transparency: Assessing whether the Group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment 
assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected the risks 
inherent in the valuation of property, plant and equipment. 
Our results
We found the Group’s assessment of potential impairment of 
property, plant and equipment, in relation to the specific cinema 
site in Israel to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).
Parent Company 
financial statements: 
Valuation of 
investments £901.1m 
(2016: £741.4m) and 
recoverability of 
intercompany 
receivables £363.8m 
(2016: £343.2m). 
Risk vs 2016 
Refer to page 88 
(accounting policy) 
and page 127 
(financial 
disclosures).
Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the 
Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries held at cost less 
impairment and intercompany 
receivables represent 99% of 
the Company’s total assets.
We do not consider the 
valuation of these investments 
and recovery of intercompany 
receivables to be at a high risk 
of significant misstatement, or 
to be subject to a significant 
level of judgement. However, 
due to their materiality in the 
context of the Company 
financial statements as a whole, 
this is considered to be the 
area which had the greatest 
effect on our overall audit 
strategy and allocation of 
resources in planning and 
completing our Company audit.
Our procedures included: 
Tests of detail: Comparing a sample of the investment and 
intercompany receivables carrying value to the net assets of  
the investment to identify whether the net asset values of  
the subsidiaries, being an approximation of their minimum 
recoverable amount, were in excess of their carrying amount.
Assessing subsidiary audits: Assessing the work performed by 
the subsidiary audit teams, where possible, on that sample of 
those subsidiaries and considering the results of that work, on 
those subsidiaries’ profits and net assets. Where the subsidiary  
is not subject to component audit for Group reporting purposes  
or a statutory audit, we considered the results of analytical 
procedures performed by the Group team, on those subsidiaries’ 
profits and net assets.
For the investments where the carrying amount exceeded the net 
asset value of the subsidiary, our procedures included evaluating 
key assumptions and methodology used in the value in use 
calculations of the underlying Cash Generating Units.
Our sector experience: Challenging the growth assumptions and 
cash flow projections using our knowledge and historic experience 
of the profitability of the underlying trading Group.
Benchmarking assumptions: Comparing the Group’s assumptions 
to internally and externally derived data in relation to key inputs 
such as projected economic growth rates and discount rates.
Sensitivity analysis: Performing breakeven analysis on growth 
rates and discount rates.
Our results 
We found the Group’s assessment of the recoverability of the 
investment in subsidiaries and intercompany receivables to be 
acceptable (2016: acceptable).
75
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance Independent Auditor’s Report continued
We continue to perform procedures over onerous lease 
provisions £3.6m (2016: £2.4m) but have not assessed it as one 
of the most significant risks in our current year audit as fewer 
leased cinemas are trading at a loss than in the past and as  
a result, the potential for a material error in this area has 
diminished. Therefore, it is not separately identified in our 
report this year.
Further, we have removed the key audit matter in relation  
to the acquisition of the five Empire Cinemas in 2016 as the 
acquisition accounting has been substantially completed. The 
only acquisitions in the current period have been on a much 
smaller scale, such that the potential for a material error is 
much smaller than it was last year.
3  Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £5.2m (2016: £4.5m), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before tax, of which it represents 
4.3% (2016: 4.6%).
Materiality for the parent Company financial statements as  
a whole was set at £3.9m (2016: £3.4m), by reference to 
component materiality. This is lower than the materiality we 
would otherwise have determined by reference to net assets, 
and represents 0.5% of the Company’s net assets (2016: 0.6%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £260,000 
(2016: £225,000), in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group operates in nine countries across the UK and 
Ireland, Central and Eastern Europe and Israel. Of the Group’s 
10 (2016: 10) reporting components, we subjected 4 (2016: 4) 
to full scope audits for Group purposes. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for 
the percentages illustrated opposite.
The remaining 25% (2016: 25%) of total Group revenue, 29% 
(2016: 26%) of the total profits and losses that made up Group 
profit before tax and 14% (2016: 15%) of total Group assets is 
represented by 6 (2016: 6) reporting components. For these 
residual components, we performed analytical procedures 
over financial information at a component level to re-examine 
our assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these.
The Group team instructed component auditors as to the 
significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks 
detailed above and the information to be reported back. The 
Group team approved the following component materialities, 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components:
• 
UK component £3.9m (2016: £3.4m)
 •
 Poland and Israel components £2.9m (2016: £2.5m)

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Most of the audit work on 3 of the 4 audited components 
(2016: 2 of the 4 components) was performed by component 
auditors although our work over impairment of property, plant 
and equipment, impairment of goodwill, onerous lease provisions 
and taxation was performed centrally for the entire Group by 
the Group audit team. The Group team performs the audit of 
the parent Company and the Group consolidation. In 2016 the 
Group team also performed the audit of the UK component.
The Group team visited the component locations in Poland (for 
the Poland component and certain processes relevant to the 
UK component performed in Poland), to assess the audit risk 
and strategy and gain an understanding of the local finance 
environment. Telephone conference meetings were held with 
each component auditor throughout the audit. At the planning 
stage these meetings focused on the audit approach, while 
during the fieldwork and reporting stage they focused on the 
findings and observations reported to the Group team. 
Significant findings were discussed in more detail, and any 
further work deemed necessary by the Group team was then 
performed by the component auditor. The Group team 
inspected the audit files relating to each component audit.
4 We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if:
• 
we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to the directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial 
statements on the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that 
basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; or
 •
the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on 
page 34 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.
5  We have nothing to report on the other information  
in the Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does  
not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and,  
in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial 
statements audit work, the information therein is materially 
misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or  
our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not 
identified material misstatements in the other information. 
Strategic report and directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
• 
we have not identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report and the directors’ report; 
• 
in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 •
in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
Directors’ remuneration report
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. 
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to: 
• 
the directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on 
page 22 that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity; 
• 
the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and 
explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and 
 •
the directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they considered that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability 
statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if:
• 
we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements 
audit and the directors’ statement that they consider  
that the annual report and financial statements taken as  
a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or 
 •
the section of the annual report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance 
Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the 
eleven provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified by the Listing Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.

6  We have nothing to report on the other matters on which 
we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
• 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• 
the parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
 •
we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7 Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 73, 
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the 
financial statements including being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error; assessing the Group and parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or 
the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other 
irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in 
an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted  
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
Irregularities – ability to detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could 
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the 
financial statements from our sector experience, through 
discussion with the directors and other management (as 
required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the 
Group’s/Company’s regulatory and legal correspondence.
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly 
affect the financial statements including financial reporting 
(including related company legislation) and taxation legislation. 
We considered the extent of compliance with those laws and 
regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial 
statements items. 
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout 
our team and remained alert to any indications of non-
compliance throughout the audit. 
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-
detection of non-compliance with relevant laws and 
regulations (irregularities), as these may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal controls. 
8  The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe  
our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance 1. Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
Cineworld Group plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with UK standards including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; these are presented  
on pages 124 to 131.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these Group financial statements.
Information regarding the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position is set out in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review on pages 10 and 11 and the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties section on pages 18 to 22. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officer’s Review on pages 26 to 29. In addition Note 21 to the financial statements 
includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Going Concern
At the year end the Group met its day-to-day working capital requirements through its bank loan, which consisted of a term loan 
and a revolving facility (see Note 16 to the financial statements). 
As a result of the Regal acquisition, on 28 February 2018 the Group restructured its debt arrangements. The previous financing 
arrangements in place as at 31 December 2017 for the Group and Regal Entertainment Group were terminated and superseded 
with the new financing arrangements for the enlarged Group which consist of a USD and Euro term loan totalling $4.1bn and a 
$300.0m revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is subject to springing covenants which are triggered above 35% 
utilisation. 
The enlarged Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the enlarged Group should be able to operate within the level of its new facilities for at least 12 months from the approval 
date of the financial statements, including compliance with the bank facility covenants. The Group therefore continues to adopt 
the going concern basis.
Measurement Convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated  
at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments classified as fair value through the Statement of  
Other Comprehensive Income or as available for sale.
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control 
commences until the date on which control ceases.
Jointly Controlled Entities (Equity Accounted Investees)
Jointly controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual 
agreement and requiring the venturers’ unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. Jointly controlled 
entities are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s 
investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial 
statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense and equity movements of equity accounted 
investees, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses 
exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to £nil and recognition of further 
losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on 
behalf of an investee.
Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are 
eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to 
the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only  
to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Forming Part of the Financial Statements)
84
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1. Accounting Policies continued
Use of non-GAAP Profit and Loss Measures
The Group believes that along with operating profit, the following measures provide additional guidance to the statutory 
measures of the performance of the business during the financial year:
• 
EBITDA
• 
Adjusted EBITDA
• 
Adjusted profit before tax
 •
Adjusted profit after tax
The Group defines EBITDA as Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation. EBITDA is considered a consistent measure 
of the trading performance at a CGU level.
The Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss as Operating profit before 
depreciation and amortisation, onerous leases and other non-cash items, impairments and reversals of impairments, transaction 
and reorganisation costs, gains and losses on disposals of assets and subsidiaries and the settlement of the defined benefit 
pension liability. Adjusted EBITDA is considered an accurate and consistent measure of the Group’s trading performance, items 
adjusted to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA are considered to be outside the Group’s ongoing trading activities.
Adjusted profit before tax is calculated by adding back amortisation of intangible assets (excluding acquired movie distribution 
rights), and certain non cash items and foreign exchange as set out in Note 5. Adjusted profit before tax is an internal measure 
used by management, as they believe it better reflects the underlying performance of the Group and therefore a more 
meaningful comparison of performance from period to period.
Adjusted profit after tax is arrived at by applying the relevant effective tax rate to taxable adjustments and deducting the total 
from adjusted profit before tax.
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.  
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using  
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  
that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are 
translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of  
the transactions.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
Cash Flow Hedges and Interest Swap Policy
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting when recognition 
of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the 
Balance Sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The 
fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the Balance Sheet date, being the present value of the 
quoted forward price.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, 
or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised 
directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
For cash flow hedges, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the Statement of Other 
Comprehensive Income in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
85
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance 1. Accounting Policies continued
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge 
relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in 
equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the Statement of Other 
Comprehensive Income immediately.
Net Investment Hedge
The Group uses net investment hedges to mitigate translation exposure on certain net investments in subsidiary companies. 
Changes in the fair values of hedging instruments are taken directly to the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income together 
with gains or losses on the foreign currency translation of the hedged investments. Until the investment is disposed all of these 
gains or losses are recognised in equity, within the hedging reserve.
Non-Derivative Financial Instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
interest-bearing borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and Other Receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently they are carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method less any impairment losses. A bad debt allowance for receivables is established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of 
the Statement of Cash Flows.
Trade and Other Payables
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Interest-Bearing Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially measured at fair value less attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss 
over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as 
finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under finance leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered 
separately from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower 
of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses.
All other leases are operating leases. These leased assets are not recognised in the Group’s Balance Sheet.
Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to write assets down to their residual values on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are 
as follows:
• 
Land and buildings: freehold properties 50 years
• 
Land and buildings: long leasehold properties including leasehold improvements life of lease
• 
Land and buildings: short leasehold properties including leasehold improvements 30 years or life of lease if shorter
• 
Plant and machinery 3 to 16 years
• 
Fixtures and fittings 3 to 16 years
No depreciation is provided on land, assets held for sale or assets in the course of construction.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items  
of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of all assets are reassessed annually.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
86
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1. Accounting Policies continued
Business Combinations
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred 
(including the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree) and the recognised amount of any non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately 
in the Statement of Profit or Loss. Transactions costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that 
the Group incurs in connection with business combinations are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights 
are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to CGUs and is not amortised but is 
tested annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Distribution rights that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the Statement of Profit or Loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible 
assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested  
for impairment at each Balance Sheet date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. 
Distribution rights are amortised by film title from the date of release of the film, at 50% in the first year of release and 25%  
in each of the two subsequent years. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• 
Brands 10 to 20 years
• 
Distribution rights 3 years
• 
Other intangibles 5 to 10 years
Non-Current Assets Held for Sale
A non-current asset or a group of assets containing a non-current asset (a “disposal group”) is classified as held for sale if its 
carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale 
and sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to the Statement of Profit or Loss. The same applies to gains 
and losses on subsequent remeasurement although gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss. Any 
impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, 
except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment 
property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment once classified as held for sale or distribution are not amortised or depreciated.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the First-In, First-Out (“FIFO”) 
principle. Cost comprises expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and 
condition, and net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated selling costs.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill assets  
that have an indefinite useful economic life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each Balance Sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to 
CGUs and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other intangible assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A CGU is the smallest 
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
groups of assets.
Calculation of Recoverable Amount
The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.
87
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance 1. Accounting Policies continued
Reversals of Impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist as 
a result of a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, including a change in fair value less costs to sell. 
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Employee Benefits
Defined Contribution Pension Plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit  
or Loss as incurred.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of 
future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior years, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value 
of any plan assets.
The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit 
method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of 
economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets 
(excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in the Statement 
of Other Comprehensive Income. The Group determines the net interest expense/(income) on the net defined benefit liability/
(asset) for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual 
year to the then-net defined benefit liability/(asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability/(asset) 
during the year as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined 
benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service 
or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss. The Group recognises gains and 
losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
Share-Based Payment Transactions
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted is 
recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date using the 
Black-Scholes model and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture 
is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Share appreciation rights are also granted by the Group to employees. The fair value of the amount payable to the employee is 
recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value is initially measured at grant date and spread 
over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The fair value of the share appreciation 
rights is measured taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The liability is 
remeasured at each Balance Sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value are recognised in the Statement  
of Profit or Loss.
Government Grants
Government grants are recognised initially as deferred income at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be 
received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. They are then recognised in the Statement of 
Profit or Loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset to which they relate.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market

Revenue
Revenue represents the total amount receivable for goods sold, excluding sales related taxes and intra-group transactions. 
All the Group’s revenue is received from the sale of goods and services:
• 
Box office revenue is recognised on the date of the showing of the film it relates to.
• 
Concessions revenue is recognised at point of sale.
• 
Advertising revenue is recognised over the period the advertisement is shown in cinemas.
• 
Distribution revenue is recognised on the date of the showing of the film it relates to for cinema distribution, for other media 
the revenue is recognised over the life of the distribution contract.
• 
Unlimited card revenue is received annually or monthly in advance. When revenue from the Unlimited card is received annually 
in advance it is recognised on a straight-line basis over the year. Monthly Unlimited card revenue is recognised in the period to 
which it relates.
 •
Other revenue is recognised in the period to which it relates.
Given the nature of the Group’s revenue streams recognition of revenue is not considered to be a significant area of judgement.
Other Operating Income
Other income represents rent receivable and profit on disposals of fixed assets. Rental income is recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the lease.
Expenses
Operating Lease Payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss. Lease incentives received are 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Statement of Profit or Loss as an integral part of the total lease 
expense. Where the Group has operating leases that contain minimum guaranteed rental uplifts over the life of the lease, the 
Group recognises the guaranteed minimum lease payment on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance Lease Payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance 
charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability.
Net Financing Costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable, amortisation of financing costs, unwind of discount on property provisions, 
finance lease interest, net gain/loss on remeasurement of interest rate swaps, interest receivable on funds invested, foreign 
exchange gains and losses and finance costs for defined benefit pension schemes.
Sale and Leaseback
Where the Group enters into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets 
concerned have not been substantially transferred to the lessor, any excess of sales proceeds over the previous carrying amount 
is deferred and recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss over the lease term. At the date of the transaction the assets and 
the associated finance lease liabilities on the Group’s Balance Sheet are stated at the lower of fair value of the leased assets and 
the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Where the Group enters into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets 
concerned have been substantially transferred to the lessor, any excess of sales proceeds over the previous carrying amount  
is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss on completion of the transaction, when the sale and subsequent leaseback  
has been completed at fair value.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss  
and Other Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted  
at the Balance Sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet method, providing temporary differences between the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the 
extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised.

Operating Segments
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and 
incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. An 
operating segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors to make decisions about resources  
to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Significant Accounting Judgements and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year are set out below.
Judgements
The key judgements are:
Business Combinations
When the Group undertakes a business combination, there are specific judgements which need to be made in respect of the 
acquisition accounting. This includes determining the fair value of the acquired total net identifiable assets, with particular 
reference to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, acquired leases and any required provisions. Details of the 
acquisition undertaken by the Group during the year, including the specific judgements taken, are set out in Note 15.
Finance and Operating Leases
When the Group enters into a new lease it is required to consider whether it bears substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset. The Group considers the requirements of IAS 17 “Leases” when determining whether it has an operating or finance lease. 
For the majority of the Group’s leases the determinations are straight forward and the material judgements only relate to a few 
lease arrangements. There are some instances within the Group where the lease arrangements can be up to 99 years in length 
and therefore a judgement has to be made as to whether the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset 
where the asset is not transferred at the end of the lease. In addition for these leases, calculations have to be undertaken to 
ascertain whether, at inception of the lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments represent substantially all of the 
fair value of the leased asset. Determining the present value of the lease payments and the fair value of the leased asset requires 
elements of estimation and judgement in respect of the forward-looking discount rate and assessing if extension options are 
likely to be exercised in the lease contract. The outcome of whether a lease is an operating or a finance lease can have a material 
impact on the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The right of use asset and the finance lease liability on an 
individual lease could be a material asset based on a long lease and average annual rents. The Group is not intending to early 
adopt the new lease accounting standard, IFRS 16 “Leasing”, which will be effective from 1 January 2019.
Estimates
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
year in which the estimate is revised and in any future years affected.
In applying the Group’s accounting policies described above the Directors have identified that the following areas are the key 
estimates that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of Goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis. This requires an estimate of the value in use of 
the CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated. To estimate the value in use, the Group estimates the expected future cash flows 
from the CGU and discounts them to their present value at a determined discount rate, which is appropriate for the territory 
where the goodwill is allocated to.
Forecasting expected cash flows and selecting an appropriate discount rate inherently requires estimation. A sensitivity analysis 
has been performed over the estimates (see Note 10). The resulting calculation is sensitive to the assumptions in respect of future 
cash flows and the discount rate applied. The Directors consider that the assumptions made represent their best estimate of  
the future cash flows generated by the CGUs, and that the discount rate used is appropriate given the risks associated with 
the specific cash flows. Although based on the sensitivity analysis performed there is no impairment charge to goodwill, it is 
considered appropriate to disclose this as an area of significant estimation due to the size of the balance and the fact that it could 
change as a result of future events.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
90
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1. Accounting Policies continued
Impairment of Tangible Fixed Assets
The Group determines whether tangible fixed assets are impaired when indicators of impairments exist or based on the annual 
impairment assessment. The annual assessment requires an estimate of the value in use of the CGUs to which the tangible fixed 
assets are allocated, which is predominantly at the individual cinema site level. Where individual sites; cash flows are not 
considered independent from one another, mainly due to strategic or managerial decisions being made across more than one 
site, they may be combined into a single CGU.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from each cinema and 
discount these to their net present value at a discount rate which is appropriate for the territory where the assets are held.
The resulting calculation is sensitive to the assumptions in respect of future cash flows and the discount rate applied. The 
Directors consider that the assumptions made represent their best estimate of the future cash flows generated by the CGUs,  
and that the discount rates used are appropriate given the risks associated with the specific cash flows. A sensitivity analysis  
has been performed over the estimates (see Note 9).
Tax
In determining the income tax assets and liabilities recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Group is 
required to estimate the outcome of multiple tax years remaining open to tax authority audit in each of the jurisdictions in which 
the Group has companies. The key judgement area for tax is the pricing of cross-border transactions between Group companies, 
in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. In most countries transfer pricing law requires that taxable profits reflect 
arm’s length pricing of intra-group transactions. Determining the arm’s length price of a transaction and the likelihood of 
challenge by local tax authorities is inherently subjective. In making estimates for tax provisioning purposes management make 
use of in-house tax expertise, comparable third party studies prepared by professional advisors and any other information 
available. In the event of an audit the Group may liaise with the relevant taxation authorities to agree an outcome.
The tax liability provided for each tax year and jurisdiction is reassessed in each period to reflect our best estimate of the 
probable outcome in light of all the information available. A final position agreed with a tax authority or through expiry of a tax 
audit period could differ from the estimates made by us which would impact the current tax liability of £21.3m (2016: £10.5m) 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Currently there are no significant ongoing tax audits. Should a tax audit commence this would give additional visibility over 
maximum potential exposures as the tax authorities’ own position becomes clearer. Such developments would then further inform 
our best estimate in line with the approach above. Conversely should tax audit windows close without audits commencing this 
would enable tax provisions to be released. The amount of the current tax liability subject to significant uncertainty is £7.0m, being 
the reduction in the liability if all filed returns are agreed without adjustment. Conversely the liability may increase due to the 
outcome of tax audits or changes in our assessment. Five years of tax returns remain open to audit across multiple jurisdictions. 
Deferred taxes are recognised in respect of temporary differences between the tax treatment and treatment within the financial 
statements for assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent they are expected to be recovered. 
Recoverability is assessed on an ongoing basis. Deferred tax is calculated at the substantively enacted rate which is expected  
to apply in the period the asset or liability is expected to be realised. Although the deferred tax asset recognised may not be 
material, there is still estimation involved in those potential tax assets which remain unrecognised. The nature and amounts of 
unrecognised potential tax assets are disclosed in Note 8 and these are material for the Group. Although the Group does not 
believe that there is a significant risk of a material adjustment to deferred tax assets within the next financial year, there is a 
significant uncertainty existing at each year end and therefore the Group’s overall tax position could change within the next  
12 months.

New Standards and Interpretations
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year. The following standards, amendments 
and interpretations were adopted for the year ended 31 December 2017 and have not had a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group:
• 
Annual improvements to IFRSs
 •
Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (amendments to IFRS 2)
 •
Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28)
 •
IFRIC 22 “Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration”
 •
IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the following standards and interpretations which have been issued but are not 
effective for the year ended 31 December 2017. These standards and interpretations have not been adopted early.
• 
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
• 
IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
 •
IFRS 16 “Leasing”
At 31 December 2017 an initial impact assessment has been performed in respect of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. 
In respect of IFRS 15 a review has been undertaken of the key revenue streams within the Group. For each of the revenue streams 
the five-step model under IFRS 15 has been applied to assess how the revenue stream should be recognised and whether this will 
result in a material change from the approach currently applied by the Group. A summary of the expected impact is outlined 
below for each of the Group’s key revenue streams:
• 
Box office revenue – no changes are expected. 
• 
Concessions revenue – no changes are expected. 
• 
Advertising revenue – the analysis is currently being finalised; however, analysis to date suggests no material changes 
are expected.
• 
Distribution revenue – the analysis is currently being finalised; however, analysis to date suggests no material changes 
are expected.
• 
Membership revenue – the analysis is currently being finalised; however, analysis to date suggests no material changes 
are expected.
• 
Other income – no changes are expected. 
On adoption of IFRS 9 this is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s current accounting in respect of financial 
instruments; however, it is expected there will be changes in the disclosure requirements. A review has been performed against 
IFRS 9 to assess the definitions and accounting treatment for financial assets, financial liabilities, fair value accounting, 
impairments of financial assets and hedge accounting. Particular focus was given to the Group’s interest rate swaps, loans and 
financial liabilities, hedge accounting, receivables and payables balances. 
The adoption of IFRS 16 is expected to materially affect the Group’s lease accounting and financial statements. One of the first 
considerations is the transition method which the Group should adopt. There are three options: fully retrospective; modified; and 
modified retrospective. Each option has a slightly different impact on the financial statements on the initial transition date and 
going forward. Initial assessments have been undertaken for each of these options based on a sample of leases and management 
are in the process of concluding which will be the transition method selected. From the initial analysis performed the Group’s 
profit after tax, operating profit, finance costs EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will be materially affected by the adoption of IFRS 
16. The Group’s finance costs and depreciation charge will materially increase; however, the rental charge for leases classified as 
finance leases under IFRS 16, which will substantially be all of the Group’s property leases, will no longer be recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Group’s Statement of Financial Position will be materially impacted in 
respect of total assets, total liabilities, net debt and equity. For all leases which fall under the scope of IFRS 16 a right of use asset 
and related lease liability will be recognised in the Statement of Financial Position.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, after excluding the weighted average number of non-vested 
ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in the same way except that the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders 
is adjusted by adding back the amortisation of intangible assets recognised as part of business combinations and other one-off 
income or expense and then adjusting for the tax impact on those items which is calculated at the effective tax rate for the 
current year. The performance of adjusted earnings per share is used to determine awards to Executive Directors under the 
Group Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to 
ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of any non-vested ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust 
and after adjusting for the effects of dilutive options.

Group’s bank loans.
Factors that May Affect Future Tax Charges
As at 31 December 2017 the Group had potential UK tax assets relating to the following:
 •
Capital losses of approximately £7.5m (2016: £7.5m)
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on £6.8m (2016: £5.8m) of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries which are 
potentially subject to withholding tax on distribution, as the Group can control the timing of remittances and it is probable that 
no remittance will be made in the foreseeable future. No withholding tax or other taxes are imposed under local tax laws on the 
distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries resident in the majority of the Group’s jurisdictions. 
At 31 December 2017 the Group had unrecognised potential tax assets relating to the following temporary differences:
• 
UK capital losses of £7.5m with no expiry date
 •
Overseas tax losses of £0.5m with no expiry date
It is not considered probable that future taxable profit will be available against which these deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the periods when the assets are 
realised or liabilities settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 31 December 2017.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance 9. Property, Plant and Equipment continued
Impairment
The Group determines whether tangible fixed assets are impaired when indicators of impairment exist or based on the annual 
impairment assessment. The annual assessment requires an estimate of the value in use of the CGUs to which the tangible 
fixed assets are allocated, which is predominantly at the individual cinema site level. Where individual sites’ cash flows are not 
considered independent from one another, mainly due to strategic or managerial decisions being made across more than one 
site, they may be combined into a single CGU.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from each CGU and 
discount these to their net present value at a pre-tax discount rate which is appropriate for the territory where the assets 
are held. A table summarising the rates used, which are derived from externally benchmarked data, is set out below:

(1) For sites which generate significant rental cash flows in addition to cinema cash flows a separate discount rate of 12.75% (2016: £13.06%) was used to 
reflect the specific risks related to those CGUs.
For established sites, expected future cash flows are based on financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors covering  
a one year period. Cash flows beyond the first period are extrapolated using the assumptions used in the impairment model. 
Constant growth rate assumptions are used for projections on established sites. For new sites, where a constant growth would 
not accurately reflect market conditions, more detailed growth assumptions are used for the first five years.

(1) Individual discount rates for each operating territory have been used; a summary is disclosed above.
2018 forecast EBITDA, as defined in Note 1, was used as the basis of the future cash flow calculation. This was adjusted to add 
back rent (EBITDAR). Property costs are factored into the model, but are assumed to grow at 3.0% per annum over the life of  
the model. Cash flows are projected over a 20 year period.
Impairments recognised during the year totalled £0.3m within the UK and Ireland operating segment: £0.1m related to capital 
expenditure on cinema sites for which onerous lease provisions were in place, the remaining £0.2m related to the write off of 
residual assets held at sites which were closed during the year. Impairments for ROW were £0.1m.
Impairment Reversals
A review of future cash flows for previously impaired cinema sites identified improvements in trading performance at one site in 
the UK and one site in the ROW sufficient to recognise a reversal of impairment. An impairment reversal of £5.2m was recognised 
in respect of the site in the UK and £0.4m in respect of the site in the ROW.

Sensitivity to Changes in Assumptions
Impairment reviews are sensitive to changes in key assumptions. Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the established 
CGUs’ calculated recoverable amounts giving consideration to incremental changes in the key assumptions of EBITDAR and 
discount rates.
The cash flow models used in assessing the carrying values of sites opened within the last two years are based on specific 
assumptions made prior to opening in respect of the early growth phase of the sites. Therefore sensitivity analysis is not  
applied to these sites during this time.
The sensitivities applied reflect realistic scenarios which management believe would have the most significant impact on the  
cash flows described above.
Discounts rates are largely derived from market data, and these rates are intended to be long term in nature so therefore should 
be reasonably stable in the short term. However, the models are sensitive to changes in these rates. Increases by a factor of 1% 
and 2% have been applied in the sensitised scenarios on the basis they reflect the range of likely to maximum variances in  
rates applied.
The growth rates for EBITDAR in years 1 and 2 have been reduced to 2%, 1% and nil. EBITDAR sensitivities reflect reductions in 
growth which would largely be driven by changes in admissions and ticket prices. Given the short term admissions trends and 
ticket price inflation, sensitivities applied are believed to reflect a potential downside scenario.
From year 3 onward a lower long-term growth rate is applied, which is in line or below long-term inflation in each territory.  
As such this assumption is already considered prudent and therefore this has not been included as part of the  
sensitivities performed.
When reviewing the outputs of the sensitivity analysis, particular focus is given to material amounts where headroom  
is more limited.
The impact on the total impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used in the first two years and 
the discount rates would be as follows:
Additional 
impairment
£m
EBITDAR growth rate in years 1 – 2 reduced to 2% 0.2
EBITDAR growth rate in years 1 – 2 reduced to 1% 0.3
No growth in EBITDAR growth rate in years 1 – 2 0.4
1 percentage point increase to the discount rates –
2 percentage point increase to the discount rates 0.9
For CGUs which are still in a rapid growth phase and include significant rental cash flows in addition to the cinema cash flows, 
specific local factors should be considered when preparing the forecast admissions which differ from a constant future growth 
rate. Therefore the basic sensitivities highlighted above are not appropriate to be applied. As such these CGUs have been 
excluded from the above analysis and alternative sensitivities, reflecting management’s best estimate of likely possible changes, 
have been applied.
EBITDAR is particularly sensitive to a change in admissions due to its particular growth profile. As such EBITDAR has been 
reduced to reflect an 18% reduction in mature admissions and related cash flows. In assessing the risk associated with these cash 
flows, discount rates have been increased across the various income streams to reflect the maximum expected variances which 
are considered realistic in practice.
From the sensitivity analysis performed, including a mix of downsides when applying admissions decrease and discount rate 
increase, there is still substantial headroom of £7.4m.
Non-current assets held for sale
Subsequent to the year end the Group entered into an agreement for the sale assets which had been held for a proposed 
development in the UK. The sale of these assets will not result in a reduction of the number of sites or screens operated by  
the Group.
The values in the table below represent the net book value of the property, plant and equipment held for sale. As the fair value 
less costs to sell is expected to be in excess of the net book value no impairment is considered necessary.

Impairment Testing
Each individual cinema, or collection of cinemas which are strategically or operationally co-dependent, is considered to be one 
CGU. However, for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, it is acceptable under IAS 36 to group CGUs, in order to 
reflect the level at which goodwill is monitored by management.
The ex-Cine-UK, ex-UGC (including Dublin) and Picturehouse businesses are now fully integrated, meaning that goodwill is now 
monitored on a UK-wide level (2017: £304.7, 2016: £296.8). Cinema City CGUs are considered as separate groups in each territory 
and have been tested for goodwill impairment on this basis, the territories being Poland (2017: £105.8m, 2016: £96.2m), Israel 
(2017: £65.2m, 2016: £64.4m), Hungary (2017: £49.5m, 2016: £47.9m), Romania (2017: £101.1m, 2016: £99.7m), Bulgaria (2017: 
£16.0m, 2016: £15.3m), Czech (2017: £29.4m, 2016: £26.6m) and Slovakia (2017: £3.9m, 2016: £3.7m).
The six sites acquired from Empire Cinemas Limited are considered to have been fully integrated from the date of acquisition as 
there were no support functions included in either acquisition. The acquired goodwill in respect of these transactions is therefore 
included within the UK CGU Group.
The recoverable amounts of UK and Cinema City CGU Groups have been determined based on a value in use calculation. That 
calculation uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period. Cash 
flows beyond the first five year period have been extrapolated using the below assumptions. This growth rate does not exceed 
the long-term average growth rate for the market in which the CGU Groups operate.
The UK business has discounted forecast cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.9% (2016: 9.2%) being a market 
participant’s discount rate. The Cinema City CGU Groups have discounted forecast cash flows using a pre-tax discount rates 
relevant to the operating territory of each CGU Group (see Note 9), being a market participant’s discount rate. This is considered 
to reflect the risks associated with the relevant cash flows for each CGU Group.
The key assumptions used in the cash flow projections for the purpose of the impairment review are as follows:

2018 forecast Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in Note 1, was used as the basis of the future cash flow calculation.
Management have sensitised the key assumptions in the goodwill impairment tests and under both the base case and sensitised 
cases no impairment exists. The key assumptions used and sensitised were forecast cash flows and the relevant discount rate, 
which were selected as they are the key variable elements of the value in use.
A reduction of 10% in the forecast cash flows for each CGU from years 2 to 5 or an increase in the discount rate applied to the 
cash flows of each CGU of 1 or 2 percentage points would not cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount for  
any CGU.

2016 Acquisition of five Empire cinemas
On 28 July 2016 Cineworld Group Plc (the “Group”) announced the acquisition of five Cinemas from Cinema Holdings Limited by 
means of an acquisition of 100% of the shares, including all of the voting rights.
Consideration transferred
The acquisition was completed on 11 August 2016, at which point the consideration equated to £94.5m which would be settled 
equally in cash and in Cineworld Group plc ordinary shares in addition to the transfer of the trade and assets of the Group’s 
Haymarket cinema to Cinema Holdings Limited. The shares were issued in five instalments during a 12 month period, based on 
an issue price reflecting the 20 days’ average trading price prior to the date of each issuance. The first issue of shares took place 
on 18 November 2016 and the last took place on 8 August 2017.

Cash and cash equivalents –
Total net identifiable assets 33.9
Goodwill 60.6
Consideration transferred 94.5
The key judgments considered were as follows:
Property and Leases
The fair value of property, plant and equipment of £42.8m included a number of adjustments. Old cinema equipment and assets 
which were previously held at their residual value of £3.2m were fully depreciated as the residual value is not expected to be 
realised. A fair value adjustment of £3.0m was made in respect of the Bromley site in recognition of the residual value in the 
sellers books being below the current market value.
As well as considering the fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment, management also considered the lease contract 
for each of the cinemas. Where leases include options to extend beyond the existing contracted term this was taken into 
consideration. Two leases held on the Leicester Square site were classified as finance leases and a liability for the fair value of the 
minimum expected lease payments on each recognised; a corresponding asset was recognised in respect of the fair value of the 
lease within Property, Plant and Equipment.
Tax
The acquired deferred tax liability of £0.2m reflects taxable temporary differences on fixed assets at acquisition.
No income tax liability is recognised on acquisition as future tax charges are not expected to arise in respect of tax positions 
open at the date of acquisition.
Identifiable Intangible Assets
There were no identifiable intangible assets recognised on acquisition. Management consider the residual goodwill of £60.6m to 
represent a number of factors including the strategic location of the sites acquired, the established benefit of an established site, 
the value the acquired sites can add to Cineworld’s existing brand and products as well as synergies expected to be realised post 
acquisition. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The revenue included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss for the year ended 31 December 2016 since 11 August 2016 
contributed by the acquired sites was £11.9m. The profit before tax contributed was £2.6m over the same period. Had the five 
cinemas been consolidated from 1 January 2016 (the commencement of the prior financial period), the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit or Loss would show revenue of £814.5m and profit before tax of £101.9m.
Acquisition related costs of £0.5m were charged to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss for 
the year ended 31 December 2016.

2017 Acquisition of Empire cinema
On 15 June 2017 the Group completed the acquisition of the Newcastle cinema from Cinema Holdings Limited by means of an 
acquisition of 100% of the shares. The consideration consists of two elements, the initial consideration of £7.1m plus contingent 
consideration based on the performance of the site over a 24 month period post completion of the refurbishment. The 
contingent consideration has been provisionally estimated at £3.2m based on the expected future performance of the site 
and the market.

The Key Judgments considered were as follows:
Property and Leases
The fair value of property, plant and equipment of £2.1m represents management’s initial assessment of the assets acquired. 
This provisional fair value will be reviewed as further information on the assets acquired becomes available.
As well as considering the fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment, management also considered the lease contracts 
for the cinema; no assets or liabilities were identified in respect of these contracts.
Tax
No income tax liability is recognised on acquisition as future tax charges are not expected to arise in respect of tax positions 
open at the date of acquisition. 
Identifiable Intangible Assets
There were no identifiable intangible assets recognised on acquisition. Management consider the residual Goodwill of £8.2m to 
represent a number of factors including the strategic location of the site acquired, the benefit of an established site, the value the

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance 18. Employee Benefits
Pension Plans
The Group until recently operated two externally funded defined benefit pension schemes, one in the United Kingdom, the MGM 
Pension Scheme, and one in Ireland, the Adelphi-Carlton Limited Contributory Pension Plan.
MGM Scheme
The Scheme was a funded scheme of the defined benefit type, providing retirement benefits based on final salary. The Scheme 
closed to future accrual from 31 May 2009, though the link to final pay at retirement was retained.
On 15 December 2016 the Scheme was bought out by Aviva Annuity UK Limited, with all risks in relation to the Scheme passing 
to Aviva Annuity UK Limited as of the buyout date. This transition was treated as a settlement occurring on 15 December 2016 
(the inception date). Following this transaction, all members of the Scheme have had their benefits secured with Aviva Annuity 
UK Limited, discharging the Group’s legal and constructive obligations for the Scheme. The past service liabilities at 31 December 
2017 and 2016 are therefore shown as £Nil.
The Group engaged its actuary’s assistance in measuring the defined benefit asset for the purposes of IAS 19 revised for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 as well as at the buyout date.
The valuation used for IAS 19 disclosures were based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the Scheme as at 5 April 2015. The 
present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using 
the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses up to the date of the buyout were recognised in the year in which they occurred, but outside the 
Statement of Profit or Loss, through Other Comprehensive Income.
The Group made contributions of £Nil during 2017 (2016: £0.8m).
Following the buyout transaction there is no asset or liability recognised in respect of the fair value of the Scheme, £1.6m (2016: 
£1.6m) is recognised within other receivables in respect of the amount due to the Group from the settlement of the Scheme.
Following the buyout transaction, all members of the Scheme have had their benefits secured with Aviva Annuity UK Limited; 
there is no longer any obligation by the Group to the members of the Scheme.
Funding Requirements
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The last funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out 
by a qualified actuary as at 5 April 2015 and showed a surplus of £1.7m. The Group paid deficit contributions of £0.8m in 2016 
to support the Scheme, following the buyout transaction no further contribution in respect of the Scheme are expected.
Risks Associated with the Scheme
Following the buyout transaction all of the risks in respect of the scheme have been transferred to Aviva Annuity UK Limited. 
Prior to settlement, the Scheme exposed the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which were:
Asset Volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; 
if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The Scheme holds a significant 
proportion of growth assets (equity diversified growth funds and global absolute return 
fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create 
volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure 
it remains appropriate given the Scheme’s long-term objectives.
Changes in Bond Yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the Scheme’s liabilities 
for accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of 
the Scheme’s bond holdings.
Inflation Risk A significant proportion of the Scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher 
inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary 
increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are 
either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in 
inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life Expectancy The majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, 
so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
A contingent liability previously existed in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (“GMP”). The UK 
Government intends to implement legislation which could result in an increase in the value of GMP for males. This would increase 
the defined benefit obligation of the plan. At the buyout date, it was not possible to quantify the impact of this change. The 
buyout premium paid included an estimated additional cost for GMP equalisation and this cost was therefore included in the 
settlement recorded through the Statement of Profit or Loss in 2016,
When the members’ benefits have been fully paid, the rules of the Scheme permit any surplus to revert to the employer 
(the Group). Therefore the surplus on the Scheme has been recognised as an asset. The fair value of plan assets remaining at 
31 December 2016 represent the residual balance following settlement of the Scheme and all risks and obligations transferring 
to Aviva Annuity UK Limited, it is expected that these assets will transfer to the Group on completion of the buyout process.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18. Employee Benefits continued
Adelphi-Carlton Limited Contributory Pension Plan
The Adelphi-Carlton Limited Contributory Pension Plan is closed to new entrants and therefore the current service cost is £Nil. 
The trustees of the Adelphi-Carlton Contributory Pension Plan have not agreed that any surplus on the plan can be refunded 
to the Group. Accordingly the surplus has not been recognised. The Scheme has a surplus of £0.8m as at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £0.8m).
Actuaries for Adelphi-Carlton Limited carried out the last actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 1 April 2016. Based on this 
assessment, the actuarial value of the assets is £2.4m (2016: £2.4m) which is more than sufficient to cover 100% of the benefits 
that had accrued to members. In view of this, a suspension of Group contributions was in force from 1 April 2001 to 31 December 
2016. Total contributions for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 were £Nil and £Nil, respectively. No 
contributions are expected for the year ending 31 December 2018.
Accrued Employee Retirement Rights
Local applicable labour laws and agreements in the ROW require certain Group companies to pay severance pay to dismissed 
or retiring employees (including those leaving their employment under certain other circumstances). The calculation of the 
severance pay liability has been made in accordance with labour agreements in force and based on salary components that, 
in management’s opinion, create entitlement to severance pay.
Group companies’ severance pay liabilities to their employees are funded partially by regular deposits with recognised pension 
and severance pay funds in the employees’ names and by purchase of insurance policies. They are accounted for as if they were 
a defined contribution plan. The amounts funded as above are netted against the related liabilities and are not reflected in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position since they are not under the control and management of the companies.
The amounts of the liability for severance pay presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (see below) reflect 
that part of the liability not covered by the funds and the insurance policies mentioned above, as well as the liability that is 
funded by deposits with recognised central severance pay funds held under the name of the Company’s subsidiaries.
The cost of severance provision is determined according to the projected unit credit method. It has been calculated using 
a discounted cash flow approach. The calculations are based on the following assumptions:
• 
Discount at 31 December 2017 2.08%
 •
Expected returns on plan assets at 31 December 2017 1.73%

EPS means adjusted earnings per share calculated by dividing the profits for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders 
(adjusted by adding back the amortisation of intangible assets and other one one-off income or expense adjusted pro forma and 
applying a tax effect on all adjustments) by the number of ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the period, after excluding 
non-vested ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust at that time and adjusting for the effects of dilutive options.
Further awards over 77,808 shares were made which will vest after three years subject to continued employment only, with

Notes:

(2) The value of PSP shares vesting in respect of the period has been calculated using a share price of £6.349 being the average price for the last three 
months of the period (as the PSP will not vest until 23 April 2018), and includes payment of a cash sum equivalent to the dividends that would have 
 been paid on the vested shares in respect of dividend record dates occurring between grant and vesting. Currently, the dividend equivalent payment  
to Moshe Greidinger would amount to £89,625, the dividend equivalent payment to Israel Greidinger would amount to £61,108, and the dividend 
equivalent payment to Nisan Cohen would amount to £1,711. 
(3) Nisan Cohen and Dean Moore were appointed to the Board on 11 January 2017.
(4) Martina King left the Company on 11 January 2017.
(5) Details of the actual gains made are set out on page 66. The actual figures set out in the table above differ from those included in the 2016 Annual Report 
figures as last year an estimated value of £5.525 per share was used to calculate the theoretical gain, as the awards had not yet vested. The figures above 
reflect the share price of £7.00 on the date of vesting, 6 June 2017.

Other provisions do not require significant judgement and have historically been settled in line with reported values.
Property provisions relate to onerous leases, dilapidations, market rent adjustments and other property liabilities. Market rent 
provisions relate to the fair value of liabilities on leases acquired, which are assessed on acquisition and released over the 
remaining life of the lease.
The property provision includes onerous leases, which are assessed as being the unavoidable costs of the lease obligations in 
excess of the economic benefits expected to be received from operating it. The unavoidable costs of the lease reflect the lease 
net cost of exiting from the contract and are measured as the lower of the net cost of continuing to operate the lease and any 
penalties or other costs from exiting it, measured on a discounted basis. The remaining provision will be utilised over the period 
to the next rent review date or the remaining lease life depending on the term of the lease. This is between one and 30 years (see 
further analysis below).

As set out in Note 25, a further 1,095,705,180 ordinary shares were issued pursuant to the Rights Issue which completed on 
20 February 2018.
Translation Reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Merger Reserve
In accordance with section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, the premium on ordinary shares issued in relation to acquisitions is 
recorded as a merger reserve.
A further £10.7m was transferred to the Merger Reserve from Share Premium during the year in relation to shares issued in 2016 
in connection with the acquisition of five Empire cinemas on 28 July 2016 (see Note 15).
Hedging Reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the liability in relation to the interest rate swaps entered into, to hedge against variable interest 
payments on £125.7m (2016: £147.5m) of the total £328.8m (2016: £322.9m) of bank debt. As hedge accounting has been 
adopted the gains/losses are recorded through equity until such time as the cash flows being hedged occur, when they are 
recycled to the Statement of Profit or Loss. During 2016 a £1.9m gain was recycled through the Statement of Profit or Loss in 
respect of the fair value of cash flow hedges on loans settled during the year.
A foreign currency exposure arises from the Group’s net investment in its Dutch subsidiary, which has a Euro functional currency. 
The risk arises from fluctuations in exchange rates between Sterling and the Euro, which cause the value of the net investment 
to vary.
The Group hedges part of its exposure to changes in the value of the investment arising from variances in Euro to Sterling 
exchange rate. The hedge is designated against the Group’s Euro term loan and €48.0m of the investment in the Dutch 
subsidiary. The loan is designated as the hedging instrument for the changes in value that is attributable to the £GBP/EURO 
spot rate.
The Group assesses effectiveness by comparing changes in the carrying amount of the debt that are attributable to a change in 
spot rate with changes in the value of the investment in the foreign operation due to movements in the spot rate. The Group’s 
policy is to hedge the net investment only to the extent of the debt principal.
The changes in fair value of the hedged item and instrument reflected in the table were recognised in the hedge and foreign 
exchange reserve respectively for the hedged item and hedging instrument.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance 21. Financial Instruments
Overview
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• 
Credit risk
• 
Liquidity risk
 •
Market risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s Risk Management 
Framework. The Group has in place a risk management programme and regular reports are made to the Audit Committee, which 
is tasked with general oversight.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk 
limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to 
reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and 
procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles 
and obligations.
The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and 
procedures and reviews the adequacy of the Risk Management Framework in relation to the risks by the Group. The Group’s 
Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of 
certain risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. However, due to the nature of the Group’s business, trade 
receivables are not significant which limits the related credit risk. The Group’s trade receivables are disclosed in Note 14. Of the 
total balance of £29.6m (2016: £29.8m) due, 75% (2016: 75%) are within credit terms. The bad debt provision as at 2017 is £Nil 
(2016: £Nil), with a bad debt expense in the year of £Nil (2016: £Nil). Based on past experience the Group believes that no 
impairment allowance is necessary in respect of the trade receivables that are past due. The credit risk on liquid funds and 
derivative financial instruments is also limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under 
both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting 
agreements. The amounts disclosed in the table are contractual undiscounted cash flows, including interest payments calculated 
using interest rates in force at each reporting date, so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position.

The Group entered into a five year facility in January 2014 which included term loans of £165.0m and €132.0m and revolving 
credit facilities of £75.0m and €60.0m.
On 29 July 2015 the Group signed an amendment and extension to its existing banking facility which was effective immediately 
upon signing and extends the facility to June 2020. As a result, the term loans were reduced from £157.5m and €126.0m to 
£130.0m and €63.0m. In August 2016 the Group extended the single currency revolving credit facility of £190.0m to £215.0m 
to partly fund the empire acquisition.
At 31 December 2017 the facility remained subject to the existing two covenants: the ratio of EBITDA (as defined in Note 1) to net 
debt and the ratio of EBITDAR (pre-rent EBITDA) to net finance charges. A margin, determined by the results of the covenant 
tests at a given date is added to LIBOR or EURIBOR. The margins currently applicable to the Group are 1.40% on the term loans 
and 1.15% on the revolving credit facility.
On 5 December 2017 the Group entered into a contingent foreign exchange forward contract to hedge its exposure to fluctuations 
in US Dollar to Sterling exchange rates in respect of $2.3bn of the consideration described in note 25. The contract required the 
Group to pay an amount of £1.7bn on 28 February 2018; the payment was contingent on the completion of the Regal acquisition. 
As the cash flows resulting from the contract were contingent on the on the completion of the acquisition associated Rights 
Issue, in accordance with IFRS 9 the financial instrument was not required to be recognised within the Financial Statements at  
31 December 2017.

Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and 
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Foreign Currency Risk
Operating across nine territories increases the Groups exposure to currency risk. Wherever possible, overseas operations will 
fund their day-to-day working capital requirements in local currency with cash generated from operations, naturally hedging 
the currency risk exposure to the Group. Management will continually monitor the level of currency risk exposure, and consider 
hedging where appropriate. Currently the Group considers the currency risk on consolidation of the assets and liabilities of its 
foreign entities to be of low materiality and no hedging has been undertaken.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s policy is to manage its cost of borrowing by securing fixed interest rates on a portion of its term loan.
Whilst fixed-rate interest-bearing debt is not exposed to cash flow interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to 
enjoy a reduction in borrowing costs in markets where rates are falling.
In addition, the fair value risk inherent in fixed-rate borrowing means that the Group is exposed to unplanned costs should debt 
be restructured or repaid early as part of the liquidity management process.
The Group uses interest rate swaps agreed with other parties to hedge a portion of its bank loans that have fixed interest rates. 
Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value, which have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at 
prevailing interest rates.
The Group has hedging arrangements in place to mitigate the potential risk of a material impact arising from interest rate 
fluctuations. At 31 December 2017, the Group had three (2016: seven) interest rate swaps, two GBP denominated swaps which 
hedged 81% (2016: 82%) of the Group’s variable rate GBP unsecured term loan and a remaining Euro denominated swap hedging 
83% (2016: 100%) of the Euro denominated unsecured loan.
The revolver loan, of which £175.0m (2016: £158.0m) was drawn down at the end of the year, is not hedged.

Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments
The Group accounts for fixed-rate derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps) at fair value. The gain or loss on 
remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss except where derivatives qualify 
for hedge accounting when recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged. 
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates would have increased equity by £1.5m (2016: £1.6m) or decreased equity by £1.5m 
(2016: £1.6m) for each swap and would have increased or decreased profit or loss by £Nil (2016: £Nil).
Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis for Variable Rate Instruments
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or loss by 
the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. 
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2016.

Fair Values
Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial instruments that are 
carried in the financial statements.
Short-term debtors, creditors and cash and cash equivalents have been excluded from the following disclosures on the basis that 
their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation to fair value.

Interest rate swaps 0.1 0.1 (1.1) (1.1)
(345.3) (346.9) (338.1) (341.4)
The fair value of derivatives and borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing 
interest rates. The carrying amount of unsecured bank loans is stated net of debt issuance costs and the fair value is stated gross 
of debt issuance costs and is calculated using the market interest rates.
The difference between net carrying amount and estimated fair value reflects unrealised gains or losses inherent in the 
instruments based on valuations at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. The volatile nature of the markets means that 
values at any subsequent date could be significantly different from the values reported above.

Fair Value Hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method. The different levels have been defined 
as follows:
• 
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• 
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 •
Level 3: inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Capital Management
The capital structure of the Group consists of the following items:
2017  
£m
2016  
£m
Cash and cash equivalents 67.5 55.8
Bank loans 329.5 322.0
Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent 834.4 596.0
1,231.4 973.8
The Board of Directors constantly monitors the ongoing capital requirements of the business and has reviewed the current 
gearing ratio, being the ratio of bank debt to equity and considers it appropriate for the Group’s current circumstances. Ratios 
used in the monitoring of debt capital include the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to net debt and the ratio of EBITDAR (pre-rent 
EBITDA) to net finance charges.
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market 
confidence and to sustain future development of the business, to provide returns for shareholders and to optimise the capital 
structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as 
the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders’ equity and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.

The total future minimum sublease payments expected to be received are £18.4m (2016: £17.5m).
Lease Arrangements
The Group enters into operating leases for sites in all territories in UK and Ireland and the ROW. These leases are typically for  
25 – 35 years with rent increases and options to renew leases determined in line with local market practice in each territory. The 
key contractual terms of each lease are taken into consideration when calculating the rental charge over the lease term. There  
are no significant restrictions placed on the Group as a result of its leasing arrangements.

Other Related Party Transactions
Digital Cinema Media Limited (“DCM”) is a joint venture between the Group and Odeon Cinemas Holdings Limited set up on 
10 July 2008. Revenue receivable from DCM in the year ended 31 December 2017 totalled £20.8m (2016: £18.3m) and as at 
31 December 2017 £3.8m (2016: £Nil) was due from DCM in respect of receivables. In addition, the Group has a working capital 
loan outstanding from DCM of £0.5m (2016: £0.5m).
During the year the Group incurred property charges of £8.7m by companies under the ownership of Global City Holdings N.V. 
(“GCH”), which is considered a related party of the Group as Moshe Greidinger and Israel Greidinger are directors in both groups.
Details of subsidiaries held by the Group can be found in Note 29.
25. Post Balance Sheet Events
On the 5 December 2017, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of Regal by means of an acquisition of the entire issued, 
and to be issued, share capital of Regal. The acquisition was based on an implied enterprise value of US$5.8bn. 
Due to the size of the proposed acquisition it was classed as a reverse takeover under the UK Listing Rules. The acquisition of 
Regal completed on 28 February 2018. 
Consideration for the acquisition of $3.4bn was settled fully in cash, funded by the proceeds of the fully underwritten Rights 
Issues at the Rights Issue Price of 157.0 pence per New Ordinary Share, which raised £1.7bn, plus an additional US$4.1bn was 
raised through committed Debt Facilities. The restructured debt arrangement consists of a US Dollar and Euro term loan totalling 
$4.1bn and a $300.0m revolving credit facility. The previous financing arrangements in place as at 31 December 2017 for the 
Group and Regal have been terminated and superseded by the new financing arrangements from 28 February 2018.
As the consideration was entirely paid in cash the acquisition is expected to be accounted for as an acquisition under IFRS 3 
rather than as a reverse takeover acquisition under IFRS 3, notwithstanding the size of the acquisition. 
Given the timing of the acquisition being post the year end and so close to the approval date of the 2017 financial statements, the 
accounting for the acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3 has not yet been prepared and completed and is therefore not disclosed 
in these financial statements.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Financial Statements Corporate Governance 26. Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation 
to the Company’s financial statements.
Basis of Preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost 
accounting rules.
Information regarding the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position is set out in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 29 and the Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 
18 to 22. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial 
Review on pages 26 to 29. In addition, Note 21 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and 
its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following 
disclosures:
• 
a Cash Flow Statement and related notes;
• 
comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets;
• 
disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
• 
disclosures in respect of capital management;
• 
the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;
• 
an additional Balance Sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following the retrospective change  
in accounting policy; and
 •
disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel.
Investments
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for any 
impairment in value.
Impairment
The Group evaluates its investments for financial impairment where events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  
of such assets may not be fully recoverable. When such evaluations indicate that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable value, an impairment in value is recorded.
Deferred Taxation
Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet method, providing temporary differences between the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all temporary differences except as otherwise required by IAS 12.
Share-Based Payment Transactions
The share options programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted is 
recognised as an addition to fixed asset investments with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using an evaluation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options 
were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares options that vest except 
where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Share appreciation rights are also granted by the Company to employees. The fair value of the amount payable to the employee 
is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value is initially measured at grant date and 
spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The fair value of the share 
appreciation rights is measured based on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the instruments were granted. The liability is remeasured at each Balance Sheet date and at settlement date and any changes  
in fair value recognised in profit and loss spread equally over the vesting period.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises an increase in the cost 
of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiary’s 
financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity. Amounts recharged to or reimbursed 
by the subsidiary are recognised as a reduction in the cost of investment in the subsidiary.
Own Shares Held by Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”)
Transactions of the Group sponsored EBT are included in the Group financial information. In particular, the trust’s purchase 
of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
