Strategic report As expected, Emerging Markets 
generated good returns over the past 
year both in absolute terms and relative 
to Developed Markets, and capital flows 
into Emerging Markets have resumed. 
With this favourable backdrop, Ashmore 
continues to deliver strong investment 
performance for clients, and its business 
model has performed as expected with 
good operational and financial performance 
demonstrated by the increase in the Group’s 
revenues, adjusted EBITDA margin and 
diluted EPS. The ongoing improvements in 
economic and political fundamentals across 
Emerging Markets compare favourably 
with the structural growth challenges in the 
developed world, and provide substantial 
opportunities for Ashmore to continue to 
deliver value for clients and shareholders.
Emerging Markets backdrop
Index returns across the main Emerging 
Markets asset classes were strong over 
the year to 30 June 2017 and ranged from 
+6% in external debt to +24% in equities. 
This means that Emerging Markets assets 
continue to outperform their developed 
world counterparts, in both fixed income and 
equity markets. While the rally has not been 
a straight line, the brief interruptions have 
been caused by events in the developed 
world, such as the US election result in 
November 2016. The consequent reset 
in Emerging Markets prices presented 
attractive value opportunities for investors, 
most of whom are underweight the 
asset classes.
Investment performance and AuM 
growth
Ashmore’s investment performance is 
strong, as expected at this point in the 
market cycle, with outperformance relative 
to benchmarks and peers reflecting the 
decisions to add risk when market conditions 
were weaker and Ashmore’s active 
investment processes identified and acted 
upon the significant value available across 
a wide range of asset classes. The market 
recovery is in its early stages, with plenty of 
value still to be captured by active managers. 
The positive outlook, described in more detail 
in the Market review, provides the potential 
for continued outperformance by Ashmore’s 
investment processes that have been 
consistently deployed over the past 25 years. 
As the chart below shows, since its inception 
in 1992, Ashmore’s first fixed income 
fund, EMLIP, has delivered consistent 
outperformance against its benchmark, 
the JP Morgan EMBI GD index, and for 
comparison the S&P 500 equity index.
Ashmore’s assets under management 
increased by 12% over the 12 months 
from US$52.6 billion to US$58.7 billion, 
through positive investment performance 
of US$4.2 billion and net inflows of 
US$1.9 billion. As the cycle turned, gross 
sales momentum picked up and the second 
half of the year delivered consecutive 
quarters of net inflows.
The typical investor is underweight Emerging 
Markets, with an allocation of less than 
10% and in some cases well below 5%, 
compared with representative benchmark 
weights of 20%. This presents a significant 
medium-term growth opportunity, as 
investors should raise allocations towards 
benchmark weights, and those benchmarks 
increasingly reflect the growing relevance 
of Emerging Markets within the world’s 
economy and capital markets.
Financial performance
Reflecting the growth in assets under 
management, the Group’s net revenue 
increased by 11% year-on-year. The 
favourable market environment also provided 
opportunities to generate performance fees, 
although the vast majority (89%) of the 
Group’s fee income continues to be derived 
from recurring net management fees.
The Group’s disciplined control of fixed 
costs limited operating cost growth 
excluding consolidated funds to 7% and 
notwithstanding investment in the rapidly 
expanding local market platforms in countries 
such as Colombia, Indonesia and Saudi 
Arabia. Consequently, the adjusted EBITDA 
margin rose from 62% to 65%. Cash 
generation in the period was strong, with

cash flow excluding consolidated funds of

total regulatory financial resources of £559.4 
million compared with a regulatory capital 
requirement of £111.1 million, and cash and 
cash equivalents excluding amounts held in 
consolidated funds of £420.1 million.

contributing profits of £41.0 million. Diluted 
EPS increased by 31% to 23.7 pence, and 
the Board has proposed a final dividend per 
share of 12.10 pence to give total dividends 
per share of 16.65 pence for the year.
Strategic and business 
developments
There are several prominent themes that will 
affect the asset management industry over 
the medium term, including the increase 
in passive investing in certain markets, 
continual regulatory developments, and, 
partly in response to some of the perceived 
challenges, the industry has seen some 
consolidation activity. 
In relation to recent regulatory developments 
such as MiFID2, Ashmore has been working 
towards the implementation date of January 
2018 and consequently is well prepared and 
believes the impact on its business model 
will be manageable. 
Ashmore’s strategy and business model 
are designed to deliver value to clients 
and shareholders over the longer term by 
growing a high-quality, diversified, focused, 
specialist active investment management 
business. This should mean that Ashmore 
is well placed to deal with any medium-term 
industry challenges and to take advantage 
of the opportunities that may arise.
Phase 1: Emerging Markets investment 
universe continues to grow
The Emerging Markets investment 
universe continues to grow rapidly and 
now comprises US$44.6 trillion of fixed 
income and equity securities, an increase 
of 12% or US$4.7 trillion over the past 12 
months. While the representation of these 
markets in benchmark indices remains 
inadequate, with just 8% of bonds and 18% 
of equities included in indices, this presents a 
substantial set of investment opportunities 
for active investment managers to address 
outside of those securities meeting the 
rigid index eligibility criteria. Furthermore, 
over time, some countries will remove the 
impediments to index inclusion, for example 
by improving foreign investor access to their 
domestic capital markets.
Looking at Emerging Markets fixed 
income securities, the US$20.1 trillion of 
outstanding bonds is dominated by local 
currency issuance comprising 89% of the 
total. When combined with the US$30.3 
trillion of domestic credit outstanding, 
Emerging Markets account for only 27% 
of global finance. Yet Emerging Markets 
generate nearly 58% of global GDP, which 
therefore offers compelling evidence of a 
significantly better investment proposition 
than Developed Markets fixed income where 
73% of global financing is supported by just 
42% of global GDP.
Institutional investors in the developed 
world have limited exposure to Emerging 
Markets, with target weights for a typical 
pension fund being below 10% for fixed 
income and equities. In some cases, actual 
allocations are significantly below targets. 
It therefore remains the case that as 
emerging nations continue to grow more 
rapidly than developed countries, and their 
capital markets increase their representation 
in global markets and benchmark indices, 
the pressure on investors to address this 
underweight position will increase. This 
situation is amplified by the relative value 
arguments in favour of Emerging Markets, 
with attractive yields and equity valuations 
contrasting with the elevated price levels 
and negative real yields prevailing in many 
Developed Markets.
Phase 2: diversification through  
growth in intermediary AuM
The second phase of the Group’s strategy 
looks to diversify its sources of AuM, and 
therefore revenues, through broadening 
access to its distribution channels and 
its client mix. This includes developing a 
meaningful retail business that sources high 
net worth capital through agents such as 
private banks, broker-dealers, wirehouses, 
wealth advisers and other intermediaries.
Over the past five years, the proportion of 
AuM from intermediated retail clients has 
ranged between 9% and 12%. Strong AuM 
growth from clients in Europe, the US and Asia 
ex Japan has all but replaced the anticipated 
run-off of the Japanese retail money raised in 
2010 and 2011, and the proportion of Group 
AuM from these geographies has nearly 
trebled from 4% to 11%.
Ashmore has delivered growth in retail AuM, 
notwithstanding the challenging market 
conditions for much of the period when 
sentiment, and especially retail investor 
attitudes, was negative towards Emerging 
Markets. While retail capital-raising was 
difficult against this backdrop, the Group 
secured new distribution agreements and 
gained intermediaries’ approval for products 
to put it in a stronger position when the cycle 
turned and investor sentiment improved.
Of particular note are the blended debt, 
short duration and frontier equity products, 
which are selling well through retail channels 
in Europe and the US. Asian private bank 
relationships have also delivered growth 
through fixed duration products.
Phase 3: local markets
A key strategic initiative is to develop a 
network of local Emerging Markets asset 
management platforms to capture domestic 
flows. These businesses also provide access 
to global investors wishing to take specialised 
single-country or regional exposure through 
local managers affiliated with Ashmore’s 
strong brand and control culture. While 
many of the businesses are at an early 
stage of development, the network spans 
seven countries, represents a meaningful 
proportion of Ashmore’s employees 
including investment professionals, and 
contributes approximately 5% of Group AuM.
The local businesses are performing as 
expected, with good growth in AuM, 
revenues and profits. During the financial 
year, action was taken to resolve growth 
challenges in some of the weaker-performing

12 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 franchises. This resulted in selling the Turkish 
business to a local, independent manager, 
and introducing a major distribution partner 
to the China joint venture. These actions have 
not only improved the aggregate financial 
performance of the local businesses, but 
have also enabled the Group to provide 
greater support to the businesses that are 
performing well and have created capacity 
to consider other markets.
Clients
Ashmore has a high-quality, diversified 
client base that is largely institutional but 
with a growing contribution from retail 
clients accessed through intermediaries 
such as private banks, broker-dealers 
and wirehouses. Client relationships are 
managed by a 40-strong distribution team 
that is located throughout Ashmore’s 
worldwide office network. This enables 
direct, long-standing relationships to be 
developed, which assists in sustaining client 
engagement throughout the market cycle, 
and ensures that value opportunities can be 
directly discussed as market cycles turn. As 
expected, this type of ‘early adopter’ activity 
has been seen recently from certain of the 
Group’s clients.
The average tenure of client relationship 
has increased over the past two years from 
five years to six years, which implies that 
a greater proportion of the client base has 
experienced a full Emerging Markets cycle 
and seen the value opportunities that can 
arise. It also means that the potential for 
cross-selling increases as clients become 
more familiar with the breadth and depth of 
the Emerging Markets asset classes, and 
with Ashmore’s ability to identify attractive 
investment opportunities.
The Emerging Markets allocation 
opportunity described above is substantial 
and predominantly relates to developed 
world institutions. However, there is an 
additional source of AuM growth accessed 
through the third phase of the Group’s 
strategy, which seeks to manage capital for 
investors domiciled in the emerging world. 
Success here is illustrated by the 33% of 
the Group’s AuM that is sourced from such 
clients, through global client relationships 
and Ashmore’s network of local asset 
management platforms.
Cost efficiency
The Group takes a disciplined approach to 
operating costs and during the year cost 
savings achieved in the global business 
units have enabled continued investment 
in the rapidly-growing local businesses, for 
example in Colombia, Indonesia and Saudi 
Arabia. Group headcount has fallen over the 
period, which largely reflects natural levels 
of turnover and where business processes 
have been made more efficient.
In November 2016, the Group consolidated 
its US operations into its operating hub in 
New York. This locates specialist equities 
investment professionals alongside 
distribution and support functions, and will 
deliver operational efficiencies through the 
combination of the offices.
Brexit
In March 2017, the UK formally started the 
process to leave the European Union (EU), 
triggering a two-year period to determine the 
exit terms for the UK (Brexit). However, there 
remains uncertainty regarding the terms on 
which the UK will leave and the implications 
for the UK financial services industry, notably 
for Ashmore regarding the passporting of 
services into and out of the EU. Ashmore 
will continue to monitor developments 
closely and will take appropriate action 
once there is greater clarity. For now, the 
direct operational implications of Brexit 
are deemed manageable.
Outlook
As described in the Market review, the 
performance of Emerging Markets assets 
over the past year has been strong. 
However, given the significant price moves 
and macroeconomic adjustments undertaken 
over the past cycle, there remains substantial 
value available across the Emerging 
Markets asset classes, in absolute terms 
but also relative to developed world assets. 
Ashmore’s strategy to capitalise on Emerging 
Markets growth, its proven investment 
processes, and its efficient business model, 
mean it is in a strong position to continue 
to deliver superior investment performance 
for clients, to raise investor allocations to 
Emerging Markets, and to generate further 
value for shareholders.
People and culture
Ashmore’s distinctive culture, underpinned 
by its remuneration philosophy that places 
an emphasis on pay-for-performance and 
long-dated equity incentivisation, has 
withstood another market cycle. The superior 
investment performance and improving 
financial performance delivered over the 
past year, together with strategic and 
operational developments, are testament 
to the hard work of all employees, for which 
I would like to say thank you on behalf of 
all shareholders.

Measure Assets under management Investment performance
Definition
The movement between opening and closing 
AuM provides an indication of the overall 
success of the business during the period, 
in terms of subscriptions, redemptions and 
investment performance.
The average AuM level during the period, 
along with the average margins achieved, 
determines the level of management 
fee revenues.
The proportion of relevant Group AuM that is 
outperforming benchmarks on a gross basis, 
over one year, three years and five years. The 
gross basis reflects the largely institutional 
nature of the client base, typically with the 
ability to agree bespoke fee arrangements. 
Funds without a performance benchmark 
are excluded, specifically those in the 
Alternatives and Overlay/liquidity themes.
Relevance to strategy
The Group’s strategy seeks to capitalise on 
the growth trends across Emerging Markets. 
This is ultimately reflected in AuM growth 
over time.
The Group’s success is dependent on 
delivering investment performance for 
clients, who typically look at performance 
over the medium to long term.
Long-term performance Assets under management Investment performance (three years)
AuM increased by 12% through net inflows 
of US$1.9 billion and positive investment 
performance of US$4.2 billion. Average AuM 
increased by 5% to US$54.8 billion.
Ashmore continues to deliver strong 
investment performance for clients, over 
one, three and five years.

Adjusted EBITDA margin Diluted EPS Balance sheet
The adjusted EBITDA margin measures 
operating profit excluding depreciation and 
amortisation against net revenues. To provide 
a meaningful assessment of the Group’s 
operating performance, the measure 
excludes foreign exchange translation 
and seed capital items.
Profit attributable to equity holders of the 
parent divided by the weighted average of 
all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group maintains a strong balance sheet 
through the cycle. This is measured by the 
total value of capital resources available to 
the Group, defined as capital and reserves 
attributable to equity holders of the parent 
less goodwill and intangible assets less 
investments in associates, and comparing 
this with the consolidated regulatory capital 
requirement (see Note 21 to the financial 
statements), to provide a solvency ratio.
Delivering a high profit margin demonstrates 
the Group’s scalable operating platform, 
enables investment in future growth 
opportunities, supports cash generation to 
sustain a strong balance sheet, and provides 
for attractive returns to shareholders.
The earnings per share reflect the overall 
financial performance of the Group in the 
period, and represent an aspect of value 
creation for shareholders.
A strong balance sheet enables the Group 
to build a diversified client base, provides 
opportunities for investment to grow the 
business including the seeding of funds, 
and supports the Group’s dividend policy.
Adjusted EBITDA margin Diluted EPS Solvency ratio
Diluted EPS increased by 31% versus 
the prior year, as a result of good revenue 
growth, disciplined cost control together with 
higher gains on seed capital investments.
The Group’s capital position remains strong, 
with total financial resources equivalent 
to approximately four times its regulatory 
capital requirement.
The increases in AuM and revenues versus 
the prior financial year, combined with 
ongoing strict control of operating costs, 
have delivered a higher adjusted EBITDA 
margin for the year.

in Emerging Markets
Georgia is a frontier market with huge growth potential. Its GDP per 
capita is US$10,000 and has been growing rapidly as economic and 
legislative reforms are implemented.
Ashmore invests in healthcare projects selectively across the broad 
Emerging Markets universe and in Georgia the sector is especially 
attractive. The relative spend on healthcare is high and there is a 
growing demand for private services supported by supply-side 
reforms linked to the universal provision of healthcare.

large and diverse, and offers substantial growth 
opportunities as countries’ economic, social and 
political characteristics converge with those of the 
developed world over time. Notwithstanding the 
strong growth seen since the end of the 1990s, 
the emerging world is on average still nearly four

Market review
Positive trends across Emerging Markets
Year in review
The year to 30 June 2017 has been positive 
for Emerging Markets investors. Developed 
world central banks have become more 
hawkish, which has put pressure on the 
returns available from their fixed income 
markets that still have a significant amount, 
nearly US$9 trillion, of bonds with negative 
yields and a further substantial amount 
with historically low real yields. In contrast, 
Emerging Markets central banks have been 
cutting rates as inflation is falling in response 
to the macro adjustments undertaken in 
recent years. Emerging Markets bonds and 
currencies have therefore performed well in 
absolute terms, but also relative to developed 
world assets.
Equity markets have performed strongly, 
and the high absolute and relative returns 
achieved in Emerging Markets reflect 
accelerating GDP growth across a wide 
range of countries as their economic 
cycles turn more positive after a period 
of adjustment.
A weaker US dollar has contributed to good 
returns for local currency investors, and more 
stable commodity prices over the period, 
particularly oil, have improved investor 
sentiment towards Emerging Markets.
The geopolitical landscape remains complex. 
While the US and UK have seen a significant 
degree of political change over the 12 
months, Europe now appears more settled 
following the French presidential election. 
Events on the Korean peninsula and in the 
Middle East continue to act as sources of 
volatility for many markets.
Resilience of Emerging Markets
The long-term growth opportunity across 
Emerging Markets is significant and 
is in contrast to the structural growth 
impediments facing many Developed 
Markets. Emerging Markets generate 58% 
of world GDP and this share is expected 
to rise steadily as the 87% of the world’s 
population that resides in these countries 
becomes wealthier over time. Consequently, 
GDP per capita in Emerging Markets, which 
today is roughly where the developed world 
was in 1980, is expected to continue to 
increase at a fast pace.
In the shorter term, Emerging Markets 
countries have faced and successfully dealt 
with a series of financial and economic 
challenges. Between 2010 and 2015, the 
‘US taper tantrum’, a stronger US dollar, the 
50% fall in commodity prices and the start 
of the Fed rate hiking cycle all presented 
headwinds. Emerging Markets economies 
grew more slowly over this period as 
global asset allocators moved capital to 
investments supported by quantitative 
easing (QE) in Developed Markets.
Yet, despite these headwinds, Emerging 
Markets economic and political fundamentals 
held up far better than most investors 
expected. Aggregate GDP growth remained 
at least twice that of the developed world, 
and the Emerging Markets growth premium 
began to increase again in early 2016 and 
looks set to continue to expand for several 
more years.

The resilience of Emerging Markets can be 
seen elsewhere. For example, sovereign 
defaults were limited in number and very few 
countries had to resort to IMF support over 
this period, barring a small number of the 
most vulnerable economies. In the Emerging 
Markets corporate high yield sector, default 
rates remain materially lower than for 
similarly-rated US companies.
This resilience can be attributed to Emerging 
Markets’ stronger fundamentals, such as 
low debt levels, inflation targeting by central 
banks, the establishment of domestic 
pension funds, greater prevalence of floating 
exchange rates with high levels of foreign 
exchange reserves, high savings and 
investment rates, room to ease both fiscal 
and monetary policies, better demographics, 
and a greater proclivity to reform as soon as 
challenges arise.
Therefore, the weakness in Emerging 
Markets asset prices in the recent past was 
primarily the result of investor behaviour and 
capital flows during the QE period rather than 
deterioration in the underlying fundamentals. 
This implies that substantial value has been 
created for Emerging Markets investors, a 
situation that began to be recognised over 
the past year.
Emerging Markets investment universes Attractive yields available in Emerging Markets
18 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Market recovery appears 
sustainable
Emerging Markets valuations remain 
attractive relative to comparable investments 
in Developed Markets, but they are also 
attractive in their own right. The principal 
drivers of Emerging Markets returns over the 
next few years are likely to be as follows.
 – GDP growth has been accelerating since 
2015 and should continue to recover given 
the large slowdown in growth between 
2010 and 2015. The recovery so far has 
been led by improving external balances 
as exchange rates fell to 13-year lows, 
but economic conditions should continue 
to improve as capital flows return to 
Emerging Markets.
 – Many Emerging Markets countries 
have pursued deep structural reforms in 
recent years, including Argentina, Brazil, 
Colombia, India, Indonesia, Mexico and 
Russia. Successful reforms remove the 
obstacles to growth and allow countries 
to grow faster before encountering 
inflationary constraints.
 – Most foreign investors have underweight 
allocations to Emerging Markets, typically 
at less than 10% versus the 20% weight in 
the more representative global indices.
 – Foreign investor capital flows back into 
Emerging Markets should ease financial 
conditions, which in turn will stimulate 
economic growth. Hence, the QE-related 
financial tightening of recent years should 
start to be reversed. This should support 
returns in local markets as well as leading 
to tighter spreads on external debt.
Active management can mitigate 
the risks
There are risks to this optimistic outlook, 
but the major systemic risks to Emerging 
Markets, such as a decline in commodity 
prices and US dollar strength, have already 
been endured and have been largely 
managed well by the majority of Emerging 
Markets countries.
There will always be a small number of 
country specific risks, however these can 
be addressed through active management. 
Similarly, buying opportunities for active 
investors can be presented by price volatility 
induced by events in Developed Markets that 
may have little or no bearing on Emerging 
Markets fundamentals.
Higher US interest rates appear to be more 
than priced in by the relative yields available 
across Emerging Markets. Indeed, as rates 
continue to rise in the US, spreads on US 
dollar-denominated Emerging Markets debt 
have substantial room to compress so as to 
continue to deliver outperformance against 
US Treasuries.
One of the external risks, particularly to local 
currency markets, appeared to be the threat 
of a US border adjustment tax, which could 
have undermined the case for capital flowing 
back into faster-growing Emerging Markets 
economies in favour of supporting domestic 
US production. However, this threat has 
receded with the US administration recently 
abandoning this policy.
Significant value available across 
Emerging Markets
Although Emerging Markets assets have 
performed well recently, there remains 
substantial value available and the recovery 
should be supported over the medium term 
by inbound capital flows from underweight 
foreign institutional investors. These are likely 
to proceed at a measured pace because 
investors are mindful of the market volatility 
caused by the 2013 US taper tantrum and, 
ironically, there is a degree of risk aversion 
influenced by concerns about elevated 
asset price levels in Developed Markets. As 
evidenced by the high yields and attractive 
equity valuations in Emerging Markets, 
there is a very significant value opportunity 
available and specialist, active investment 
management can deliver outperformance 
across a broad range of Emerging Markets 
asset classes.

Strategic report Market review continued
External debt
The JP Morgan EMBI GD benchmark 
index delivered a +6.0% return over the 
12 months, but with a wide dispersion of 
returns from the 65 constituent countries 
ranging from Venezuela with a +29.9% 
return to Philippines with a –1.5% return. 
High yield credits performed particularly 
well, returning +10.0% over the year versus 
+2.6% for investment grade bonds.
Over three years, Ashmore’s external debt 
broad composite has generated gross 
annualised returns of +6.8%, outperforming 
the index (+5.4% annualised).
The outlook for external debt returns over the 
next few years is positive, with a spread of 
approximately 300bps over the US Treasury 
curve providing good value and with the 
potential for tighter spreads as flows to 
Emerging Markets pick up and reduce the 
need for governments to raise new debt. 
Also, with more than 100 Emerging Markets 
countries yet to issue index-eligible sovereign 
debt, the diversity of the external debt 
benchmark should continue to increase.
Local currency
The JP Morgan GBI-EM GD index performed 
in line with hard currency bonds, returning 
+6.4% over the year. The index yield of 
6.5% is attractive in nominal and real terms, 
with index-weighted inflation of around 4%, 
and stronger Emerging Markets currencies 
against the US dollar contributing to returns.
Over three years, Ashmore’s local currency 
bonds composite has returned -1.7% 
gross annualised, outperforming the index 
(-2.8% annualised).
While inflation is expected to rise slightly, 
real yields should remain positive and 
currencies have room to recover some 
of the 40% to 50% decline in value 
experienced against the US dollar between 
2010 and 2015. The value proposition 
available in local currency bonds is therefore 
one of the strongest in global fixed income 
and, as capital flows back into local markets, 
financial conditions should ease, stimulating 
investment, consumption and growth across 
Emerging Markets. As with external debt, 
the index diversity is increasing steadily with 
the number of countries in the GBI-EM GD 
index rising from 15 to 17 over the past year.
Corporate debt
The CEMBI BD benchmark index delivered 
a +6.8% return over the 12 months and, 
echoing the performance of sovereign 
bonds, high yield outperformed investment 
grade (+11.6% versus +3.9%). The HY 
default rate fell from 4.2% to 2.2% over the 
period and remains well below the US HY 
default rate of 4.4%, reflecting the greater 
diversification of the Emerging Markets 
universe, less use of financial leverage, 
and the potential for sovereign support in 
certain cases.
Ashmore’s corporate debt composite 
performed in line with the benchmark over 
three years with gross annualised returns 
of +4.9%. The relative performance should 
continue to improve as the periods of 
underperformance in late 2014 and early 
2015 roll off.
The fundamental outlook for Emerging 
Markets corporates is expected to benefit 
from the cyclical upswing described for 
sovereign credit, as it will lead to rising profits 
and falling default risk. When compared 
with US corporates, there is a clear value 
argument in favour of Emerging Markets 
credit, as it has a lower default rate, wider 
spreads, particularly in the HY market, and 
typically less leverage than identically-rated 
US companies.
Blended debt
The standard blended debt benchmark index 
returned +5.9% over the year.
Active management of investment theme 
allocations – external debt, local currency 
and corporate debt – has delivered significant 
outperformance over three years, with 
Ashmore’s blended debt composite returning 
+4.7% gross annualised versus +1.4% for 
the benchmark index. The typical blended 
debt portfolio is positioned for further market 
strength, with a current overweight allocation 
to local currency markets.
Given the wide range of asset class returns 
typically available, investors allocating 
to Emerging Markets may not have the 
confidence or experience to target a discrete 
asset class. Ashmore’s blended debt and 
multi-asset products can provide broad-
based exposure to Emerging Markets 
fixed income and all investment themes, 
respectively, with active management 
producing significant outperformance versus 
the constituent asset classes. Blended debt 
is therefore expected to enjoy good growth 
as industry allocations increase.
Equities
Equities outperformed fixed income over the 
year, reflecting expectations of accelerating 
GDP growth. The Group’s specialist products 
provide a range of risk and return profiles, 
from single country exposure to frontier 
equities and global Emerging Markets 
small cap. Over three years, the investment 
performance track records of these funds 
are strong with, for example, frontier equities 
delivering gross annualised returns of +5.0% 
versus -3.4% for the MSCI benchmark index.
The uncorrelated returns available from 
specialist equity products are highly 
attractive, and with investment opportunities 
typically driven by domestic factors such as 
infrastructure development or deregulation, 
they can be insulated from the vagaries of 
global macro forces.
Alternatives
Capital raising in the period was focused 
on a number of new funds in the Group’s 
local market franchises, such as Colombia 
and Saudi Arabia. There are several 
established growth trends in Emerging 
Markets that require long-term investment, 
such as infrastructure development, private 
healthcare provision, and renewable energy. 
The Group’s experience of structuring 
funds and sourcing investors who can make 
multi-year capital commitments means it 
is in a good position to capitalise on these 
growth trends.
Multi-asset
As described above, multi-asset products 
provide broad access to retail and institutional 
investors that do not wish to take more 
specific Emerging Markets risks. Investment 
performance was positive over the period 
across the Group’s multi-asset funds.
Overlay/liquidity
The investment theme increased its AuM 
over the year through net inflows from 
institutional clients, particularly in the 
second half.

through diversification
Although still a major exporter of natural products such as rubber  
and palm oil, Malaysia is increasingly becoming a centre for  
the manufacture of high-tech goods.
A clear example is in the manufacture of semiconductors, a 
sub-sector that dominates the exports of electrical and electronic 
products and represents 20% of Malaysia’s total exports. The 
presence of major multinational corporations such as Intel and 
AMD has undoubtedly contributed to the steady growth of the 
semiconductor industry in Malaysia.

Strategic report Business review
Ashmore delivered a strong operating and 
financial performance for the year with a 
12% increase in AuM, 11% revenue growth, 
cost growth limited to 7% (excluding 
consolidated funds) and strong returns on 
seed capital generating a 23% increase in 
profit before tax to £206.2 million. Diluted 
EPS increased by 31% to 23.7p.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year was £161.1 
million, an increase of 23% compared with 
the prior year, and resulting in an increase 
in the adjusted EBITDA margin from 62% 
to 65%.
Assets under management
AuM increased by 12% over the year from 
US$52.6 billion to US$58.7 billion, through 
gross subscriptions of US$14.8 billion, 
approximately double the prior year level 
of US$7.6 billion, lower gross redemptions 
of US$12.9 billion (FY2015/16: US$15.1 
billion) and positive investment performance 
of US$4.2 billion (FY2015/16: US$1.2 
billion). Average assets under management 
increased by 5% to US$54.8 billion.
Gross subscriptions represent 28% of 
opening AuM (FY2015/16: 13%) and gross 
redemptions represent 25% (FY2015/16: 
26%). Sales momentum improved 
throughout the year as Emerging Markets 
rallied and Ashmore's investment processes 
delivered outperformance. Client demand 
was fairly broadly spread across the fixed 
income and equities themes. 
In the blended debt theme, which saw the 
highest level of subscriptions, there was 
notable demand from US pension funds and 
European retail clients. Corporate debt also 
generated good flows, particularly into short 
duration funds from European retail clients. 
Subscriptions into the other fixed income 
themes were from a broad mix of Asian and 
European pension funds, government-related 
clients and retail investors sourced through 
intermediaries. Equities saw momentum in 
the specialist products, particularly frontier 
markets, and local market platforms such as 
Indonesia including global institutional clients 
allocating to single country funds. There 
were also meaningful flows into the 
overlay theme.
Redemptions picked up for a short period 
after the US election result in November 
2016, but reduced steadily through the 
second half of the year, notwithstanding 
some large institutional account withdrawals 
from blended debt, corporate debt and 
local currency mandates. The result was a 
much improved net flow performance in the 
second half of the year, with US$2.6 billion of 
net inflows versus a net outflow of US$0.7 
billion in the first half. The larger institutional 
redemptions experienced in the period were 
from a variety of US and European pension 
funds in blended debt, corporate debt and 
equities, and government-related clients in 
the external debt and local currency themes.
The momentum in the third-party 
intermediary business continued to build 
during the period, with net inflows of 
US$1.2 billion after anticipated Japanese 
retail redemptions of US$0.2 billion. Short 
duration, specialist equity and blended debt 
products continue to benefit from good 
demand from retail clients in Europe, the 
US and Asia.

Investor profile
The Group’s client base remains 
predominantly institutional in nature, with 
88% (30 June 2016: 90%) of AuM from such 
clients. Ashmore has established direct, 
long-term relationships with its institutional 
clients, the most significant categories of 
which are government-related entities (such 
as central banks, sovereign wealth funds and 
pension schemes) and private and public 
pension plans, together accounting for 68% 
of AuM (30 June 2016: 70%). AuM sourced 
through intermediaries, which provide 
the Group with access to retail markets, 
increased to 12% of the Group's total AuM 
(30 June 2016: 10%).
Segregated accounts represent 67% of 
AuM (30 June 2016: 69%), and the Group 
continues to expect institutional demand 
for such fund structures to increase to 
satisfy regulatory obligations, to enable the 
application of specific investment guidelines, 
and to provide for bespoke reporting.
AuM as invested
The charts on page 26 show AuM ‘as 
invested’ by underlying asset class, which 
adjusts from ‘by mandate’ to take account 
of the allocation into the underlying asset 
class of the multi-asset and blended debt 
themes; and of crossover investment 
from within certain external debt funds.
The Group’s AuM by investment destination 
is diversified geographically and broadly 
consistent with the prior year, with 37% in 
Latin America, 23% in Asia Pacific, 12% 
in the Middle East and Africa, and 28% in 
Eastern Europe.
Financial review
Revenues
Net revenue increased 11% from £232.5 
million to £257.6 million, with higher net 
management fees driven by growth in 
AuM and a beneficial average GBP:USD 
rate compared with the prior year. 
Stronger markets enabled a higher level 
of performance fees to be generated, 
which offset lower foreign exchange 
translation revenues.
Management fee income net of distribution 
costs rose by 13% to £221.6 million 
(FY2015/16: £195.9 million). Good AuM 
growth and the benefit of a stronger 
US dollar against Sterling more than 
offset the reduction in the aggregate net 
management fee margin from 55bps 
to 52bps.
The majority of the movement is accounted 
for by changes in investment theme mix and 
mandate size effects. The former reflects 
growth in lower margin themes such as 
overlay/liquidity and lower average AuM 
in higher margin themes such as equities 
and multi-asset. The latter is attributable to 
individually small redemptions late in the 
prior year and early in the current financial 
year, particularly in the external debt, local 
currency, equities and multi-asset themes, 
and large institutional subscriptions in the 
local currency and equity themes. The 
alternatives margin reflects institutional 
rebates granted on two funds in realisation 
phase and the underlying run-rate theme 
margin is around 130bps.
Performance fees of £28.3 million 
(FY2015/16: £10.4 million) were generated 
during the year, reflecting good market 
conditions. At 30 June 2017, 12% of 
the Group’s AuM was eligible to earn 
performance fees (30 June 2016: 14%), 
of which a significant proportion is subject 
to rebate agreements.
Translation of the Group’s non-Sterling 
assets and liabilities at the period end 
resulted in a foreign exchange gain of 
£7.8 million (FY2015/16: £21.0 million), 
reflecting US dollar strength against Sterling. 
The Group recognised net realised and 
unrealised hedging losses of £2.8 million 
(FY2015/16: £1.1 million gain) to give total 
foreign exchange revenues of £5.0 million 
(FY2015/16: £22.1 million).

Operating costs
Total operating costs of £100.7 million 
(FY2015/16: £92.3 million) include £4.9 
million of consolidated fund expenses 
(FY2015/16: £2.4 million). Excluding these 
costs, and notwithstanding the 21% 
increase in the variable compensation 
charge, total operating expenses rose by 
only 7% compared with the prior year, 
demonstrating the Group's unrelenting focus 
on cost control.
Excluding variable compensation, 
consolidated fund expenses and adverse 
currency effects of £4.4 million, operating 
costs were reduced by 11%.
Average headcount fell 8% from 277 to 256 
employees, reflecting the sale of the Turkish 
business and the effect of consolidating 
the US offices, together with some natural 
staff turnover in the global business, partially 
offset by expansion in the rapidly growing 
local businesses in Colombia, Indonesia 
and Saudi Arabia. The Group’s headcount 
at 30 June 2017 was 252 employees 
(30 June 2016: 266 employees). Fixed 
staff costs of £24.8 million were 3% 
higher (FY2015/16: £24.1 million) than in 
the prior year, but excluding the effect of 
lower average exchange rates, fixed staff 
costs reduced by 4% versus the prior year.
Other operating costs, excluding depreciation 
and amortisation, were £27.4 million 
(FY2015/16: £27.5 million) and excluding 
consolidated fund expenses fell by 10% to 
£22.5 million (FY2015/16: £25.1 million). 
This reduction was due to an ongoing focus 
on controlling discretionary expenditure, 
such as travel, and other operating costs 
such as insurance. Additionally, where the 
Group acts as an agent in respect of certain 
services contracted for by its funds, for 
example third-party services, the recharge 
for these services was historically recognised 
in other income. This year, in order to reflect 
the pass-through nature of these costs, 
the recharge of £1.5 million (FY2015/16: 
£1.2 million) has been offset within other 
operating costs. There is no impact on 
operating profit.
The charge for variable compensation 
was £43.0 million, an increase of 21% 
compared with the prior year (FY2015/16: 
£35.6 million). This represents 21% of 
EBVCIT (FY2015/16: 20%), reflecting 
the improved business and operating 
performance including particularly strong 
seed capital gains. Total personnel expenses 
for the period were therefore £67.8 million 
(FY2015/16: £59.7 million).
EBITDA
EBITDA for the period of £172.3 million was 
20% higher than in the prior financial year 
(FY2015/16: £143.0 million). On an adjusted 
basis, reclassifying the effects of seed  
capital investments and foreign exchange 
translation, EBITDA was 23% higher at 
£161.1 million (FY2015/16: £130.9 million).
The adjusted EBITDA margin was 65% 
(FY2015/16: 62%), benefiting from higher 
revenues and the ongoing strict control of 
operating costs described above.
Finance income
Net finance income of £38.6 million for 
the period (FY2015/16: £31.3 million) 
includes items relating to seed capital 
investments, which are described in more 
detail below. Excluding these items, net 
interest income for the period was similar 
to last year at £2.6 million (FY2015/16: 
£2.0 million).
Taxation
The majority of the Group’s profit is subject 
to UK taxation; of the total current tax charge 
for the year of £40.7 million (FY2015/16: 
£37.0 million), £31.3 million (FY2015/16: 
£31.5 million) relates to UK corporation tax.
There is an £18.2 million net deferred tax 
asset on the Group’s balance sheet as at 
30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: £14.3 million), 
which arises principally as a result of 
timing differences in the recognition of the 
accounting expense and actual tax deduction 
in connection with (i) share-based payments 
and (ii) goodwill and intangibles arising on the 
acquisition of Ashmore’s equity business.
The Group’s effective tax rate for the year

Strategic report lower than the blended UK corporation tax 
rate of 19.75% (FY2015/16: 20.0%). This 
reflects the blend of the varying rates that 
apply across territories in which the Group 
operates as well as other effects. Note 12 
to the financial statements provides a full 
reconciliation of this difference compared 
to the blended UK corporate tax rate.
Balance sheet, cash flow and 
foreign exchange
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a 
strong balance sheet in order to support 
regulatory capital requirements, to meet 
the commercial demands of current and 
prospective clients, and to fulfil development 
needs across the business. These include 
funding establishment costs of distribution 
offices and local asset management 
ventures, seeding new funds, trading or 
investing in funds or other assets, and 
other strategic initiatives.
As at 30 June 2017, total equity 
attributable to shareholders of the parent 
was £724.4 million (30 June 2016: £676.7 
million). There is no debt on the Group’s 
balance sheet.
Cash
Ashmore’s business model delivers a high 
conversion rate of operating profits to cash. 
The Group generated cash of £177.0 million 
before working capital changes (FY2015/16: 
£151.2 million) and £171.3 million of cash 
from operations (FY2015/16: £125.2 million) 
from operating profit of £166.8 million for the 
period (FY2015/16: £137.9 million).

The 19% increase in the Group's cash

ordinary dividends.
Seed capital investments
The Group's seeding programme has 
successfully enabled growth in third-party 
AuM with approximately 13% of Group AuM 
in funds that have been seeded.
Seed capital is actively managed and during 
the period the Group made new investments 
of £57.0 million, realised £117.4 million from 
previous investments and therefore, after 
including positive market movements of 
£32.1 million, the market value of the Group's 
seed capital reduced from £238.5 million to 
£210.2 million over the period. The Group 
has also committed £29.4 million that was 
undrawn at the year end. The original cost of 
the Group's current seed capital investments 
is £170.7 million (30 June 2016: £207.4 
million), representing 33% of Group net 
tangible equity (30 June 2016: 35%). The 
majority of the seed capital is held in liquid 
funds, such as daily-dealing SICAVs and US 
40-Act mutual funds.
New investments were made across a 
broad range of funds, but with significant 
investments in alternatives funds in 
Colombia, the frontier equities SICAV, and 
an absolute return fund in the external debt 
theme. The most significant realisations 
were from the mutual funds in the local 
Indonesian business, which now manages 
more than US$1.0 billion and has returned 
substantially all of the Group's seed capital, 
the US frontier equities fund, and the US 
short duration fund.

The seed capital programme generated 
a pre-tax profit of £41.0 million for 
the year (FY2015/16: £24.6 million), 
comprising foreign exchange translation 
gains of £13.4 million and market and 
other movements of £27.6 million. Over 
half (£20.8 million) of the pre-tax profit 
contribution was realised on the recycling 
of previous investments, with the balance 
representing unrealised profits at the year 
end. The table below draws together 
the relevant line items to assist in the 
understanding of the financial impact 
of the Group's seed capital programme.
Goodwill and intangible assets
At 30 June 2017, goodwill and intangible 
assets on the Group’s balance sheet 
totalled £79.9 million (30 June 2016: 
£82.5 million) with the decrease attributable 
to an amortisation charge of £4.5 million 
(FY2015/16: £3.9 million) and a foreign 
exchange revaluation gain through reserves 
of £1.9 million (FY2015/16: £12.3 million).
Own shares held
The Group purchases and holds shares 
through an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) in 
anticipation of the vesting of share awards. 
At 30 June 2017, the EBT owned 38,701,321 
(30 June 2016: 41,173,968) ordinary shares.
Foreign exchange
The majority of the Group’s fee income is 
received in US dollars and it is the Group’s 
established policy to hedge up to two-thirds 
of the notional value of budgeted foreign 
currency-denominated net management

exchange contracts. The Group’s Foreign 
Exchange Management Committee 
determines the proportion of budgeted 
fee income to hedge by regular reference 
to expected non-US dollar, and principally 
Sterling, cash requirements. The proportion 
of fee income received in foreign currency 
and not subject to hedging is held as cash 
or cash equivalents in the foreign currency 
and marked to market at the period end 
exchange rate.
Translation of the Group’s non-Sterling 
denominated balance sheet resulted in a 
foreign exchange translation gain of £7.8 
million, principally as a result of the strength 
of the US dollar against Sterling. The 
sensitivity of the Group to exchange rate 
movements, including GBP:USD, is shown 
in note 21. The Group sold US$95 million of 
its US dollar cash holdings as the exchange 
rate moved in its favour during the year. Net 
realised and unrealised hedging losses of 
£2.8 million were recognised for the period.
Regulatory capital
As a UK listed asset management group, 
Ashmore is subject to regulatory supervision 
by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
under the Prudential Sourcebook for Banks, 
Building Societies and Investment Firms. 
At the year end, the Group had two UK-
regulated entities: Ashmore Investment 
Management Limited (AIML), and Ashmore 
Investment Advisors Limited (AIAL), on 
behalf of which half-yearly capital adequacy 
returns are filed. Both AIML and AIAL held 
excess capital resources relative to their 
requirements at all times during the period 
under review.
Since 1 January 2007, the Group has been 
subject to consolidated regulatory capital 
requirements, whereby the Board is required 
to assess the degree of risk across the 
Group’s business, and is required to hold 
sufficient capital against these requirements.
The Board has therefore assessed the 
amount of Pillar II capital required to be 
£111.1 million (30 June 2016: £99.9 million). 
The net increase of £11.2 million compared 
with the prior year is largely attributable to 
a higher market risk requirement reflecting 
more volatile market conditions, together 
with a slightly higher operational risk 
requirement and an increase in the capital 
requirements for undrawn illiquid seed capital 
commitments. The Group has total capital 
resources of £559.4 million, giving a solvency 
ratio of 404% and excess regulatory 
capital of £448.3 million. Therefore, 
the Board is satisfied that the Group is 
adequately capitalised.
Alternative performance measures
The Group discloses non-GAAP financial alternative 
performance measures in order to assist shareholders' 
understanding of the operational performance of the Group 
during the accounting period.
Net revenue
As shown on the face of the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, net revenue is total revenue less 
distribution costs and including foreign exchange. This provides 
a comprehensive view of the revenues recognised by the Group 
in the period.
Variable compensation ratio
Defined as the charge for employee variable compensation as 
a proportion of earnings before variable compensation, interest 
and tax (EBVCIT). The linking of variable annual pay awards to 
the Group's profitability is one of the principal methods by which 
the Group controls its operating costs. EBVCIT is defined as 
operating profit excluding the charge for variable compensation 
and seed capital-related items. The items relating to seed capital 
are gains/losses on investment securities; change in third-party 
interests in consolidated funds; and other expenses in respect 
of consolidated funds.
EBITDA
The standard definition of earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation is operating profit before 
depreciation and amortisation. It provides a view of the business 
before certain non-cash items, financing income and charges, 
and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA
Defined as EBITDA excluding items relating to foreign 
exchange translation and seed capital. This provides a better 
understanding of the Group's operational performance excluding 
the mark-to-market volatility of foreign exchange translation 
and seed capital investments. These adjustments are merely 
reclassified within the adjusted profit and loss account, leaving 
statutory profit before tax unchanged.
Conversion of operating profits to cash
This compares adjusted EBITDA to cash generated from 
operations excluding consolidated funds, and is a measure 
of the effectiveness of the Group's operations at converting 
profits to cash.
Dividend
The Board intends to pay a progressive 
ordinary dividend over time, taking into 
consideration factors such as prospects 
for the Group’s earnings, demands on 
the Group’s financial resources, and the 
markets in which the Group operates.
In recognition of Ashmore’s operating and 
financial performance during the period, 
its balance sheet strength, and the Board’s 
confidence in the Group’s future prospects, 
the Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 12.10 pence per share for the 
year ending 30 June 2017, which, subject 
to shareholder approval, will be paid on 
1 December 2017 to shareholders who 
are on the register on 3 November 2017.

Strategic report Seizing expanding value
DELIVERING
shareholder value
India’s domestic pharmaceutical market is forecast to grow  
at a CAGR of 15% to 20% over the next few years. This positive 
outlook is supported by reforms and political sponsorship,  
such as the government's Pharma Vision 2020 plan that seeks  
to position India as a leader in pharmaceutical manufacturing.
At the same time, product development skills and scientific  
talent are challenging the perception of India as simply a cheap 
manufacturing base, as companies move up the value chain  
to deliver innovation and growth. 
80%
of antiretroviral drugs 
combating AIDS are 
developed in India
20%
of global generic drugs 
exported from India
Source: IBEF
70%
of industry revenues are 
generated by generic 
drug manufacturing Long track record of delivering for shareholders 
Ashmore’s unrelenting strategic focus on Emerging 
Markets investing over the past 25 years, combined 
with a robust and flexible business model, has 
delivered value for shareholders across multiple 
market cycles. 
The Group's profitability and cash conversion have 
been sustained at high levels and support a strong, 
liquid balance sheet and a progressive dividend policy.

Ashmore Group plc Board
Ultimately responsible for the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems, and for reviewing their effectiveness
Risk management and 
internal control systems
In accordance with the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Board is ultimately responsible for the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems and for reviewing their 
effectiveness. Such systems and their 
review are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
Within the Group’s overarching corporate 
governance framework, through 
which the Board aims to maintain full 
and effective control over appropriate 
strategic, financial, operational and 
compliance issues, an internal control 
framework has been established, against 
which the Group is able to assess the 
effectiveness of its risk management and 
internal control systems. The Group’s 
system of internal control is integrated 
into the Group’s strategy and business 
model and embedded within its routine 
business processes and operations, 
and a strong control culture is combined 
with clear management responsibility 
and accountability for individual controls. 
The internal control framework provides 
an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the Group’s 
principal risks, and has been in place 
for the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. The process is regularly 
reviewed by the Group’s Audit and Risk 
Committee (ARC) and accords with the 
guidance in the document ‘Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting’ (the Guidance) published 
by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2014.
Chairman:
Group Head of Risk Management and Control
Members: 
32 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Executive Directors oversee the key 
risks and controls and the risk management 
process on a day-to-day basis, and there 
is an organisational structure with clearly 
defined lines of responsibility and delegation 
of authority.
The Group’s Risk and Compliance 
Committee (RCC), which meets monthly, 
is responsible for maintaining a sound 
risk management and internal control 
environment and for assessing the impact 
of the Group’s ongoing activities on its 
regulatory and operational exposures. 
The RCC is chaired by the Group Head of 
Risk Management and Control, and the 
other members are the Chief Executive, 
the Group Finance Director, the Group 
Head of Compliance, the Group Head of 
Finance, the Group Head of Middle Office 
and Technology, the Group Head of Legal 
and Transaction Management, the Group 
Head of Distribution, the Group Head of 
Internal Audit, and the Group Head of 
Human Resources. Responsibility for risk 
identification is shared among these senior 
management personnel, with individuals 
being responsible for day-to-day control of 
risk in their business area. 
There are established policies and 
procedures to enable the ARC and ultimately 
the Board, through its regular meetings, 
to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control systems, 
which cover all principal identified internal 
and external strategic, operational, financial, 
compliance and other risks, including the 
Group’s ability to comply with all applicable 
laws, regulations and clients’ requirements.
The ARC and/or Board receives regular 
compliance, risk and internal audit reports 
while the Board receives regular financial and 
other management information related to the 
control of expenditure against budget and the 
making of investments, and for monitoring 
the Group’s business and its performance.
Three lines of defence
The Group has three lines of defence against unintended outcomes arising from the 
risks it faces.
First: Risk ownership This rests with line managers, whether they are in 
portfolio management, distribution or support functions. 
The senior management team takes the lead role with 
respect to implementing and maintaining appropriate 
controls across the business.
Second: Risk control This is provided by Group Risk, which includes 
investment risk; and Group Compliance, which includes 
the compliance monitoring programme.
Third: Independent 
assurance
Group Internal Audit is the third line of defence and 
provides independent assurance over agreed risk 
management, internal control and governance processes 
as well as recommendations to improve the effectiveness 
of these processes.
The main features of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems 
are as follows:
Policies
 – core values and policies together 
comprising the Group’s high-level 
principles and controls, with which 
all staff are expected to comply;
 – manuals of policies and procedures, 
applicable to all business units, with 
procedures for reporting weaknesses 
and for monitoring corrective action;
 – a code of business conduct, with 
procedures for reporting compliance 
therewith; and
 – a defined operational framework and 
organisational structure with appropriate 
delegation of authority and segregation 
of duties with accountability that has 
regard to acceptable levels of risk.
Processes
 – a planning framework is maintained, which 
incorporates a Board-approved strategy, 
with objectives for each business unit;
 – a risk appetite framework developed 
by engaging key stakeholders at the 
functional, business and executive levels 
of the organisation and, accordingly, the 
Group’s risk appetite statement (and 
its associated components) is regularly 
reviewed and updated in line with 
the evolving strategy, business model, 
financial capacity, business opportunities, 
regulatory constraints and other internal 
and external factors;
 – an established Media and Reputation 
Management Policy focusing on 
understanding the information currently 
publicly available on the Group and 
the funds and individual investments 
it manages, especially anything which 
could create negative reputational issues;
 – an annual budget is reviewed and 
approved by the Board and is subject 
to update through a forecasting process;
 – regular reviews of the financial and 
operating performance of the Group 
are undertaken by the Group’s Operating 
Committee to focus on delivery of the 
Group’s key strategic objectives;
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 33
Strategic report  – detailed investment reports are 
prepared and discussed at each of the 
sub-committee meetings of the Group’s 
Investment Committees, which take 
place weekly or monthly depending on 
investment theme, with follow-up actions 
agreed and implemented within a strict 
operational framework;
 – supervision by the Group’s Pricing 
and Oversight Committee (POC) of 
the effectiveness of pricing policies 
for all investments held in Ashmore-
sponsored funds where a reliable pricing 
source is available. This includes the 
responsibility to ensure that appointed 
third-party pricing agents carry out the 
agreed pricing policy faithfully and manage 
the pricing sources appropriately;
 – oversight of the valuation methodologies 
used for clients’ fund investments that 
cannot be readily externally priced is 
the responsibility of the Group’s Pricing 
Methodology and Valuation Committee 
(PMVC) and Public Equity Valuation 
Committee (PEVC), which meet monthly 
and quarterly respectively to review the 
current valuation methodology for each 
of these investments and to propose 
an updated valuation methodology 
where appropriate;
 – semi-annual senior management systems 
and controls meetings chaired by the 
Group Head of Compliance are held 
with attendees including the Group 
Finance Director, the Group Head of 
Human Resources, the Group Head of 
Risk Management and Control, the Group 
Head of Middle Office and Technology, 
and the Group Head of Legal and 
Transaction Management and in which 
the Chief Executive Officer participates 
at least annually. These meetings include 
evaluation of the potential impact and 
likelihood of identified risks and possible 
new risk areas;
 – the Group's Compliance function, 
whose responsibilities and processes 
include: ensuring that the Group at all 
times meets its regulatory obligations; 
integrating regulatory compliance 
procedures and best practices within the 
Group; ongoing compliance monitoring 
programme covering all the relevant 
areas of the Group’s operations; and 
identifying any breach of compliance 
with applicable financial services 
regulation, which includes real-time 
investment restrictions monitoring of 
client mandate requirements. Results of 
the compliance monitoring programme 
are reported to the RCC in support of 
the overall risk management and internal 
control framework;
 – a matrix of principal risks identifies key 
strategic and business, client, treasury, 
investment and operational risks, and 
considers the likelihood of those risks 
crystallising and the resultant impact. 
The inherent risk within each business 
activity is identified, with the adequacy 
and mitigating effect of existing processes 
being assessed to determine a current 
residual risk level for each such activity;
 – on the basis that further mitigants and/
or controls may be employed over time, 
a target residual risk for each activity after 
one to two years is defined and progress 
to target is formally tracked as appropriate;
 – key risk indicator (KRI) statistics are 
reported to and analysed by the RCC. 
The KRIs indicate trends in the Group’s 
risk profile, assist in the reduction of 
errors and potential financial losses and 
seek to prevent exposure by dealing with 
a potential risk situation before an event 
actually occurs;
 – financial controls are maintained 
to ensure accurate accounting for 
transactions, appropriate authorisation 
limits to contain exposures, and reliability 
of data processing and integrity of 
information generated;
Risk management continued
Longer-term viability statement 
In accordance with the provisions of 
C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed 
the current position and prospects 
of the Group over a three-year period 
to June 2020, which is consistent 
with the planning horizon under the 
Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ICAAP). A robust 
assessment of the principal risks implicit 
in the business model has been made, 
alongside the controls and mitigants 
in operation within the Group, and is 
presented in more detail on pages 36 
to 37. The principal risks the Group 
faces are Strategic, Client, Treasury, 
Investment and Operational in nature.
Regular information is reviewed by the 
Board in respect of the risks, prospects 
and financial planning of the Group, 
which includes a three-year detailed 
financial forecast alongside scenario-
based downside stress-testing, including 
the impact of negative investment 
performance and a decline in AuM. 
Consequently, the Board regularly 
assesses the amount of capital that the 
Group is required to hold to cover its 
principal risks, including the amounts 
required under a range of adverse 
planning scenarios.
The Group’s strategy and prospects are 
regularly reviewed by the Board and 
qualitative and quantitative assessments 
of the principal risks are presented to 
the Group’s Audit and Risk Committee 
quarterly. The Group’s Risk Appetite 
Statement is considered as part of the 
ICAAP and the Board receives regular 
management reporting against each risk 
to allow it to assess the effectiveness of 
the controls in place.
The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation, meet its liabilities 
as they fall due and maintain sufficient 
regulatory capital over the next three 
years, as the Group is currently highly 
profitable, generates healthy cashflow 
and the strong and liquid balance sheet 
is sufficient to withstand the financial 
impact of the range of adverse planning 
scenarios modelled as part of the ICAAP.

Standards (GIPS) Committee, which 
acts as the primary decision-making body

Verification
 – Internal Audit has ongoing responsibility 
for reviewing the assurance map and 
providing an independent assessment 
of assurance on an annual basis. The 
assurance map documents the interaction 
from a Group perspective of the first, 
second and third lines of defence with 
regard to the controls and mitigants of 
those principal risks assessed as high risk;
 – annual control reports are reviewed 
independently by the Group’s external 
auditors pursuant to the International 
Standards on Assurance Engagements

financial statements, the condensed 
set of financial statements in the half-year 
financial report and also independently 
and objectively review the approach

Confirmation
Through the ARC, the Board has conducted 
an annual review and assessment of the 
effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control systems, and has identified 
no significant failings or weaknesses during 
this review. In conducting this review, the 
Board and/or ARC has considered the 
periodic reports on compliance and risk 
matters, including reports provided by the 
internal audit function, and the annual report 
on risk management and internal control 
processes from the Group’s RCC. These 
reports were received throughout the year 
up to the latest practicable date prior to the 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Board is satisfied that appropriate 
planned actions continue to be effective in 
improving controls as the Group develops, 
and its overall assessment of the control 
framework continues to be satisfactory.

Strategic report Corporate social responsibility
Combining ethical investing  
with sound business practice
Ashmore recognises the importance of 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
incorporating transparency, fairness, 
accountability and integrity and believes 
that these principles are fundamental to 
the Group’s operations.
The Group continues to monitor best 
practice developments in all relevant areas 
of CSR, including its approach to investing, 
community programmes, employees, and 
environmental management. Ashmore’s 
CSR programme and initiatives are designed 
to be relevant to the nature and scale of its 
business and to protect and reinforce the 
Group’s reputation and integrity. Ashmore 
intends to build upon these firm foundations 
for the future.
Consistent with the various philosophies 
explained herein, Ashmore is a signatory 
of the UN Principles for Responsible 
Investment (UNPRI).
Investment approach
Ashmore’s Investment Committees’ 
processes ensure a consistent approach to 
all investments within its clients’ portfolios. 
Ashmore’s experience in managing 
investments within the Emerging Markets 
has enabled it to experience first-hand 
the advantages of qualitatively evaluating 
environmental, social and governance factors 
and incorporating them within its portfolios.
Ashmore believes that there are many 
potential asset classes in emerging countries 
as well as many different risk return profiles 
which it will be able to offer its clients in 
the future. As capital markets grow rapidly 
in Emerging Markets Ashmore aims to 
participate in that growth, enabling access 
to these markets by both developed world 
pools of capital and also, increasingly, by 
Emerging Markets pools of capital.
Business conduct and integrity
Ashmore believes that its reputation 
as an ethical, trustworthy provider of 
investment services is essential to align 
clients’ and shareholders’ interests. 
Ashmore seeks to establish and maintain 
long-term relationships with its clients and 
intermediaries and believes this to be a 
fundamental prerequisite for the growth 
of its business.
Responsible investing across Ashmore’s 
themes
Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) 
is a form of investing that screens out 
investments in certain stocks or industries 
in line with defined ethical guidelines.
Ashmore aims to ensure that the 
governance bodies of the investments 
it makes comply with their own industry 
standards and best practice, treat their 
employees fairly, have active community 
programmes and operate with sensitivity 
to the environment. Ashmore has made 
investments in a number of renewable 
energy projects in different countries 
including hydro-electricity, geothermal 
energy and sugar-based ethanol production. 
Investments have also been made in a 
Chinese company which manufactures wind 
turbines with both local and growing global 
supplies. These investments on behalf of 
clients reflect Ashmore’s overall approach 
to combining ethical investing with sound 
business practice.
Amongst the initiatives undertaken in 
South America is the establishment of an 
Environmental and Social Management 
System (ESMS) for the management of 
investments of an investor fund in Colombia 
within the alternatives investment theme. 
This fund has been developed in a form and 
substance acceptable to the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) and International 
Finance Corporation (IFC). In 2014 Ashmore 
Colombia won the Colombian Association 
for Private Equity award for best corporate 
governance, as voted for by investors.
Ashmore’s funds and segregated 
accounts each have a specific investment 
mandate which sets out the parameters 
for investment. Within the Equities and 
Corporate Debt themes, Ashmore is able 
to screen client portfolios to meet client 
requirements for geographic, sector and 
stock specific restrictions. Stock specific 
restrictions may include securities which 
meet clients’ own criteria.
Examples of investment areas where 
screening of portfolios can be offered based 
on (or informed by) client requirements 
(using recognised investment industry 
identifiers and coding into Ashmore’s 
portfolio management system) include 
alcohol, animal/food products, armaments 
manufacturers or dealers, gambling, 
pornography and tobacco.
Ashmore seeks to comply at all times 
with all sanctions imposed by applicable 
government authorities, and also screens at 
a geographical level across all investment 
themes for countries which are on the 
United Nations and EU/UK Sanctions and 
the US Office of Foreign Assets and Control 
(OFAC) lists, for example during the Russia/
Ukraine crisis.
Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) approach
The evaluation of ESG risk is an integral part 
of Ashmore’s investment processes.
Ashmore integrates ESG factors into 
fundamental analysis across its liquid 
investment themes and scores them to 
the extent they are deemed material to 
investment returns.
Listed equities
ESG criteria tend to be focused primarily on 
equity investing because of the influence 
which shareholder interests are able to exert 
on the management of a particular company. 
Ashmore believes that the way in which 
companies manage ESG factors can have 
an impact on business performance and 
valuation, and should be incorporated into 
investment decisions.
Ashmore’s top down allocation model 
evaluates country metrics relative to 
history and one year forward. Hence, the 
risk premium imputed by the market to a 
given country is captured. Risk premiums 
incorporate sovereign corporate governance 
concerns, as for example in Russia where 
stock valuations are historically amongst the 
lowest globally due to relatively higher risk 
premiums. Any changes in risk premiums 
relative to history are analysed to determine 
if justified. To make this more explicit 
Ashmore reviews ESG rankings of countries 
within its mandate using third party data 
sources. The scoring and ranking is based 
on ESG principles as rated by World Bank, 
US Energy Information Administration, 
Heritage Foundation and Economist 
Intelligence Unit. Ashmore also evaluates 
country exposures weekly at its Investment 
Committee meetings, and considers country 
risks in the review channels.
38 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The stakeholders in a company encompass 
employees, local communities, wider 
society, governments, supply chains, 
customers and the natural environment. 
There are a wide range of ESG issues 
which could be relevant for a company 
depending on the industry in which it 
operates and its specific business profile. 
ESG issues can become new sources of 
risk or opportunities for companies, and 
a company’s ability to respond to these 
issues can therefore act as an early signal 
of long-term competitiveness. To the extent 
practicable, Ashmore routinely monitors 
the ESG performance of the companies in 
which it invests through on-going company 
visits and other information channels. In 
addition, companies often disclose corporate 
governance practices through corporate 
policies, stock market listings, and market 
press releases (for example, Brazil has a 
separate category for companies committed 
to corporate governance best practice). 
Companies may also disclose environmental 
and social practices in annual reports and 
other reports to investors. These are then 
highlighted, as appropriate, in Investment 
Committee reports.
ESG metrics are used to measure, analyse, 
and rank securities. Assessments at the 
stock level tend to be qualitative and based 
on company public disclosures, interviews 
and/or company visits which are made 
to each company held in portfolios. In 
addition, Ashmore gathers information from 
market related channels, such as suppliers 
and clients. These assessments are then 
factored into the valuation and profitability 
metrics, which are evaluated relative to 
history, country and industry comparators.
As a global investor, Ashmore recognises 
that legislation and best practice standards 
vary between countries and regions, and that 
it must remain sensitive to these differences. 
However, at a minimum, Ashmore expects 
the companies in which it invests to comply 
with the national legislation that applies 
to them.
Fixed income
Ashmore’s fixed income themes consist 
of investments in Corporate and Sovereign 
Debt issuances. ESG within fixed income 
is fundamentally a risk management 
consideration. Within the Emerging Markets 
fixed income space, the Governance 
aspect of ESG is best reflected in the 
political landscape. Ashmore’s Investment 
Committee meetings start off with a macro 
discussion and then move to the individual 
countries. This review of individual emerging 
countries starts with a focus on what the 
likely effects of the external macro factors 
are on market behaviour and in turn, asset 
prices. The team analyses and discusses the 
ability (the financial position of a country) and 
the willingness (qualitative focusing on the 
incentives of the policy-makers in-country) 
of countries to service their sovereign debt. 
Ability to pay is analysed looking at classic 
indicators of credit-worthiness and debt 
sustainability analysis. This involves analysis 
of the local fiscal position, currency, interest 
rates and trade data. Currency and interest 
rate exposures within individual countries are 
explicitly evaluated and fundamentals such 
as growth prospects, balance of payments 
dynamics, credit-worthiness, the likely 
effect of commodity price movements, local 
politics, economic data and local and external 
investor sentiment are analysed thoroughly.
Willingness to pay is more subjective and 
can change quickly subject to the vagaries 
of the political cycle and the political 
response to economic events. Ashmore 
places emphasis on the factors that affect 
a government’s willingness to pay and 
relies on scenario-analysis to determine the 
risks and opportunities presented by these 
governments’ assets. Finally, the technical 
factors affecting asset prices in various 
markets are important considerations leading 
to investment decisions. Ashmore speaks 
regularly with appointed policy makers to 
glean their views on significant events, such 
as local elections, as well as to try to gauge 
their bias towards populist agendas which 
may impact ESG factors.
Ashmore formalises country credit and 
ESG considerations at least quarterly, in 
conversations between various members 
of the Investment team and the Head 
of Research. In addition, the Investment 
Committee will consider the assessment 
for each country on an ad-hoc basis as it 
discusses country visit reports from portfolio 
managers returning from research trips, or 
when discussing significant events such 
as elections. Therefore, credit and ESG 
analysis are an integral part of Ashmore’s 
investment process for publicly traded fixed 
income securities.
Ashmore’s quantitative scorecard is a 
derivation of its Risk models and assesses 
10 economic and ESG risk factors for 
Impact (low, moderate, high, or 1, 2, 3) and 
Probability (low, moderate, high or 1, 2, 3). 
The score of each factor would be Impact x 
Probability, with six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 
3, 4, 6, 9. Adding the scores of all ten factors 
gives a country risk score that incorporates 
both credit risk and ESG risk. The theoretical 
minimum and maximum risk scores are thus 
10 and 90 respectively, while the median 
is 30 and the average is 40. These metrics 
are reviewed against yields and spreads to 
determine if an appropriate risk premium has 
been built into Ashmore’s scenario analyses.
Within Emerging Markets fixed income 
segregated accounts, Ashmore also offers 
clients the flexibility to implement their ESG 
constraints related to specific countries, 
sectors and securities (for example, 
restricted lists, concentration limits etc.).
Alternatives
Ashmore’s Alternatives investment theme 
often involves its funds taking significant 
stakes in investee companies. In such 
circumstances Ashmore is in a position 
to engage with the management of these 
companies. In many cases, Ashmore 
believes it to be beneficial to its investors to 
be active in promoting its brand locally by 
improving the livelihoods of the employees 
in those companies where it has a significant 
stake. When undertaking initial due diligence 
on any investments within the Alternatives 
theme, Ashmore’s deal memorandum 
checklist takes into account the consideration 
of ESG issues within the investment analysis 
and decision making process, and the 
investee company’s own ESG practices.
Engagement
Engagement is a fundamental part of 
Ashmore’s ESG approach.
Within mature markets, ethical investing has 
often been portrayed as a ‘negative’ concept 
i.e. it involves a decision not to invest in 
a certain way. Whilst these concepts are 
well accepted in mature markets Ashmore 
believes that they are not necessarily 
conducive to helping emerging economies 
develop. In the context of developing 
countries Ashmore believes that it is also 
possible to apply other concepts such 
as engagement within the ethical 
investment debate.
In the Equities theme Ashmore believes that 
good corporate governance helps to align 
the interests of company management with 
those of its shareholders. Where possible, 
Ashmore seeks to maintain constructive 
dialogue with company management.
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 39
Strategic report Ashmore considers whether companies 
have corporate governance frameworks that 
are in line with applicable country codes 
and serve shareholder interests. Views 
on corporate governance do not constrain 
investment decisions however; often the 
most profitable investments can be made 
in companies where an improvement 
in corporate governance practices is 
anticipated. In many jurisdictions, and to the 
extent consistent with Ashmore’s fiduciary 
duty to its clients, Ashmore exercises voting 
rights as a means to signal views to company 
management. Ashmore has developed 
detailed guidelines to guide voting decisions, 
but will, as appropriate, consider resolutions 
on a case-by-case basis taking into account 
all available information.
The majority of Ashmore’s assets under 
management continue to be invested in fixed 
income (the majority of which is sovereign) 
for which Ashmore’s ability to have an 
influence is generally limited to a decision 
whether or not to invest. However, at a 
country level, Ashmore believes that it is able 
to exert an influence through dialogue with 
governments and central banks. In order to 
assist with the debate on the broader issues 
affecting Emerging Markets, to enhance 
the understanding of these markets globally 
and to address market failures, Ashmore 
engages with numerous international public 
sector financial institutions with the objective 
of aiding transparency and best practice. 
Engagement with a country, as opposed 
to disengagement, is akin to many small 
pressures every day as opposed to one 
‘big stick’. By remaining engaged over an 
extended period of time it is often possible 
to have a positive influence and to add 
credibility. Ashmore is also mindful of the 
potential impact that the abuse of power 
and corruption by governments in certain 
countries can have on its reputation and 
the interests of its clients and continuously 
monitors, and takes into account 
such factors.
Where Emerging Markets are concerned 
therefore, it is believed that in certain 
circumstances, it may be more beneficial 
to keep investment flowing combined with 
the influence which accompanies it in order 
to continue being able to help a country’s 
population. In country specific terms at the 
extreme, being cut off from capital may allow 
undemocratic rulers to control their people 
by attributing blame for economic problems 
to foreign actions. Sanctions may be counter-
productive and may reduce the welfare of 
the population considerably. Conversely, 
to the extent that governments pursue 
policies that are not in the best interests of 
that country, then this is likely to become 
a poor investment proposition. Hence 
Ashmore takes investment and engagement/
disengagement decisions on a case by case 
basis, relative to the specific circumstances 
and investment criteria in the best interests 
of clients.
Ashmore does not always evaluate 
quantitative variables in its assessment of 
country risk but will also examine qualitative 
factors such as the relationship between 
politics and economics and their interaction. 
Ashmore has always sought to develop 
networks locally in order to adopt a better 
quality of forward looking decision making 
in this area and to promote an understanding 
of local cultures and politics.
Proxy voting and corporate actions
Subject to specific mandate restrictions, 
Ashmore is generally responsible for voting 
proxies and taking decisions in connection 
with proxy voting with respect to equities, 
bonds, loans or other debt instruments held 
by or on behalf of the clients for which it 
serves as investment manager/adviser.
Where Ashmore is given responsibility 
for proxy voting and corporate actions, 
it will take reasonable steps under the 
circumstances to ensure that proxies are 
voted in the best interests of its clients. 
Protecting the financial interests of its clients 
is the primary consideration for Ashmore in 
determining how to protect such interests. 
This generally means proxy voting with a 
view to enhancing the value of the securities 
held by or on behalf of Ashmore’s clients, 
taken either individually or as a whole.
UK Stewardship Code
Details on how, and the extent to which, 
Ashmore complies with the principles of 
the UK Stewardship Code are described 
separately on the Ashmore website at 
www.ashmoregroup.com
Managing Conflicts of Interest
Conflicts of interest can arise where: (i) the 
interests of Ashmore conflict with those of 
a client (firm vs. client conflicts) and (ii) the 
interests of one client of Ashmore conflict 
with those of another of Ashmore’s clients 
(client vs. client conflicts). Ashmore has 
policies and arrangements in place to identify 
and manage conflicts of interest that may 
arise between Ashmore and its clients 
or between Ashmore’s different clients. 
Ashmore has a policy of independence that 
requires its staff to disregard any personal 
interest, relationship or arrangement which 
gives rise to a conflict of interest and to 
ensure that the interests of clients prevail.
Employees
Ashmore directly employs 252 people 
in 10 countries worldwide, excluding 
employees in companies significantly 
controlled by funds that Ashmore manages. 
Ashmore’s people have always been its 
most important asset, at the heart of 
everything it does. The Group’s priority 
is to attract, develop, manage and retain 
this talent in order to deliver the potential 
of the organisation which is reflected in 
the low levels of unplanned staff turnover 
(FY2016/17: 8.7%). Ashmore wishes to be 
an employer which the most talented people 
aspire to join wherever it operates.

40 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ashmore recognises that the involvement of 
its employees is key to the future success 
of the business and adopts a practice of 
keeping employees informed on significant 
matters affecting them, via email and in 
meetings arranged for the purpose. Ashmore 
has consistently operated a remuneration 
strategy that recognises both corporate and 
individual performance. Ashmore is also 
committed to following good practice in 
employment matters, recognising the part 
this plays in attracting and retaining staff.
Ashmore seeks to ensure that its 
workforce reflects, as far as practicable, 
the diversity of the many communities in 
which its operations are located. Ashmore 
also recognises the diverse needs of its 
employees in managing the responsibilities 
of their work and personal lives, and believes 
that achieving an effective balance in these 
areas is beneficial to both Ashmore and the 
individual. Ashmore encourages employees 
to act ethically and to uphold clearly the 
standards of practice which its clients have 
come to expect. It also means ensuring that 
employees understand the strategic aims 
and objectives of the Group and are clear 
about their role in achieving them.
Ashmore works to ensure employee 
policies and procedures reflect best practice 
within each of the countries where it has a 
presence. This means having policies and 
practices that make Ashmore an attractive 
place to work in respect of the day to day 
operating environment and culture, and also 
in respect of medium to long term growth 
for employees, personally, professionally 
and financially.
Disability 
Ashmore will give full and fair consideration 
to applications for employment by disabled 
persons, having regard to their particular 
aptitudes and abilities and provide equal 
opportunity for disabled employees in 
terms of training, career development 
and promotion.
Diversity
Ashmore is committed to providing equal 
opportunities and seeks to ensure that its 
workforce reflects, as far as is practicable, 
the diversity of the many communities in 
which it operates. Ashmore employs over  
32 different nationalities throughout the 
organisation. The gender balance is currently 
67.5% (169 people) male and 32.5% (83 
people) female.
Ashmore has provided data to the 2017

Employee development
Ashmore believes that constructive 
performance management is an essential 
tool in the effective management of its 
people and business. Ashmore ensures all 
employees are competent to undertake their 
roles, have access to training as it is required, 
and can demonstrate their continuing 
professional development.
The performance management cycle 
comprises setting objectives and an annual 
performance appraisal against those agreed 
objectives. Output from this performance 
process is used to assist with decisions 
on remuneration, career development 
and progression.
Information security
Information security (including cyber 
security) is identified as a key principal risk to 
the business which is subject to Ashmore’s 
governance, policies and procedures and risk 
assessment. Ashmore assesses, monitors 
and controls data security risk, and ensures 
that there is adequate communication 
between the key stakeholders, which 
include senior management and IT, human 
resources, risk management and control, 
legal and compliance departments.
Ashmore has a layered security model, 
within which multiple complementary 
technologies and processes are employed. 
Ashmore staff undertake mandatory 
training in matters of Information Security 
(including cyber security). Ashmore routinely 
deploys security updates to its systems and 
undertakes regular vulnerability testing of 
its networks and systems using a specialist 
service provider. Ashmore provides an 
annual report to the Ashmore Audit and 
Risk Committee on its cyber security 
arrangements, and adopts a culture of 
continuous improvement which means 
that improvements can and do occur 
throughout the year.
Ashmore also affirms and/or attests 
with key partners on an annual basis 
that they have not been susceptible to 
cyber security attacks and vendors have 
taken all reasonable steps to continuously 
monitor and protect themselves on cyber 
security weaknesses.
Ashmore’s approach to principal risks in 
general is discussed in greater detail on 
pages 32 to 37.
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 41
Strategic report High ethical standards
Ashmore’s Board of Directors seeks 
to maintain a strong corporate culture 
employing high standards of integrity 
and fair dealing in the conduct of the 
firm’s activities, compliance with both the 
letter and the spirit of relevant laws and 
regulations, and standards of good market 
practice in all jurisdictions where the Group’s 
business is carried out. The Board’s aim 
is to enable Ashmore to demonstrate that 
the Group is fit and proper to undertake 
its business, to safeguard the legitimate 
interests of Ashmore clients and protect 
Ashmore’s reputation.
Health and safety
The health and welfare of employees is very 
important to the Group.
Ashmore promotes high standards of health 
and safety at work and has a comprehensive 
health and safety policy which highlights the 
Group’s commitment to ensuring employees 
are provided with a safe and healthy working 
environment. In London Ashmore carries 
out regular risk assessments of premises 
and provides staff with safety training 
including the provision of training to fire 
wardens and first aid representatives. 
Ashmore also engages external consultants 
to carry out regular health and safety and 
fire assessments in its London premises.
There have been no reportable accidents 
in the UK or overseas premises.
Taxation
As a multi-national organisation with a 
diverse geographic footprint, Ashmore 
aims to create value for its shareholders 
and clients by managing its business in a 
commercial, tax efficient and transparent 
manner, within the remit of applicable 
tax rules and always bearing in mind the 
potential impact on brand and reputation. 
In doing so, Ashmore is committed to 
paying tax in accordance with relevant laws 
and regulations and complying with fiscal 
obligations in the territories in which the 
Group operates. Ashmore’s tax strategy 
will be published on the Ashmore Group 
website by 30 June 2018.
In the spirit of tax transparency, Ashmore 
complies with relevant global initiatives 
including the US Foreign Account Tax 
Compliance Act (FATCA) and the OECD 
Common Reporting Standard. Ashmore 
closely monitors developments arising from 
the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 
(BEPS) initiative and has implemented a 
transfer pricing policy to comply with the 
relevant international tax changes introduced 
by BEPS.
Human rights
Ashmore supports the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Environment
As a company whose business is 
fundamentally based on intellectual capital 
and does not own its business premises, 
Ashmore has a limited direct impact 
on the environment and there are few 
environmental risks associated with the 
Group’s activities. Nevertheless, Ashmore 
recognises that it has a responsibility to 
manage this as effectively as possible. 
The Group continues to promote energy 
efficiency and the avoidance of waste 
throughout its operations and a number of 
initiatives, such as the recycling of paper, 
glass and other waste and the use of 
‘green’ energy, are encouraged.
Ashmore does not own any of the buildings 
where it occupies floor space and invariably 
buildings in which it does have a lease are 
multi-tenanted and costs are apportioned 
to each tenant pro-rated according 
to occupancy.
Ashmore’s largest property occupancy 
is at its headquarters at 61 Aldwych, 
London where it occupies a single floor of 
approximately 19,000 square feet in a nine 
storey multi-tenanted building. Electricity 
usage in London is separately monitored by 
floor and energy efficient lighting is installed 
in the building with sensors which turn 
lights off when no movement is detected.
Corporate social responsibility continued
Travel
Although Ashmore endeavours to make 
maximum use of available technology, such 
as video conferencing, investing in Emerging 
Markets inevitably requires that investment 
professionals and other members of staff 
travel frequently to these countries to 
investigate and monitor investments.
Recycling
Ashmore has in place recycling programmes 
for waste paper, photocopier toners and 
other disposable materials. Ashmore seeks 
to minimise the use of paper as part of its 
clear desk policy and electronic scanning is 
actively encouraged. All printing is two-sided 
by default.
Ashmore is conscious of minimising its 
impact on the environment. For this reason, 
wherever possible Ashmore chooses paper 
stocks that have been sustainably sourced 
and which are Forest Stewardship Council© 
(FSC) accredited (or equivalent) for its 
marketing materials and business stationery.

Making a positive difference
Ashmore’s approach to community 
investment represents a commitment to 
building relationships and having a positive 
impact on the communities where Ashmore 
operates and invests. At the heart of this 
approach is the Ashmore Foundation, 
which consistent with Ashmore’s 
investment experience focuses on the 
Emerging Markets.
Ashmore recognises the positive impact 
it can have on the communities where it 
operates and is committed to creating lasting 
benefits in those locations where Ashmore 
has a presence. Beyond support for the 
Ashmore Foundation, employees across all 
offices and subsidiaries are encouraged to 
engage with and support local community 
projects. This commitment is reflected 
in Ashmore’s policy enabling employees 
to take one day annually to support 
charitable projects.
Ashmore employees have taken part in a 
range of activities supporting disadvantaged 
communities in their local vicinity. In New 
York, a team of Ashmore employees 
volunteer annually with local community 
organisations taking part in activities ranging 
from sorting clothes to stocking food banks. 
This year a team of seven sorted clothes for 
GOOD +.
In London, Ashmore employees continued 
to cultivate their relationships with local 
charities and in December took part and 
won a Corporate Rowing challenge to 
raise funds for Resurgo, a London-based 
charity, that works with young people from 
disadvantaged communities to access 
employment. Ashmore continues to make 
an annual donation of foreign coins and 
banknotes to the Alzheimer’s Society, and to 
support local charities with gifts in kind.
Investing locally in Emerging 
Markets communities
The Ashmore Foundation was established in 
January 2008 and seeks to make a positive 
and sustainable difference to disadvantaged 
communities in the Emerging Markets in 
which Ashmore operates and invests. To 
achieve this goal, the Ashmore Foundation 
aims to develop long-term relationships 
with locally based non-government 
organisations (NGOs).
The Ashmore Foundation is staffed by 
a full time Executive Director who is 
responsible for managing the Foundation’s 
affairs. The board of trustees consists of 
seven Ashmore employees as well as one 
independent trustee. In addition to the board 
of trustees Ashmore employees engage in 
the governance of the Foundation through 
sub-committees.
Ashmore supports the Foundation’s 
charitable activities through the provision 
of pro-bono office space, administrative 
support and a matched funding commitment 
for employee donations. The Ashmore 
Foundation is supported solely by Ashmore 
and its employees globally. Crucially, this 
support from employees extends beyond 
financial aid to active engagement with 
NGOs through mentoring and helping them 
expand their network of contacts.
Ashmore employees organise a range of 
events from wine tastings to cake bakes 
to raise funds for the Foundation. Ashmore 
employees organise challenge event in 
support of the Foundation and over the 
years have submitted the UK’s three 
peaks, cycled from London to Paris and 
walked the length of Hadrian’s Wall. In total, 
Ashmore employees have raised in excess 
of £220,000 for the Foundation and the civil 
society organisations it supports.
Approach
The Ashmore Foundation’s focus of work 
is designed in response to the fact that, 
despite economic growth in Emerging 
Markets, disadvantaged communities 
in many countries remain affected by 
poverty and lack access to basic services 
and opportunities that are basic rights and 
could greatly improve their life situations. 
Moreover, a thriving civil sector is essential 
to democratic development in nascent and 
emerging nations.
The Foundation seeks to develop long-term 
partnerships with civil society organisations 
and does not accept unsolicited applications, 
preferring to seek appropriate partnerships 
pro actively. Civil society organisations 
typically receive between US$20,000 and 
US$50,000 per year over a two to three 
year period.
Following a review of its funding priorities 
in 2014, the Ashmore Foundation focuses 
its support on programmes that aim to equip 
people with the skills and resources they 
need to increase their livelihood opportunities 
enabling them to meet their basic needs and 
that of their families and will also support 
economic growth and begin to address 
broader societal inequalities.

Strategic report Mosintuwu Institute 
(Indonesia)
Partnership established 2016
Between 1998 and 2007, in Poso, 
Central Sulawesi, communal violence 
ensued, initially for political purposes 
but then spread along religious lines. 
Today people still bear the scars of this 
conflict, with mistrust and prejudice 
towards other religions common. 
Women have been disproportionately 
affected by the conflict and 
displacement, but have limited 
participation in the formal peace making 
process. Traditionally, gender roles have 
been defined by culture and religion; 
women are seen as second-class 
citizens with no place in public life.
This project seeks to support women’s leadership through the development of 
income generating activities by establishing rural enterprises and garbage banks. 
The basic premise of the garbage bank is that villagers will deposit recyclable 
refuge to a central point in exchange for basic food staples. The refuse will be 
recycled into a range of products that will be sold locally and nationally.
All proposals for new partnerships undergo 
a rigorous assessment designed to review 
not only the proposed activities but the 
organisation as a whole – taking into 
consideration management, governance, 
strategy, resources and accountability. 
The level and depth of due diligence is 
proportionate to the size of the grant 
under consideration.
Since its inception in 2008, the Ashmore 
Foundation has disbursed over £4 million to 
70 civil society organisations in 25 Emerging 
Market countries. It has developed a number 
of longstanding strategic partnerships; below 
are case studies from two organisations 
which the Ashmore Foundation has 
recently supported.
Investing in the Ecosystem
The Ashmore Foundation believes in the 
power of civil society organisations and 
social enterprises to drive social change. 
Since inception the Ashmore Foundation 
has partnered with enterprise incubators 
and accelerator programmes that enable 
organisations to prove their model and 
accelerate growth.
The Ashmore Foundation seeks to 
collaborate with and, where appropriate, 
establish funding partnerships with other 
foundations. These partnerships enable the 
Ashmore Foundation to bring its resources 
to bear in combination with the skills and 
expertise of other organisations to most 
effectively support civil society.
In the coming years, the Ashmore 
Foundation will continue to grow and 
develop its partnerships with civil society 
organisations in Emerging Market 
countries, exploring new opportunities 
and financing mechanisms to enable 
organisations to tackle inequality and social 
injustice creating a positive impact for 
disadvantaged communities.

Emergencies
In addition to the main partnership grants 
programme, the Ashmore Foundation 
supports those communities in Emerging 
Market countries that have been affected 
by natural disasters and humanitarian 
emergencies. Most recently the Ashmore 
Foundation has supported families affected 
by the conflict in Yemen.
Corporate social responsibility continued
British Red Cross (Yemen) – British Red Cross launched the Yemen Crisis Appeal 
in 2015 in response to the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation. They have 
helped support immediate relief efforts, providing vital items such as medical 
supplies, water and war-wound treatment kits to those injured in the conflict.
IED-Vital (Colombia)
Partnership established 2016
Rural communities in Colombia have 
been disproportionately affected by the 
conflict between the government and 
FARC. IED-Vital works with displaced 
families, ethnic minorities, and victims 
of the armed conflict through financial 
education programmes. They invest 
in local, village-level capacity for the 
management of savings, credits and 
solidarity funds through savings and 
loans groups. Once established the savings groups co-create micro-franchises and 
collective purchasing models that seek to generate income for rural communities, 
while at the same time increasing access to basic goods and services at more 
affordable prices.
The model is based on the strengthening of the social fabric, the capabilities of the 
groups and their participation in identifying gaps between supply and demand for 
basic goods and services. Through this partnership IED-Vital will increase coverage 
of their micro-franchise model, working with communities to establish 800 new 
micro-franchises. This will enable at least 8,000 low-income families to have 
permanent access to basic goods and services at a fair and reasonable price.

  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 45 Chairman’s statement
Ashmore has delivered strong operating 
and financial performance over the 
past 12 months, in particular producing 
outperformance for clients, generating net 
inflows in the second half of the financial 
year, and growing profit before tax by 24%. 
As described in the Market review, we 
feel the long-term prospects for Emerging 
Markets are extremely good, and the cyclical 
improvement in asset prices over the past 
year is translating into AuM and profit growth 
for Ashmore after a protracted period of 
weaker market conditions.
The characteristics that define Ashmore and 
provide significant competitive advantages 
have been much in evidence over the past 
year. The Group’s investment processes 
are producing excellent performance 
against both benchmarks and peer groups; 
the inherent attractions of the Emerging 
Markets asset classes are increasingly 
being recognised by investors and addressed 
by our global distribution team; the local 
platforms are growing rapidly and repaying 
investments made by the Group; the 
operating model has delivered an increase 
in profit margin through ongoing disciplined 
control of costs; and the Group continues to 
maintain a strong and liquid balance sheet 
to provide reassurance through the market 
cycle and to enable investment in growth 
initiatives such as seed capital.
The Board’s regular meetings have benefited 
from varied and detailed presentations by 
colleagues from both the global business 
units and the local asset management 
platforms. This enhances the Board’s 
understanding of the Group’s operations 
as well as providing an opportunity to 
focus on areas of topical interest, such 
as cyber security.
One of the most important features of the 
Ashmore operating model is the distinctive 
and highly effective remuneration model, 
which attracts and retains high-quality 
employees and aligns interests with 
clients and shareholders. As Simon Fraser 
describes in the Remuneration report on 
page 55, the Remuneration Committee has 
conducted a thorough review of the Group’s 
remuneration policy ahead of the triennial 
vote at the forthcoming AGM. Central to this 
review was a comprehensive programme 
of meetings with Ashmore’s largest 
institutional shareholders, to discuss and 
explain Ashmore’s remuneration philosophy 
and to understand shareholders’ views on 
the principal features of the policy. I believe 
strongly in the Group’s remuneration policy 
and participated in the majority of these 
meetings to ensure that the Board’s support 
was recognised and to address any other 
governance topics that were raised.
The Board has recommended an unchanged 
final dividend of 12.10 pence for the year 
ending 30 June 2017 to give total dividends 
per share for the year of 16.65 pence. 
Subject to shareholders’ approval at the AGM 
in October, the final dividend will be paid on 
1 December 2017 to those shareholders on 
the register on 3 November 2017.
Through its regular formal meetings with 
employees, the Board is deeply aware of the 
strong culture and work ethic at Ashmore, 
and I would like to take this opportunity, on 
behalf of all Board members, to thank our 
colleagues for their ongoing efforts to deliver 
value to clients and shareholders.

More information
A detailed report on corporate 
governance is provided on  
pages 47 to 49.
46 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Group has been in compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
its predecessor versions since Admission 
to listing on the London Stock Exchange 
on 17 October 2006, except where the 
Directors consider that, in particular limited 
circumstances, departure may be justified 
and explained. No departures from the 
Code occurred during the year under review. 
References herein to ‘the Code’ are to the 
April 2016 version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. This report describes the 
Group’s corporate governance arrangements, 
explaining how it has applied the principles of 
the Code.
Directors
The Board of Directors comprises two 
Executive Directors and five independent 
Non-executive Directors. The two Executive 
Directors are Mark Coombs, the Chief 
Executive Officer, and Tom Shippey, the 
Group Finance Director. The Independent 
Non-executive Directors are Peter Gibbs, 
Chairman; Simon Fraser, Senior independent 
Director; Dame Anne Pringle, David Bennett 
and Clive Adamson. Nick Land retired from 
the Board on 21 October 2016. All other 
Directors served throughout the year.
The Board has a schedule of matters 
specifically reserved to it for decision 
and approval, which include, but are not 
limited to:
 – the Group’s long-term commercial 
objectives and strategy;
 – major acquisitions, disposals and 
investments;
 – the Group’s annual and interim reports and 
financial statements;
 – the interim dividend and recommendation 
of final dividend;
 – annual budgets and forecast updates;
 – Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process;
 – significant capital expenditure; and
 – the effectiveness of risk management and 
internal control systems.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer are separate, clearly 
defined and have been approved by the 
Board. The Chairman is responsible for the 
effective conduct of the Board, while the 
Chief Executive Officer is responsible for 
execution of strategy and for the day-to-day 
management of the Group.
In considering Non-executive Director 
independence, the Board has taken into 
consideration the guidance provided by 
the Code. The Board considers Peter 
Gibbs, Simon Fraser, Dame Anne Pringle, 
David Bennett and Clive Adamson to be 
independent. Simon Fraser is the Senior 
Independent Director.
During the year under review,. the Group 
complied with the Code requirement that at 
least half of the Board consist of independent 
Directors (excluding the Chairman).
The Board confirms that the Company and 
Mark Coombs entered into a relationship 
agreement on 1 July 2014 as required 
under UK Listing Rule 9.2.2AR(2)(a); and 
that: (i) the Company has complied with 
the independence provisions included in 
that agreement; (ii) so far as the Company 
is aware, Mark Coombs has complied with 
the independence provisions included in that 
agreement; and (iii) so far as the Company 
is aware, Mark Coombs has complied 
with the procurement obligation included 
in that agreement pursuant to UK Listing 
Rule 9.2.2BR(2)(a), in each case during 
the financial reporting period ending on 
30 June 2017.
The Board meets a minimum of six 
times during the year to review financial 
performance and strategy and to follow the 
formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision. Comprehensive Board papers, 
comprising an agenda and formal reports 
and briefing papers, are sent to Directors in 
advance of each meeting. Throughout their 
period in office, Directors are continually 
updated by means of written and verbal 
reports from senior executives and external 
advisers on the Group’s business, and the 
competitive and regulatory environments 
in which it operates, as well as on legal, 
compliance, corporate governance, 
corporate social responsibility and other 
relevant matters.
In addition to its formal business, the 
Board received a number of briefings and 
presentations from members of executive 
management during the year covering a 
wide range of topics across the range of 
the Group’s business. All Directors have 
access to independent professional advice, 
if required, at the Company’s expense, 
as well as to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary. New Directors 
appointed to the Board will receive advice as 
to the legal and other duties and obligations 
arising from the role of a director of a UK 
listed company within a full, formal and 
tailored induction.
The Company Secretary, under the 
direction of the Chairman, is responsible 
for maintaining an adequate continuing 
education programme, reminding the 
Directors of their duties and obligations on 
a regular basis, ensuring good information 
flows between the Board, its committees 
and management and assisting with 
Directors’ continuing professional 
development needs. The Company’s 
Nominations Committee considers the 
appointment and replacement of Directors 
Corporate governance
Governance
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 47 Corporate governance (continued)
subject to the rules set out in the Articles, a 
summary of which is set out opposite.
Under the Articles, the minimum number 
of Directors shall be two and the maximum 
shall be nine. Directors may be appointed 
by the Company by ordinary resolution or 
by the Board. A Director appointed by the 
Board must offer himself/herself for election 
at the next Annual General Meeting of the 
Company following his appointment but he 
is not taken into account in determining the 
Directors or the number of Directors who are 
to retire by rotation at that meeting.
The Directors to retire by rotation must be 
those who held office at the time of the 
two preceding Annual General Meetings 
and did not retire at either of them or those 
who have held office with the Company for 
a continuous period of nine years or more 
at the date of the Annual General Meeting. 
The office of Director shall be vacated in 
other circumstances, including where (i) 
that Director resigns or is asked to resign; 
(ii) they are or have been suffering from 
mental ill-health; (iii) they are absent without 
permission of the Board from meetings 
of the Board for six consecutive months; 
(iv) they become bankrupt or compound 
with their creditors generally; or (v) they are 
prohibited by law from being a Director.
Notwithstanding these provisions, the 
Board has adopted provision B.7.1 of the 
Code and all Directors will retire and seek 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting on 
20 October 2017. The Listing Rules require 
that the election/re-election of independent 
directors be by a majority of votes cast by 
independent shareholders as well as by a 
majority of votes cast by all shareholders.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles, the 
Companies Act 2006 and any directions 
given by the Company by special resolution, 
the business of the Company is managed 
by the Board, which may exercise all 
powers of the Company, whether relating 
to the management of the business of the 
Company or not.
Biographical details of the Directors are given 
on page 45.
Annual performance evaluation
The Code recommends that the Board 
should undertake a formal annual evaluation 
of its own performance and that of its 
committees and individual Directors and 
that an externally facilitated evaluation 
should be undertaken at least once every 
three years. An independent externally 
facilitated evaluation was undertaken 
by Independent Audit (which has no 
connection with the Company) for the 
reporting year ended 30 June 2015. The 
next independently facilitated review will 
be undertaken for the reporting year ending 
30 June 2018. For the year under review 
individual meetings were held between 
each Director and the Chairman in which 
issues and developments over the year were 
discussed and performance was considered 
by reference to the objectives of the Board 
and its committees. The Senior Independent 
Director, Simon Fraser, led a review of 
Peter Gibbs’ performance as Chairman. The 
Chairman presented a report to the Board 
and highlighted the following key points 
arising from his interviews with the Directors 
and from the Senior Independent Director:
 – The Board believes that the existing 
compact structure is effective and that 
the relationships around the Boardroom 
work well.
 – The size and balance of skills on the Board 
is appropriate at the present time.
 – The Board is mindful of the need for 
greater diversity and when a suitable time 
arises to add further members to the 
Board, will aim to increase the balance 
of female representation.
 – There is a constructive, professional and 
open environment and the Board is well 
supported by the senior executives and by 
the senior management team supporting 
them.
 – The Audit and Risk, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees are considered 
to be operating effectively.
 – The Board strategy sessions and 
subsequent discussions have improved 
consistently.
 – The Board confirmed its continuing 
support of Peter Gibbs as Chairman.
The Board believes that, following the 
completion of the performance evaluation, 
the performance of the Chairman and the 
Directors continues to be effective and that 
they continue to demonstrate commitment 
to their roles.
Board committees
The Board has appointed Audit and Risk, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees 
to assist in the execution of its duties.
All of these committees operate within 
written terms of reference, which are 
reviewed annually consistent with changes 
in legislation and best practice.
The chairman of each committee reports 
regularly to the Board.
Each of the committees is authorised, at 
the Company’s expense, to obtain external 
legal or other professional advice to assist 
in carrying out its duties. Only the members 
of each committee are entitled to attend 
its meetings but others, such as senior 
management and external advisers, may 
be invited to attend as appropriate.
Current membership of the committees 
is shown in the relevant sections below. 
The composition of these committees 
is reviewed at least annually, taking into 
consideration the recommendations of 
the Nominations Committee.

Audit and risk committee
The terms of reference for the Audit and Risk

the financial statements of the Company, 
any formal announcements relating to 
the Company’s financial statements or

issues and judgements contained in them; 
 – reviewing the contents of the Annual

the Group’s internal control and risk

 – reviewing the Company’s whistleblowing

and the prevention of bribery;
 – reviewing the Audit and Risk Committee’s 
terms of reference and carrying out an 
annual performance evaluation exercise;

Key judgements
In assessing the various key matters 
relative to its terms of reference, and 
to satisfy itself that the sources of 
assurance and information the Audit and 
Risk Committee has used to carry out 
its role to review, monitor and provide 
assurance or recommendations to the 
Board, are sufficient and objective, the 
Audit and Risk Committee has adopted 
an integrated assurance approach. This 
approach relies not only on the work of 
the external auditor but also management 
assurances received from various reports 
including from the Group Finance Director, 
Group Head of Risk Management, Group 
Head of Compliance and also via the 
existing Ashmore governance framework 
such as specialised internal management 
50 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 committees. Other independent assurance 
is received from the Compliance Monitoring 
Programme and Internal Audit and from the 
externally audited ISAE 3402 report on the 
control environment. The Group Finance 
Director, Group Head of Risk Management 
and Group Head of Internal Audit attend each 
pre-scheduled meeting of the Audit and Risk 
Committee as a matter of practice and the 
Group Head of Compliance attends meetings 
of the Committee from the financial year 
commencing 1 July 2017.
The Audit and Risk Committee also has 
responsibility for reviewing the Company’s 
arrangements on whistleblowing, ensuring 
that appropriate arrangements are in 
place for employees to be able to raise, in 
confidence, matters of possible impropriety, 
with suitable subsequent follow-up action.
The Audit and Risk Committee has the 
authority to seek any information it requires 
to perform its duties from any employee 
of the Company and to obtain outside legal 
or other independent professional advice 
as appropriate.
The principal activities of the Audit and Risk 
Committee through the year, and the manner 
in which it discharged its responsibilities, are 
described below.
Meetings
The number of Audit and Risk Committee 
meetings and their attendance by the 
Directors are set out in the table on page 
49. The Audit and Risk Committee met four 
times in relation to the current financial 
reporting year as part of its standard process. 
Scheduled meetings of the Committee take 
place on the day prior to a Board meeting to 
maximise the efficiency of interaction with 
the Board. The Chairman of the Audit and 
Risk Committee reports to the Board, as part 
of a separate agenda item, on the activities of 
the Committee. All Non-executive Directors 
are invited to attend meetings of the Audit 
and Risk Committee.
The Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee also meets on a regular basis, 
outside of scheduled committee meetings, 
with the Group Head of Internal Audit, 
the Group Head of Risk Management and 
Control, the Group Head of Compliance, 
the Group Finance Director and the 
external auditors.
Financial statements
The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the 
FY2016/17 annual report, interim results and 
reports from the external auditor, KPMG LLP, 
on the outcome of its reviews and audits 
in 2017.
Significant accounting matters
During the year the Audit and Risk 
Committee considered key accounting 
issues, matters and judgements in relation 
to the Group’s financial statements and 
disclosures relating to:
Share-based payments
It is the responsibility of the Remuneration 
Committee to address, and report upon, 
compensation matters including share-based 
payments made to employees of the Group. 
The Audit and Risk Committee considers 
these in its review of the financial statements 
and receives a report from the external 
auditor on the quantification and accounting 
treatment related to such payments, which 
are explained in note 10 to the financial 
statements. 
Classification of seed capital investments
Ashmore makes seed capital investments 
in funds that are managed by Group 
subsidiaries in order to support future third-
party AuM growth. These investments can 
result in Ashmore becoming a controlling 
party in the funds. If at the time of investing 
in these funds Ashmore expects the period 
of control to be less than 12 months, the 
investments are classified as held-for-sale 
(HFS) and consolidated as HFS assets 
and liabilities rather than on a line-by-line 
basis. In determining whether the Group 
controls these funds, there are three factors 
which are taken into consideration, namely 
1) whether Ashmore has power over the 
relevant activities of the funds; 2) whether 
Ashmore is exposed to variability of returns 
through fees and/or co-investments; and 
3) the strength of the linkage between 
the power and the variable returns. The 
third factor is one of the key judgemental 
areas that KPMG focuses upon in its audit 
due to the potential risk that Ashmore 
has incorrectly assessed the strength of 
the linkage between the power and the 
variable returns.
The accounting treatment for seed capital 
investments is addressed more fully in note 
20 to the financial statements.
Management fee rebates
A report from the external auditor 
regarding the processing of fee rebates 
and its treatment on revenue recognition 
was received and reviewed. The method 
of accounting for revenue recognition is 
described more fully on page 98. The Audit 
and Risk Committee is satisfied that controls 
are in place to ensure that revenue rebates 
are recorded accurately and completely.
Future IFRS and UK GAAP developments
The Audit and Risk Committee has 
received a report from management 
and the external auditor and discussed 
future accounting developments likely 
to affect the presentation of the Group’s 
financial statements.
Other accounting matters
During the year, the Audit and Risk 
Committee received communications 
from management and from the external 
auditor on other accounting matters. The 
Committee has also reviewed the adoption 
of the going concern basis in preparing the 
interim and year end consolidated accounts 
and considered the longer term viability 
statement for the Group which is described 
in more detail on page 34.
UK Corporate Governance Code
A further version of the Code (the 2016 
Code) was issued effective for accounting 
periods commencing on or after 
17 June 2016, which Ashmore has adopted 
for the financial year ended 30 June 2017.
External auditor
For FY2016/17 Thomas Brown became 
the KPMG audit partner. The FRC Ethical 
Standards for Auditors require that KPMG 
rotate the audit partners every five years for 
a listed entity.
The external auditor attends all meetings 
of the Audit and Risk Committee. It is 
the responsibility of the Committee to 
monitor the performance, objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor. The 
Audit and Risk Committee discusses and 
agrees the scope of the audit plan for the 
full year and the review plan for the interim 
statement with the auditor.
The external auditor provides reports at 
each committee meeting on topics such 
as the control environment, key accounting 
matters and mandatory communications. 
The Audit and Risk Committee also received 
Governance
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 51 Audit and risk committee report continued
a comprehensive presentation from the 
auditor demonstrating, to the Committee’s 
satisfaction, how its independence and 
objectivity is maintained when providing 
non-audit services. 
External auditor independence
The Audit and Risk Committee has agreed 
the types of permitted and non-permitted 
non-audit services and those which require 
explicit prior approval. All contracts for non-
audit services in excess of £25,000 must be 
notified to the Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee and approved by him.
During the year the value of non-audit 
services provided by KPMG LLP amounted 
to £0.2 million (FY2015/16: £0.4 million). 
Non-audit services as a proportion of 
total fees paid to the auditor have fallen to 
approximately 33% (FY2015/16: 50%). The 
overall quantum of non-audit services is 
not considered to be significant given that 
Ashmore operates within a highly-regulated 
market and that a significant proportion of 
the non-audit services provided relate to the 
following matters:
 – reporting on the half-year 
financial statements;
 – providing regular mandatory assurance 
reports to the FCA (as the regulator of 
Ashmore Investment Management 
Limited and Ashmore Investment 
Advisors Limited);
 – reporting on the internal control 
systems applicable to Ashmore’s offices 
in London, New York and Singapore 
as required under the international 
standard ISAE 3402, pursuant to 
investment management industry 
standards; and 
 – auditing the controls and procedures 
employed by the Company relating to the 
production of investment performance 
figures over one, three and five-year 
periods to conform to the investment 
management industry’s Global Investment 
Performance Standards.
The assurance provided by the Group’s 
external auditor on the items listed above is 
considered by the Audit and Risk Committee 
to be strictly necessary in the interests of the 
business and, by their nature, these services 
could not easily be provided by a separate 
professional auditing firm.
The provision of tax advisory services, due 
diligence/transaction services and litigation 
services may be permitted with the Audit 
and Risk Committee’s prior approval. The 
provision of internal audit services, valuation 
work and any other activity that may give 
rise to any possibility of self-review are not 
permitted under any circumstance. During 
the year there were no circumstances 
where KPMG LLP was engaged to provide 
services which might have led to a conflict 
of interests.
The Audit and Risk Committee has assessed 
and noted the impact on the Company of EU 
legislation introduced in June 2014 which 
serves to reform the audit market within the 
EU. The areas addressed are:
 – Mandatory audit firm rotation is required 
after 20 years and a re-tender process 
every 10 years. The Committee undertook 
a comprehensive tender process in March 
2016 for the audit in relation to the year 
ending 30 June 2017.
 – Restrictions on non-audit services: The 
legislation restricts the non-audit services 
which can be provided by the auditor. In 
compliance with this requirement Deloitte 
provide independent tax advice services to 
the Group.
 – Non-audit service fee limits: The legislation 
also imposes a fee cap of 70% of the 
average statutory audit fees paid in the 
last three consecutive years. This cap 
will not restrict KPMG from continuing 
to undertake assurance, verification and 
reporting work in other required areas 
described above such as to the FCA, 
Global Investment Performance Standards 
and ISAE 3402.
At the end of each Audit and Risk Committee 
meeting the Non-executive Directors meet 
with the external and internal auditors 
without the Executive Directors being 
present so as to provide a forum to raise any 
matters of concern in confidence.
KPMG LLP (and its prior entity KPMG 
Audit plc) have acted as the auditor to the 
Company since the IPO in October 2006 and 
the lead audit partner rotates every five years 
to assure independence.
In order to assess the effectiveness of 
the external audit process the Audit and 
Risk Committee asked detailed questions 
of key members of management as well 
as considering the firm-wide audit quality 
inspection report issued by the FRC in June 
2017 and KPMG’s response to the findings 
inspection. Based on this review the 
Committee concurred with management’s 
view that there had been appropriate focus 
and challenge of the primary areas of 
audit risk and assessed the quality of the 
audit to be satisfactory. Accordingly, the 
Audit and Risk Committee continues to be 
satisfied with the work of KPMG LLP and 
that it continues to remain objective and 
independent. The Committee has therefore 
recommended to the Board that a resolution 
be put to shareholders for the reappointment 
of the auditor, and its remuneration and 
terms of engagement, at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company.
Internal controls and risk 
management systems
The Group Head of Risk Management and 
Control attends each meeting of the Audit 
and Risk Committee and provides reports 
to each. These reports have addressed 
a number of risk-related topics and have 
demonstrated how the output of the 
different Investment, Risk and Compliance 
and Pricing and Valuation Methodology 
Committees’ discussions throughout the 
period have been effective in highlighting, 
tracking and contributing towards managing 
key market, liquidity, credit, counterparty 
and operational risks. In particular, in 
relation to operational risk, the Audit and 
Risk Committee has also reviewed and 
discussed the Group’s Principal Risk Matrix 
which continues to serve as an effective tool 
to highlight and monitor the principal risks 
facing the Group and its continued evolution, 
and reflects changes in the business profile 
of the Group and the corresponding impact 
on internal controls and related processes.
The Audit and Risk Committee also received 
an annual report on, and conducted a review 
and evaluation of, the system of internal 
controls and risk management operated 
within the Company pursuant to the Financial 
Reporting Council guidance, ‘Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting’, 
prior to final review by the Board.

management framework and the manner in 
which risks are identified and managed is set 
out on pages 32 to 37.
Internal audit
The Head of Internal Audit has regular 
meetings with the Chairman of the Audit and 
Risk Committee and attends all meetings 
of the Committee to present reports on the 
internal audit findings and on the proposed 
programme of reviews. The Audit and 
Risk Committee continues to monitor the 
internal audit plan on an ongoing basis to 
ensure that it remains relevant to the needs 
of the business and to ensure that it can be 
adapted or changed if a particular focus area 
necessitates this.
During the year, the Audit and Risk 
Committee received presentations from 
Internal Audit on a number of topics including 
the Internal Audit plan for the year and the 
outcomes of any internal audits conducted 
during the period under review. The 
Committee also received presentations from 
Internal Audit on the implementation of the 
assurance framework and the results of the 
assurance review over the effectiveness 
of the controls and mitigants in place for 
the principal risks rated as having a high 
residual risk. Based on the work described, 
and in accordance with the requirements of 
the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors’ 
Financial Services Code guidance, Internal 
Audit has provided the Audit and Risk 
Committee with its assessment of the 
overall effectiveness of the governance 
and risk and control framework of 
the organisation.
The Global Institute of Internal Auditors 
International Professional Practices 
Framework (IPPF) and the Financial Services 
Code guidance have a requirement for 
regular independent evaluations of the 
Internal Audit function, and the Audit and 
Risk Committee will consider with the 
Internal Auditor the scope and timing of 
such an external quality assessment.
Internal Audit also provides annual 
confirmations to the Audit and Risk 
Committee on four areas: internal 
independence, internal audit skills and 
continuing professional development, any 
potential conflicts of interest and the ongoing 
suitability of the internal audit terms of 
reference. After due consideration, and in 
accordance with the Financial Services Code 
guidance, the Audit and Risk Committee 
is satisfied that the quality, experience and 
expertise of the Internal Audit function is 
appropriate for the business and that it has 
adequate resources to fulfil its remit.
Compliance
In order to ensure a co-ordinated reporting 
process with the Risk Management and 
Internal Audit functions, the Group Head 
of Compliance will attend and present to 
the Audit and Risk Committee, rather than 
to the Board, from the financial reporting 
period commencing 1 July 2017. Reports 
will include details of the Group’s relations 
with regulators; the Compliance monitoring 
programme; material breaches, errors 
and complaints; retail conduct risk, anti-
money laundering controls and sanctions 
compliance. The Audit and Risk Committee 
will also approve the Compliance monitoring 
plan and review the Group’s procedures 
for ensuring compliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements.
Information security
Information security (including cyber 
security) is identified as a key principal risk to 
the business which is subject to Ashmore’s 
governance, policies and procedures and risk 
assessment. The Audit and Risk Committee 
receives annual updates from the Ashmore 
IT Department on potential cyber security 
threats and how Ashmore would respond 
to a significant event.
Whistleblowing and fraud
The Committee is responsible for reviewing 
the arrangements in place for employees to 
raise concerns in confidence about possible 
wrongdoing in financial reporting and 
other matters and for ensuring that these 
arrangements allow for proportionate and 
independent investigation.
Public funds’ audits
The Audit and Risk Committee met with 
and received reports from the independent 
auditors of Ashmore’s SICAV, US 40-Act 
and Guernsey public funds on the conduct 
of those audits and outcomes from them.
Audit and Risk Committee 
effectiveness
A review of the effectiveness of the 
Board, its committees and the Directors 
was conducted during the year. Following 
the review the Board has concluded 
that the Audit and Risk Committee is 
working effectively.

  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 55 
Remuneration Committee 
I am pleased to present the Remuneration 
report for the year ending 30 June 2017. This 
year’s report is split into three sections: an at a 
glance summary, which includes details of this 
year’s remuneration outcomes for the CEO and 
GFD and highlights of the proposed policy; the 
proposed Directors’ remuneration policy; and 
finally the Annual Report on Remuneration, which 
explains how the current policy has been applied 
during the year and which will be subject to an 
advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting. 
Ashmore Group plc’s Directors’ remuneration 
policy (the Remuneration Policy, the Policy) will be 
subject to a triennial binding vote by shareholders 
at this year’s Annual General Meeting in October. 
The Group’s Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee), has been reviewing all aspects of the 
Remuneration Policy over the last few months in 
the light of regulatory and other developments 
since the last binding shareholder vote in 2014. 
I, along with the Board Chairman and other senior 
Ashmore employees, have spent time meeting 
with our larger shareholders to understand their 
views on our existing Remuneration Policy and 
practices. In particular, the Committee and the 
Board have been focused on whether Ashmore’s 
remuneration approach is still aligned with the 
long-term strategy of the business. 
Remuneration Policy structure 
We believe the current Remuneration Policy 
has served clients, employees and shareholders 
extremely well and therefore we are not 
proposing any significant changes. The 
Remuneration Policy is deliberately simple and 
the principles supporting it are applied across 
all of the Group’s employees in order to instil 
a common equity ownership culture based on 
pay for performance. The key principles are: 
– A consistent remuneration structure for all 
employees, not just Executive Directors. 
– A low cap on fixed salaries, currently £100,000 
for Executive Directors, and variable awards 
that genuinely reflect performance. 
– Simplicity, with a single profit-derived bonus 
pool for all employees and no separate LTIP 
for Executive Directors. 
– A cap on the aggregate variable compensation 
pool for all employees, including executives, 
currently at 25% of earnings before variable 
compensation, interest and tax (EBVCIT). 
– Long-term deferral (with a five-year cliff vest) 
of a substantial proportion of variable awards. 
– Additional performance conditions for Executive 
Directors that put a significant proportion of 
their total pay at risk. 
– Strong alignment of interests with shareholders 
and clients through significant employee 
equity ownership. 
 
We believe that this type of structure is different 
from most other major UK listed companies as 
there is no complicated LTIP, it is consistent 
throughout the Company which is critical to 
develop a strong, team-based corporate culture, 
it is heavily focused on variable compensation 
which is paid only for genuine performance, 
and it is designed to align all employees with 
shareholders through equity ownership. 
Approximately 50% of outstanding shares are 
owned by 164 employees, 87% of those that 
are eligible, and who average six years of service. 
Employee shareholders have voted for and 
continue to support, the Remuneration Policy 
since establishment in 1992. This emphasises 
the strong equity-ownership culture that prevails 
at Ashmore, and also ensures effective alignment 
with external shareholders. 
Hence, it can be seen that this Policy has worked 
for the benefit of all shareholders over a long 
period of time in both private and 11 years of 
public ownership. 
There are some features of the Remuneration 
Policy, however, that are now less common in the 
UK market, such as the opportunity for employees 
to receive matching shares, and the fact that the 
cap on pay is at the Group level and not at the 
individual employee level, but these should be 
regarded in the context of the Group’s distinctive 
business model and the Board’s desire to foster 
an equity ownership culture with all of the positive 
outcomes that this can deliver for clients 
and shareholders.  
Reflecting performance in 
remuneration 
Most importantly, though, the remuneration 
structure is designed to support and fit with the 
long-term strategy of the business. The Group 
operates in a growth sector which experiences 
market cycles and the remuneration policy plays 
a key role in minimising fixed costs, providing 
flexibility in variable costs, enabling key staff 
retention, and thereby aligning the interests of 
clients, shareholders and employees through 
market cycles. This is the key driver of the 
structure of our remuneration policy rather than 
a sector benchmarking exercise or short-term 
business metrics.  
During the period of recent under performance 
of emerging market assets, our approach resulted 
in Executive Director variable compensation at 
award value falling from £12 million in 2011 to 
£2.9 million in 2016, reflecting the 30% fall in our 
revenues and 32% decline in diluted earnings 
per share. Over the same period, dividends to 
shareholders actually grew by 15%. This is 
demonstrated in the chart on page 58, which 
shows that as revenues have fluctuated through 
the market cycle, the remuneration policy has 
provided significant cost flexibility and therefore 
has protected returns to shareholders. In addition 
the application of stretching performance 
conditions applied to elements of deferred 
restricted shares in 2010 and 2011 have resulted 
in £10,500,000 of awards lapsing with no value 
in 2015 and 2016. The impact of our approach to 
variable remuneration for the CEO, who has been 
in his role for sufficient time to demonstrate 
variable pay outcomes through market cycles, 
can be seen in the chart on page 58. 
Over a number of years, the Group has continued 
to receive support from shareholders for its 
Remuneration Policy and it is recognised that the 
Policy has delivered appropriate outcomes over 
a long period of time. The core features of the 
Policy, such as long-dated equity deferral, were 
established prior to Ashmore’s listing in 2006, 
and have subsequently been reflected in 
established market practices or financial services 
industry regulation. The significant deferral of 
equity awards under the Group’s remuneration 
policy meant that it was able to comply easily 
with the Alternative Investment Fund Managers 
Directive and it is already consistent with the 
publicly-stated position on the subject of a number 
of institutional investors. Interestingly, emerging 
governance guidance is recommending that all 
major companies move away from the use of 
LTIPs towards a model similar to that which 
Ashmore has always had in place, as LTIPs have 
not tended to work in the best long-term interest 
of the business. 
The Remuneration Committee and Board believe 
that the Policy to be put to a binding vote at this 
year’s AGM will continue to serve the Company, 
its clients and its shareholders well and would 
welcome your support for the 2017 Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, highlights of which can 
be found in the at a glance section overleaf.

which will be put to a binding vote at the 20 October 2017 AGM are 
shown on the following pages. Below is a summary of this year’s 
remuneration outcomes, which have been delivered under the current 
Policy, approved in 2014.  
Performance for the year ending 30 June 2017 
Performance in relation to the Group’s KPIs and the short term 
performance measures by which the Executive Directors are 
assessed, has been positive through the period. Particular 
highlights include: 
– 12% increase in AuM to 
US$58.7bn;  
– Continued strong investment 
performance over 1, 3 and 5 years;
– Improved adjusted EBITDA 
margin of 65%;  
– 31% increase in diluted EPS to 
23.7p per share; 
– 23% increase in profit 
before tax  
– Continued focus on cost control 
Further detail can be found in Figure 5 of the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 65. 
The Chief Executive’s remuneration outcomes 
The Chief Executive’s total annual bonus comprising cash and share 
awards at grant value, prior to any waivers or voluntary elections he 
may choose to make, increased from £1,500,000 (FY 2015/16) to 
£4,000,000. Should the Chief Executive voluntarily elect to commute 
the maximum 50% of his cash bonus, and as a result receive a 
matching share award, his maximum annual bonus will be £5,200,000
as shown in the below chart. The total sum ultimately to be received 
by the Chief Executive will be dependent on achievement relative to 
the performance conditions, which means that up to £1,400,000 of 
this sum may not be paid out when the share awards vest in 2022.  
Restricted and restricted matching shares awarded to the Chief 
Executive in 2010, vesting in 2015 and 2011, vesting in 2016 with 
respective grant values of £4,900,000 and £5,600,000 lapsed in full as 
a result of the application of the stretching performance conditions. 
 
 
 
 
The Group Finance Director’s remuneration outcomes 
The Group Finance Director’s total annual bonus comprising cash and share 
awards at grant value, prior to any waivers or voluntary elections he may choose 
to make, increased from £750,000 (FY 2015/16) to £950,000. Should the Group 
Finance Director voluntarily elect to commute the maximum of 50% of his cash 
bonus, and as a result receive a matching share award, his maximum annual 
bonus will be £1,235,000, as shown in the below chart. The total sum ultimately 
to be received by the Group Finance Director will be dependent on achievement 
relative to the performance conditions, which means that £332,500 of this sum 
may not be paid out when the share awards vest in 2022. 
 
 
Details of any elections made to commute cash bonus and related 
awards of matching shares will be provided in the Remuneration 
report for the year in which the awards are made, as will the vesting 
outcome of the awards made in 2012 due to vest on 18 September 
2017. As has been the case in previous years, base salaries for 
Executive Directors have remained unchanged at £100,000, a level 
significantly below fixed pay levels for equivalent positions at peer 
organisations, consistent with the Company’s management of its 
fixed cost base and strong belief in pay for performance. 
Regulatory considerations for the year ending  
30 June 2017 
For remuneration relating to the year ending 30 June 2017, the 
Remuneration Committee has again ensured that pay will be delivered 
to Executive Directors and other employees categorised by the FCA 
as identified staff, consistent with the requirements of the Alternative 
Investment Fund Managers Directive. This has meant that Executive 
Directors and other relevant employees will receive a proportion of 
their upfront or cash bonus delivered as a further award of restricted 
shares which are retained and restricted from sale for a six-month 
period, rather than as cash. Further details of this can be found in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Consideration of malus and clawback for the year 
ending 30 June 2017 
A clawback principle applies to variable remuneration, enabling 
the Committee to recoup variable remuneration under certain 
circumstances. Clawback can be applied to both the cash and  
share-based elements of variable remuneration, via the reduction 
or cancellation of any outstanding unvested deferred share awards 
regardless of the year to which they relate. The Committee 
considered there were no events or circumstances that would have 
made it appropriate to recoup remuneration during the year ending 
30 June 2017.

relative to the performance conditions, which means that £332,500 of this sum 
may not be paid out when the share awards vest in 2022. 
 
 
Details of any elections made to commute cash bonus and related 
awards of matching shares will be provided in the Remuneration 
report for the year in which the awards are made, as will the vesting 
outcome of the awards made in 2012 due to vest on 18 September 
2017. As has been the case in previous years, base salaries for 
Executive Directors have remained unchanged at £100,000, a level 
significantly below fixed pay levels for equivalent positions at peer 
organisations, consistent with the Company’s management of its 
fixed cost base and strong belief in pay for performance. 
Regulatory considerations for the year ending  
30 June 2017 
For remuneration relating to the year ending 30 June 2017, the 
Remuneration Committee has again ensured that pay will be delivered 
to Executive Directors and other employees categorised by the FCA 
as identified staff, consistent with the requirements of the Alternative 
Investment Fund Managers Directive. This has meant that Executive 
Directors and other relevant employees will receive a proportion of 
their upfront or cash bonus delivered as a further award of restricted 
shares which are retained and restricted from sale for a six-month 
period, rather than as cash. Further details of this can be found in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Consideration of malus and clawback for the year 
ending 30 June 2017 
A clawback principle applies to variable remuneration, enabling 
the Committee to recoup variable remuneration under certain 
circumstances. Clawback can be applied to both the cash and  
share-based elements of variable remuneration, via the reduction 
or cancellation of any outstanding unvested deferred share awards 
regardless of the year to which they relate. The Committee 
considered there were no events or circumstances that would have 
made it appropriate to recoup remuneration during the year ending 
30 June 2017. 
 
Main features of the proposed  
Remuneration Policy  
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 57 
Base salary  
In a business where the majority of costs are 
employee-related, a low cap on base salaries, 
currently set at £120,000, seeks to ensure 
that fixed costs are minimised, and it delivers 
a ratio of CEO to median employee pay 
that is very low relative to the UK market. 
Therefore it is not proposed to change 
the existing Policy. 
Variable remuneration, including 
matching shares 
The Group operates a simple variable 
remuneration structure for all employees 
including Executive Directors, based on a 
single annual profit-derived bonus pool that 
is capped at 25% of earnings before variable 
remuneration, interest and tax. There is a bias 
towards long-dated equity through the use of 
restricted shares and the voluntary option to 
defer cash in favour of equity. Ashmore’s pay 
structure has always been straightforward, 
comprised of an annual cash bonus and an 
annual award of equity, which has vesting 
deferred for five years. The Group does not 
operate, and never has operated, a separate 
long-term incentive programme. 
The process of determining the annual 
cash bonus and share awards for Executive 
Directors is one to which the Remuneration 
Committee dedicate significant time. Whilst 
the Committee retains discretion over the 
amounts awarded, the outcomes are based 
on detailed analysis of achievements relative 
to financial and non-financial KPIs. 
For Executive Directors, in addition to 
the requirement to remain in service until 
vesting, half of the restricted shares are 
subject to four equally-weighted performance 
conditions over the five-year period, relating 
to: total shareholder return relative to a broad 
industry peer group; delivery of investment 
outperformance; growth in assets under 
management; and profitability. 
The individual may elect to defer up to half 
of his cash bonus into restricted shares that 
also vest after five years, and which will be 
matched in the form of an additional award 
of restricted shares. For Executive Directors, 
half of the additional restricted shares are 
subject to the performance conditions 
described above. The Committee believes it 
is important to ensure a consistent treatment 
of deferred remuneration across the firm, 
and so matching restricted shares can be 
awarded to Executive Directors in the same 
way as any other employee, albeit that 
other employees do not have additional 
performance conditions attached to 
their restricted matching shares. 
The current Policy therefore ensures that 
between 40% and 77% of an Executive 
Director’s variable pay is deferred for five 
years. With a low basic salary, this also 
results in a very high proportion of total 
remuneration being deferred. 
This variable remuneration structure allows 
the Remuneration Committee to flex the 
awards in order to reflect the performance 
of both the business and the individual in 
any given period. The current Remuneration 
Policy plays a key role in providing flexibility 
in variable costs, enabling key staff retention, 
and thereby aligning the interests of clients, 
shareholders and employees through market 
cycles. The Group’s history demonstrates 
that there is significant variability, in terms 
of both the proportion of profits made 
available for variable remuneration and also 
the awards made to Executive Directors, 
including several cases when no award was 
made, and the application of the stretching 
performance conditions results in a significant 
proportion of remuneration being at risk.  
In addition, the Committee has never 
utilised fully the capped 25% bonus pool; 
the historical range of outcomes as a listed 
company is between 14% and 21% of profits 
allocated to the employee bonus pool. 
The use of equity with significant deferral 
ensures a strong alignment of interests 
between clients, shareholders and 
employees and, in combination with ongoing 
performance conditions, seeks to support 
long-term decision-making. The potentially 
dilutive effect of the equity awards has been 
mitigated historically through the efficient 
purchase of ordinary shares in the market 
by the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust, and 
it is intended that this approach continues. 
Therefore it is not proposed to change the 
existing Policy. 
Variable remuneration cap  
Whilst there is a de facto cap provided by 
the limit on the proportion of profits that can 
be awarded to employees in any given year, 
and in practice this can serve as an effective 
cap on the pay awards to Executive Directors, 
the current Remuneration Policy does not 
explicitly cap any individual employee’s 
variable pay award. The Committee believes 
it is appropriate to retain discretion and 
flexibility to reward performance, and does 
not want to risk creating an incentive to 
manage towards a particular financial 
threshold. The Committee has a demonstrable 
record of paying Executive Directors only 
for performance, with zero awards in 
some years. 
The structure of Ashmore’s variable pay 
awards should be seen in the context of the 
Policy which applies a low cap on base 
salaries, and which delivers a significant 
proportion of variable remuneration in 
deferred restricted shares. This supports the 
Group’s strategy and provides significant cost 
flexibility in a cyclical business, thus aligning 
the interests of clients, shareholders and 
employees through market cycles. 
The Committee believes this is an appropriate 
Policy for a business whose main assets are 
its employees, as it builds a strong equity 
ownership culture which in turn delivers high 
levels of staff retention, whereas a formulaic 
approach to determining pay can often drive 
the wrong behaviours and thus long-term 
outcomes for clients, shareholders and 
employees. Therefore it is not proposed 
to change the existing Policy. 
Shareholding requirement 
The Committee recognises that a formal post 
vesting shareholding requirement could be 
useful in the case of new Executive Directors 
and therefore proposes introducing a new 
requirement for Executive Directors to build up 
a shareholding equivalent to 200% of salary 
over a three-year period. This period will 
commence from the conclusion of the AGM in 
2017 for existing Executive Directors and from 
the first five-year vesting date for new 
Executive Directors, if the 2017 Remuneration 
Policy is approved by shareholders.

The chart below shows variable remuneration awarded to the 
CEO each year between 2009 and 2016. As can be seen, the 
Committee exercises its discretion in setting the annual level of 
award at an appropriate level based on the CEO’s performance 
and the performance of the business each year; and as such, 
the variation in award level is reflective of the range of annual 
outcomes. In addition, as a result of the stretching performance 
conditions measured over the 5 year deferral period of restricted 
awards, the amount eventually received by the CEO when awards 
vest can vary significantly from the original award amount.

Directors’ remuneration policy 
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 59 
This section of the Remuneration report 
has been prepared in accordance with Part 4 
of The Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. It sets out 
the Remuneration Policy for the Company. 
The Policy has been developed taking into 
account the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 and shareholders’ 
executive remuneration guidelines. The 
current Policy was approved by a binding 
shareholder vote in 2014, and can be found 
on pages 56 to 59 of the 2016 Annual Report 
and Accounts. This policy was approved for 
three years and therefore will expire this 
year. The new Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
proposed by the Committee is set out on 
pages 59 to 63. Shareholders will be asked to 
approve the new policy at the 2017 AGM on 
20 October 2017. This policy will take effect 
for Directors from the date it is approved and 
is expected to apply for three years. 
Policy overview 
The Remuneration Committee determines, 
and agrees with the Board, the Company’s 
policy on the remuneration of the Board 
Chairman, Executive Directors and other 
members of executive management 
including employees designated as 
Code or Identified Staff under the FCA’s 
Remuneration Codes. The Remuneration 
Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website. 
In determining the Remuneration Policy, the 
Remuneration Committee takes into account 
the following:  
– the need to encourage and promote the 
long-term success of the Company; 
– the need to attract, retain and motivate 
talented Executive Directors and 
senior management;  
– consistency with the remuneration 
principles applied to Ashmore employees 
as a whole; 
– external comparisons to examine current 
market trends and practices and equivalent 
roles in similar companies taking into 
account their size, business complexity, 
international scope and relative 
performance; and 
– the requirements of the Remuneration 
Codes of the UK financial services 
regulator. 
How the views of shareholders 
are taken into account 
The Remuneration Committee regularly 
compares the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy with shareholder guidelines, and takes 
account of the results of shareholder votes 
on remuneration. 
If material changes to the Remuneration 
Policy are contemplated, the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman consults with major 
shareholders about these in advance.  
Details of votes cast to approve the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and last year’s Annual 
Report on Remuneration are provided in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration section of 
this report. 
During the period, the Chairman of the 
Board, the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and other senior Company 
representatives engaged with shareholders 
and proxy voting agencies, both in writing and 
through formal meetings, in order to provide 
information and solicit comments and 
feedback on the Company’s remuneration 
practices and outcomes, and have considered 
these discussions as part of their decision-
making process.  
Consistent company-wide 
approach 
The Company applies a consistent 
remuneration philosophy for employees 
at all levels.  
The cap on base salary means that 
Executive Directors’ base salaries are set at 
a similar level to other senior investment and 
professional employees in the Company, and 
the base salary range from lowest to highest 
in the Company is considerably narrower than 
the market norm. All employees are eligible 
for a performance-related annual bonus, and 
the principle of bonus deferral into Company 
shares or equivalent applies to annual 
bonuses for all employees who have at least 
one full year’s service. Employees other than 
Executive Directors may elect to receive 
up to the first £50,000 (or local currency 
equivalent) of their annual bonus delivered 
as 90% cash and 10% as restricted shares, 
rather than in the Company’s usual 
proportions of 60% cash and 40% restricted 
shares. Rates of pension contribution and 
fringe benefit provisions are consistent 
between executives and other employees 
within each country where the 
Company operates.  
The Company does not operate formal 
employee consultation on remuneration. 
However, employees are able to provide 
direct feedback on the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy to their line managers 
or the Human Resources department.  
The Remuneration Committee monitors 
the effectiveness of the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy in recruiting, retaining, 
engaging and motivating employees, and 
receives reports from the Chief Executive 
Officer on how the Company’s remuneration 
policies are viewed by employees and 
whether they are meeting business needs. 
The Remuneration Committee does not 
seek to apply fixed ratios between the total 
remuneration levels of different roles in 
the Company, as this would prevent it from 
recruiting and retaining the necessary talent 
in a highly competitive employment market. 
However, the base salary multiple between 
the highest and lowest paid UK-based 
employees in the Company is less than 4.5x.

VARIABLE COMPENSATION (DISCRETIONARY)
PURPOSE AND LINK TO SHORT AND LONG-
TERM STRATEGY 
Rewards performance and ensures interests of executives are 
closely aligned with other shareholders. 
OPERATION, PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
AND PERIODS, DEFERRAL AND CLAWBACK 
Executive Directors are considered each year for a discretionary 
variable pay award depending on personal and Company 
performance, by applying a range of performance indicators such 
as growth in AuM, investment performance, profits, and strategic 
and operational achievements. The variable pay award comprises 
a cash bonus (part of which may be voluntarily deferred into 
restricted shares) and a long-term incentive in the form of both a 
restricted share award and a restricted matching share award on 
any voluntarily deferred cash bonus. 
1. Cash bonus (60% of total award) 
The executive may voluntarily commute up to half of the cash bonus 
in return for the same value in a restricted bonus share award (or 
phantom equivalent) deferred for five years. The deferred shares are 
eligible for restricted matching shares (or phantom equivalent) vesting 
after five years subject to conditions (see 3 below). 
Long-term incentives under the Company Executive 
Omnibus Incentive Plan (Omnibus Plan)  
2. Restricted shares award (40% of total award) 
There is no separate long-term incentive plan, rather 40% of the 
executive’s annual bonus is compulsorily deferred into Company 
shares (or phantom equivalent) for a period of five years and does 
not qualify for matching. Half of this deferred portion is subject to 
additional performance conditions on vesting. The Policy permits 
the Committee to set suitable performance conditions each year 
for each award type. The performance condition for the most 
recent awards was a combination of: 
– 25% relative total shareholder return (TSR) 
– Measured against an asset management peer group 
over five years.  
– 25% investment outperformance 
– Relative to the relevant benchmarks over three and five years.  
– 25% growth in AuM  
– A compound increase in AuM over the five-year 
performance period. 
– 25% profitability  
– Ashmore’s diluted earnings per share (EPS) performance 
relative to a comparator index over the five-year 
performance period. 
3. Restricted matching shares awarded on the voluntarily 
commuted cash bonus (from 1 above) 
Matching is provided on the voluntarily commuted cash bonus, 
subject to the same performance conditions on half of the matching 
award as that described in 2 above. The maximum match used to 
date on any award made under the current policy was one-for-one 
the Policy permits the matching level to be changed for future 
awards but not to exceed three-for-one. Dividends or dividend 
equivalents on deferred restricted bonus share (or phantom 
equivalent) awards and on the portion of restricted share and 
restricted matching share awards that are not subject to a 
performance condition vesting after five years will be paid out in 
line with the Company’s dividend payment schedule. Dividends or 
dividend equivalents on the portion of restricted and restricted 
matching share (or phantom equivalent) awards which are subject 
to a performance condition will be accrued and paid out at the time 
the award vests and to the extent of vesting. For any awards made 
to a Director prior to his or her appointment as a Director, the 
dividend or dividend equivalent payments are made on share 
awards in full, under previous commitments made to participants. 
The Remuneration Policy permits the award of deferred 
remuneration in alternative forms such as share options, although 
none have been granted in recent years, and to vary the percentage 
split of award between cash and share awards to meet business, 
legislative or regulatory requirements. 
MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY 
The aggregate variable compensation pool for all employees, 
including executives, is capped, currently at 25% of earnings before 
variable compensation, interest and tax (EBVCIT). The Policy 
permits the Remuneration Committee to vary this cap if necessary 
to meet business needs. 
The policy is to cap the aggregate sum available for variable 
compensation rather than to cap individual variable 
compensation awards.  
The high proportion of variable compensation deferral, with 
vesting after five years and subject in part to ongoing performance 
conditions, encourages a prudent approach to risk management, 
in support of the Company’s risk and compliance controls. Most 
importantly, though, the remuneration structure is designed to 
support and fit with the long-term strategy of the business. The 
Group operates in a growth sector which experiences market 
cycles and this aspect of the Remuneration Policy plays a key role 
in providing flexibility in variable costs, enabling key staff retention, 
and thereby aligning the interests of clients, shareholders and 
employees including Directors through such cycles. 
MALUS AND CLAWBACK 
In addition to the performance condition described above, malus 
and clawback can be applied to all elements of variable 
remuneration at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, 
including to unvested share awards made in prior periods. 
Circumstances that may trigger the application of the Committee’s 
discretion include a material misstatement of the Company’s 
results, a material failure in risk management, serious reputational 
damage, or the executive’s misconduct.  
PERSONAL SHAREHOLDING 
– Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding 
equivalent to 200% of salary over a three-year period. This period 
will commence from the conclusion of the AGM in 2017 for 
existing Executive Directors and from the first five-year vesting 
date for newly appointed Executive Directors.

Differences in Remuneration Policy 
for Executive Directors compared 
with other employees 
The Remuneration Policy for the Executive 
Directors is generally consistent with that for 
employees across the Company as a whole. 
However, there are some differences which 
the Remuneration Committee believes are 
necessary to reflect the different 
responsibilities of employees across the 
Company. Below Executive Director level, 
while the same five-year deferral policy 
applies, share awards are not subject 
to additional performance conditions. 
Employees other than Executive Directors 
may elect to receive up to the first £50,000 
(or local currency equivalent) of their annual 
bonus delivered as 90% cash and 10% as 
restricted shares, rather than in the 
Company’s usual proportions of 60% 
cash and 40% restricted shares. 
External Non-executive 
Director positions 
Executive Directors are permitted to 
serve as Non-executive Directors of other 
companies where there is no competition 
with the Company’s business activities and 
where these duties do not interfere with the 
individual’s ability to perform his or her duties 
for the Company. Tom Shippey holds one 
unpaid external appointment with a charitable 
organisation unconnected to the asset 
management industry. Other than as noted 
above, Executive Directors do not presently 
hold any external appointments with any  
non-Ashmore-related companies. 
Where an outside appointment is 
accepted in furtherance of the 
Company’s business, any fees received 
are remitted to the Company.  
If the appointment is not connected 
to the Company’s business, the 
Executive Director is entitled to retain 
any fees received. 
Approach to remuneration for new 
Executive Director appointments 
The remuneration package for an externally 
recruited new Executive Director would be 
set in accordance with the terms and 
maximum levels of the Company’s approved 
Remuneration Policy in force at the time 
of appointment.  
In addition, the Remuneration Committee 
may offer additional cash and/or share-based 
elements to take account of any 
remuneration relinquished when leaving the 
former employer, when it considers these to 
be in the best interests of the Company (and 
therefore shareholders). In considering any 
such payments, the Committee would take 
account of the nature, vesting dates and any 
performance requirements attached to the 
relinquished remuneration. The Committee 
may determine to make any such recruitment 
related awards outside the variable pay pool 
cap. For an internal appointment, any variable 
pay element awarded in respect of the prior 
role may be allowed to be paid out according 
to its terms, adjusted if necessary, to take 
into account the appointment. 
For external and internal appointments, 
the Company may meet certain relocation 
expenses as appropriate including but not 
limited to assistance with housing, 
immigration, taxes and travel. 
Service contracts and loss of 
office payment policy 
Service contracts normally continue until the 
Executive Director’s agreed retirement date 
or such other date as the parties agree.  
The service contracts contain provisions 
for early termination.  
Notice periods are limited to 12 months by 
either party. Service agreements contain no 
contractual entitlement to receive variable 
pay; participation in these arrangements is 
at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts 
are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal 
business hours. 
If the employment of an Executive Director is 
terminated without giving the period of notice 
required under the contract, the Executive 
Director would be entitled to claim 
recompense for up to one year’s 
remuneration subject to consideration of 
the obligation to mitigate the loss. Such 
recompense is expected to be limited to base 
salary due for any unexpired notice period, 
and any amount assessed by the 
Remuneration Committee as representing 
the value of other contractual benefits and 
pension which would have been received 
during the period. In the event of a change  
of control of the Company, there is no 
enhancement to these terms. 
In summary, the contractual provisions are 
as follows: 
Provision Detailed terms 
Notice period 12 months 
Termination payment 
in the event of 
termination by the 
Company without 
due notice 
Base salary plus value 
of benefits (including 
pension) paid monthly 
and subject to 
mitigation 
Change of control Same terms as above 
on termination 
Any outstanding share-based entitlements 
granted to an Executive Director under the 
Company’s share plans will be determined 
based on the relevant plan rules.  
An Executive Director’s service contract may 
be terminated without notice and without any 
further payment or compensation, except for 
sums accrued up to the date of termination, 
on the occurrence of certain events such as 
gross misconduct. 
The Committee may enter into settlement 
agreements with departing Directors, should 
the circumstances warrant it, and limited legal 
fees, outplacement fees and retirement gifts 
may be provided. 
Incentive plan discretions 
The Remuneration Committee will operate 
the current share plans in accordance with 
their respective rules and the policy set out 
above, and in accordance with the Listing 
Rules and relevant legislation or regulation. 
As is consistent with market practice, the 
Remuneration Committee retains discretion 
over a number of areas relating to operating 
and administrating these plans. These include 
(but are not limited to) the following: 
– Who participates in the plans; 
– The timing of the grant of an award 
and/or payment; 
– The size of an award and/or a payment 
within the plan limits approved by 
shareholders; 
– The choice of (and adjustment of) 
performance measures and targets in 
accordance with the policy set out above 
and the rules of each plan (including the 
treatment of delisted companies for the 
purpose of the TSR comparator group); 
– Discretion relating to the measurement 
of performance in the event of a change 
of control or reconstruction; 
– Determination of a good leaver (in addition 
to any specified categories) for incentive 
plan purposes, based on the rules of each 
plan and the appropriate treatment under 
the plan rules;

Incentive plan discretions 
The Remuneration Committee will operate 
the current share plans in accordance with 
their respective rules and the policy set out 
above, and in accordance with the Listing 
Rules and relevant legislation or regulation. 
As is consistent with market practice, the 
Remuneration Committee retains discretion 
over a number of areas relating to operating 
and administrating these plans. These include 
(but are not limited to) the following: 
– Who participates in the plans; 
– The timing of the grant of an award 
and/or payment; 
– The size of an award and/or a payment

shareholders; 
– The choice of (and adjustment of) 
performance measures and targets in 
accordance with the policy set out above 
and the rules of each plan (including the 
treatment of delisted companies for the

– Discretion relating to the measurement 
of performance in the event of a change 
of control or reconstruction; 
– Determination of a good leaver (in addition 
to any specified categories) for incentive 
plan purposes, based on the rules of each 
plan and the appropriate treatment under 
the plan rules;  
 
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 63 
– Adjustments required in order to comply 
with any new regulatory requirements 
which the Company is compelled to 
adhere to; and 
– Adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate 
restructuring, special dividends and on a 
change of control). 
Any use of the above discretions would, 
where relevant, be explained in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration. As appropriate, it 
might also be the subject of consultation with 
the Company’s major shareholders. 
Legacy arrangements 
For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy 
includes authority for the Company to honour 
any commitments entered into with current 
or former Directors that have been disclosed 
to shareholders in previous Remuneration 
reports. Details of any payments to former 
Directors will be set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration as they arise. 
Reward scenarios 
The Company’s Policy results in the 
majority of the remuneration received by 
the Executive Directors being dependent 
on performance, and being deferred for 
five years into restricted shares.  
As noted earlier, the policy is not to cap 
individual awards, but rather the aggregate 
pool. As such, it is not possible to 
demonstrate maximum remuneration 
levels. In lieu of this, the minimum (fixed) 
remuneration is illustrated in Figure 2, which 
provides an indication of the potential range 
of total remuneration using the highest and 
lowest variable pay awards in a rolling five-
year period and assuming full vesting, five 
years later at the grant price, of the long-term 
incentive components based on upper 
quartile TSR or equivalent achievement 
relative to other performance conditions. 
Non-executive Directors are engaged 
under letters of appointment and do not have 
contracts of service. They are appointed for 
an initial three-year period, subject to annual 
shareholder re-election. Their continued 
engagement is subject to the requirements 
of the Company’s Articles relating to the 
retirement of Directors by rotation. The 
letters of appointment are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours.  
Compliance with the 
Remuneration Code 
The Remuneration Committee regularly 
reviews its Remuneration Policy’s 
compliance with the principles of the 
Remuneration Codes of the UK financial 
services regulator, as applicable to Ashmore. 
The Remuneration Policy is designed to be 
consistent with the prudent management 
of risk, and the sustained, long-term 
performance of the Company.

1. Benefits for both Executive Directors include membership of the Company medical scheme, and for Mark Coombs includes the Company’s contribution towards 
transportation costs in relation to his role. 
2. Benefits for David Bennett relate to transportation costs and the associated income tax and national insurance costs in relation to his role.  
3. Long-term incentives vesting relates to awards with performance conditions where the performance period has ended in the relevant financial year and payments 
of dividends or dividend equivalents on such awards prior to their vesting date. 
4. In respect of the year ending 30 June 2017, Mark Coombs waived any eligibility for, and any right or expectation to receive, a cash bonus of up to £283,391 (2016 
£190,991), to be used by the Company for the general benefit of employees. In addition to this, in both the years ending 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2017 Mark 
Coombs chose to waive 10% of any element of his potential variable remuneration award in return for the Remuneration Committee considering and approving a 
contribution to charity or charities nominated by himself; the numbers in the table above exclude any waived variable remuneration. Had he not waived these amounts, 
Mark Coombs’ total bonus in respect of the year ending 30 June 2017 would have been £3,200,000. (2016 £1,425,000) 
5. Mark Coombs and Tom Shippey may commute up to 50% of their cash bonus in favour of an equivalent amount of bonus share or phantom bonus share awards and 
an equivalent value in matching share or phantom matching share awards. All share or phantom share awards will be reported in the Directors’ share and phantom 
share award tables in the year of grant. Mark Coombs and Tom Shippey both chose to commute 50% of their cash bonuses pre-waiver in 2016 for an equivalent 
amount of bonus share awards. 
6. From the year ending 30 June 2015 onward, additional performance conditions are applied to 50% of any restricted or matching share award. The amounts shown in 
the column labelled mandatorily deferred share bonus represent the 50% of restricted and matching share awards that do not have additional performance conditions 
attached. These amounts represent the cash value of shares awarded at grant, which will vest after five years subject to continued employment. 
7. In order to comply with the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive both Mark Coombs and Tom Shippey received a proportion of their bonus which would 
have otherwise been delivered in cash, as an additional award of restricted shares which will vest after a retention period. In 2017, prior to any elections made to 
commute cash bonus for bonus shares and an equivalent value in matching shares, the value of this award for Mark Coombs was £108,000 (2016 £29,252) and for 
Tom Shippey was £25,650 (2016 £14,628). 
8. In respect of prior year deferred share awards which have been waived to charity, any dividend equivalents associated with the amounts waived are paid directly 
to the nominated charities. The figures shown exclude the amounts waived. 
9. Dividends or dividend equivalents were paid relating to voluntarily and mandatorily deferred share or phantom share awards in the period.  
10. Nick Land retired from the Board on 21 October 2016. 
11. Mark Coombs receives cash in lieu of a pension contribution. Tom Shippey’s pension contribution includes an employee contribution via salary sacrifice; in 2017 this 
was £500 (2016 £5,375).

5. Mark Coombs and Tom Shippey may commute up to 50% of their cash bonus in favour of an equivalent amount of bonus share or phantom bonus share awards and 
an equivalent value in matching share or phantom matching share awards. All share or phantom share awards will be reported in the Directors’ share and phantom 
share award tables in the year of grant. Mark Coombs and Tom Shippey both chose to commute 50% of their cash bonuses pre-waiver in 2016 for an equivalent 
amount of bonus share awards. 
6. From the year ending 30 June 2015 onward, additional performance conditions are applied to 50% of any restricted or matching share award. The amounts shown in 
the column labelled mandatorily deferred share bonus represent the 50% of restricted and matching share awards that do not have additional performance conditions 
attached. These amounts represent the cash value of shares awarded at grant, which will vest after five years subject to continued employment. 
7. In order to comply with the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive both Mark Coombs and Tom Shippey received a proportion of their bonus which would 
have otherwise been delivered in cash, as an additional award of restricted shares which will vest after a retention period. In 2017, prior to any elections made to 
commute cash bonus for bonus shares and an equivalent value in matching shares, the value of this award for Mark Coombs was £108,000 (2016 £29,252) and for 
Tom Shippey was £25,650 (2016 £14,628). 
8. In respect of prior year deferred share awards which have been waived to charity, any dividend equivalents associated with the amounts waived are paid directly 
to the nominated charities. The figures shown exclude the amounts waived. 
9. Dividends or dividend equivalents were paid relating to voluntarily and mandatorily deferred share or phantom share awards in the period.  
10. Nick Land retired from the Board on 21 October 2016. 
11. Mark Coombs receives cash in lieu of a pension contribution. Tom Shippey’s pension contribution includes an employee contribution via salary sacrifice; in 2017 this 
was £500 (2016 £5,375).

Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Group Finance Director (GFD) performance measures 
As described in detail in other sections of the Annual Report the Group, led by the CEO and GFD, has performed well this year.  
The CEO’s performance has been measured relative to financial (75%) and non-financial (25%) KPIs. All financial KPIs assessed by the 
Committee have demonstrated a marked improvement over the prior period, as very strong investment performance and improved sentiment 
towards Emerging Markets combined with continued tight control of operating costs has delivered increased profitability for the Group. The lag 
between delivering strong investment performance and client allocations being made has meant that despite excellent performance, net 
subscriptions only turned positive in the second half. 
The GFD’s performance has been assessed in relation to a range of operational objectives. During the period all departments under his 
supervision performed well. 
The development of the Group’s strategy has also been positive, with continued diversification of distribution channels through the growth of 
the intermediary business, and the continued growth of local asset management activity in Colombia, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. 
The Group’s personnel have remained highly engaged through another market cycle and with very low unplanned turnover in the period under 
review, in large part underpinned by the Group’s distinctive remuneration philosophy, which places an emphasis on pay for performance and 
long dated equity incentives, thus aligning all employees with clients and external shareholders through market cycles.

Committee considering and approving a contribution to charity or charities nominated by himself, the numbers in the table above exclude any waived variable remuneration. 
2. In addition Executives voluntarily defer their bonus into shares in order to receive an equivalent level of matching shares and are also required under the AIFMD rules to defer 
a portion of their cash bonus for six months. These awards are not subject to any performance conditions and full details can be found in Figure 10. 
Long-term incentive awards made during the year ended 30 June 2017 – performance conditions 
Figure 7 provides details of the long-term incentive awards that were made during the year. These represent the Restricted and Matching Share 
awards, 50% of which are subject to additional performance conditions, and will vest on the fifth anniversary of the award date, to the extent 
that the performance conditions are met. The remaining 50% are subject to continued employment. 
The performance conditions for the most recent awards were a combination of: 
– 25% relative total shareholder return (TSR), measured against an asset management peer group over five years.  
– 25% investment outperformance, relative to the relevant benchmarks over three and five years.  
– 25% growth in assets under management, demonstrated through a compound increase in AuM over the five-year performance period. 
– 25% profitability, demonstrated through Ashmore’s diluted earnings per share (EPS) performance relative to a comparator index over the  
five-year performance period. 
The performance conditions vesting scale and TSR peer group are shown in Figures 8 and 9 respectively.  
Performance and vesting outcome for the Chief Executive’s 2011 long-term incentive awards which vested 
during the year ended 30 June 2017 
During the period, shares awarded to Mark Coombs in 2011 reached their vesting date. On the vesting date, all bonus shares vested, and the 
TSR performance condition was applied to the vesting restricted and matching shares. The Company’s TSR was 10.4%, which ranked Ashmore 
at 15.73 relative to the TSR peer group of 18 companies; the median rank which would have resulted in 25% vesting was 9.5 or a TSR of 
90.7%. Therefore no restricted or matching share awards vested.

Note: As a result of the merger of Henderson Group and Janus Capital Group, both companies have been removed from the TSR comparator group for awards made prior to 
2017 and the new combined entity, Janus Henderson Investors, will be included in the TSR comparator group for awards made during the year ending 30 June 2018. 
TSR is a well-established and recognised performance measure, which aligns the interests of the Executive Directors with those of 
shareholders. A comparator group of 17 companies has been selected from the global investment management sector. The Committee 
reviews the peer group periodically to take account of de-listings, new listings or other sector changes that are relevant.

The Company’s obligations under its employee share plans can be met by newly issued shares in the Company, or shares purchased in 
the market by the trustees of the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). As detailed in the Business review, the EBT continues to make market 
purchases of shares to satisfy awards.  
The overall limits on new issuance operated under the existing share plans were established on the listing of the Company in 2006. Under these 
agreed limits, the number of shares which may be issued in aggregate under employee share plans of the Company over any ten-year period 
following the date of the Company’s Admission in 2006 is limited to 15% of the Company’s issued share capital. As at 30 June 2017, the 
Company had 5.5% of the Company’s issued share capital outstanding under employee share plans to its staff. All of the awards made to date 
have been satisfied by the acquisition of shares in the market, thus none of the Company’s obligations under its employee share plans have 
been met by newly issued shares. 
Defined benefit pension entitlements  
None of the Directors has any entitlements under Company defined benefit pension plans.  
Directors’ shareholding and share interests 
Details of the Directors’ interests in shares are shown in the table below. Although there is currently no formal shareholding requirement, the 
Executive Directors have substantial interests in Company shares. It is the intention to implement a formal requirement for Executive Directors 
to build an unrestricted, post vesting shareholding equivalent to 200% of salary under the proposed Director’s Remuneration Policy, to be voted 
on at the 2017 AGM. If the Policy is approved, existing Executive Directors will be required to build up this shareholding over the three-year 
period following the approval of the Policy by shareholders.

Performance chart 
Figure 13 shows the Company’s TSR performance (with dividends reinvested) against the performance of the relevant indices for the last eight 
years. Each point at a financial year end is calculated using an average total shareholder return value over the month of June (i.e. 1 June to 
30 June inclusive). As the chart indicates, £100 invested in Ashmore on 30 June 2009 was worth £255 eight years later, compared with £230 
for the same investment in the FTSE 100 index, and £326 for the same investment in the FTSE 250 index.

Statement on implementation of the Remuneration Policy in the year commencing 1 July 2017 
The proposed Directors Remuneration Policy is subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 20 October 2017 AGM. If approved, the Policy will 
apply to the performance years ending 30 June 2018, 2019 and 2020. If shareholders do not vote approve the proposed Policy then the current 
Policy will continue to apply.  
Under the proposed new Policy, the Committee intends to continue to apply broadly the same metrics and weightings to annual variable 
remuneration in the year ending 30 June 2018 as have been applied in the current period.  
For long-term incentive awards (half of any restricted shares, matching shares and their phantom equivalents), the Remuneration Committee 
intends to continue to apply the four performance conditions as in the prior period, these being relative TSR, (subject to any changes to the peer 
group that may be necessary to take account of de-listings, new listings or other sector changes that are relevant), investment performance, 
assets under management and profitability.

  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 73 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Group and parent 
company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under  
that law they are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must  
not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and parent company and of their profit and 
loss for that period. In preparing each of  
the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and estimates that  
are reasonable, relevant and reliable;
 – state whether they have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU; 
 – assess the Group and parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern; and 
 – use the going concern basis of accounting 
unless they either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the parent company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are responsible for such internal control as 
they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to hem to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations,  
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic report, Directors’  
report, Directors’ remuneration report  
and corporate governance statement that 
comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement  
of the Directors in respect  
of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of  
our knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and  
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 – the Strategic report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
issuer and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks  
and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.

remuneration policy on page 62.
Details of the constitution and powers of the 
Board and its committees are set out in the 
Corporate governance report on pages 47  
to 49. The Corporate governance report also 
summarises the Company’s rules concerning 
appointment and replacement of Directors.
Board diversity
The Nominations Committee and the Board 
recognise the importance of diversity and 
believes that this is a wider issue than 
solely gender. There are presently no plans 
to add further non-Executive Directors 
to the Board, however, the Nominations 
Committee, in assessing the suitability of 
a prospective appointee considers a number 
of diverse factors including the balance of 
skills, experience, gender and nationality. 
The Board currently consists of two 
Executive and five Non-executive Directors 
of whom one is female. The Nominations 
Committee from time to time engages the 
services of an external search consultant 
for the purpose of seeking new candidates 
for Board membership, conditional upon 
such consultant having no connection to 
the Company.
Further details on diversity in general within 
Ashmore can be found in the Corporate 
Social Responsibility section on pages 
38 to 44.
Insurance and 
indemnification of Directors
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance is 
maintained by the Company for all Directors. 
To the extent permissible by law, the Articles 
of Association also permit the Company to 
indemnify Directors and former Directors 
against any liability incurred whilst serving  
in such capacity.
Directors’ conflicts of interests
Since October 2008, the Companies Act 
2006 has imposed upon Directors a new 
statutory duty to avoid unauthorised conflicts 
of interest with the Company. The Company 
has adopted revisions to its Articles of 
Association which enable Directors to 
approve conflicts of interest and which also 
include other conflict of interest provisions. 
The Company has implemented processes 
to identify potential and actual conflicts of 
interest. Such conflicts are then considered 
for approval by the Board, subject, where 
necessary, to appropriate conditions.
Save as disclosed on page 62, Executive 
Directors do not presently hold any 
external appointments with any 
non-Ashmore-related companies.
Directors’ share interests
The interests of Directors in the Company’s 
shares are shown on page 70 within the 
Annual report on remuneration.
Significant agreements 
with provisions applicable to a 
change in control of the Company
Save as described, there are no agreements 
in place applicable to a change in control of 
the Company.
Resolution 19 in the Notice of Annual 
General Meeting will seek approval from 
shareholders to a waiver of the provisions of 
Rule 9 of the Takeover Code in respect of the 
obligation that could arise for Mark Coombs 
to make a mandatory offer for the Company 
in the event that the Company exercises the 
authority to make market purchases of its 
own shares. Further details are contained  
in the separate Notice of AGM.

Relations with shareholders
The Company places great importance on 
communication with its investors and aims 
to keep shareholders informed by means 
of regular communication with institutional 
shareholders, analysts and the financial  
press throughout the year.
Annual and interim reports and quarterly 
assets under management updates are

may have an interest in the Group’s 
performance. These documents are also 
made available on the Company’s website 
where formal regulatory information 
service announcements are also posted. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Group 
Finance Director make regular reports to the 
Board on investor relations and on specific 
discussions with major shareholders and the 
Board receives copies of research published 
on the Company. Additionally, the Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director met 
with a number of the company’s largest 
shareholders during the course of the year 
to discuss a number of topics including 
corporate governance and remuneration.
The 2017 Annual General Meeting will be 
attended by all Directors, and the Chairmen 
of the Audit and Risk, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees will be available 
to answer questions. Private investors  
are encouraged to attend the Annual 
General Meeting.
The Senior Independent Director is available 
to shareholders if they have concerns which 
contact through the normal channels of 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Group 
Finance Director has failed to resolve or  
for which such contact is inappropriate.  
The Company continues to offer major 
shareholders the opportunity to meet  
any or all of the Chairman, the Senior 
Independent Director and any new Directors.
The Group will announce via a regulatory 
information service the number of 
proxy votes cast on resolutions at the 
Annual General Meeting and any other 
general meetings.
Share capital
The Company has a single class of share 
capital which is divided into ordinary shares 
of 0.01 pence, each of which rank pari 
passu in respect of participation and voting 
rights. The shares are in registered form. 
The issued share capital of the Company 
at 30 June 2017 is 712,740,804 shares in 
issue (of which 5,368,331 shares are held 
in Treasury).
Details of the structure of and changes in 
share capital are set out in note 22 to the 
financial statements.
Restrictions on voting rights
A member shall not be entitled to vote at  
any general meeting or class meeting in 
respect of any share held by him if any call  
or other sum then payable by him in respect 
of that share remains unpaid or if a member 
has been served with a restriction notice 
(as defined in the Articles of Association) 
after failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Acts. Votes may be exercised 
in person or by proxy. The Articles of 
Association currently provide a deadline 
for submission of proxy forms of 48 hours 
before the meeting.
Purchase of own shares
In the year under review, the Company  
did not purchase any of its own shares for 
Treasury. The Company is, until the date of 
the next Annual General Meeting, generally 
and unconditionally authorised to buy back  
up to 35,368,623 of its own issued shares. 
The Company retains a total of 5,368,331 
shares for Treasury which were acquired  
at an average price of 129 pence per share.  
The Company is seeking a renewal of the 
share buyback authority at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting.
Director’s report continued
76 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Power to issue and allot shares
The Directors are generally and 
unconditionally authorised to allot unissued 
shares in the Company up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £23,579.08 (and 
£47,158.16 in connection with an offer 
by way of a rights issue).
A further authority has been granted to the 
Directors to allot the Company’s shares for 
cash, up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£7,073.72, without regard to the pre-emption 
provisions of the Companies Acts. No such 
shares have been issued or allotted under 
these authorities, nor is there any current 
intention to do so, other than to satisfy 
outstanding obligations under the employee 
share schemes where necessary.
These authorities are valid until the date  
of the next Annual General Meeting.  
A resolution for the renewal of such 
authorities will be proposed at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting.
Employees
Details of the Company’s employment 
practices (including the employment of 
disabled persons) can be found in the 
Corporate social responsibility section

Corporate governance
The Company is governed according to 
the applicable provisions of company law 
and by the Company’s Articles. As a listed 
company, the Company must also comply 
with the Listing Rules and the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules issued by the United 
Kingdom Listing Authority (UKLA). Listed 
companies are expected to comply as far 
as possible with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s UK Corporate Governance Code, 
and to state how its principles have been 
applied. A report on corporate governance 
and compliance with the provisions of 
the Code is set out on pages 47 to 49. 
The Company complied throughout the 
accounting period under review with all the 
relevant provisions set out in the Code.
Mandatory greenhouse  
gas emissions reporting
Companies listed on the Main Market  
of the London Stock Exchange are required 
to report their greenhouse gas emissions 
(GHGs) in their annual report. The following 
is a summary of this information which 
is also reflected in Ashmore’s separate 
Corporate social responsibility report.
Operational control methodology
Ashmore Group has adopted the operational 
control method of reporting. The emissions 
reported below are for the 13 global offices 
around the world where Ashmore exercised 
direct operational control in the 2016/17 
financial year. These office emissions, as 
well as emissions originating from their 
operations, are those which are considered 
material to Ashmore Group.
Emission scopes
Mandatory GHG reporting requires 
emissions associated with Scope 1 (direct 
emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions 
from purchased electricity, heating and 
cooling) to be reported. Revisions to the 
GHG Protocol, to which this reporting 
exercise adheres, require organisations 
to calculate their Scope 2 emissions both 
in terms of ‘market-based’ emissions and 
‘location-based’ emissions. This information 
is set out below.
It is not obligatory to report Scope 3 (indirect 
emissions from the inputs and outputs to 
the main business activity – i.e. supply chain 
and consumer/end-user related emissions). 
However, for completeness, Ashmore Group 
will continue to report on some Scope 3 
emission categories in order to offer a wider 
picture to stakeholders and investors.
Ashmore’s Scope 1 emissions relate to gas 
combustion and refrigerant usage.
Ashmore’s Scope 2 emissions relate to 
purchased electricity.
Ashmore’s Scope 3 emissions relate to 
water usage, air travel and office waste.
Exclusions
Whilst every effort has been made to collect 
full and consistent data from all international 
offices, in some cases information was 
not available.
Where no country data was available for the 
current reporting year, previous years have 
been used to estimate 2017 consumption.
A number of offices were only able to 
provide data for the whole building in which 
they reside. No sub-metered data was 
available for each tenant in these cases. In 
these instances, the share of the total floor 
area occupied by Ashmore was used to 
apportion the total consumption.
Missing, or anomalous, water data was 
estimated using an average consumption 
figure of 15m per full-time employee, as 
sourced from a UK-based water company. 
This figure is broadly consistent with the 
average ‘per employee’ consumption 
of those offices which were able to 
provide data.

Ashmore’s emissions
The overall GHG emissions decreased by 
37.5% compared to the last year. This is 
primarily due to portfolio changes during 
2016/17 financial year, and a Scope 3 
methodology change implemented to 
account for more accurate information 
received this year. Analysis of the energy 
efficiency of the new offices demonstrates 
that more energy efficient buildings are 
joining the portfolio, which also contributes 
to lower GHG emissions and energy 
intensity. Air travel emissions decreased by 
38.3%. This category, however, still remains 
the largest contributor to Ashmore Group’s 
emissions breakdown with 890 tCO 2e. 
The second largest contributor to the 
GHG footprint, purchased electricity, has 
decreased significantly this year, due to 
exclusion of two offices from the Ashmore 
Group portfolio, and now accounts for 371 
tCO 2e. Waste, water and refrigerants (based 
on the available data) account for the lowest 
levels of emissions.
Emissions have also been calculated 
using an ‘intensity metric’, which enables 
Ashmore to monitor how well it is controlling 
emissions on an annual basis, independent 
of fluctuations in the levels of its activity. As 
Ashmore is a “people” business, the most 
suitable metric is ‘emissions per full-time 
equivalent (FTE) employee

. Ashmore’s 
emissions per FTE are shown in the 
table below.
FTE 2015/16 = 274 employees;  
FTE 2016/17 = 258 employees

For those offices where the landlord utilities 
charge was the only possible source of data, 
energy and water consumption have been 
estimated using the average governmental 
utility prices for the respective countries.
Where offices were not able to provide 
any waste data for their buildings it was not 
deemed appropriate to estimate this, due 
to the uncertainties surrounding the varying 
nature of building sizes, modes of working 
and cities’ waste disposal infrastructure, 
amongst other factors. It has also not been 
possible to make use of data supplied 
in litres, as the density of the waste 
is unknown.
Methodology
All data has been collected and analysed 
in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard. UK 
Government 2017 emission factors have 
been applied for all calculations, except the 
international offices’ electricity consumption, 
for which the International Energy Agency’s 
2016 emissions factors have been used. 
Ashmore Group has used a customised tool, 
developed by Ricardo Energy & Environment, 
to undertake the emissions calculations.
The data inputs and outputs have been 
reviewed by Ricardo Energy & Environment 
on behalf of Ashmore.
All UK related emissions factors have 
been selected from the emissions 
conversion factors published annually by 
the UK Government: https://www.gov.uk/
government/publications/greenhouse-
gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2017 
All international electricity emissions factors 
were taken from the International Energy 
Agency’s statistics report CO 2 Emissions 
from Fuel Combustion (2016 Edition).

78 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Charitable and political 
contributions
During the year, the Group made 
charitable donations of £0.1 million 
(FY2015/2016: £0.1 million). The work of 
the Ashmore Foundation is described in 
the Corporate social responsibility section 
of this report on pages 43 to 44. It is the 
Group’s policy not to make contributions for 
political purposes.
Creditor payment policy
The Group’s policy and practice in the UK 
is to follow its suppliers’ terms of payment 
and to make payment in accordance 
with those terms subject to receipt of 
satisfactory invoicing. Unless otherwise 
agreed, payments to creditors are made 
within 30 days of receipt of an invoice. At 
30 June 2017, the amount owed to the 
Group’s trade creditors in the UK represented 
approximately 15 days’ average purchases 
from suppliers (FY2015/16: 15 days).
Auditors and the disclosure of 
information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date 
of approval of this Directors’ report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware, and 
each Director has taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as Directors 
to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.  
We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our 
key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters 
were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.

to calculate the majority of 
management fee rebates. 
Risk in relation to rebate rates
The rebate rates are subject to 
periodic amendments. As a result, 
transactions in the financial 
statements require complete and 
accurate communication of rebate 
rates between several teams which 
increases the risk of error of 
incomplete recording of these 
transactions. 
Risk in relation to assets  
under management 
Assets under management used for 
rebate calculations are sourced from 
different parties including outsourced 
service organisations and internal 
teams. Complete and accurate 
transmission of assets under 
management data to the rebate 
calculation system is a key audit risk. 
Our procedures included: 
Procedures in relation to rebate rates: 
Control design, implementation and effectiveness 
– We evaluated and tested the key processes and controls in place 
over the integrity of system data for rebate rates and the controls 
around approving any changes made to the rebate rates in the 
system by inspecting evidence of review and approval. 
– We evaluated the control in the system to ensure that rebate rates 
are only effective after necessary approvals are granted in the system.
Test of details 
– We agreed a selection, using a statistical sampling plan, of rebate 
rates used in the calculation by the system to the original legal 
documents. 
Procedures in relation to assets under management: 
Outsourcing controls 
– We obtained an understanding of the control environment and 
evaluated the operating effectiveness of controls in operation by 
inspecting the internal controls reports prepared by the service 
organisation and attested to by independent service auditors. 
Control observation 
– Through retrieving system data and records we assessed the 
completeness and accuracy of the assets under management data 
flow through the interface from the third-party service provider and 
other in-house systems to the rebate calculation system. 
General procedures: 
Control design, implementation and effectiveness 
– We performed testing over user access and authorisation controls 
over the automated rebate calculation system through inspection of 
system configurations and records. 
– We performed testing over system-generated reports through 
retrieving system data and records to ascertain the completeness 
and accuracy of those reports. We also tested the calculation logic 
in the system by tracing one calculation in the system. 
Test of details  
– We independently recalculated a selection, using a statistical 
sampling plan, of management fee rebates and agreed the 
recalculated fees to the general ledger records. 
– We reconciled the rebates recognised within the general ledger to 
the output from the automated rebate calculation system for all 
system calculated rebates. 
Our results:  
– Our testing did not identify any deficiencies in controls that would 
have required us to amend the nature or scope of our planned 
detailed test work. We found no differences in the calculations 
above the materiality level over which we are required to report 
to the Group Audit and Risk Committee.

Classification of seed capital 
investments 
The Group invests in funds that 
are managed by its investment 
management subsidiaries (seed 
capital investments). These funds 
should be consolidated where it has 
been determined that the Group has 
control over the funds. In order to 
determine whether control exists for 
each fund, the Group needs to assess 
the strength of linkage between the 
power to govern the fund’s operations 
and the level of variable returns 
receivable by the Group. 
The outcome of the assessment  
drives the classification of seed capital 
investments which in turn drives the 
accounting treatment for these 
investments. 
The classification of the seed capital 
investments represents a key audit 
area as the assessment of the linkage, 
and thus determination of control 
which leads to the classification, 
requires judgement. 
Our procedures included: 
Accounting analysis 
– We critically assessed the Directors’ stated policy for 
compliance with the accounting standards and assessed the 
appropriateness of the framework designed to determine 
whether control exists with reference to aggregate economic 
interests in funds and the strength of other investors’ rights to 
replace the Group’s subsidiaries as the investment manager. 
External confirmation 
– For each fund we agreed external inputs to the aggregate 
economic interest determination (including direct holdings and 
indirect holdings, where relevant) held by the Group to 
independent confirmations from fund administrators.  
Assessing judgements 
– For each fund we critically assessed the judgement on the 
strength of other investors’ rights to replace the Group’s 
subsidiaries as investment manager including reviewing the 
number of investors in each fund, if the fund is closed or 
open-ended and the investors’ consent required to change 
the investment manager. 
Test of details 
– For a selection of the funds, we agreed internal inputs to  
the aggregate economic interest determination (including 
management fees and performance fees percentages,  
where applicable) to the funds’ legal documents.  
Assessing transparency 
– We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures on the 
classification of seed capital investment. 
Our results 
– We found that the Group’s judgements made in determining 
these classifications were acceptable, and that the disclosures 
on the basis of classification judgements were acceptable.

Share-based payments for 
Executive Directors

Refer to page 50 (Audit and Risk 
Committee report), page 98 
(accounting policy) and page 124 
(financial disclosures). 
Subjective estimate 
The Group issues share awards to 
employees under a number of share-
based compensation plans. The fair 
value of shares granted to Executive 
Directors are subject the achievement 
of some performance conditions,  
being the Group’s Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) in comparison to its peer 
group as defined by the Remuneration 
Committee, investment 
outperformance relevant to the 
benchmark over three and five years, 
growth in assets under management 
and profitability as assessed by the 
diluted earnings per share relative 
to a comparator index over the 
performance period. The Group uses 
a third party remuneration consultant 
to determine the fair value of awards 
granted with reference to their 
estimation of the likelihood of the 
performance conditions being met. 
This is one of the key judgemental 
areas that our audit is focused on 
because of the judgements involved 
in determining the likelihood of the 
performance conditions being met. 
Our procedures included: 
Assessing experts’ credentials 
– We assessed the objectivity and competency of the  
third-party remuneration consultant. 
Methodology choice and remuneration consultant 
expertise 
– We utilised our internal specialist to critically assess 
the methodology used in the third party remuneration 
consultant reports to estimate the fair value of the shares 
granted to Executive Directors with reference to the 
performance conditions. 
Test of details 
– We traced the estimation made by the remuneration 
consultant on the fair value of the shares granted as a function 
of the likelihood of the performance conditions being met, to 
those used in the determination of the charge of share-based 
payment schemes. 
Assessing transparency 
– We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in relation to 
the scheme in the Remuneration report, in particular around 
the impact of the performance conditions on the fair value of 
the shares granted to Executive Directors. 
Our results 
– We had no concerns with the objectivity and competence of 
the third-party consultant. We found the resulting estimates 
on the fair value of shares granted to Executive Directors to  
be acceptable. 
We continue to perform procedures over the valuation of intangible assets other than goodwill. However, the inputs and assumptions 
used to estimate the value of intangible assets have become less judgemental as those assets, as at 30 June 2017, are less than two 
years away from being fully amortised. We have thus not assessed this as one of the most significant risks in our current year audit and, 
therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of 
the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 
£10.07 million (2016: £6.75 million), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group profit before tax, of which it represents 5% 
(2016: 4%). 
We reported to the Group Audit and Risk Committee any corrected 
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.5 million 
(2016: £0.3 million), in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s 31 reporting components (2016: 35 components), 
we subjected 6 (2016: 6) to audits for Group reporting purposes. 
These audits covered 99% (2016: 99%) of total Group revenue; 97% 
(2016: 97%) of Group profit before taxation; and 97% (2016: 97%) 
of total Group assets. 
The Group audit team set the component materialities, which ranged 
from £0.4 million to £4.3 million (2016: £0.4 million to £4.1 million), 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across 
the components. The work on the components was performed by 
the Group audit team. 
 
4. We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if: 
– we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to the Directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements on 
the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and 
Company’s use of that basis for a period of at least 12 months  
from the date of approval of the financial statements; or 
– the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 79 
is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5. We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report 
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in 
the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as 
explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, 
the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on 
that work we have not identified material misstatements in the 
other information. 
Strategic report and Directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
– we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report;

year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
– in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. 
Remuneration report 
In our opinion the part of the Remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability  
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements 
audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in  
relation to: 
– the Directors’ confirmation within their Longer-Term Viability 
Statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; 
– the Principal risks disclosures describing these risks and explaining 
how they are being managed and mitigated; and 
– the Directors’ explanation in the Longer-Term Viability Statement 
of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they considered that period to 
be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Financial statements 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Longer-Term 
Viability Statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures  
We are required to report to you if: 
– we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit and 
the Directors’ statement that they consider that the annual report 
and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or 
– the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit 
and Risk Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee. 
We are required to report to you if the Corporate governance 
statement does not properly disclose a departure from the 11 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the 
Listing Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters  
on which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
– the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or 
– we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7. Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 74, 
the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group 
and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud, other irregularities, or error, and to issue our 
opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other 
irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial 
statements. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud or other irregularities is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as they may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control and 
may involve any area of law and regulation not just those directly 
affecting the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we 
owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.

Notes to the financial statements 
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 93 
Financial statements 
1) General information 
Ashmore Group plc (the Company) is a public limited company listed 
on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in  
the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together the Group) for the year ended 
30 June 2017 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 
6 September 2017. The principal activity of the Group is described in 
the Directors’ report on page 75. 
2) Basis of preparation 
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union (EU) effective for the Group’s 
reporting for the year ended 30 June 2017 and applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.  
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis under the historical cost convention, except for the 
measurement at fair value of certain financial assets that are  
available-for-sale or classified as at fair value through profit or loss.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in section  
408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows it not to present its 
individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes.  
The preparation of financial statements requires management  
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and various other factors that  
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results  
of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying  
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from  
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
Further information about key assumptions and other key sources  
of estimation and areas of judgement are set out in note 32.  
3) New standards and interpretations not  
yet adopted  
At the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial 
statements, the following standards and interpretations relevant to 
the Group’s operations were issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) but are not yet mandatory: 
– IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for annual periods beginning

– IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018

The Group completed an assessment of the impact of the new 
standards on its financial statements during the year. Overall, the 
Group does not expect the implementation of these standards to 
have a material impact on its results, net assets or regulatory capital 
requirements. However, the Group expects to update the relevant 
accounting policies when these standards come into force, as well 
as making necessary presentational changes on the face of the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated 
balance sheet. 
– IFRS 9 Financial Instruments has been endorsed by the EU and 
replaces the classification and measurement models for financial 
instruments in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement with three classification categories: amortised cost, 
fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other 
comprehensive income. Under IFRS 9, the Group’s business 
model and the contractual cash flows arising from its investments 
in financial instruments determine the appropriate classification. 
All equity investments within the scope of IFRS 9 are measured 
at fair value, with gains or losses reported either in the statement 
of comprehensive income or, by election, through other 
comprehensive income. The impact will be on classification and 
presentation of the Group’s seed capital investments, with limited 
changes in measurement basis for available-for sale financial assets 
that will be measured at fair value through profit or loss.  
In addition, IFRS 9 introduces an expected loss model for the 
assessment of impairment. The current incurred loss model under 
IAS 39 requires the Group to recognise impairment losses when 
there is objective evidence that an asset is impaired. The new 
impairment model in IFRS 9 is based on the premise of providing 
for expected losses, even in the absence of a default event. The 
Group does not anticipate the impact of the expected losses to be 
material as a result of the nature of assets held and the low level 
of historical defaults. 
– IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has been 
endorsed by the EU and deals with revenue recognition. The 
standard provides a single, principles-based five-step model to 
be applied to all contracts with customers to recognise revenue 
in a manner that depicts the pattern of transfer of services to 
the customer. IFRS 15 replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 
Construction Contracts and related interpretations. The standard 
provides guidance on topics such as the point at which revenue 
is recognised, accounting for variable consideration such as 
performance-based incentive fees, and costs related to obtaining 
and fulfilling investment management contracts. The Group has 
assessed that IFRS 15 will not have a material impact on its results 
or a material change to the estimation of management fee or 
performance fees revenue; however, additional note disclosure 
will be required to update the Group’s revenue recognition policy 
when the standard is adopted. 
– IFRS 16 Leases was issued on 13 January 2016 and replaces 
IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 requires all operating leases in excess of 
one year, where the Group is the lessee, to be included on the 
Group’s statement of financial position, and recognised as a right-
of-use (ROU) asset and a related lease liability representing the 
obligation to make lease payments. The ROU asset will be 
amortised on a straight-line basis with the lease liability being 
amortised using the effective interest method. Optional 
exemptions are available under IFRS 16 for short-term leases 
(lease term of less than 12 months) and for small-value leases. 
Based on the preliminary assessment, the Group expects its 
existing operating lease arrangements as a lessee (refer to note 30) 
to be recognised as ROU assets with corresponding lease liabilities 
under the new standard. The operating lease commitments on 
an undiscounted basis amount to approximately 1% of the 
consolidated total assets and 7% of consolidated total liabilities. 
The Group will complete a detailed impact analysis closer to the 
adoption of IFRS 16. 
No other standards or interpretations issued and not yet effective  
are expected to have an impact on the Group‘s consolidated  
financial statements. 
4) Significant accounting policies 
The following principal accounting policies have been applied 
consistently where applicable to all years presented in dealing

Basis of consolidation  
The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the 
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, associates 
and joint ventures. This includes an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) 
established for the employee share-based awards and consolidated 
investment funds. 
Interests in subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities, including investment funds, over which the 
Group has control as defined by IFRS 10. The Group has control if it 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on 
which control commences until the date when control ceases. The 
Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and 
circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the 
elements of control. 
The profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income are attributed to the equity holders of the Company and to 
any non-controlling interests. Based on their nature, the interests of 
third parties in consolidated funds are classified as liabilities and 
appear as ‘Third-party interests in consolidated funds’ on the Group’s 
balance sheet. Associates and joint ventures are presented as single-
line items in the statement of comprehensive income and balance 
sheet (refer to note 27). Intercompany transactions and balances are 
eliminated on consolidation. Consistent accounting policies have 
been applied across the Group in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements as at 30 June 2017. 
A change in the ownership interest of a consolidated entity that  
does not result in a loss of control by the Group is accounted for as  
an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a consolidated 
entity, it derecognises the related assets, goodwill, liabilities,  
non-controlling interest and other components of equity, and any  
gain or loss is recognised in consolidated comprehensive income. 
Any investment retained is recognised at its fair value at the date of  
loss of control. 
Interests in associates and joint arrangements 
Associates are partly owned entities over which the Group has 
significant influence but no control. Joint ventures are entities through 
which the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity 
which is subject to joint control. 
Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are 
measured using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, 
the investments are initially recognised at cost, including attributable 
goodwill, and are adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of net assets. The Group’s share of post-
acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income.  
Where the Group’s financial year is not coterminous with those  
of its associates or joint ventures, unaudited interim financial 
information is used after appropriate adjustments have been made. 
Interests in consolidated structured entities 
The Group acts as fund manager to investment funds that are 
considered to be structured entities. Structured entities are entities 
that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the 
dominant factor in deciding which party has control: for example, 
when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the 
relevant activities of the entity are directed by means of contractual 
arrangements. The Group’s assets under management are managed 
within structured entities. These structured entities typically consist of 
unitised vehicles such as Sociétés d’Investissement à Capital Variable 
(SICAVs), limited partnerships, unit trusts and open-ended and closed-
ended vehicles which entitle third-party investors to a percentage of 
the vehicle’s net asset value. 
The Group has interests in structured entities as a result of the 
management of assets on behalf of its clients. Where the Group 
holds a direct interest in a closed-ended fund, private equity fund or 
open-ended pooled fund such as a SICAV, the interest is accounted 
for either as a consolidated structured entity or as a financial asset, 
depending on whether the Group has control over the fund or not. 
Control is determined in accordance with IFRS 10, based on an 
assessment of the level of power and aggregate economic interest 
that the Group has over the fund, relative to third-party investors. 
Power is normally conveyed to the Group through the existence  
of an investment management agreement and/or other contractual 
arrangements. Aggregate economic interest is a measure of the 
Group’s exposure to variable returns in the fund through a 
combination of direct interest, carried interest, expected management 
fees, fair value gains or losses, and distributions receivable from  
the fund.  
The Group concludes that it acts as a principal when the power it  
has over the fund is deemed to be exercised for self-benefit, 
considering the level of aggregate economic exposure in the fund  
and the assessed strength of third-party investors’ kick-out rights.  
The Group concludes that it acts as an agent when the power it  
has over the fund is deemed to be exercised for the benefit of  
third-party investors.  
The Group concludes that it has control and, therefore, will 
consolidate a fund as if it were a subsidiary where the Group acts  
as a principal. If the Group concludes that it does not have control 
over the fund, the Group accounts for its interest in the fund as a 
financial asset.  
Interests in unconsolidated structured entities 
The Group classifies the following investment funds as 
unconsolidated structured entities: 
– Segregated mandates and pooled funds managed where the 
Group does not hold any direct interest. In this case, the Group 
considers that its aggregate economic exposure is insignificant  
and, in relation to segregated mandates, the third-party investor 
has the practical ability to remove the Group from acting as fund 
manager, without cause. As a result, the Group concludes that 
it acts as an agent for third-party investors. 
– Pooled funds managed by the Group where the Group holds  
a direct interest, for example seed capital investments, and the 
Group’s aggregate economic exposure in the fund relative to third-
party investors is less than 20% (i.e. the threshold established by  
the Group for determining agent versus principal classification).  
As a result, the Group concludes that it is an agent for third-party 
investors and, therefore, will account for its beneficial interest in  
the fund as a financial asset.  
The disclosure of the AuM in respect of consolidated and 
unconsolidated structured entities is provided in note 28.

Basis of consolidation  
The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the 
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, associates 
and joint ventures. This includes an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) 
established for the employee share-based awards and consolidated 
investment funds. 
Interests in subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities, including investment funds, over which the 
Group has control as defined by IFRS 10. The Group has control if it 
is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on 
which control commences until the date when control ceases. The 
Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and 
circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the 
elements of control. 
The profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income are attributed to the equity holders of the Company and to 
any non-controlling interests. Based on their nature, the interests of 
third parties in consolidated funds are classified as liabilities and 
appear as ‘Third-party interests in consolidated funds’ on the Group’s 
balance sheet. Associates and joint ventures are presented as single-

eliminated on consolidation. Consistent accounting policies have 
been applied across the Group in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements as at 30 June 2017. 
A change in the ownership interest of a consolidated entity that  
does not result in a loss of control by the Group is accounted for as  
an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a consolidated 
entity, it derecognises the related assets, goodwill, liabilities,  
non-controlling interest and other components of equity, and any  
gain or loss is recognised in consolidated comprehensive income. 
Any investment retained is recognised at its fair value at the date of  
loss of control. 
Interests in associates and joint arrangements 
Associates are partly owned entities over which the Group has 
significant influence but no control. Joint ventures are entities through 
which the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity 
which is subject to joint control. 
Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are 
measured using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, 
the investments are initially recognised at cost, including attributable

considered to be structured entities. Structured entities are entities 
that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the 
dominant factor in deciding which party has control: for example, 
when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the 
relevant activities of the entity are directed by means of contractual

ended vehicles which entitle third-party investors to a percentage of 
the vehicle’s net asset value. 
The Group has interests in structured entities as a result of the 
management of assets on behalf of its clients. Where the Group 
holds a direct interest in a closed-ended fund, private equity fund or 
open-ended pooled fund such as a SICAV, the interest is accounted 
for either as a consolidated structured entity or as a financial asset, 
depending on whether the Group has control over the fund or not. 
Control is determined in accordance with IFRS 10, based on an 
assessment of the level of power and aggregate economic interest 
that the Group has over the fund, relative to third-party investors. 
Power is normally conveyed to the Group through the existence  
of an investment management agreement and/or other contractual 
arrangements. Aggregate economic interest is a measure of the 
Group’s exposure to variable returns in the fund through a 
combination of direct interest, carried interest, expected management

the fund.  
The Group concludes that it acts as a principal when the power it

The Group concludes that it acts as an agent when the power it  
has over the fund is deemed to be exercised for the benefit of  
third-party investors.  
The Group concludes that it has control and, therefore, will 
consolidate a fund as if it were a subsidiary where the Group acts  
as a principal. If the Group concludes that it does not have control 
over the fund, the Group accounts for its interest in the fund as a 
financial asset.  
Interests in unconsolidated structured entities 
The Group classifies the following investment funds as 
unconsolidated structured entities: 
– Segregated mandates and pooled funds managed where the 
Group does not hold any direct interest. In this case, the Group 
considers that its aggregate economic exposure is insignificant  
and, in relation to segregated mandates, the third-party investor

party investors is less than 20% (i.e. the threshold established by  
the Group for determining agent versus principal classification).

Financial statements 
Foreign currency  
The Group’s financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling 
(Sterling), which is also the Company’s functional and presentation 
currency. Items included in the financial statements of each of  
the Group’s entities are measured using the functional currency, 
which is the currency that prevails in the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates. 
Foreign currency transactions  
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective 
functional currencies of the Group entities at the spot exchange rates  
at the date of the transactions.  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  
at the balance sheet date are translated into the functional currency  
at the spot exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of  
the transaction.  
Foreign currency differences arising on translation are generally 
recognised in comprehensive income. However, foreign currency 
differences arising from the translation of the following items are 
recognised in other comprehensive income: 
– available-for-sale equity instruments; and 
– qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedge  
is effective. 
Foreign operations  
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill  
and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated  
into Sterling at the spot exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into 
Sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling  
at the dates of the transactions.  
Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive 
income, and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve, 
except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to  
non-controlling interests.  
When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control is lost,  
the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve 
related to that foreign operation is reclassified to comprehensive 
income as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes 
of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign 
operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of  
the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. 
If the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to  
a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable 
future, foreign currency differences arising on the item form part 
of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised 
in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in the foreign 
currency translation reserve within equity. 
Business combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method as at the acquisition date. The acquisition date is the date  
on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree. 
The consideration transferred for the acquisition is generally 
measured at the acquisition date fair value, as are the identifiable  
net assets acquired, liabilities incurred (including any asset or liability 
resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement) and  
equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control  
of the acquiree. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, except if they  
are related to the issue of debt or equity securities. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will  
be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequently, 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is 
deemed to be a liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 
in comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified 
as equity, it will not be remeasured and settlement is accounted for 
within equity. 
If share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required  
to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees 
(acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, all or a portion  
of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included  
in measuring the consideration transferred in the business 
combination. This determination is based on market-based value  
of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value  
of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement 
awards relate to pre-combination service. 
Goodwill 
The cost of a business combination in excess of the fair value of  
net identifiable assets or liabilities acquired, including intangible  
assets identified, is recognised as goodwill and stated at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, 
is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment  
or when there is an indication of impairment.  
Intangible assets 
The cost of intangible assets, such as management contracts and 
brand names, acquired as part of a business combination is their  
fair value as at the date of acquisition. The fair value at the date of 
acquisition is calculated using the discounted cash flow methodology 
and represents the valuation of the profits expected to be earned 
from the management contracts and brand name in place at the  
date of acquisition.  
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less 
any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible 
assets are amortised, if appropriate, over their useful lives, which  
have been assessed as being eight years.  
Non-controlling interests (NCI) 
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. Changes to the Group’s 
interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are 
accounted for as equity transactions. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Cost is determined on the basis 
of the direct and indirect costs that are directly attributable. Property, 
plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful lives, assessed to be five years for office 
equipment and four years for IT equipment. The residual values and 
useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually.

Deferred acquisition costs 
Costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment 
management contract are deferred if they can be identified separately 
and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered. 
Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to benefit 
from providing investment management services and are charged  
as the related revenue is recognised. 
Financial instruments 
Recognition and initial measurement 
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes party  
to the contractual provisions of an instrument, initially at fair value  
plus transaction costs except for financial assets classified at fair 
value through profit or loss. Purchases or sales of financial assets are 
recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when 
the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or 
been transferred or when the Group has transferred substantially all 
risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognised 
when the obligation under the liability has been discharged, cancelled 
or expires. 
Subsequent measurement 
The subsequent measurement of financial instruments depends on 
their classification in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held 
for Sale and Discontinued Operations.  
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: 
financial assets held for sale, investment securities designated as fair 
value through profit or loss (FVTPL), fair value through profit or loss 
investments, available-for-sale financial assets and non-current 
financial assets held for sale. 
The Group may, from time to time, invest seed capital in funds 
where a subsidiary is the investment manager or an adviser. Where 
the holding in such investments is deemed to represent a controlling 
stake and is acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal 
through sale or dilution, these seed capital investments are 
recognised as non-current financial assets held for sale in accordance 
with IFRS 5. The Group recognises 100% of the investment in the 
fund as a ‘held for sale’ asset and the interest held by other parties as 
a ‘liability held for sale’. Where control is not deemed to exist, and the 
assets are readily realisable, they are recognised as financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39. Where the 
assets are not readily realisable, they are recognised as non-current 
asset investments. If a seed capital investment remains under the 
control of the Group for more than one year from the original 
investment date, the underlying fund is consolidated line-by-line. 
Investment securities designated as FVTPL 
Investment securities represent securities, other than derivatives, 
held by consolidated funds. These securities are designated as FVTPL 
and are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised 
through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Non-current financial assets held for sale (HFS) 
Non-current financial assets held for sale are measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except where 
measurement and remeasurement is outside the scope of IFRS 5. 
Where investments that have initially been recognised as non-current 
financial assets held for sale, because the Group has been deemed  
to hold a controlling stake, are subsequently disposed of or diluted 
such that the Group’s holding is no longer deemed a controlling stake, 
the investment will subsequently be classified as fair value through 
profit or loss investments in accordance with IAS 39. Subsequent 
movements will be recognised in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy for the newly adopted classification.  
Available-for-sale financial assets  
Available-for-sale financial assets (AFS) include readily realisable 
interests in seeded funds that are either allocated specifically to 
this category or cannot be assigned to any other category. They are 
carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, until the asset is disposed of or impaired, at 
which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is included in profit for the year as part of 
comprehensive income. Dividend income and impairment losses are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Financial assets designated as FVTPL  
Financial assets designated as FVTPL include certain readily realisable 
interests in seeded funds, non-current asset investments and 
derivatives. The Group designates financial assets as FVTPL when: 
– the financial assets are managed, evaluated and reported internally 
on a fair value basis; and 
– the classification at fair value eliminates or significantly reduces  
an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise. 
From the date the financial asset is designated as FVTPL, all 
subsequent changes in fair value, foreign exchange differences, 
interest and dividends are reflected in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and presented in finance income or expense. 
(i) FVTPL investments 
The Group classifies new readily realisable interests in seeded  
funds as FVTPL investments with fair value changes being directly 
recognised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. Fair value is measured based on the proportionate net asset 
value in the fund. 
(ii) Non-current asset investments 
Non-current asset investments include closed-end funds that are 
designated as FVTPL. They are held at fair value with changes in  
fair value being recognised through the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. 
(iii) Derivatives 
Derivatives include foreign exchange forward contracts and options 
used by the Group to manage its foreign currency exposures and 
those held in consolidated funds. Derivatives are initially recognised  
at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Transaction costs are 
recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. 
All derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is 
positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
derivatives are taken directly in comprehensive income, except for 
the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. 
Trade and other receivables  
Trade and other receivables are initially recorded at fair value plus 
transaction costs. The fair value on acquisition is normally the cost. 
Impairment losses with respect to the estimated irrecoverable 
amount are recognised through the statement of comprehensive

Deferred acquisition costs 
Costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment 
management contract are deferred if they can be identified separately 
and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered. 
Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to benefit 
from providing investment management services and are charged  
as the related revenue is recognised. 
Financial instruments 
Recognition and initial measurement 
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes party  
to the contractual provisions of an instrument, initially at fair value  
plus transaction costs except for financial assets classified at fair 
value through profit or loss. Purchases or sales of financial assets are 
recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when 
the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or 
been transferred or when the Group has transferred substantially all 
risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognised 
when the obligation under the liability has been discharged, cancelled 
or expires. 
Subsequent measurement 
The subsequent measurement of financial instruments depends on 
their classification in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held 
for Sale and Discontinued Operations.  
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: 
financial assets held for sale, investment securities designated as fair 
value through profit or loss (FVTPL), fair value through profit or loss 
investments, available-for-sale financial assets and non-current 
financial assets held for sale. 
The Group may, from time to time, invest seed capital in funds 
where a subsidiary is the investment manager or an adviser. Where 
the holding in such investments is deemed to represent a controlling 
stake and is acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal 
through sale or dilution, these seed capital investments are 
recognised as non-current financial assets held for sale in accordance 
with IFRS 5. The Group recognises 100% of the investment in the 
fund as a ‘held for sale’ asset and the interest held by other parties as 
a ‘liability held for sale’. Where control is not deemed to exist, and the 
assets are readily realisable, they are recognised as financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39. Where the 
assets are not readily realisable, they are recognised as non-current 
asset investments. If a seed capital investment remains under the 
control of the Group for more than one year from the original 
investment date, the underlying fund is consolidated line-by-line. 
Investment securities designated as FVTPL 
Investment securities represent securities, other than derivatives, 
held by consolidated funds. These securities are designated as FVTPL 
and are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised 
through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Non-current financial assets held for sale (HFS) 
Non-current financial assets held for sale are measured at the lower 
of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except where 
measurement and remeasurement is outside the scope of IFRS 5. 
Where investments that have initially been recognised as non-current 
financial assets held for sale, because the Group has been deemed  
to hold a controlling stake, are subsequently disposed of or diluted 
such that the Group’s holding is no longer deemed a controlling stake, 
the investment will subsequently be classified as fair value through 
profit or loss investments in accordance with IAS 39. Subsequent 
movements will be recognised in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy for the newly adopted classification.  
Available-for-sale financial assets  
Available-for-sale financial assets (AFS) include readily realisable 
interests in seeded funds that are either allocated specifically to 
this category or cannot be assigned to any other category. They are 
carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, until the asset is disposed of or impaired, at 
which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is included in profit for the year as part of 
comprehensive income. Dividend income and impairment losses are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Financial assets designated as FVTPL  
Financial assets designated as FVTPL include certain readily realisable 
interests in seeded funds, non-current asset investments and 
derivatives. The Group designates financial assets as FVTPL when: 
– the financial assets are managed, evaluated and reported internally 
on a fair value basis; and 
– the classification at fair value eliminates or significantly reduces  
an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise. 
From the date the financial asset is designated as FVTPL, all 
subsequent changes in fair value, foreign exchange differences, 
interest and dividends are reflected in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and presented in finance income or expense. 
(i) FVTPL investments 
The Group classifies new readily realisable interests in seeded  
funds as FVTPL investments with fair value changes being directly 
recognised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. Fair value is measured based on the proportionate net asset 
value in the fund. 
(ii) Non-current asset investments 
Non-current asset investments include closed-end funds that are 
designated as FVTPL. They are held at fair value with changes in  
fair value being recognised through the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. 
(iii) Derivatives 
Derivatives include foreign exchange forward contracts and options 
used by the Group to manage its foreign currency exposures and 
those held in consolidated funds. Derivatives are initially recognised  
at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into 
and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Transaction costs are 
recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. 
All derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is 
positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
derivatives are taken directly in comprehensive income, except for 
the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. 
Trade and other receivables  
Trade and other receivables are initially recorded at fair value plus 
transaction costs. The fair value on acquisition is normally the cost. 
Impairment losses with respect to the estimated irrecoverable 
amount are recognised through the statement of comprehensive 
 
 
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 97 
Financial statements 
income when there is appropriate evidence that trade and other 
receivables are impaired. The resulting adjustment is recognised as 
interest expense or interest income. Subsequent to initial recognition 
these assets are measured at amortised cost less any impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash represents cash at bank and in hand, and cash equivalents 
comprise short-term deposits and investments in money market 
instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. 
Financial liabilities 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following 
categories: non-current financial liabilities held for sale, financial 
liabilities designated as FVTPL and financial liabilities at  
amortised cost. 
Non-current financial liabilities held for sale 
Non-current financial liabilities represent interests held by other 
parties in funds in which the Group recognises 100% of the 
investment in the fund as a held for sale financial asset. These 
liabilities are carried at fair value with gains or losses recognised  
in the statement of comprehensive income within finance income  
or expense. 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL include derivative financial instruments 
and third-party interests in consolidated funds. They are carried at fair 
value with gains or losses recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income within finance income or expense. 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities including trade and other payables  
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to  
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. the ‘exit price’)  
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. In determining fair value, the Group uses various 
valuation approaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in 
measuring fair value that maximises the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs by requiring  
that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable 
inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the 
asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from 
sources independent of the Group.  
Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Group’s assumptions 
about the assumptions other market participants would use in pricing 
the asset or liability, developed based on the best information 
available in the circumstances. 
Securities listed on a recognised stock exchange or dealt on any  
other regulated market that operates regularly, is recognised and  
open to the public are valued at the last known available closing bid 
price. If a security is traded on several actively traded and organised 
financial markets, the valuation is made on the basis of the last known 
bid price on the main market on which the securities are traded.  
In the case of securities for which trading on an actively traded and 
organised financial market is not significant, but which are bought and 
sold on a secondary market with regulated trading among security 
dealers (with the effect that the price is set on a market basis), the 
valuation may be based on this secondary market.  
Where instruments are not listed on any stock exchange or not 
traded on any regulated markets, valuation techniques are used  
by valuation specialists. These techniques include the market 
approach, the income approach or the cost approach for which 
sufficient and reliable data is available. The use of the market 
approach generally consists of using comparable market transactions 
or using techniques based on market observable inputs, while the 
use of the income approach generally consists of the net present 
value of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as deemed appropriate 
for liquidity, credit, market and/or other risk factors.  
Investments in open-ended funds are valued on the basis of the  
last available net asset value of the units or shares of such funds. 
The fair value of the derivatives is their quoted market price at  
the balance sheet date. 
Hedge accounting 
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting when the transactions 
meet the specified hedge accounting criteria. To qualify, the following 
conditions must be met: 
– formal documentation of the relationship between the hedging 
instrument(s) and hedged item(s) must exist at inception 
– the hedged cash flows must be highly probable and must present 
an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect 
comprehensive income 
– the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured 
– the hedge must be highly effective, with effectiveness assessed  
on an ongoing basis. 
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of  
the effective hedging instrument is initially recognised in other 
comprehensive income and is released to comprehensive income  
in the same period during which the relevant financial asset or  
liability affects the Group’s results.  
Where the hedge is highly effective overall, any ineffective portion  
of the hedge is immediately recognised in comprehensive income. 
Where the instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or  
is sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is discontinued. 
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risk and rewards of 
ownership of the asset. The Group derecognises a financial  
liability when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled  
or they expire. 
Impairment of financial assets 
General 
At each reporting date, the carrying amounts of the Group’s assets 
are reviewed to assess whether there is any objective evidence  
of impairment in the value of financial assets classified as either 
available-for-sale or as trade and other receivables. Impairment  
losses are recognised if an event has occurred that will have an 
adverse impact on the expected future cash flows of an asset and  
the expected impact can be reliably estimated. If any such indication 
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment 
loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount.

4) Significant accounting policies continued 
Impairment of financial assets continued 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in  
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present  
value using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For an 
asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. 
Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are measured 
as the difference between cost and the current fair value. Where 
there is evidence that the available-for-sale financial asset is impaired, 
the cumulative loss that had been previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is reclassified from the available-for-sale  
fair value reserve and recognised in the consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income.  
Impairment losses in respect of assets other than goodwill are 
measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the 
financial asset and the present value of estimated cash flows 
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Such 
impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
other comprehensive income and are recognised against the carrying 
amount of the impaired asset on the consolidated statement of 
financial position. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be 
accrued on the reduced carrying amount based on the original 
effective interest rate of the asset. 
Subsequent increases in fair value of previously impaired available-for-
sale financial assets are reported as fair value gains in the available-
for-sale fair value reserve through other comprehensive income and 
not separately identified as an impairment reversal.  
For all other assets other than goodwill, if in a subsequent year the 
amount of the estimated impairment loss decreases because of an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed, but is limited to the extent 
that the value of the asset may not exceed the original carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, had no impairment occurred. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an 
indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based  
on management’s judgements regarding the future prospects of the 
business, estimates of future cash flows and discount rates. When 
assessing the appropriateness of the carrying value of goodwill at 
year end, the recoverable amount is considered to be the greater of 
fair value less costs to sell or value in use. The pre-tax discount rate 
applied is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital  
after making allowances for any specific risks.  
The business of the Group is managed as a single unit, with asset 
allocations, research and other such operational practices reflecting 
the commonality of approach across all fund themes. Therefore,  
for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, the Group is 
considered to have one cash-generating unit to which all goodwill  
is allocated and, as a result, no further split of goodwill into smaller 
cash-generating units is possible and the impairment review is 
conducted for the Group as a whole. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 
Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable for the provision of investment management services,  
and includes management fees, performance fees and other 
revenue. Revenue is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income as and when the related services are provided. Revenue is 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits 
will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Net revenue is total revenue less distribution costs and including 
foreign exchange. 
Specific revenue recognition policies are: 
Management fees 
Management fees are presented net of rebates, and are calculated  
as a percentage of net fund assets managed in accordance with 
individual management agreements. Management fees are  
accrued over the period for which the service is provided. Where 
management fees are received in advance, they are recognised  
over the period of the provision of the asset management service.  
Performance fees 
Performance fees are presented net of rebates, and are calculated  
as a percentage of the appreciation in the net asset value of a fund 
above a defined hurdle. Performance fees are recognised when the 
quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable that 
the fee will crystallise. This is usually at the end of the performance 
period or upon early redemption by a client. 
Other revenue 
Other revenue includes transaction, structuring and administration 
fees, and reimbursement by funds of costs incurred by the Group. 
This revenue is recognised when the related services are provided.  
Distribution costs 
Distribution costs are cost of sales payable to third-parties and  
are recognised over the period for which the service is provided. 
Employee benefits 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans  
are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive 
income when payable in accordance with the scheme particulars. 
Share-based payments  
The Group issues share awards to its employees under share-based 
compensation plans.  
For equity-settled awards, the fair value of the amounts payable  
to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity over the vesting period after adjusting for the 
estimated number of shares that are expected to vest. The fair value 
is measured at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
instruments were granted. At each balance sheet date prior to 
vesting, the cumulative expense representing the extent to which  
the vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate  
of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest is calculated. The 
movement in cumulative expense is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income with a corresponding entry within equity. 
For cash-settled awards, the fair value of the amounts payable to 
employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding liability 
on the Group’s balance sheet. The fair value is measured using an 
appropriate valuation model, taking into account the estimated 
number of awards that are expected to vest and the terms and

This revenue is recognised when the related services are provided.  
Distribution costs 
Distribution costs are cost of sales payable to third-parties and  
are recognised over the period for which the service is provided.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans  
are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive 
income when payable in accordance with the scheme particulars. 
Share-based payments  
The Group issues share awards to its employees under share-based 
compensation plans.  
For equity-settled awards, the fair value of the amounts payable  
to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity over the vesting period after adjusting for the 
estimated number of shares that are expected to vest. The fair value 
is measured at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the

vesting, the cumulative expense representing the extent to which  
the vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate  
of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest is calculated. The 
movement in cumulative expense is recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income with a corresponding entry within equity. 
For cash-settled awards, the fair value of the amounts payable to 
employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding liability 
on the Group’s balance sheet. The fair value is measured using an 
appropriate valuation model, taking into account the estimated 
number of awards that are expected to vest and the terms and 
 
 
  Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 99 
Financial statements 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted. During the 
vesting period, the liability recognised represents the portion of the 
vesting period that has expired at the balance sheet date multiplied  
by the fair value of the awards at that date. Movements in the liability 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.  
Operating leases  
Payments due under operating leases are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over  
the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised  
on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are recorded as  
a reduction in premises costs.  
Finance income and expense 
Finance income includes interest receivable on the Group’s cash and 
cash equivalents, realised gains on available-for-sale financial assets 
and both realised and unrealised gains on held for sale assets and 
investments measured at FVTPL.  
Finance expense includes realised losses on available-for-sale financial 
assets and both realised and unrealised losses on held for sale assets 
and investments measured at FVTPL. 
Taxation  
Tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax.  
Tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax 
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on  
the taxable income or loss for the year, and any adjustment to the  
tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance  
sheet date in the countries where the Group operates. Current  
tax also includes withholding tax arising from dividends. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method,  
in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. The following differences are not 
provided for:  
– goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and  
– differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent  
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which  
the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at  
each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no  
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be 
applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax  
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
 
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised when shareholders’ rights to receive 
payments have been established. 
Equity shares 
The Company’s ordinary shares of 0.01 pence each are classified  
as equity instruments. Ordinary shares issued by the Company  
are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received or the  
market price at the day of issue. Direct issue costs, net of tax,  
are deducted from equity through share premium. When share  
capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including 
directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. 
Own shares 
Own shares are held by the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). The 
holding of the EBT comprises own shares that have not vested 
unconditionally to employees of the Group. In both the Group and 
Company, own shares are recorded at cost and are deducted from 
retained earnings.  
Treasury shares 
Treasury shares are recognised in equity and are measured at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised 
in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale 
and original cost being taken to retained earnings. 
Segmental information 
Key management information, including revenues, margins, 
investment performance, distribution costs and AuM flows,  
which is relevant to the operation of the Group, is reported to and 
reviewed by the Board on the basis of the investment management 
business as a whole. Hence the Group’s management considers  
that the Group’s services and its operations are not run on a discrete 
geographic basis and comprise one business segment (being 
provision of investment management services).  
Company-only accounting policies 
In addition to the above accounting policies, the following specifically 
relates to the Company:  
Investment in subsidiaries  
Investments by the Company in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, 
where appropriate, provisions for impairment.

determined by the average Ashmore Group plc closing share price for the five business days prior to grant. For Executive Directors, the fair 
value of awards also takes into account the performance conditions set out in the Remuneration report.  
Where the grant of restricted and matching share awards is linked to the annual bonus process, the fair value of the awards is spread over  
a period including the current financial year and the subsequent five years to their vesting date when the grantee becomes unconditionally 
entitled to the underlying shares. The fair value of the remaining awards is spread over the period from the date of grant to the vesting date. 
The liability arising from cash-settled awards under the Omnibus Plan at the end of the year and reported within trade and other payables  
on the consolidated balance sheet is £0.4 million (30 June 2016: £0.6 million) of which £nil (30 June 2016: £nil) relates to vested awards.

The CSOP was also introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and is an option scheme providing for the grant of market value 
options to employees with the aggregate value of outstanding options not exceeding £30,000 per employee. The CSOP qualifies as a UK tax 
approved company share option plan and approval thereto has been obtained from HMRC. To date, there have been no awards made under

A reduction to the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20% was enacted in the Finance Act 2013 and became effective from 1 April 2015. 
Finance (No. 2) Act 2015 introduced legislation to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017. Finance Act 2016 further 
reduces the tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020. These tax rate reductions have been taken into account in the calculation of the Group’s UK 
deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2017.

13) Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share at 30 June 2017 of 25.07 pence (30 June 2016: 19.13 pence) is calculated by dividing the profit after tax for the 
financial period attributable to equity holders of the parent of £167.6 million (FY2015/16: £127.8 million) by the weighted average number  
of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on basic earnings per share adjusted for all dilutive potential ordinary shares. There is  
no difference between the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent used in the basic and diluted earnings per  
share calculations. 
Reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is shown below.

recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders. Based on the number of shares 
in issue at the year end that qualify to receive a dividend, the total amount payable would be £84.6 million.

Goodwill 
The Group’s goodwill balance relates principally to the acquisition of the equities business in May 2011.  
The Company’s goodwill balance relates to the acquisition of the business from ANZ in 1999.  
The annual impairment review of goodwill was undertaken for the year ending 30 June 2017. The Group consists of a single cash-generating 
unit for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill. In performing the impairment review, management prepares a calculation of  
the recoverable amount of goodwill and compares this with the carrying value. The recoverable amount was based on a fair value less costs to  
sell calculation using the Company’s year end share price. Based on management’s assessment as at 30 June 2017, the recoverable amount 
was in excess of the carrying value of goodwill and no impairment was implied. No impairment losses have been recognised in the current  
or preceding years.  
Fund management relationships  
Intangible assets comprise fund management relationships related to profit expected to be earned from clients of AEIM. 
An annual impairment review of the fund management relationships was undertaken for the year ending 30 June 2017. The recoverable 
amount was derived from the cumulative pre-tax net earnings anticipated to be generated over the remaining useful economic life, discounted 
to present value using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 13.0% per annum. Cumulative net earnings associated with the fund 
management relationships intangible asset were derived from the annual operating profit contribution that would arise as a result of the 
remaining fund management relationships, adjusted for investment performance and investor attrition.  
The recoverable amount of the fund management relationships intangible asset was determined to be higher than its carrying value as at 
30 June 2017. Accordingly, no impairment charge was recognised during the year (FY2015/16: no impairment charge recognised).  
The remaining amortisation period for fund management relationships is two years (30 June 2016: three years).

19) Fair value of financial instruments 
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. This framework includes committees that 
have overall responsibility for all significant fair value measurements. Each committee regularly reviews significant inputs and valuation 
adjustments. If third-party information is used to measure fair value, the team assesses and documents the evidence obtained from the third 
parties to support such valuations. There are no material differences between the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities and their fair 
values at the balance sheet date. 
Fair value hierarchy 
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making  
the measurements: 
– Level 1: Valuation is based upon a quoted market price in an active market for an identical instrument. This fair value measure relates  
to the valuation of quoted and exchange traded equity and debt securities.  
– Level 2: Valuation techniques are based upon observable inputs, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).  
This fair value measure relates to the valuation of quoted equity securities in inactive markets or in interests in unlisted funds whose  
net asset values are referenced to the fair values of the listed or exchange traded securities held by those funds. 
– Level 3: Valuation techniques use significant unobservable inputs. 
For financial instruments that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between 
levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole) at the end of each reporting period.

Valuation of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value on a recurring basis 
Investments valued using valuation techniques include financial investments which, by their nature, do not have an externally quoted price 
based on regular trades, and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions e.g. market illiquidity. 
The valuation techniques used include comparison to recent arm’s length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the 
same, discounted cash flow analysis, and, if applicable, enterprise valuation.  
These techniques may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as interest rate and price earnings multiples. Changes in 
assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these instruments. When determining the 
inputs into the valuation techniques used priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the 
source of pricing is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement that reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would 
take place between market participants on the measurement date.  
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon available market information and judgements about the financial 
instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows. Such estimates do not typically reflect any premium 
or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Group’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument, nor do they 
typically consider the tax impact of the realisation of unrealised gains or losses from selling the financial instrument being fair valued. In some 
cases the disclosed value cannot be realised in immediate settlement of the financial instrument.  
In accordance with the Group’s Pricing Methodology and Valuation framework, the estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments 
valued internally using standard market practices are subject to assessment against external counterparties’ valuations.

Valuation of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value on a recurring basis 
Investments valued using valuation techniques include financial investments which, by their nature, do not have an externally quoted price 
based on regular trades, and financial investments for which markets are no longer active as a result of market conditions e.g. market illiquidity. 
The valuation techniques used include comparison to recent arm’s length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the 
same, discounted cash flow analysis, and, if applicable, enterprise valuation.  
These techniques may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as interest rate and price earnings multiples. Changes in 
assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these instruments. When determining the 
inputs into the valuation techniques used priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the 
source of pricing is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement that reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would 
take place between market participants on the measurement date.  
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon available market information and judgements about the financial 
instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows. Such estimates do not typically reflect any premium 
or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Group’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument, nor do they 
typically consider the tax impact of the realisation of unrealised gains or losses from selling the financial instrument being fair valued. In some 
cases the disclosed value cannot be realised in immediate settlement of the financial instrument.  
In accordance with the Group’s Pricing Methodology and Valuation framework, the estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments 
valued internally using standard market practices are subject to assessment against external counterparties’ valuations.

Financial instruments not measured at fair value 
Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value include cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and 
other payables. The carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value is considered a reasonable approximation 
of fair value as at 30 June 2017 and 2016. 
The Group considers itself a sponsor of an investment fund when it facilitates the establishment of a fund in which the Group is the  
investment manager. The Group ordinarily provides seed capital in order to provide initial scale and facilitate marketing of the funds to  
third-party investors. The fund is then financed through the issue of units to investors. Aggregate interests held by the Group include seed  
capital, management fees and performance fees. The Group generates management and performance fee income from managing the  
assets on behalf of third-party investors.

a) Non-current assets and non-current liabilities held for sale 
Where Group companies invest seed capital into funds operated and controlled by the Group and the Group is actively seeking to reduce its 
investment and it is considered highly probable that it will relinquish control within a year, the interests in the funds are treated as held for sale 
and are recognised as financial assets and liabilities held for sale. During the year, three funds (FY2015/16: five) were seeded in this manner, 
met the above criteria, and consequently the assets and liabilities of these funds were initially classified as held for sale.  
The non-current assets and liabilities held for sale at 30 June 2017 were as follows:

Investments cease to be classified as held for sale when they are no longer controlled by the Group. A loss of control may happen through  
sale of the investment and/or dilution of the Group’s holding. When investments cease to be classified as held for sale, they are classified  
as financial assets designated as FVTPL. One such fund was transferred to the FVTPL category during the year after the Group reduced its 
interests following investment inflows from third parties (FY2015/16: none). 
If the fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year from the original investment date, it will cease to be classified  
as held for sale, and will be consolidated line-by-line after it is assessed that the Group controls the investment fund in accordance with  
the requirements of IFRS 10. During the year, two such funds (FY2015/16: seven) with an aggregate carrying amount of £12.5 million 
(FY2015/16: £15.8 million) were transferred from held for sale to consolidated funds category. There was no impact on net assets  
or comprehensive income as a result of the transfer.  
Included within finance income are net gains of £9.3 million (FY2015/16: net gains of £4.2 million) in relation to held for sale investments. 
As the Group considers itself to have one segment (refer to note 4), no additional segmental disclosure of held for sale assets or liabilities

d) Consolidated funds 
The Group has consolidated 13 investment funds as at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: 14 investment funds), over which the Group is deemed  
to have control (refer to note 26). Consolidated funds represent seed capital investments where the Group has held its position for a period 
greater than one year and its interest represents a controlling stake in the fund in accordance with IFRS 10. Consolidated fund assets and 
liabilities are presented line-by-line after intercompany eliminations. The table below sets out an analysis of the carrying amounts of interests

e) Non-current asset investments 
Non-current asset investments relate to the Group’s holding in closed-end funds and are designated as FVTPL. Fair value is assessed by  
taking account of the extent to which potential dilution of gains or losses may arise as a result of additional investors subscribing to the  
fund where the final close of a fund has not occurred.

21) Financial instrument risk management 
Group 
The Group is subject to strategic and business, client, investment, treasury and operational risks throughout its business as discussed in the 
Risk management section. This note discusses the Group’s exposure to and management of the following principal risks which arise from the 
financial instruments it uses: credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk. Where the Group holds units  
in investment funds, classified either as held for sale, available-for-sale, FVTPL or non-current asset investment financial assets, the related 
financial instrument risk disclosures in the note below categorise exposures based on the Group’s direct interest in those funds without  
looking through to the nature of underlying securities. 
Risk management is the ultimate responsibility of the Board, as noted in the Risk management section on pages 32 to 37. 
Capital management 
It is the Group’s policy that all entities within the Group have sufficient capital to meet regulatory and working capital requirements and  
it conducts regular reviews of its capital requirements relative to its capital resources. 
As the Group is regulated by the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), it is required to maintain appropriate capital and perform 
regular calculations of capital requirements. This includes development of an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), based 
upon the FCA’s methodologies under the Capital Requirements Directive. The Group’s Pillar III disclosures can be found on the Group’s website 
at www.ashmoregroup.com. These disclosures indicate that the Group had excess capital of £448.3 million as at 30 June 2017 
(30 June 2016: excess capital of £406.4 million) over the level of capital required under a Pillar II assessment. The objective of the assessment is 
to check that the Group has adequate capital to manage identified risks and the process includes conducting stress tests to identify capital and 
liquidity requirements under different future scenarios including a potential downturn.  
Credit risk 
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts  
when due.  
Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis by senior management and the Group’s Risk management and control function.  
The Group has a counterparty and cash management policy in place which, in addition to other controls, restricts exposure to any single 
counterparty by setting exposure limits and requiring approval and diversification of counterparty banks and other financial institutions.  
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets. The table below lists financial  
assets subject to credit risk.

counterparties with credit ratings ranging from A+ to AAA as at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: A to AAA).  
All trade and other receivables are considered to be fully recoverable and none were overdue at year end (30 June 2016: none). They include  
fee debtors that arise principally within the Group’s investment management business. They are monitored regularly and, historically, default 
levels have been insignificant, and, unless a client has withdrawn funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client. 
There is no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of fees owing from clients.

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled 
by delivering cash or other financial assets.  
In order to manage liquidity risk, there is a Group Liquidity Policy to ensure that there is sufficient access to funds to cover all forecast 
committed requirements for the next 12 months.

Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market  
interest rates. 
The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest income through adverse movements in interest  
rates. This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business. The Group has a cash management policy which monitors cash 
levels and returns within set parameters on a continuing basis. 
Bank and similar deposits held at year end are shown on the consolidated balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents. The effective interest 
earned on bank and similar deposits during the year is given in the table below: 
Effective interest rates applicable to bank deposits 
 
2017
%
2016
%
Deposits with banks and liquidity funds 0.67 1.01
Deposits with banks and liquidity funds are repriced at intervals of less than one year. 
At 30 June 2017, if interest rates over the year had been 50 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, profit before tax  
for the year would have been £2.0 million higher/lower (FY2015/16: £1.0 million higher/lower), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest on  
cash balances. An assumption that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the model 
to calculate the effect on profit before tax. 
In addition, the Group is indirectly exposed to interest rate risk where the Group holds seed capital investments in funds that invest in  
debt securities.

Foreign exchange risk 
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. 
The Group’s revenue is almost entirely denominated in US dollars, while the majority of the Group’s costs are denominated in Sterling. 
Consequently, the Group has an exposure to movements in the GBP:USD exchange rate. In addition, the Group operates globally, which  
means that it may enter into contracts and other arrangements denominated in local currencies in various countries. The Group also holds  
a number of seed capital investments denominated mainly in US dollars, Colombian pesos and Indonesian rupiah. 
The Group’s policy is to hedge a proportion of the Group’s revenue by using a combination of forward foreign exchange contracts and options 
for a period of up to two years forward. The Group also sells US dollars at spot rates when opportunities arise.  
The table below shows the Group’s sensitivity to a 1.0% exchange movement in the US dollar, Colombian peso and Indonesian rupiah, net of 
hedging activities.

Price risk 
Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of market changes. 
Seed capital 
The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in market prices in respect of seed capital investments. Such price risk is borne by the Group 
directly through interests in available-for-sale and non-current asset seed capital investments or indirectly either through line-by-line consolidation 
of underlying financial performance and positions held in certain funds or potential impairments when fair values less costs to sell of seed 
investments held for sale are less than carrying amounts. Details of seed capital investments held are given in note 20. 
The Group has well defined procedures governing the appraisal, approval and monitoring of seed capital investments. 
At 30 June 2017, a 5% movement in the fair value of these investments would have had a £10.5 million (FY2015/16: £11.9 million) impact  
on net assets and the impact on profit before tax would have been £3.3 million (FY2015/16: £7.8 million).  
Management and performance fees 
The Group is also indirectly exposed to price risk in connection with the Group’s management fees, which are based on a percentage of value  
of AuM, and fees based on performance. Movements in market prices, exchange and interest rates could cause the AuM to fluctuate, which  
in turn could affect fees earned. Performance fee revenues could also be reduced depending upon market conditions. 
Management and performance fees are diversified across a range of investment themes and are not measurably correlated to any single 
market index in Emerging Markets. In addition, throughout Ashmore’s history, the policy of having funds with year ends staged throughout  
the financial year has meant that in periods of steep market decline, some performance fees have still been recorded. The profitability impact  
is likely to be less than this, as cost mitigation actions would apply, including the reduction of the variable compensation paid to employees.  
Using the year end AuM level of US$58.7 billion and applying the year’s average net management fee rate of 52bps, a 5% movement  
in AuM would have a US$15.3 million impact, equivalent to £11.8 million using year end exchange rate of 1.2946, on management fee 
revenues (FY2015/16: using the year end AuM level of US$52.6 billion and applying the year’s average net management fee rate of 55bps, 
a 5% movement in AuM would have a US$14.5 million impact, equivalent to £10.9 million using year end exchange rate of 1.3234 on 
management fee revenues). 
Hedging activities 
The Group uses forward and option contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk. These hedges, which have been assessed as 
effective cash flow hedges as at 30 June 2017, protect a proportion of the Group’s revenue cash flows from foreign exchange movements.  
The cumulative fair value of the outstanding foreign exchange hedges asset at 30 June 2017 was £0.3 million (30 June 2016: £4.5 million 
foreign exchange hedges liability) and is included within the Group’s derivative financial instrument assets.

When hedges are assessed as effective, intrinsic value gains and losses are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and later 
reclassified to comprehensive income as the corresponding hedged cash flows crystallise. Time value in relation to the Group’s hedges is 
excluded from being part of the hedging item and, as a result, the net unrealised loss related to the time value of the hedges is recognised  
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year. 
A £3.8 million intrinsic gain (FY2015/16: £3.9 million intrinsic loss) on the Group’s hedges has been recognised through other comprehensive  
income and £3.7 million intrinsic value loss (FY2015/16: £1.7 million intrinsic value gain) was reclassified from equity to the statement of 
comprehensive income in the year.  
Included within the net realised and unrealised hedging loss of £2.8 million (note 7) recognised at 30 June 2017 (£1.1 million gain at 
30 June 2016) are: 
– a £0.9 million gain in respect of foreign exchange hedges covering net management fee income for the financial year ending 30 June 2017 
(FY2015/16: £0.6 million loss in respect of foreign exchange hedges covering net management fee income for the financial year ended 
30 June 2016); and 
– a £3.7 million loss in respect of crystallised foreign exchange contracts (FY2015/16: £1.7 million gain). 
Company 
The risk management processes of the Company, including those relating to the specific risk exposures covered below, are aligned with  
those of the Group as a whole unless stated otherwise.  
In addition, the risk definitions that apply to the Group are also relevant for the Company.  
Credit risk 
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets. The table below lists financial 
assets subject to credit risk by credit rating: 
  
2017
£m
2016
£m
Cash and cash equivalents  229.7 301.4
Trade and other receivables  398.0 285.4
Total  627.7 586.8
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term deposits held with banks and liquidity funds which have credit ratings ranging 
from A+ to AAA as at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: A to AAA). 
All trade and other receivables are considered to be fully recoverable and none were overdue at year end (30 June 2016: none).  
Liquidity risk 
The contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to the Company’s financial liabilities all fall due within one year.  
Details on leases and other commitments are provided in note 30.

Company 
Interest rate risk 
The principal interest rate risk for the Company is that it could sustain a reduction in interest revenue from bank deposits held in the ordinary 
course of business through adverse movements in interest rates.  
Bank and similar deposits held at year end are shown on the Company’s balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents. The effective interest 
earned on bank and similar deposits during the year is given in the table below: 
Effective interest rates applicable to bank deposits 
 
2017
%
2016
%
Deposits with banks and liquidity funds 0.30 0.59
Deposits with banks and liquidity funds are repriced at intervals of less than one year. 
At 30 June 2017, if interest rates over the year had been 50 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for 
the year would have been £1.1 million higher/lower (FY2015/16: £0.5 million higher/lower), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest on cash 
balances. An assumption that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the model to 
calculate the effect on post-tax profits. 
Foreign exchange risk  
The Company is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk in respect of US dollar cash balances and US dollar-denominated intercompany 
balances. However, such risk is not hedged by the Company. 
At 30 June 2017, if the US dollar had strengthened/weakened by 1% against Sterling with all other variables held constant, profit before tax  
for the year would have increased/decreased by £3.9 million (FY2015/16: increased/decreased by £3.4 million).

** Formerly Ashmore-CCSC Fund Management Company Limited, renamed Taiping Fund Management Company  
During August 2016, Ashmore reduced its interest in the joint venture Ashmore-CCSC Fund Management Company Limited (ACCSC), from 
49% to 15% following the introduction of a new shareholder, Taiping Group. Ashmore received cash consideration of £4.8 million resulting in a 
profit of £1.8 million in the period. ACCSC was renamed Taiping Fund Management Company Limited after the transaction and Ashmore 
Group’s remaining 15% equity interest in the company was reclassified to investment in associate.

The carrying value of the investments in associates includes attributable goodwill that arose on acquisition of the associates. Although 
the Group’s share of net assets of the associates is currently below the aggregate carrying value of the associates reflected on the 
consolidated balance sheet, the Group has considered that this position is temporary. No permanent impairment is believed to exist 
relating to the associates.  
The Group has undrawn capital commitments of £4.9 million (30 June 2016: £4.8 million) to investment funds managed by the associates. 
Further details are provided in note 28. 
28) Interests in structured entities 
The Group has interests in structured entities as a result of the management of assets on behalf of its clients. Where the Group holds a  
direct interest in a closed-ended fund, private equity fund or open-ended pooled fund such as a SICAV, the interest is accounted for either  
as a consolidated structured entity or as a financial asset, depending on whether the Group has control over the fund or not.  
The Group’s interest in structured entities is reflected in the Group’s AuM. The Group is exposed to movements in AuM of structured  
entities through the potential loss of fee income as a result of client withdrawals. Outflows from funds are dependent on market sentiment,  
asset performance and investor considerations. Further information on these risks can be found in the Business review.  
Considering the potential for changes in AuM of structured entities, management has determined that the Group’s unconsolidated  
structured entities include segregated mandates and pooled funds vehicles. Disclosure of the Group’s exposure to unconsolidated  
structured entities has been made on this basis. 
The reconciliation of AuM reported by the Group within unconsolidated structured entities is shown below.

The main risk the Group faces from its beneficial interests in unconsolidated structured entities arises from a potential decrease in the fair value  
of seed capital investments. The Group’s beneficial interests in seed capital investments are disclosed in note 20. Note 21 includes further 
information on the Group’s exposure to market risk arising from seed capital investments.

31) Post-balance sheet events 
There are no post-balance sheet events that require adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements. 
32) Accounting estimates and judgements 
Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are regularly evaluated and are based upon management’s assessment  
of current and future events. The principal estimates and judgements that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities are discussed below. 
Share-based payment transactions 
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based awards at fair value at the date of grant and expenses them 
over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will vest. Market-related performance conditions are incorporated 
into the grant price of the awards. The estimation of the likelihood of the performance conditions being met is made at the time of granting 
the awards for equity-settled arrangements and also at each reporting date for cash-settled share-based arrangements.

32) Accounting estimates and judgements 
Classification of seed capital investments 
The Group invests seed capital from time to time to support the initial launch and growth of new products, such as SICAVs, private equity  
funds and alternative investment funds. The seed capital investments vary in duration depending on the nature of the product and the time 
expected to grow the funds to a size and track record required for participation by third-party investors. The Group reviews the size and nature 
of these investments to consider the level of control over the fund and to determine the appropriate classification for accounting either as  
full consolidation (where the Group concludes that it has control over the fund), using equity-method accounting (where the Group exercises 
significant influence or joint control), or as a financial asset classified as available-for-sale, held for sale or at fair value through profit or loss.  
In the case of seed capital investments, where the Group concludes that it does not have control over the fund, the Group is also not deemed 
to have significant influence over the fund, and therefore does not apply equity-method accounting. The Group would account for the seed 
capital investment as a financial asset, classified either as an available-for-sale financial asset, financial asset held for sale, or a financial asset  
at fair value through profit or loss. The Group considers that its seeding activity is intended to help establish a fund’s track record and to  
provide initial scale until the fund has attracted sufficient third-party capital, at which stage the Group will actively seek to redeem and  
redeploy the seed capital.  
Management exercises judgement to determine whether the Group controls an investment fund under IFRS 10, including making an 
assessment of whether the Group has power over the fund which the Group exercises primarily for self-benefit. Management also assesses 
the magnitude of the Group’s aggregate economic interest in the fund (comprising direct interests, carried interests, expected management 
fees, fair value gains or losses, and distributions receivable from funds managed) relative to third-party investors, and whether third-party 
investors have substantive rights to remove the Group from acting as a fund manager without cause.  
The Group has assessed and classified the following fund vehicles as unconsolidated structured entities:  
– Segregated mandates and pooled funds managed where the Group does not hold any direct interest. In this case, the Group considers  
that its aggregate economic exposure is insignificant and, in relation to segregated mandates, the third-party investor has the practical  
ability to remove the Group from acting as fund manager, without cause. As a result, the Group concludes that it acts as an agent for  
third-party investors. 
– Pooled funds managed by the Group where the Group holds a direct interest, for example seed capital investments, and the Group’s 
aggregate economic exposure in the fund relative to third-party investors is less than 20% (i.e. the threshold established by the Group for 
determining agent versus principal classification). As a result, the Group concludes that it is an agent for third-party investors and, therefore, 
will account for its beneficial interest in the fund as a financial asset. Further details on the carrying values of these seed capital financial 
assets have been disclosed in note 20.  
The disclosure of the AuM in respect of consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities is provided in note 28. 
Impairment of intangible assets 
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets annually for impairment. The recoverable amount for goodwill is determined by reference to  
the Group’s market capitalisation, whereas the recoverable amount for intangible assets is determined based upon value in use calculations 
prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets on the Group’s 
balance sheet at 30 June 2017 was £79.9 million (30 June 2016: £82.5 million). Management considers that reasonably possible changes in 
any of the key assumptions applied would not cause the carrying value of fund management relationships intangible asset to materially exceed 
its recoverable value. The recoverable amount of the intangible asset was determined to be higher than its carrying value as at 30 June 2017. 
Accordingly, no impairment charge was recognised during the year (see note 15).

Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements 
It is possible that this document could or may contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations or beliefs, as well  
as assumptions about future events. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical  
or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as anticipate, target, expect, estimate, intend, plan, goal, believe, will, may, 
should, would, could or other words of similar meaning.  
Undue reliance should not be placed on any such statements because, by their very nature, they are subject to known and unknown risks and 
uncertainties and can be affected by other factors that could cause actual results, and the Group’s plans and objectives, to differ materially from 
those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. There are several factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
described in the forward-looking statements are changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, 
future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business combinations or dispositions. The Group undertakes no obligation 
to revise or update any forward-looking statement contained within this document, regardless of whether those statements are affected as a 
result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Financial statements 
Sharegift 
Shareholders with only a small number of shares whose value makes 
them uneconomic to sell may wish to consider donating to charity 
through Sharegift, an independent charity share donation scheme. 
For further information, please contact either the Registrar or see  
the Sharegift website at www.sharegift.org. 
Frequent shareholder enquiries 
Enquiries and notifications concerning dividends, share certificates  
or transfers and address changes should be sent to the Registrar;  
the Company’s governance reports, corporate governance guidelines 
and the terms of reference of the Board committees can be found  
on the Company’s website at www.ashmoregroup.com. 
Notifying the Company of a change of address 
You should notify Equiniti Registrars in writing. 
If you hold shares in joint names, the notification to change  
address must be signed by the first-named shareholder. You may 
choose to do this online, by logging on to www.shareview.co.uk.  
You will need your shareholder reference number to access this 
service – this can be found on your share certificate or from a 
dividend counterfoil. 
You will be asked to select your own PIN and a user ID will be  
posted to you. 
Notifying the Company of a change of name 
You should notify Equiniti Registrars in writing of your new name and 
previous name. You should attach a copy of your marriage certificate 
or your change of name deed, together with your share certificates 
and any un-cashed dividend cheques in your old name, so that the 
Registrar can reissue them. 
Dividend payments directly into bank or building society accounts 
We recommend that all dividend payments are made directly into  
a bank or building society account. Dividends are paid via BACS, 
providing tighter security and access to funds more quickly. To apply 
for a dividend mandate form, contact the Registrar, or you can find 
one by logging on to www.shareview.co.uk (under Frequently Asked 
Questions) or by calling the helpline on 0371 384 2812 (Lines are 
open 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday). 
International shareholder helpline: +44 121 415 7047. 
Transferring Ashmore Group plc shares 
Transferring some or all of your shares to someone else (for example 
your partner or a member of your family) requires completion of  
a share transfer form, which is available from Equiniti Registrars.  
The form should be fully completed and returned with your share 
certificate representing at least the number of shares being 
transferred. The Registrar will then process the transfer and issue  
a balance share certificate to you if applicable. The Registrar will be 
able to help you with any questions you may have. 
Lost share certificate(s) 
Shareholders who lose their share certificate(s) or have their 
certificate(s) stolen should inform Equiniti Registrars immediately  
by calling the shareholder helpline on 0371 384 2812 (Lines are  
open 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday). 
International shareholder helpline: +44 121 415 7047. 
Disability helpline 
For shareholders with hearing difficulties, a special text phone 
number is available: 0371 384 2255.
