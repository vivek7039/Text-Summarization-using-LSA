Strategic report 
A service-led niche 
pharmaceutical developer, 
manufacturer and supplier to 
the health and care sectors
The Group operates through three trading divisions incorporating 
eight business units across seven locations in the UK and Europe, 
offering a portfolio of innovative and synergistic products 
and services.

The Group’s strategic focus centres on two 
key pillars represented by the Specials and 
Niche Pharmaceuticals (‘Niche’) divisions.
Specials
Manufacture and supply
The Specials division operates in the UK’s 
specials market where it manufactures, 
procures and supplies unlicensed medicines 
and imported medicines licensed abroad 
(collectively referred to as ‘specials’), and 
special obtains. Its customers include the 
main wholesale and retail pharmacy chains in 
the UK, with a number of these relationships 
underpinned by exclusive supply agreements, 
as well as hospitals. The division also operates 
a dedicated aseptics compounding unit that 
manufactures bespoke intravenous specials  
to order.
The Specials division responds to prescription 
requests from healthcare professionals. It can 
deliver bespoke specials across a variety of 
dosage forms and strengths in as little as  
15 hours through its in-house, state-of-the-art 
compounding and manufacturing facilities.
The division therefore occupies a leading 
position in the specials market that enables it  
to track shifts in demand for medicines across 
the community and hospital pharmacy sectors.
Niche
Develop and supply
The Niche division uses this insight into the 
specials market, together with other data, to 
identify where patient demand for a particular 
special is high. These products are assessed 
to determine their suitability to enter the Group’s 
product development and licensing pipeline. 
The Niche division benefits from an in-house 
product development capability that manages 
the Group’s development pipeline alongside  
a range of projects for third-party customers.
Licensing products, particularly those 
currently prescribed as specials, represents  
a growth opportunity for the Group. For more 
information of the UK’s prescribing hierarchy 
and the role of specials and licensed products 
within the healthcare industry, turn to page 6.
Medication Adherence
Homecare and medication management
The Group’s visibility over prescribing  
trends and growth medicines has been 
complemented by the Medication Adherence 
division, which dispenses and supplies 
medicines into the homecare market and 
provides medication management services 
through its innovative multi-dose tray system.
Following implementation of the Group’s new 
strategy during the second half of this year, 
which aims to tighten focus on the growth 
opportunities available to the Specials and 
Niche divisions, the long-term fit of Medication 
Adherence within the Group is under review.  
A more detailed explanation of the Group’s 
new strategy is included in the Chief Executive 
Officer’s review on page 10, and in the strategy 
summary on page 18.

Specials 
The Specials division comprises 
three business units that 
manufacture, procure and supply 
unlicensed medicines, special 
obtains and imported medicines 
licensed abroad.
Niche  
Pharmaceuticals
The Niche Pharmaceuticals 
division comprises three business 
units that develop, license and 
commercialise medicines with  
a particular focus on those 
currently prescribed as specials.
Medication  
Adherence
The Medication Adherence division 
comprises two business units that 
provide products and services to 
support patients in adhering to their 
medication regime, patient-focused 
homecare services and services  
to pharmaceutical companies.
The Specials division is the most 
established of all the divisions, is profitable 
and cash generative and provides the 
Group with a strong platform. Around 89% 
of unlicensed medicines and special 
obtains volumes supplied into the retail and 
wholesale pharmacy markets are under 
exclusive supply contracts with customers. 
Key developments
• Unlicensed medicines and special obtains 
volumes grew moderately despite market 
and competitive pressure.
• Sales volumes of imported licensed 
medicines into the hospital sector 
also grew.
• New five-year contract extension signed 
with AAH Pharmaceuticals Limited, the 
UK’s leading pharmaceutical wholesaler.
• Contract renewals with Phoenix 
Healthcare Distribution Limited and 
Bestway Panacea Healthcare Limited 
(trading as Well Pharmacy) also secured 
on a long-term basis after the year-end.
• Contract manufacturing business 
NuPharm closed following a period of 
sustained trading losses, which resulted 
in a £13.7m loss on discontinued 
operations shown in the consolidated 
income statement (see page 46).
The Niche Pharmaceuticals division uses  
the excellent visibility of trends in the UK 
pharmacy and hospital markets gained 
through the Specials division to supplement 
external market data analysis, allowing early 
identification of opportunities to take products 
from unlicensed-to-licensed status (‘UL2L ’).
The division has a growing portfolio and 
pipeline of UL2L products, as well as 
complementary larger niche generic products 
across a number of therapeutic areas that  
the Group aims to commercialise either 
independently or in partnership with other 
pharmaceutical businesses.
Key developments
• Launched a number of products during 
the year and post year-end, including 
Glycopyrronium Bromide Oral Solution 
1mg/5ml, the Group’s first major 
UL2L launch.
• All UL2L products in the current pipeline 
now in active development.
• Profitability profile of the division 
transformed through trading growth  
and elimination of costs supporting 
underperforming product lines that have 
been discontinued during the year. Turn 
to the Chief Executive Officer’s review 
on page 10 for further details.
The Medication Adherence division 
provides the Group with direct access  
to the homecare market.
Key developments
• Strong growth in homecare and  
fertility volumes, particularly following 
commencement of a major contract 
with the Yorkshire and Humber NHS 
Pharmaceutical Purchasing Consortium.
• Following development of the Group’s 
focused and simplified strategy (details 
of which are explained on pages 18 and 
19), a strategic review of the Medication 
Adherence division has commenced.

Chairman’s statement
Strongly positioned 
for success
I am pleased to introduce the 
Group’s Annual Report and 
Accounts for the year ended  
31 January 2017 (‘FY17’). FY17 
has been a year of significant 
change where some difficult but 
ultimately necessary decisions 
have been made to put the 
Group on a path to realising its 
considerable potential.
Despite having only been Chairman since 
October 2016, it is already clear to me that the 
Group benefits from a first-class infrastructure 
and talented workforce who are committed  
to upholding the highest standards of quality  
and service as the Group strives to deliver  
on its strategy.
Although we announced in October 2016 that 
the expected FY17 outturn would be lower 
than previously anticipated, I am pleased to 
report that the Group has delivered on the 
revised forecast of £10.1m adjusted EBITDA. 
Revenue grew by 28% to £88.8m and the 
Group’s net debt position was substantially 
reduced to £13.0m following a £15.0m equity 
fundraise that was completed in November 
2016. I am grateful for the continued support 
and confidence shown by our major 
shareholders in the Group’s prospects that 
this considerable fundraise serves to highlight.
Focused and simplified strategy
The premise on which the Company listed  
on AIM in December 2014 remains intact.  
The Group is seeking to leverage its market-
leading position in the manufacture, procurement 
and supply of unlicensed medicines (‘specials’) 
and special obtains in the UK and use it  
as a platform to license and commercialise  
a pipeline of the top specials.
The Group is therefore closely aligned to  
the Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency’s (‘MHRA’) aim of reducing 
clinical risk by subjecting medicines to the 
licensing process and effectively moving  
them up the UK prescribing hierarchy.  
The component parts of the hierarchy  
are more fully explained on page 6.
Much of the Group’s strategy over the past 
five years has been to equip itself with the 
capabilities needed to fully address this 
hierarchy through both organic growth and 
selective acquisitions.
Quantum Pharmaceutical is now the market 
leader in the UK for the manufacture and 
supply of specials and special obtains; UL 
Medicines is number two in the UK market for 
sourcing and supplying imported medicines 
licensed abroad; Lamda is a leading specialist 
development, formulation and licensing 
business capable of guiding products through 
the licensing process; and Colonis is an expert 
product development and commercialisation 
business equipped to take unlicensed-to-
licensed (‘UL2L ’) products to market. These 
components are in place, are fully integrated 
and are key to future growth.
We must now focus on what we do well. 
Some of the Group’s difficulties this year are 
rooted in persevering with products where  
it has not been first to market. The sales and 
marketing capability needed to successfully 
launch products into such a marketplace  
is considerable and the expertise needed  
to compete effectively against incumbent 
product offerings is not a core competency  
of the Group. It would require substantial 
investment and time in advance of securing 
meaningful revenues for the Group to build 
this capability. 5
Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report 
The essence of the Group’s focused and 
simplified strategy is therefore to prioritise and 
concentrate its own launch efforts on UL2L 
products where it has first-mover advantage, 
and on larger niche generic non-UL2L 
products where there is a market opportunity. 
Meanwhile, we will seek to partner with 
businesses who specialise in marketing other 
types of non-UL2L products to fulfil the 
potential of the remainder of the portfolio.
The launch of Glycopyrronium Bromide Oral 
Solution 1mg/5ml (‘Glyco’) in August 2016 is a 
blueprint for the type of UL2L development and 
launch that is now our priority. I am encouraged 
by the way we executed on the launch and that 
Glyco’s sales performance has subsequently 
been in line with our pre-launch estimates. This 
bodes well for future UL2L launches and I am 
excited by some of the products in our pipeline 
that display similar characteristics to Glyco in 
terms of our estimate of their market opportunity.
The Group has also taken action this year  
to remove distractions and address 
underperforming businesses. The most 
significant example of these is NuPharm, 
which ceased trading in January 2017 
following a period of sustained operating 
losses. Although this decision was taken  
with great regret, the profitability profile of  
the Group is much stronger as a result and 
management are now wholly focused on 
growing the core Specials and Niche divisions.
It is critically important that all our resources 
and efforts are geared towards making our 
focused and simplified strategy a success  
and that there are no other distractions.
Corporate governance
The Board values corporate governance highly 
and believes that it is integral to the delivery  
of the Group’s strategy, to the generation of 
shareholder value and to the safeguarding  
of the long-term interests of its stakeholders.
As Chairman, I am responsible for the 
leadership of the Board and for ensuring its 
effectiveness in all aspects of this role. The 
Board is responsible for the Group’s strategic 
development, monitoring and achievement of 
its business objectives, oversight of risk and 
maintaining a system of effective corporate 
governance. More information about our 
corporate governance controls and processes 
is contained within the Directors’ report 
starting on page 28.
Board changes
During the year we announced a number of 
changes to the Board. Following the 
resignation of Martin Such as Chief Financial 
Officer (‘CFO’) on 7 March 2016, Chris Rigg 
was appointed as his replacement.
On 12 July 2016 Andrew Scaife tendered his 
resignation as Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) 
and left his role on 29 July 2016 following 
which Chris Rigg was appointed Acting  
CEO on 1 August 2016. Chris was appointed 
permanent CEO on 19 October 2016 
alongside a new Board comprising myself, 
Dr John Brown as Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director and Christopher Mills 
as Non-executive Director. John Clarke and 
Sheila Kelly resigned from their roles as 
Non-executive Chairman and Non-executive 
Director respectively.
Gerard Murray was appointed CFO on 
23 January 2017, succeeding Chris Rigg,  
who had been performing both roles since 
1 August 2016.
Dividend
The Board has proposed not to pay a final 
dividend for FY17 as the Group intends to 
reinvest its profits to progress development  
of the product pipeline as rapidly as possible.
Our employees and stakeholders
We rely on the skills, experience and 
commitment of our team to drive the business 
forward. Their enthusiasm, innovation and 
perseverance remain key assets of the Group 
and are critical for its future success. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all  
of our employees, customers, suppliers and 
stakeholders for their continued support over 
the last year. 
Summary
This year’s results draw a line under the past 
performance of the Group. They mark the 
transition to a more focused and simplified 
business led by a new Board, and demonstrate 
real progress in executing our strategy. The 
Board is confident in the future prospects of 
the Group and we look forward to reporting on 
further strategic progress as we move forward.

prospects of the Group and we look

Market review
The prescribing hierarchy
The UK prescribing hierarchy aims to 
maximise patient safety by placing medicines 
into a series of risk categories. Licensed 
medicines sit at the top of the hierarchy as 
they have been subjected to the most rigorous 
review and testing by a regulator as part  
of a licensing process, and other types of 
medicines then follow in order of their relative 
risk to patients and prescribers.
Licensed medicines
The Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency (‘MHRA’) is the government 
body responsible for the regulation of medicinal 
products in the UK. One of the MHRA’s key 
responsibilities is the evaluation and approval 
of medicinal products for use.
Pharmaceutical companies obtain approval to 
market a product by applying for a marketing 
authorisation (‘product licence’). A product 
licence may be granted if an applicant can 
demonstrate a medicine is safe and effective 
in addressing a specific clinical need and can 
be manufactured to a high level of quality. 
Approvals are given with specific reference  
to a medicine’s formulation, strength and  
form (e.g. tablet or liquid) and for a particular 
clinical indication.
Licensed medicines are the preferred choice 
of prescribers because their safety, efficacy 
and quality have been reviewed by a recognised 
regulatory authority and so represent the 
lowest risk to patients and prescribers. In 
2015, licensed medicines represented over 
99% of the £9.8bn per annum community 
prescription market in England and Wales
1
.
Unlicensed medicines (‘specials’)
Prescribers sometimes need to administer  
a medicine that is not licensed because  
a patient may, for example, need a weaker 
dose or is unable to swallow a medicine in  
its licensed form. If a prescriber cannot treat  
a patient with a medicine licensed in the UK 
they may look to prescribe a special.
Specials include:
• imported medicines licensed in another 
country by a regulatory body equivalent  
to the MHRA;
• different forms, such as converting a tablet 
to a liquid;
• bespoke strengths;
• unusual formulations; and
• discontinued licensed products.
In 2015, the community specials prescriptions 
market in England and Wales
 2
 was worth over 
£80m
3
 per annum, representing less than 1% of 
all community prescriptions in those locations
 4
.
Since the introduction of a reimbursement tariff 
in 2011 to drive down the cost of specials, which 
presently affects some but not all specials lines, 
the value of the market has consistently fallen 
year-on-year.
This is partly the result of a reduction in the 
mean cost of sourcing and manufacturing 
specials but also reflects products moving  
from an unlicensed-to-licensed status, at which 
point they are no longer classified as a special.

Unlicensed-to-licensed
Although a special manufactured in an 
MHRA-approved facility is inherently made  
to a high standard, licensed medicines remain 
the lowest risk and preferred choice of 
prescribers, placing them at the top of the 
prescribing hierarchy.
Pharmaceutical companies typically pursue 
product licences for products in the strength, 
formulation and form that addresses the 
clinical needs of a patient group offering the 
highest chance of regulatory success, leaving 
the more difficult-to-license derivatives 
as specials.
These difficulties are often linked to the atypical 
needs of the other patient groups and the 
associated challenges in demonstrating 
safety, efficacy and quality.
This creates opportunities for businesses that 
are not only able to identify and understand 
the markets for these specials, but also 
overcome the developmental challenges 
associated with obtaining a product licence 
for them.
Our market opportunity
The Group operates in a number of markets, 
serving community pharmacies, pharmaceutical 
wholesalers and hospitals across the UK.  
The Group occupies a leading position in 
these markets that offers early visibility over, 
and insight into, specials prescribing trends, 
helping it to understand the dynamics around 
those products with the highest demand.
The Group is therefore well-placed to identify 
products with growth potential where there 
could be licensing opportunities, as well as 
being alert to other products that may be 
in decline.
The prescribing hierarchy and the pathway 
from unlicensed-to-licensed status offers the 
Group an opportunity to leverage its strengths 
to protect and grow its existing market share 
of specials, where around 93%
 5
 of spend  
is concentrated in only 500 product lines.
This opportunity is compelling when viewed  
in the context of the drive to find savings 
across the UK’s National Health Service 
(‘NHS’), which is creating pricing pressure 
within the specials market and increasing 
competitiveness amongst specials providers.
The Group’s positioning and business model 
means it benefits from a number of key 
advantages and competencies that are 
explained further on pages 8 and 9. The 
Group’s focused and simplified strategy is  
also described on pages 18 and 19.

Strategic report 
Specials
Established and market-leading
The Specials division, which includes 
Quantum Pharmaceutical Limited (‘QPL ’)  
and UL Medicines Limited (‘ULM’), occupies  
a market-leading position that provides the 
Group with insight into prescribing trends 
across a large swathe of the specials market.
The Specials division’s offering is customer-
focused and differentiated on quality and 
service. QPL works to some of the shortest 
lead times in the industry, manufacturing and 
delivering bespoke, unlicensed medication in 
as little as 15 hours. It benefits from state-of-
the-art production facilities, warehousing  
and dispensary capabilities, along with the 
expertise of a highly-skilled and committed 
team of pharmacists, laboratory technicians 
and quality specialists. The division’s imported 
medicines business ULM has a truly global 
reach with access to a range of more than  
500 imported lines sourced from more than 
24 countries.
The Specials division’s reputation for reliability 
and quality has helped it to build long-term 
relationships with several key customers  
that are underpinned by exclusive supply 
contracts. Approximately 89% of QPL ’s order 
volumes are generated from customers with 
whom it has an exclusive supply agreement 
covering the supply of specials and special 
obtains. Whilst these agreements do not 
guarantee order volumes they nevertheless 
create stability and provide visibility over a 
large proportion of the revenue potential of the 
Specials division in the short-to-medium term.
Niche Pharmaceuticals
In-house development, regulatory  
and commercialisation expertise
The Niche Pharmaceuticals division, which 
includes Colonis Pharma Limited (‘Colonis’) 
and Lamda Laboratories SA (‘Lamda’),  
is focused on developing, licensing and 
commercialising currently unlicensed 
products. Work to identify and monitor the 
market potential for these products draws 
upon data and insight generated in the 
Specials division.
Lamda, based in Athens, Greece, has sole 
responsibility for managing the development  
and regulatory approval process. Its current 
focus is on UK-unlicensed product opportunities, 
where the division benefits from significant 
knowledge and experience of the Medicines 
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s 
(‘MHRA’) approval process.
If a development is successful and is  
granted a marketing authorisation (‘product 
licence’), Colonis is responsible for taking  
the product to market, either by selling  
directly to wholesalers or through partnerships 
with other pharmaceutical distributors.  
Colonis manages a number of important 
aspects of the go-to-market model, including 
the supply chain, packaging, quality and 
pharmacovigilance, whilst the Specials 
division supports on warehousing 
and distribution.
Growth opportunities
Unlicensed-to-licensed
The Group has an opportunity to both 
preserve and grow its UK market share  
by taking a pipeline of unlicensed products 
through the regulatory pathway in order  
to license and commercialise them.
The Group is differentiated in this endeavour 
by being able to combine the strong market 
position and industry relationships secured 
through its established Specials division  
with the in-house product development  
and regulatory approval expertise in its 
Niche division.
Successfully developing, licensing and 
commercialising the product pipeline offers 
the Group the chance to not only protect  
the existing market share of the Specials 
business, which operates in an environment  
of intense competition and price regulation, 
but also potentially unlock the rest of the UK 
market for those products where it succeeds 
in being the first licensed provider. Whilst this 
is a growth opportunity for the Group it will 
also mean lower-risk medicines for patients 
and healthcare professional alongside 
potentially creating the economies of scale 
required to bring down the cost of these 
medicines to the healthcare sector.
The Group’s existing UK presence means  
it is well-placed to deliver on the potential  
of its licensed product portfolio in this market. 
However, the Group is also focusing on 
opportunities in other geographical markets 
and is working to broaden its network  
of international commercial, import and 
distribution partnerships with this in mind.
For more information on the Group’s strategy, 
which is seeking to better leverage the 
Group’s strengths, along with developments 
this year, turn to pages 18 and 19.
The Group’s focus centres upon 
the manufacture, procurement and 
supply of unlicensed medicines 
(‘specials’) and special obtains to UK 
pharmacy chains, pharmaceutical 
wholesalers and hospitals, and on 
leveraging the product licensing 
opportunities offered by this market. 10

Chief Executive Officer’s review
Focusing and simplifying 
around our best growth 
opportunities
The impact of the actions taken to confront 
the challenges we have faced leave the  
Group with a clean balance sheet and  
a leaner operating structure on which we 
intend to build and grow. The Group’s 
profitability run-rate has been materially 
improved and we are now well-placed  
to take advantage of existing and future 
opportunities within our core businesses. 
The Specials division (‘Specials’) remains 
profitable and cash generative, providing a 
strong platform for our development programme 
that is predominantly focused on unlicensed-to-
licensed (‘UL2L ’) products. The trading 
performance of the Niche Pharmaceuticals 
division (‘Niche’) has been transformed by the 
successful launch of a number of products 
during the year and post year-end, including  
our largest product to date Glycopyrronium 
Bromide Oral Solution 1mg/5ml (‘Glyco’), and 
the elimination of on-going losses, unnecessary 
costs and marginal activities. In addition, the 
drive to grow our network of commercial 
partnerships is showing clear signs of progress. 
Our focus on the two core pillars of Specials  
and Niche will continue to drive 
performance improvement.
The long-term fit of the Medication Adherence 
(‘MA’) division within the Group, particularly 
given its low gross margin contribution,  
is under review.
A focused and simplified strategy
Following the conclusion of a strategic review 
performed during the year, we have refocused 
and simplified the business to:
• Closely align our business model to the UK 
prescribing hierarchy by moving products 
from an unlicensed-to-licensed status.
• Maintain market-leading position in the 
specials market whilst we progress the 
development and licensing of products  
in our pipeline where we have a 
competitive advantage.
• Invest in our UL2L development 
programme to license key unlicensed 
specials so that we can protect and grow 
our market share and secure economies 
of scale.
• Broaden our network of commercial 
partnerships to secure multiple routes  
to market for our product portfolio.
UL2L prioritisation
Prioritising our UL2L product developments 
delivered through Niche, emphasising those 
products where we can be first to market,  
is a key part of our strategy. This type of 
development plays to our strengths, with  
less time and investment needed to penetrate 
the market and achieve scale.
Having simplified the product portfolio to 
prioritise development of the Group’s top 
specials licensing opportunities, it currently 
comprises 57 products. 19 of these products 
have been launched or out-licensed in the UK, 
with 12 having been commercialised 
post-simplification. The overall performance  
of these products since simplification has 
been very good, with the benefits of portfolio 
rationalisation evident. A further 3 products 
have been licensed in the UK and are in the 
process of being commercialised. There are 
an additional 35 products in various phases  
of development, of which 25 are UL2L 
developments. All developments are currently 
progressing to timetable. Going forward we 
I am pleased to report that  
the Group has made excellent 
progress in implementing its 
more focused and simplified 
strategy and that our 
performance in the second  
half of the year was very 
encouraging. 11
Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report 
will provide updates with respect to our 
licensed product portfolio as part of our 
interim and final results communications.
In order to release investment capacity  
to support UL2L prioritisation we have 
cancelled all development programmes where 
we cannot identify a commercial partnership 
and do not believe we can commercialise the 
opportunity ourselves. As a consequence, 
£7.2m of balance sheet investment in these 
products has been impaired, which is a key 
constituent of the reported statutory 
operating loss.
Broadening our commercial partnerships
Our non-UL2L portfolio is comprised of niche 
generic products where, although we will not 
have first-mover advantage and significant 
sales and marketing capability will likely be 
required to market them, we believe there 
remains a market opportunity.
Past experience tells us that taking share  
from incumbent competitors can be very 
challenging without an existing sales and 
marketing capability, and that converting 
these non-UL2L opportunities takes time  
and significant investment unless there is  
an established market presence.
We have therefore taken steps to commercialise 
selected non-UL2L products in our portfolio 
by partnering with other businesses that have 
more experience of taking generic products  
to market, which will help us to commercialise 
these developments to their fullest potential 
and accelerate our access to revenues through 
revenue-sharing agreements. We are progressing 
partnerships to support this strategy.
International opportunities
Our product pipeline holds significant value 
potential. In the UK market, the Group is 
well-established due to its existing infrastructure 
and commercial relationships built through our 
market-leading Specials division. We also 
have extensive experience and understanding 
of the UK’s development and regulatory 
approval process as governed by the MHRA 
through the activities of our Niche division. Our 
strategic position in the UK is therefore strong.
We are currently seeking to realise the 
potential of our product portfolio beyond  
the UK and extend our reach into other 
geographies by broadening our network  
of international commercial partnerships. 
These partnerships will seek to emphasise 
both export and localised manufacture 
together with distribution opportunities to 
secure market access without the need  
to establish our own local presence.
Consolidating our position  
in the specials market
Our Specials division continues to perform 
robustly and reliably, and is cash generative. 
This resilient performance is particularly 
encouraging given the increasing competitiveness 
and regulatory pressure within the specials 
market. We have cemented our market-
leading position by agreeing new long-term 
exclusive supply contracts with three of the 
largest UK wholesale and pharmacy chains, 
being AAH Pharmaceuticals Limited, Bestway 
Panacea Healthcare Limited, trading as 
Well Pharmacy, and Phoenix Healthcare 
Distribution Limited. Quantum Pharmaceutical 
Limited, a business within the Specials 
division, is the UK market leader in the supply 
of unlicensed medicines and around 89% of 
its volumes are under exclusive contracts.
Our attention is now turning to driving 
operational efficiencies and improvements in 
the Specials division to underpin profitability 
and provide us with the commercial agility 
necessary to react to market dynamics.

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
NuPharm closure
Following a period of sustained trading losses, 
the Board took the decision in October 2016 
to commence consultation on the closure of 
NuPharm. Trading ceased at NuPharm in 
January 2017 in line with our stated intention 
and it was placed into administration on 
26 April 2017 following an orderly 
closure process.
The total loss incurred on the closure of 
NuPharm is £13.7m, which reflects trading 
losses and closure costs of £1.7m, and 
£12.0m of written down balance sheet 
investment. This loss is shown as a 
discontinued operation in the consolidated 
income statement as NuPharm’s activities as 
a contract manufacturer are considered to be 
a separate major line of business. The cash 
impact of NuPharm’s trading losses and 
closure costs during the year was £2.4m.
Divisional review
Niche Pharmaceuticals division (‘Niche’)
The financial year ended 31 January 2017  
has been a pivotal year for the Niche division 
following the launch of a number of new 
products, the most significant of which has 
been Glycopyrronium Bromide Oral Solution 
1mg/5ml (‘Glyco’), and substantial operational 
changes to focus and simplify the business  
in line with our strategy.
Revenue grew 35% during the year to  
£5.8m (2016: £4.3m), driven primarily by the 
contribution from Glyco following its launch  
in August 2016. Adjusted EBITDA contracted 
by 33% to £1.4m (2016: £2.1m) with Glyco’s 
trading contribution offset by a reduction  
in out-licensing income of £0.5m and an 
increased operating cost base that has now 
been addressed.
The adjusted EBITDA monthly run-rate  
of Colonis Pharma Limited (‘Colonis’), the 
commercialisation arm of the Niche division,  
has been transformed during the second half  
of the year. During the first half of the year 
Colonis had invested ahead of meaningful sales 
activity to support the launch of a number of 
products in the portfolio where we needed 
engagement with healthcare professionals.
Following the decision to prioritise UL2L 
developments a number of underperforming 
product lines were discontinued, including the 
Mucodis range and Ergocalciferol 50,000 IU. 
This decision has allowed the division to focus 
investment on what it believes are the right 
products and stop on-going investment in the 
discontinued products, yielding significant 
savings. Colonis therefore exited the year with 
a positive monthly adjusted EBITDA run-rate, 
underpinned by strong contributions from 
Glyco alongside a number of other launched 
products, and a lower cost base.
In addition to Glyco, we launched several 
other products during the second half of  
the year and just after the year-end, which  
are delivering in line with management 
expectations. These include:
• Aviticol
™
 and Colecalciferol capsules 
(licensed for the treatment and prevention 
of vitamin D deficiency) in an 800 IU 
strength in July 2016 and 1,000 IU strength 
in August 2016;
• Metformin Oral Solution (licensed for  
the treatment of type 2 diabetes) in 
500mg/5ml, 850mg/5ml and 1,000mg/5ml 
strengths in December 2016; 
• Folic Acid Oral Solution 1mg/1ml (licensed 
for the treatment of folate deficiency) and 
Acetylcysteine Sachets 200mg (licensed  
as a mucolytic) during February and  
March post year-end; and
• Levothyroxine Oral Solution (indicated  
for hyperthyroidism) in 25mcg/5ml, 
50mcg/5ml and 100mcg/5ml strengths 
launched in April 2017.
Lamda Laboratories SA (‘Lamda’), the product 
development and licensing arm of the Niche 
division, delivered another good performance. 
The development pipeline is now fully integrated 
at Lamda, absorbing around 60% of Lamda’s 
total development capacity this year. The 
business has also continued to generate strong 
development, supply and royalty revenue from  
a range of third-party projects.
Specials division (‘Specials’)
The Specials division delivered another solid 
performance during the year, generating 89%  
of the Group’s adjusted EBITDA before Group 
costs. The division provides a strong platform  
for our product development and licensing 
activities, as well as valuable insights into trends 
within the specials market that we use to inform 
our new product development decisions.
Revenue increased by 7% to £57.6m  
(2016: £53.6m) and adjusted EBITDA 
contracted by 6% to £10.1m (2016: £10.7m). 
Sales order volumes in Quantum 
Pharmaceutical Limited (‘QPL ’) increased by 
6%, supported by volumes gained as a result 
of the acquisition of 281 Sainsbury’s stores  
by Lloyds Pharmacy in September. This was 
partly offset by the impact of our licensing of 
Glyco in August 2016, which cannibalised 
some existing specials sales.
The drive to secure efficiency savings across 
the NHS continues to create pricing pressures 
and changes to prescribing trends in favour  
of more cost-effective medicines. We are 
seeing this most notably through a gradual 
shift towards prescription of tariff medicines  
in place of clinically equivalent but sometimes 
more expensive non-tariff alternatives. This has 
been a feature of the industry for a number  
of years and we are continuing to manage  
this dynamic through a variety of initiatives, 
including margin improvement through the 
manufacture of more products in-house as 
opposed to external sourcing.
QPL was also successful in retaining all  
major key accounts during the year, including 
securing a five-year exclusive supply relationship 
with our largest customer, AAH Pharmaceuticals 
Limited, which supplies over 1,800 Lloyds 
Pharmacy stores and 8,000 independents  13
Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report 
across the UK. Post the year-end we entered 
into long-term exclusive supply agreements 
with Bestway Panacea Healthcare Limited, 
trading as Well Pharmacy, and Phoenix 
Healthcare Distribution Limited, who supply 
Rowlands pharmacies, for two and three 
years respectively. Securing these agreements 
mean we supply three out of the four largest 
national pharmacy chains in the UK on an 
exclusive basis, satisfying all of their 
unlicensed medicine and special obtain 
demand. Around 89% of our specials and 
special obtains sales volumes in QPL are 
sourced from customers with whom we have 
an exclusive supply relationship, providing  
us with good visibility over our future 
revenue potential.
UL Medicines Limited, which primarily serves 
the hospitals sector, exited the year strongly 
following a softer first half. The business 
continues to consolidate its position as one of 
the leading suppliers of unlicensed imported 
medicines to the NHS. Following the result of 
the EU referendum in June 2016, the business 
has faced challenges relating to the impact  
of Sterling weakness on the cost of imported 
lines, however underlying hospital volumes are 
growing and the business has benefited from 
temporary supply opportunities following 
shortages of licensed products. 
Medication Adherence division (‘MA’)
The MA division comprises Total Medication 
Management Services Limited (trading as 
‘Biodose Services’), a homecare dispensary 
and delivery business, and Protomed Limited, 
which provides medication management 
services through Biodose, its innovative 
multi-dose tray system. Divisional revenue 
increased by 125% to £25.4m (2016: £11.3m), 
driven by Biodose Services, which secured a 
number of new homecare contracts and saw 
continued growth in the Stork Fertility Service 
(‘Stork’). The division delivered an adjusted 
EBITDA loss in the year of £0.2m (2016: £0.4m 
profit) overall, however the division was generating 
monthly profits as it exited the year.
The significant revenue base in the MA 
division is due to Biodose Services and the 
inherent characteristics of its homecare 
business model. The business model requires 
high-value medicines to be dispensed and 
delivered to patients at home, which results  
in high levels of revenue and costs and a low 
gross margin profile.
Trading in Protomed has been steady as  
the number of patients benefiting from the 
multi-dose tray system has remained similar to 
last year. The business has historically sought 
to commercialise Biodose Connect
™
, which  
is an extension of the multi-dose tray system. 
It allows carers and clinicians to remotely 
monitor a patient’s adherence to their 
medication regime. It has become clear that 
Biodose Connect
™
 will require substantial 
further investment to establish it in the 
domiciliary care market, which is no longer  
a core area of focus for the Group.
Following our decision to focus our efforts  
on our core Specials and Niche businesses, 
we have commenced a strategic review of the 
MA division to conclude on its long-term fit 
within the Group.
Summary and outlook
I am very pleased with the progress we  
have made to date. We have driven a step 
change in the profitability of the Niche 
Pharmaceuticals division in the second half  
by focusing on launching and commercialising 
products where we have a competitive 
advantage. In addition, the Group has 
cemented its position as the UK’s market-
leading specials business by renewing 
exclusive contracts with three of the four main 
wholesale and pharmacy chains in the UK. 
Operating costs across the Group have been 
reduced and our net debt position at the 
year-end was lower than expected at £13.0m. 
We exited the financial year with a much 
improved profitability run-rate that is 
supportive of market expectations for the 
current financial year and we are well-placed 
to deliver future growth by focusing on our 
core Niche and Specials businesses.

Group performance
The Group performance is summarised  
in the following measures:
• revenue increased by 28% to £88.8m 
(2016: £69.2m);
• gross profit remained flat at £25.9m  
(2016: £25.9m);
• gross margin declined to 29.2%  
(2016: 37.4%);
• adjusted EBITDA declined to £10.1m  
(2016: £12.5m);
• loss before tax of £10.9m  
(2016: £6.7m profit);
• capitalised development expenditure  
of £4.0m was incurred (2016: £6.4m); and
• net debt reduced by almost half to  
£13.0m (2016: £24.6m).
Revenue
Revenue by division (£m) 2017 2016
Specials 57.6 53.6
Niche 5.8 4.3
Medication Adherence 25.4 11.3
Group 88.8 69.2
Group revenue grew by 28% to £88.8m  
(2016: £69.2m), primarily as a result of the 
revenue growth delivered in the Medication 
Adherence (‘MA’) division of £14.1m, 
representing 72% of the Group’s total revenue 
increase of £19.6m. The balance of the 
Group’s revenue growth of £5.5m was 
represented by the Specials division  
(£4.0m) and the Niche Pharmaceuticals 
(‘Niche’) division (£1.5m).
The Specials division delivered a strong 
performance during the year. It operates in a 
challenging market that is subject to regulated 
pricing across some of the division’s product 
range. Despite these challenges, however, 
unlicensed medicines and special obtains 
volumes grew by 6% and demand for bespoke, 
aseptically-prepared specials also drove growth. 
The Niche division licensed and launched 
Glycopyrronium Bromide Oral Solution 
1mg/5ml (‘Glyco’) in the UK in August 2016,  
its first UL2L product with meaningful volume. 
Following the licensing of Glyco, other specials 
manufacturers of the medicine in the UK  
were required to cease supplying the market, 
making the Group the only licensed supplier at 
launch. The launch of Glyco is the main driver 
behind the Niche division’s revenue growth of 
35%, albeit this growth is on a low base. 
The MA division exited the care home sector 
in the prior financial year to focus on pursuing 
alternative dispensing contract opportunities 
in the homecare sector. This revised strategy 
has been implemented successfully resulting 
in a number of important contracts with large 
pharmaceutical companies and NHS Trusts 
being secured during the financial year. The 
characteristic of this business is that the 
revenue recognised relates to the value of the 
medicines being dispensed, which generates 
a high level of revenue in this division and low 
levels of gross profit.
Gross profit
Despite the increase in Group revenue,  
gross profit was unchanged at £25.9m  
(2016: £25.9m) leading to a reduced gross profit 
margin of 29.2% (2016: 37 .4%). This reduction is 
the result of the divisional revenue mix changing 
year-on-year and, in particular, the increase in 
lower margin homecare contracts in the MA 
division. The gross profit margin in the core 
Specials business remained stable.
The cumulative financial impact 
of the Group’s transition over  
the past financial year saw 
significant benefits to the 
underlying profitability run-rate 
although this resulted in 
substantial non-recurring and 
non-operational charges arising 
from discontinued operations, 
impairment of product 
developments and costs 
incurred in implementing the 
simplified strategy.  15

operational issues that needed to be 
addressed. Despite additional investment by 
the Group and the dedication of management 
time since its acquisition, NuPharm suffered 
trading losses.
The Board concluded that it would take 
unacceptable additional investment, further 
cash losses and management time to address 
the operational issues and that NuPharm was 
not capable of becoming earnings-enhancing. 
Consequently the Board took the decision to 
proceed with a closure plan for NuPharm and 
trading ceased in January 2017. Following  
an orderly closure process NuPharm was 
placed into administration on 26 April 2017. 
NuPharm’s results are included along with  
the impairment of its associated intangible 
assets and closure costs within the loss  
from discontinued operations of £13.7m  
(2016: £0.3m) shown in the consolidated 
income statement as it represents a separate

£0.8m (2016: £0.1m); and excluding a loss  
on discontinued operations of £13.7m  
(2016: £0.3m). The contraction in adjusted 
EBITDA was evenly spread across all of the 
Group’s divisions. Notable drivers include  
a year-on-year reduction in out-licensing 
revenue, an increased operating cost base in 
the first half and underperformance in certain 
areas of the business during a period of 
substantive change. Management actions 
taken during the second half of the financial 
year, particularly in the Niche division, have 
successfully addressed a number of these 
underperformance issues.
Non-recurring or non-operational items 
include a charge of £2.0m (2016: £1.5m)  
of deferred consideration for the Lamda 
acquisition, £1.1m (2016: £nil) for Board 
restructuring and a £2.7m loss (2016: £nil) 
relating to the Niche reorganisation and 
discontinuation of products where 
management do not believe the Group  
has a strategic market advantage.
Discontinued operation
In July 2015 the Group acquired NuPharm 
Laboratories Limited (‘NuPharm’), a small-
scale batch-made specials manufacturer, 
which was intended to provide the Group with 
an internal capability to batch manufacture 
both unlicensed and licensed medicines.  
At the time of acquisition NuPharm was under 
MHRA manufacturing restrictions. Following 
acquisition the Group encountered further  16

from discontinued operations of £13.7m  
(2016: £0.3m) and from continuing operations 
of £9.1m (2016: £5.9m profit). The statutory 
loss from continuing operations includes a 
number of non-recurring and non-operational 
costs associated with the transition to a more

Operating cash flow
The Group generated net cash inflows from 
continuing operating activities of £6.1m  
(2016: £7.9m) from a loss after tax for the year 
of £9.1m (2016: £5.9m profit). The loss after 
tax from continuing operations includes 
non-cash charges relating to depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment of £12.9m (2016: 
£1.6m). These non-cash charges explain why 
the Group’s net cash inflows from operating 
activities in the current year are only £1.8m 
lower than the prior year. The other contributing 
factor is the improved working capital controls 
that have been implemented during the year. 
Net cash inflows from working capital during  
the year were £2.6m compared to £0.7m net 
outflows in 2016. 
Discontinued operations incurred net cash 
outflows from operating activities of £2.2m 
(2016: £0.9m). 
Investment
During the year the Group’s capitalised 
development expenditure was £4.0m (2016: 
£6.4m) with development activities now focused 
on a clearly defined set of products aligned with 
the Group’s strategy. At the same time all of the 
Group’s development projects with the 
exception of one have been transferred from a 
portfolio of third-party contracted development 
organisations to Lamda to improve efficiency of 
execution and measurement of progress.

Net debt 13.0 24.6
Net debt was better than expected, reducing 
by 47% to £13.0m (2016: £24.6m), and 
comprised borrowings net of unamortised 
loan issue costs of £20.9m (2016: £28.8m) 
and cash and cash equivalents of £7.9m 
(2016: £4.2m). This was mainly due to the 
successful completion of a £15.0m (before 
expenses) equity fundraise in November 2016 
and tighter working capital management 
across the year.
During the prior year, the Group agreed new 
banking facilities with RBS and Lloyds that 
increased overall debt facilities to £35.0m 
comprising a £25.0m term loan plus £10.0m 
revolving credit facility, which was undrawn  
at the year-end.
Dividend
The Board has decided not to declare a 
dividend in respect of the current financial 
year (2016: 1.5 pence per share).

Metric Description Why we use it
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is statutory operating profit 
excluding:
• depreciation and impairments of tangible 
non-current assets;
• amortisation and impairments of intangible 
non-current assets; 
• items that management judge to be one-off  
or non-operational; and
• acquisition-related items.
A reconciliation is set out on page 15.
Adjusted EBITDA is profitability stated before  
the non-cash accounting impact of depreciation, 
amortisation, impairments and share based 
payments, and excludes the potentially distorting 
effects of non-recurring and non-operational items. 
This is the measure management use internally  
to assess the underlying trading performance of  
the business.
Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is adjusted profit after 
tax divided by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the financial year.
Adjusted profit after tax is adjusted EBITDA:
• less depreciation and amortisation;
• less net financing expenses; 
• plus the Group’s share of profit of equity-
accounted investees, net of tax;
• includes an accrued charge or credit for 
corporation tax on taxable profits; and
• includes movement in provisions for 
deferred tax.
All adjustments made to adjusted EBITDA  
as set out in the definition above are net of tax 
where applicable.
A reconciliation to earnings per share is provided  
in Note 10 to the financial statements on page 62.
Adjusted earnings per share (and the growth  
or contraction versus previous periods) allows 
management to assess the post-tax underlying 
trading performance of the business in combination 
with the impact of capital structuring actions on  
the share base (e.g. as a result of a share issue  
or a share buyback programme).
Net debt Net debt comprises:
• the carrying value of all bank term loans; and
• the carrying value of all drawn revolving credit 
facilities and overdrafts.
Less:
• cash and cash equivalents; and
• unamortised loan issue costs.
All amounts are closing balances as at the relevant 
balance sheet date.
A breakdown of net debt is set out on page 16.
This represents the amount of the Group’s funding 
structure that is provided through debt finance,  
net of cash.

Strategy
OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES DESCRIPTION
Focus and  
simplify
Consolidate  
our market 
position
Partnership
Focus, simplify, 
consolidate and partner
The Group is tightening its focus around developing, licensing and commercialising the top 
unlicensed medicines (‘specials’), which the business is well-positioned to identify through  
its own Specials division.
The Group is prioritising products that it classifies as unlicensed-to-licensed (‘UL2L ’), which  
are those offering first-mover advantage, and the Group will typically take these products  
to market itself. The Group will also take to market larger niche generic non-UL2L products 
where it identifies a market opportunity.
The Group is also looking to partner with other businesses who have experience of 
commercialising non-UL2L products, where maximising their potential typically requires more 
time, investment and marketing expertise.
The Group’s specials product range, which is manufactured from MHRA-licensed facilities, and 
its licensed product portfolio hold significant value potential beyond the UK, which is where the 
Group is currently strongest and well-established.
The Group is working to realise this potential by expanding the addressable market for these 
products through establishing a broader network of international commercial partnerships, with 
a particular focus on exporting and localised manufacture and distribution agreements in order 
to remove the need to build these capabilities internally.
The Specials division occupies a leading position in the specials market, is highly profitable and 
cash generative and benefits from a number of exclusive supply relationships with some of the 
market’s biggest wholesale and pharmacy businesses. It therefore provides a stable platform 
for the Group’s product licensing activities.
In an environment of price regulation and increasing competitiveness it is important to take steps  
to ensure this position is maintained. This strategic priority therefore focuses on actions to preserve 
and reinforce the Group’s advantages and strengths within the specials market, which includes:
• preserving key customer relationships;
• eliminating the cash drain of loss-making operations;
• identifying and delivering on opportunities to improve efficiency and profitability; and
• de-emphasising activities that do not support the long-term growth potential of the Specials 
and Niche divisions. 19

ACTIVITIES
• Strategic review performed in August 2016 to assess the Group’s 
direction, businesses, products and priorities, leading to increased 
focus on UL2L developments in the Niche division.
 
• All UL2L products in the current pipeline moved into active 
development, and a number of non-UL2L products removed 
from the pipeline.
• Launched eight new products and out-licensed a further four 
during the year and post year-end, including Glycopyrronium 
Bromide Oral Solution 1mg/5ml, the Group’s first major UL2L 
product launch.
• Discontinued unprofitable product lines within the Niche 
Pharmaceuticals division, allowing management to focus  
on those offering best opportunities for growth.
• New Board appointed to lead and deliver against the strategy.
• On-going trading losses eliminated across the Group, 
supported by the closure of NuPharm, a loss-making  
contract manufacturing business.
• Renewal of exclusive contractual relationship with AAH 
Pharmaceuticals Limited, the Group’s largest specials 
customer, for a further five years.
• Other key renewals occurring post year-end include relationships 
with Phoenix Healthcare Distribution Limited and Bestway 
Panacea Healthcare Limited (trading as Well Pharmacy).
• Significantly reduced the Group’s net debt through successful 
completion of a £15.0m equity fundraise (before expenses) in 
November 2016, providing the Group with increased headroom 
and flexibility going forward.
• Commenced review of the Medication Adherence division to 
consider its long-term fit within the Group.
• Progress in this area is at an early stage. A key first step has 
been to appoint a Chief Commercial Officer to ensure this 
priority is supported by dedicated resource with a clear brief, 
and who will work across divisions to bring together all of the 
Group’s commercial partnership activities. 20

Key performance indicators
The Group’s management team uses various key performance indicators 
(‘KPIs’) to monitor financial and non-financial performance of their business 
units. Below are the measures which the Board believes best indicate the 
performance of the Group as a whole.
All metrics relate to continuing operations unless otherwise stated.
KPI PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT COMMENT
Revenue
£88.8m
Sale of goods and services  
net of value added tax and 
sales-related discounts, 
recognised at point of despatch.
Revenue growth primarily driven 
by high-value new contract wins 
and volume growth in the 
Medication Adherence division, 
new product launches in the 
Niche Pharmaceuticals (‘Niche’)
division and volume growth in 
special obtains. These offset  
a reduction in year-on-year 
out-licensing revenue.
Gross profit
£25.9m
The profit achieved on revenue, 
after taking account of direct costs 
incurred in bringing the goods and 
services to a saleable condition.
Gross profit remained flat 
compared to last year due  
to inclusion of £1.6m of  
one-off costs relating to the 
simplification of the Niche 
division. These costs form part 
of the £2.7m excluded from 
adjusted EBITDA shown in the 
reconciliation on page 15.
Gross margin
29.2%
The percentage profit achieved 
on revenue.
Gross profit margin has reduced 
due to a change in the divisional 
revenue mix year-on-year, 
particularly as a result of the 
increase in lower margin 
homecare contract revenue,  
and the impact of one-off 
simplification costs.
Adjusted 
EBITDA
£10.1m
Turn to page 17 for  
a full description of this  
non-GAAP measure.
Adjusted EBITDA has fallen  
due to a year-on-year reduction 
in out-licensing revenue and 
underperformance issues in 
certain areas of the business 
during a period of substantive 
change that have now been 
addressed. 21

KPI PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT COMMENT
(Loss) 
earnings per 
share from 
continuing 
operations
1
(6.7p)
Statutory profit after tax divided 
by the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the 
financial year.
Earnings per share has fallen 
primarily due to £10.0m of 
impairments and £4.2m of 
non-recurring and non-operational 
items relating to the simplification 
of the Group’s strategy. In addition, 
a £2.0m deferred consideration 
payment for Lamda Laboratories 
SA has been accounted for as 
an expense.
Capitalised 
development  
expenditure
£4.0m
Capitalised development 
expenditure represents 
investment in product 
development activities where 
technical and commercial 
feasibility have been confirmed.
The Group continues to  
invest heavily in its product 
pipeline and will continue to  
do so to ensure developments 
are progressed as quickly  
as possible.
Net debt
£13.0m
Turn to page 17 for  
a full description of this  
non-GAAP measure.
Net debt was substantially 
reduced during the year 
following a £15.0m equity 
fundraise (before expenses)  
and tighter working capital 
management, particularly in the 
Medication Adherence division 
where high-value medicines  
are dispensed.
1. (Loss) earnings per share from continuing operations is calculated using the average number  
of shares in issue for each period. 2017: 134.8m; 2016: 125.0m; 2015: 54.5m. 22

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group maintains a consolidated corporate risk register. This register is reviewed  
and updated quarterly, with each risk assessed against likelihood of occurrence and  
the potential impact of the risk being realised. Mitigation and any necessary action  
plans are also recorded as appropriate. 
The Group takes a proactive approach to the management of risk in order to protect  
the business, and secure growth and value protection for its shareholders. An analysis  
of the key risks identified for 2017 are set out below. 
RISK IMPACT MITIGATION MOVEMENT
Key products
The Group is exposed to a variety of product 
risks. Although the Specials division supplies  
a broad range of products, a material portion  
of the revenue base is derived from a relatively 
small number of key unlicensed medicines 
(‘specials’). These products have been 
prioritised in the Group’s development pipeline. 
In this respect, there is also a risk that 
competitors succeed in licensing those key 
products ahead of the Group, thereby securing 
first-mover advantage. If the Group succeeds  
in licensing products, competitors remain able 
to launch rival alternatives, which could erode 
market share the Group has secured. All of 
these risks have the potential to impact the 
Group’s current and future revenues and 
profitability.
The Group is prioritising unlicensed-to-licensed 
(‘UL2L ’) product developments to increase the 
chances of being first to market, and as the 
pipeline contains a number of products considered 
to be key specials, the Group’s growth and 
consolidation plans do not rely solely on the 
success of any one product to defend its existing 
position or deliver meaningful growth. Many 
specials are also technically challenging to develop 
and license, which can act as a barrier to entry. 
The launch of rival generic products is a feature of 
the industry and being first to market is often key to 
cementing market position. The Group’s exposure 
to the impact of this risk will reduce as more 
products are launched and the licensed product 
portfolio diversifies.
Key customers
The Group has a number of key customers, 
particularly in the Specials business, in markets 
that are highly competitive. There are risks that 
these key customer relationships could come  
to an end for a variety of commercial reasons, 
which would adversely impact Group revenues.
The Group has actively pursued a strategy of 
securing and maintaining multi-year exclusive 
contracts with customers in the Specials division, 
which serves to protect the Group from key 
account losses to competitors. For example, 
contracts with three of the four largest national 
wholesaler and retail pharmacy chains were 
renewed during the year and post year-end. The 
Group also endeavours to be commercially agile  
to respond to evolving customer priorities whilst 
continuing its commitment to market-leading 
service where customers value it.
Regulatory 
clearance
The Group holds certain licences and consents 
from the Medical Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency (‘MHRA’), the Home Office and other 
regulatory bodies. Loss or suspension of any of 
these licences or consents could have a material 
adverse impact on the Group’s performance.
The Group operates under a robust and compliant 
Quality Management System that is verified by 
regulators through frequent routine compliance 
inspections. The Group works hard to develop  
and maintain close, co-operative relationships  
with inspectors at a number of levels within their 
respective organisations. By promoting a culture  
of transparency with inspector partners, the Group 
seeks to ensure that any issues raised by them can 
be solved collaboratively. 
Risk trend
 Increasing Unchanged Decreasing 23

RISK IMPACT MITIGATION MOVEMENT
Marketing 
authorisations 
(‘product 
licences’) for  
new products
Success in the Group’s product development 
and licensing business is dependent on 
achieving licensed status for products in the 
pipeline. If a development fails, product licence 
approval is unsuccessful or the process takes 
longer than expected, the Group’s plans and 
expected returns could be adversely affected.
The Group acquired the Lamda group of 
companies in April 2015. Lamda’s experience and 
expertise is a key competitive advantage for the 
Group and provides greater control over the timing, 
costs and completion of internal development 
projects. The product development pipeline is now 
fully integrated at Lamda.
 
Facilities
Manufacturing and warehouse management are 
key activities of the Group. There is a risk that 
revenue and profit could be impacted should 
any of the Group’s facilities become damaged.
The Group has in place appropriate business 
continuity plans, as well as the necessary 
insurances for damage to property and business 
interruption.
Reputation
The Group is heavily reliant on its reputation  
for quality, reliability, consistency and service. 
Should its reputation for any of these be 
damaged as a result of a failure by the Group 
and/or adverse publicity, this could have a 
negative impact on the Group’s revenues.
The Group operates a robust system of controls 
and processes that underpins the provision of 
products and services to customers. The Group 
also benefits from an in-house Quality function, 
which monitors a range of operational performance 
indicators to drive continuous improvement, 
prevent errors and ensure any issues are resolved 
as quickly as possible. The performance levels of 
businesses providing services on behalf of the 
Group are also regularly reviewed.
Changes  
in legislation,  
drug tariff and 
prescription 
pricing practice
Changes in laws or legislation affecting markets  
in which the Group operates could adversely 
affect revenue and trading profit, and ensuring 
compliance could lead to further costs. The 
decision by the UK to leave the European Union in 
June 2016 may also have legislative and regulatory 
implications that are as yet unknown as the terms 
of the UK’s exit remain under negotiation.
Tariff pricing and the prospect of more products 
being subject to pricing regulation, particularly solid 
dose medication, has been a feature of the industry 
for some time due to an on-going drive by the UK’s 
National Health Service (‘NHS’) to reduce costs.
The Group’s strategy of licensing products and 
achieving scale with a view to driving down the 
cost to the NHS is aligned to overcoming these 
challenges, and the business is nevertheless used 
to adopting strategies to mitigate the impact of 
legislative changes.
Loss of key  
employees
The Group is reliant on the technical and industry 
expertise of key individuals. Loss of these 
individuals could impact on the Group’s ability  
to deliver on the potential of the product pipeline.
The Group has a competitive remuneration 
package that is reflective of market conditions  
for key roles and is constantly under review as 
conditions change. The Group also operates  
a long-term incentive plan for key employees.
Cash flow  
in high-value 
contracts
Some contracts, particularly in the homecare 
business, often require the Group to acquire 
high-value drugs in advance of selling them on. 
This places great importance on ensuring that 
payment terms are set in the context of the 
Group’s cash flow constraints to manage the 
risk to working capital.
The Group implements a contract approval process, 
consisting of financial modelling of estimated 
revenues, costs and cash requirements and  
a thorough legal review. Risks can be identified and 
mitigated at an early stage by ensuring all contracts 
and tenders follow this process pre-signing. 24

and determined and work hard to make a 
difference to achieve results, and celebrate 
in success.

Investors in people
Quantum Pharmaceutical Limited (‘QPL ’),  
a business within the Specials division, first 
achieved the Investors in People standard  
in March 2011. QPL was reassessed in  
March 2015 and successfully maintained the 
standard. This demonstrates the Group’s 
commitment to realising the potential of its 
people and recognises the importance the 
Group places on learning and development.
Training

is to equip people with the necessary skills, 
knowledge and attitudes to meet the 
business’ needs. By investing in people 
through training, the Group ensures it 
harnesses their full potential and focuses  
their energies on the needs of the 
organisation, while fulfilling their need for 
personal development and job satisfaction.
In addition to in-house training, the Group has 
links with local colleges and external training 
providers. The Group plans to maximise the 
opportunities offered by the Apprenticeship 
Levy, which came into effect in April 2017.
Environment, health and safety
When it comes to promoting positive working 
conditions on-site and in the community, the 
Group works to exceed regulatory and legal 
requirements. The Group has an on-going 
commitment to the preservation of the 
environment, reducing waste and taking  
a responsible approach to recycling.
Each year, the Group aims to improve the way 
it consumes energy, manages transportation 
and protects its local community. The Group 
aims to use energy efficient equipment and 
motion-sensor lighting where possible. It also 
has a paper reduction policy and remains alert 
to new ways to make sites greener. The Group 
is as dedicated to health and safety as it is to 
quality and efficiency.

The Group takes data protection seriously. 
Customer data is handled sensitively and 
securely in a way that complies with relevant 
legislation. Policies relating to data protection 
are also regularly reviewed.

The Group has an anti-bribery and corruption 
policy that prohibits the offering, giving, seeking 
or acceptance of any bribe in any form by any 
person, company or third-party acting in order 
to gain an advantage in an unethical way.
Modern slavery
The Group is committed to improving its 
practices to combat slavery and human 
trafficking, recognising that this is a real, yet 
hidden issue, in our society. Slavery and human 
trafficking will not be tolerated in the business  
or supply chain. The Group is committed to 
acting ethically and with integrity in all business 
dealings. Effective systems and controls are 
being implemented and enforced to identify  
and combat this issue wherever it may exist.

 Female 57%
Whistleblowing
The Group recognises the importance of  
an honest and open culture, enabling all

Corporate governance statement
As an AIM company, Quantum Pharma Plc is not required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board, however, believes in 
the importance of corporate governance and recognises the principles set out in the Quoted Companies Alliance’s Corporate Governance Code 
(‘the Code’).
Although this Code is not compulsory for companies whose shares are listed on AIM, the Board seeks to apply the recommendations set out  
in the Code as far as it considers appropriate and practicable for a Group of this size and nature.
The Company was incorporated on 17 October 2014 and its shares were admitted to trading on AIM on 11 December 2014.
The Board
The Board comprises five Directors, two of whom are Executive Directors and three of whom are Non-executive Directors, each bringing  
a different set of experiences and backgrounds. Dr John Brown is considered to be ‘independent’ under the criteria identified in the Code and  
he is the Senior Independent Director.
The Board is committed to setting out the vision and strategy of the Company and the Group and to ensuring that this is effectively 
communicated, internally and externally, as recommended by the principles set out in the Code.
The Board meets regularly to consider strategy, performance and the framework of internal controls. Strategic matters are reserved for decision 
by the Board and these matters are set out in a written statement, adopted by the Board. The Board is responsible for formulating, implementing 
and developing strategy, setting annual budgets, reviewing the performance and prospects of the Group, approving major capital expenditure 
and for risk management. The Non-executive Directors’ focus, in particular, on ensuring that strategic matters are carefully assessed 
and implemented.
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information as expected under the principles set out in the 
Code and all Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. In addition, the Directors are able to obtain independent professional 
advice in the furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
The Board met formally nine times during the financial year ended 31 January 2017 in person and in addition met by telephone, as required,

Internal control
The Board is committed to managing and communicating risk and implementing internal controls and regards the management of risk as an 
essential business practice, as highlighted by principles set out in the Code. The principal risks and uncertainties of the Group are set out on 
pages 22 and 23 of this Annual Report.
The Board has established and maintains the Group’s system of internal control. The Board is responsible for assessing and reviewing its 
effectiveness. The Directors have set out below some of the key features of the Group’s internal control procedures.
The Group maintains a consolidated corporate risk register, which is reviewed and updated quarterly. Each potential material risk across the 
Group is assessed against the likelihood of occurrence and the impact on the business, should the risk be realised.
The Group has a disaster recovery and business continuity plan, which is reviewed regularly. Where any weaknesses are identified, an action plan 
is prepared to address the issue and is then implemented. In addition, the Group is actively seeking to attain the ISO22301 Business Continuity 
Management standard.
Each year, the Board approves the annual budget. Key risk areas are identified, reviewed and monitored. Performance is monitored against 
budget, relevant action is taken throughout the year and updated forecasts are prepared, as appropriate.
Capital and development expenditure is regulated by a budgetary process and authorisation levels. For expenditure beyond specified levels, 
detailed written proposals have to be submitted to the Board for approval. Reviews are carried out after the purchase is complete. The Board 
requires management to explain any major deviations from authorised capital processes and to seek further sanction from the Board.
In order to address certain areas of key risk and uncertainty, the Group’s contract proposals (whether with customers or suppliers) are governed 
by an approval process prior to signature. In addition to budgetary and profitability checks and balances, each proposed contract is reviewed 
from a legal perspective prior to being approved for signature.
Investor relations
The Group encourages communications with all shareholders and regards this as important, in line with the recommendations of the principles 
set out in the Code. There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and presentations are held after the Group’s announcements of half 
year and full year results. Presentations are also made to analysts at those times to present the Group’s results. This assists with the promotion  
of knowledge of the Group in the investment marketplace and with shareholders. This also helps the Directors to understand the needs and 
expectations of shareholders. All presentations are made available on the Group’s corporate website.
The Directors use the Annual Report and Accounts, and the Annual General Meeting as opportunities to engage with private and institutional 
investors. The Board believes that the Annual General Meeting offers an excellent opportunity to communicate directly with shareholders. 36

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and the Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare the Group and the Company financial statements for each financial year. As required by the  
AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and the Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Directors regarding disclosure of information to the Auditor
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Directors’ report, confirms that:
• so far as each of the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s Auditor is unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s Auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern 
The financial position of the Group is described in the Chief Financial Officer’s review. The Board has considered the applicability of the going 
concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements.
The Group has considerable financial resources and financing facilities and has prepared detailed business plans for a period of 36 months that 
model headroom on the agreed financial covenants. The Directors are satisfied that, after sensitising the business plans for reasonably possible 
downside scenarios, there remains adequate headroom above the covenants that are in place.
The Directors believe that the Group is well-placed to manage its business risks successfully and therefore have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 40

summary statement, setting out details of the Company’s remuneration policy and of the remuneration paid to Directors who served during the 
financial year ended 31 January 2017. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Company’s Non-executive Directors. At the start of the financial year the Remuneration Committee 
comprised John Clarke (as Chairman) and Sheila Kelly. On 28 July 2016 Sheila Kelly was appointed as Chairman. Since 19 October 2016, the 
Remuneration Committee comprises Dr John Brown as Chairman, Christopher Mills and Ian Johnson. The Remuneration Committee met eight 
times during the financial year ended 31 January 2017.
The Remuneration Committee sets salary levels for the Executive Directors to attract and motivate high-calibre leaders in the business and to 
recognise their skills, experience, expertise and their contribution to the performance of the Group.
Fees for Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board to recognise their time commitment and contribution.
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy was prepared and is maintained to provide a framework for the Remuneration Committee in discharging  
its duties to review and determine salaries, bonuses and share awards for the Executive Directors. There are three main principles of the 
remuneration policy:
1. to design remuneration packages that attract high-calibre, highly-motivated executives and to retain and motivate those executives through 
fair and competitive rewards;
2. to focus on remuneration being closely aligned to achievement of long-term goals, stretching performance targets, creating a performance-
focused ethos, while avoiding incentives that would reward excessive risk-taking; and
3. to align Directors’ remuneration with Company strategy and sustainable success of the Group in the interests of shareholders.
The overall aim of the remuneration policy is to ensure that remuneration packages motivate and incentivise, recognise and reward performance, 
are aligned with the long-term success of the Group and drive value creation for shareholders, in line with good corporate governance and 
risk management.
The Remuneration Committee takes into consideration a number of key elements in order to provide an overall executive remuneration 
package, including:
1. Salary
The basic salaries for the financial year ended 31 January 2017 for the Executive Directors were:
Executive Director Role Basic salary (per annum)
Andrew Scaife Chief Executive Office (‘CEO’) £230,000
Martin Such Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’) £160,000
Chris Rigg CFO

CFO and Acting CEO
 2

CEO and CFO and then CEO
 3
£260,000
Gerard Murray CFO
 4
£175,000
1 Chris Rigg replaced Martin Such as CFO on 8 March 2016.
2 Chris Rigg replaced Andrew Scaife as Acting CEO and continued in his role as CFO on 1 August 2016.
3 Chris Rigg was appointed permanent CEO on 19 October 2016, but also continued in his role as CFO until 23 January 2017.
4 Gerard Murray was appointed as CFO on 23 January 2017.
2. Pension contributions 
The Remuneration Committee has determined that Executive Directors receive a pension contribution from the Company of 10% of basic salary.
3. Performance-related bonus and long term incentives
The Remuneration Committee considers that performance-related elements of packages should give the Executive Directors the potential  
to receive additional annual benefits but only if the business has outperformed on key performance metrics and this accords with the general 
remuneration policy of rewarding performance. The Remuneration Committee has established short-term and long-term performance-based 
elements of remuneration consisting of cash bonuses and share awards.
a. Short-term
The Remuneration Committee assesses and determines the payment of an annual cash bonus, if any, to the Executive Directors each financial 
year based on the achievement of the overall financial results of the Group and individual performance. 42

Remuneration policy continued
b. Long-term
The Company has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), which is designed to ensure that a proportion of remuneration is linked to stretching 
performance targets and is given by means of shares in the capital of Quantum Pharma Plc. The Remuneration Committee takes independent 
advice in setting such targets.
The Company also allows employees to participate in the growth and success of the Group through a Save-as-You-Earn share scheme (‘SAYE’) 
to encourage participation and performance.

The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company prepares its parent company financial statements in accordance with FRS 101; 
these are presented on pages 76 to 84.
1.1  Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to both years presented in these consolidated 
financial statements.
1.2  Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: 
derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-for-sale, biological assets and 
investment property and liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the 
lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments and contingent consideration on 
business acquisitions are stated at their fair value.
1.3  Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic report on pages 1 to 27. The financial position of the Group is described in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 14 to 16.  
In addition, Note 28 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial  
risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and financing facilities and has prepared detailed business plans for a period of 36 months that 
model headroom on the agreed financial covenants. The Directors are satisfied that, after sensitising the business plans for reasonably possible 
downside scenarios, there remains adequate headroom above the covenants that are in place.
The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and therefore have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
1.4  Basis of consolidation
Subsidiary undertakings
Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes 
into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. 
The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until 
the date that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary undertaking are allocated to the non-controlling 
interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. Any deficit balance is transferred to provisions.
Change in subsidiary undertakings ownership and loss of control
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary undertaking that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary undertaking, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related non-controlling 
interest (NCI) and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Any interest 
retained in the former subsidiary undertaking is measured at fair value when control is lost.
Joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which the Group and one or more third parties have joint control. These joint arrangement are in turn 
classified as:
• joint ventures whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its 
liabilities; and
• joint operations whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant 
influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.

Application of the equity method to associates and joint ventures
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s 
investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include 
the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date that significant influence  
or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest 
in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the 
extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Joint operations
Where the Group is a party to a joint operation, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the joint operations assets and 
liabilities, as well as the Group’s share of the entity’s profit or loss and other comprehensive income, on a line-by-line basis.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised 
gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 
1.5  Business combinations
Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Business combinations 
are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
Acquisitions on or after 1 February 2011 (IFRS transition date)
For acquisitions on or after 1 February 2011, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• the fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is 
not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration 
are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Where contingent consideration is linked to continued employment it is classified as an 
employment cost and recognised in the consolidated income statement over the relevant period.
On a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both present ownership interests and 
are entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of liquidation, at its proportionate interest in the recognised amount 
of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. 
Acquisitions prior to 1 February 2011 (IFRS transition date)
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period. The Group elected not to restate business 
combinations that took place prior to transition date. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 February 2011, goodwill is included at transition date on 
the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable save that only separable 
intangibles were recognised and goodwill was amortised. 
1.6  Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in 
their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are 
based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which 
non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
1.7  Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional 
currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to the Group’s presentational currency (Sterling) at foreign exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of this operation are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates 
to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are 
reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.  52

1.8  Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following 
two conditions: 
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company (or Group); and 
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation  
to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s exchanging  
a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the 
legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium 
account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
Where a financial instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists these components are separated and accounted 
for individually under the above policy.
1.9  Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Investments in debt and equity securities
Other investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any 
resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity (in the fair value reserve), except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items 
such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised directly in equity is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest 
calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
Loans
Loans to joint ventures are stated at amortised cost less impairment. Financial instruments held for trading are stated at fair value, with any 
resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part  
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-
bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
1.10 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant 
and equipment.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases. 
Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased 
assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and less accumulated impairment losses. Lease payments are accounted for 
as described below.
Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings   25 years
Leasehold property improvements term of lease
Plant and equipment  5 years
Fixtures and fittings   5 years 
 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

1.11 Intangible assets and goodwill 
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is 
tested annually for impairment. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment in the investee.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends,  
has the technical ability and has sufficient resources to complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Group can 
measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development activities involve a plan or design for  
the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour 
and an appropriate proportion of overheads and capitalised borrowing costs. Other development expenditure is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement as an expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less 
accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless 
such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet 
date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer relationship  10 years
Patents and trademarks  5 – 10 years 
Capitalised development costs to be determined on an individual basis for each medicine developed 
Software development  3 years
1.12 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the weighted average principle and includes expenditure incurred 
in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case  
of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
1.13 Impairment excluding inventories and deferred tax assets
Financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not carried at fair value is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired.  
A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss 
event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues 
to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease 
in impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, 
and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the 
same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments  
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually  
are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the ‘cash-generating unit’). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of 
impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units, or (‘CGU’). Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill 
impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest 
level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs 
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 54
Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements
1 Accounting policies continued
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed 
at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss, in respect of assets other than goodwill, is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount  
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
1.14 Employee benefits
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability  
is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows certain employees to acquire shares of the Company. The grant date fair value of share-based payment 
awards granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the appropriate option pricing model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual 
number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately 
recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the 
vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured  
to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
1.15 Post retirement benefits
The Group makes contributions to employee’s personal pension schemes in line with UK auto-enrolment legislation. The amount charged to the 
consolidated income statement represents the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
1.16 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can 
be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
1.17 Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders 
such that the Company is obliged to pay the dividend. Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
1.18 Revenue
Revenue represents the total amount receivable for goods, net of discounts and excluding value added tax, sold in the ordinary course of 
business, and arises from activities in the United Kingdom.
Revenue is recognised as follows:
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised net of value added tax and sales related discounts at the point of despatch.
Prescription income
Revenue from the fulfilment of medical prescriptions to patients is recognised net of value added tax at the point of fulfilment of the prescription.
Out-licensing 
The Group’s out-licensing agreements include performance obligations. Revenue is recognised when the performance obligations have been met.
Royalty income
Revenue from royalty agreements is recognised, net of value added tax, on an accruals basis in line with amounts receivable as a result of the 
respective ‘asset use’.
Development contract income
Revenue from development contracts is recognised based on stage of completion with reference to contract costs incurred.

1.19  Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised in the consolidated income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is 
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Financing income and expenses
Financing expenses comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities and finance leases recognised in profit  
or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount on provisions, and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised  
in the consolidated income statement (see foreign currency accounting policy). Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. 
Financing income comprise interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in the consolidated income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. Foreign 
currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
1.20  Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and  
the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating  
to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. 
1.21  Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
A non-current asset or a group of assets containing a non-current asset (a disposal group) is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be 
recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and  
fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss. The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement 
although gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss. Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to 
goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred  
tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policies. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale or distribution are not amortised or depreciated.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of 
operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary undertaking acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification  
as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an 
operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is restated as if the operation has been discontinued  
from the start of the comparative period.
1.22  IFRS not yet applied
The following new and amended standards, adopted in the current financial year, had no significant impact on the financial statements.
• Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation (Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38).
• Accounting for acquisitions of interest in joint operations (Amendments to IFRS11).
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle.
• Equity methods in separate financial statements (Amendments to IAS 27).
• Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 1). 56

The Directors considered the impact on the Group of EU endorsed, new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments.  
The following new and revised accounting standards are currently endorsed but effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017;
• IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts; and
• IFRS 9 Financial instruments.
IFRS 15 introduces principles to recognise revenue by allocation to the transaction price to performance obligations and is effective for accounting 
periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The Group is assessing the impact of the amendments although anticipates that it will not have 
a material impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 9 will supersede IAS 39 and is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The Group is assessing the impact 
on the classification and measurement of financial instruments but no material impact is expected.
The future impact on the financial statements of new standards and amendments awaiting EU endorsement is currently being assessed. New 
standards awaiting EU endorsement include IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The 
standard replaces IAS 17 and will require entities to apply a single lessee accounting model, with lessees recognising right of use assets and 
lease liabilities on balance sheet for all applicable leases. The Group is assessing the impact of the amendments although does not anticipate  
it will have a material impact on the financial statements.
2 Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings
Acquisitions in the prior year
Lamda
In April 2015 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Lamda Laboratories SA, Lamda Pharma SA and Lamda UK Limited (‘Lamda’)  
for consideration, settled in cash of £3,416,000 (€4,700,000). Deferred consideration of £3,700,000 (€5,000,000) was payable in two equal 
instalments 12 and 24 months after the date of completion. The amounts payable as deferred consideration were contingent on the continued 
employment of Mr G Liolios.
The arrangement to pay the deferred consideration was accounted for separate to the business combination, as remuneration, as the payments 
were contingent on the continued employment of Mr Liolios. The £3,700,000 is being charged evenly over the 24 month performance period, 
resulting in a current year charge of £1,977,000 (2016: £1,461,000).
Expenses totalling £382,000 relating to the acquisition were charged to the prior year consolidated income statement in accordance with IFRS 3.
Lamda provide a fully outsourced research and development service to companies looking to license medical products from its modern 
development laboratories near Athens, Greece.
The resulting goodwill totalling £2,731,000 was capitalised and is subject to an annual impairment review by management. Goodwill is attributed 
to Lamda’s knowledge and expertise in the research and development of products and the synergies provided to the rest of the Group.
The fair values of the net assets acquired in respect of Lamda, and consideration payable, were as follows: 
Fair value
£000
Non-current assets
Property, plant and equipment 792
Current assets
Inventories 803
Receivables 382
Cash 133
Total assets 2,110
Total liabilities (1,425)
Net assets 685
Goodwill 2,731
Purchase consideration 3,416
Satisfied by:
Cash 3,416
In the period from acquisition to 31 January 2016, Lamda contributed a net operating profit of £363,000, before a £1,461,000 charge for deferred 
consideration, as noted above, resulting in an overall net operating loss of £1,098,000.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 February 2015, Group revenue, for the year to 31 January 2016, would have been an estimated £70,458,000 
and profit after tax would have been an estimated £5,559,000.

2 Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings continued
NuPharm 
In July 2015 the Group acquired the entire share capital of NuPharm Group Limited and its wholly owned trading subsidiary undertaking 
NuPharm Laboratories Limited (‘NuPharm’) for consideration (including expenses), settled in cash of £8,837,000 and contingent consideration  
of up to £4,000,000 payable 24 months from the date of acquisition.
The contingent consideration was subject to certain performance criteria being achieved. The amount payable ranged from £nil to a maximum  
of £4,000,000. At acquisition the Directors estimated those contingent amounts at a fair value of £250,000 (Note 24).
Expenses totalling £372,000 relating to the acquisition were charged to the prior year consolidated income statement in accordance with IFRS 3 
and have subsequently been included within discontinued operations.
NuPharm was a UK-based, outsourced manufacturer for batch-made specials and niche licensed pharmaceutical products. In addition it had 
product development expertise and was a clinical trials product manufacturer.
During the current year due to the underperformance and losses incurred since acquisition, a decision was taken to close NuPharm. As this 
represents a separate major line of business this has been treated as a discontinued operation (Note 9). The goodwill and customer relationships 
capitalised on acquisition of £9,609,000 and £2,787,000 respectively have been impaired to nil as a result (Note 14).
The fair values of the net assets acquired in respect of the NuPharm, and consideration payable, were as follows: 
Fair value
£000
Non-current assets
Property, plant and equipment 392
Customer relationships 2,787

In the period from acquisition to 31 January 2016, NuPharm contributed a net operating loss of £14,000.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 February 2015, Group revenue for the year to 31 January 2016, would have been an estimated £71,006,000 
and profit after tax would have been an estimated £5,282,000.

3 Segmental reporting continued
These operating segments have separate management teams and offer different products and services and are considered as reportable segments. 
The segment results, as reported to the Board, are calculated under the principles of IFRS. Performance is measured on the basis of adjusted EBITDA 
which comprises the segment result before non cash items (amortisation, depreciation and share based payments) and other 3 items that are excluded 
when the Board assess performance. A reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and profit (loss) before tax is included in the tables below.
The results shown below are from continuing operations only.

An impairment charge of £21,452,000 (2016: £80,000) has been recognised in the year arising from the decisions to discontinue NuPharm 
operations £12,049,000 (2016: £nil), not progress the development of certain medicines £7,210,000 (2016: £80,000), and the write down of 
goodwill and other intangible assets in respect of Protomed Limited £2,193,000 (2016: £nil) due to uncertainty over the levels of future profits.
Impairment testing
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets considered significant in comparison to the Group’s total carrying amount of such assets have been 
allocated to cash generating units or groups of cash generating units as follows:
Goodwill
2017
£000
2016
£000
Quantum Pharmaceutical Limited 37,703 37,703
U L Medicines Limited 9,647 9,647
Colonis Pharma Limited and Lamda 3,155 3,155
Total Medication Management Services Limited (‘TOMMS’) 1,841 1,841
Protomed Limited – 1,245
NuPharm Group Limited – 9,609
52,346 63,200
The recoverable amount of the goodwill allocated to the above cash generating units has been calculated with reference to their value in use.  
The key assumptions of this calculation are shown below:
2017 2016
Period on which management approved forecasts are based 3 years 3 years
Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 0% 0%
Discount rate 8-10% 10%
Management have assumed 0% growth beyond the forecast period. The forecast period is based on a three year business model approved  
by the Board. The key assumption in those forecasts is revenue. Forecasts for the more established businesses are based on historical growth 
trends. For the less mature businesses, forecast revenues are based on management’s assessment of market trends and the impact of the 
Group’s growth initiatives. In respect of Colonis Pharma Limited and Lamda, forecast revenue is based on estimated revenues for each product  
in development, which in turn is based on estimated market size and the Group’s likely market share.
The recoverable amount of these cash generating units has been calculated with reference to their value in use. Management have used a pre-tax 
discount rate ranging from 8% to 10% that reflects current market assessments for the time value of money and the risks associated with the 
CGU. A discount rate of 8% has been applied to the core mature business units within the Group, namely Quantum Pharmaceutical Limited and  
UL Medicines Limited, with a 10% discount rate applied to the less mature business units and revenue streams, namely TOMMS and Colonis 
Pharma Limited and Lamda. A further analysis would be done if this suggested that the impairment assessment was sensitive to the discount 
rate. Management has performed sensitivity analysis on all the impairment calculations by increasing the pre-tax discount rate by 5% to 13%  
and 15% respectively and sensitising revenue by 5% and no impairment would arise in any period. 66

During the year ended 31 January 2016 the Group refinanced its debt, securing a new bank term loan of £25,000,000 and a revolving credit 
facility of £10,000,000.
Arrangement fees associated with the new facilities were £480,000.
The bank term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a variable margin (1.0% to 2.75%) which is dependent upon the leverage at the end of each 
quarter and is repayable in quarterly instalments from January 2016.
The revolving credit facility, of which £nil (2016: £5,000,000) was drawn at 31 January, also bears interest at LIBOR plus a variable margin  
(1.0% to 2.75%) for any amounts drawn on the facility. Any unutilised amounts of the facility attract a fee of 40% of the applicable margin for  
the availability period.
At the reporting date the Group’s borrowings, comprised the bank term loan and revolving credit facility and include issue costs of £290,000 
(2016: £411,000). The issue costs of each instrument, together with the interest expense, are allocated to the consolidated income statement over 
the term of the respective facilities at a constant rate based on the original value of each instrument. The term loan and the revolving credit facility 
are secured by a fixed and floating charge over the Group’s assets.

Closure costs
The provision is management’s best estimate of costs to complete the orderly closure of NuPharm Laboratories Limited, which was placed into 
administration on 26 April 2017.
Rectification works
This provision was management’s best estimate of the further costs expected to be incurred in respect of the rectification work required as a result  
of NuPharm Laboratories Limited being in MHRA special measures at acquisition.
The provision was partially utilised within the prior and current years, with the remaining amount released to the consolidated income statement, 
through discontinued operations, due to NuPharm Laboratories being discontinued.
Contingent consideration

consideration of up to £4,000,000 payable in July 2017. The provision was based on the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration  
at acquisition. The provision has been released to the consolidated income statement as no payment will be made, and the release is included 
within discontinued operations.

27 Reserves
The following describes the nature and purpose of each reserve within equity:
Reserve Description and purpose
Share premium Amount subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value.
Consolidation reserve Arises as a result of the reverse acquisition concept in IFRS 3 when Quantum Pharma Plc became the parent of  
the Group. The consolidation reserve of £9,752,000 represents (i) the difference between the reserves of Quantum 
Pharma Plc and those of the former parent and (ii) the premium payable on acquisition by a subsidiary, of preference 
shares arising in the pre-IPO restructure.
Merger reserve When Quantum Pharma Group Limited (‘QPG’) acquired the entire issued share capital of Quantum Pharmaceutical 
Limited, the Company took advantage of the merger relief provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and has not 
recorded any premium arising on the issue of these shares. A merger reserve of £8,742,000 was created in the 
Group financial statements which represents the difference between the fair value and the nominal value of the 
consideration shares issued by QPG.
Translation reserve Gains (losses) arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into Sterling.
Other reserve Other reserve relates to any premium arising on acquisition of non-controlling interests where there has been no 
change of control.
ESOP own share reserve Shares purchased and held to satisfy share options.
Retained earnings All other net gains and losses and transactions with owners (e.g. dividends) not recognised elsewhere.
Own shares held by ESOP
At the reporting date 4,249,219 (2016: 4,840,165) ordinary shares of £0.10 each, were held by a Company sponsored Employee Benefit Trust 
(the ‘Trust’). The arrangements for distributing shares to employees by the Trust are at the discretion of the trustees. Based on the Directors’ best 
estimate, the market value of the shares held by the Trust at the reporting date was approximately £2,039,625 (2016: £3,605,923). At the year end 
4,249,219 ordinary shares are under option to employees.
28 Financial instruments
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest 
rate risk). 
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, 
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date for trade receivables was:
2017
£000
2016

Trade receivables 12,183 11,240
The ageing of the trade receivables at the reporting date was:

More than 120 days 663 (534) 220 (170)
Total 13,412 (1,229) 11,410 (170)
Management assesses the necessity for impairment on a specific item by item basis and incorporate, amongst other criteria, their knowledge and 
understanding of the business along with the age of the item. No other receivables are past due in any of the reporting years above.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:

£000
2016
£000
Balance at beginning of year 170 85
Impairment loss recognised 1,059 85
Amounts deemed irrecoverable – –
Balance at end of year 1,229 170
The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount 
owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly.
b) Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk has been to maintain sufficient cash balances to provide flexibility in the management of the Group’s liquidity.

A change of 1 basis point in the interest rates at the balance sheet date would have increased (decreased) equity and profit (loss) before tax  
by the amounts shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to financial 
instrument exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers the effects of financial 
instruments with variable interest rates. The analysis is performed on the same basis for the prior year.

e)  Fair values of financial instruments
Non-current asset investments
The fair value of investments is based on management’s assessment of share value where the investment is not a traded security.
Trade and other payables and receivables
The fair value of these items are considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed as 
not material.
Cash and cash equivalents
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand. Where it is not repayable 
on demand then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance 
sheet date.
Long-term and short-term borrowings 
The fair value of bank loans and other loans is based on the terms the Group has agreed for its variable rate debt.
Short-term deposits
The fair value of short term deposits is considered to be the carrying value as the balances are held in floating rate accounts where the interest 
rate is reset to market rates.
Fair value hierarchy 
The following hierarchy classifies each class of financial asset or liability depending on the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value: 
Level 1: The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows utilising applicable 
year end yield curves. The fair value of forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates 
and commodity prices at the reported date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the forward contracts. 
Level 3: The fair value is based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The investment in unlisted shares is a Level 3 fair value estimate based on the information management have received on the Company’s performance.
There have been no transfers between categories in the current or prior years.
The fair values of all financial instruments, in the current and prior years, approximate to their carrying values. Whilst the Group has previously had 
some fixed rate debt the rate was consistent with that on the Group’s variable rate debt.
f) Capital management
The Group defines capital as equity (as set out on the consolidated balance sheet) and interest bearing borrowings (Note 20). The Group’s capital 
management objectives are to provide sufficient funds to support the continued growth of the Group and to provide a return to shareholders. 
There are no external capital requirements but the bank term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to covenants, consistent with normal 
business practice, in respect of leverage and debt service cover.

This Company is party to a composite guarantee with the Group’s lenders whereby the Company is liable, jointly and severally with other members  
of the Group, with the exception of Lamda (Note 2), in respect of borrowings within the Group.
The Group’s bankers and other lenders also have in place a debenture over the Group’s assets in support of borrowings within the Group which 
amounted to £21,250,000 (2016: £29,250,000) at the balance sheet date, excluding the unamortised amount of associated loan issue costs.
32 Related parties
The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiary undertakings, jointly controlled entities and its Directors.
Subsidiary undertakings
Transactions between the Company’s subsidiary undertakings, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are therefore 
not disclosed.
Directors
There are no amounts due from Directors in the current or prior year.
Details of Director’s share options, emoluments, pension benefits and other non-cash benefits are detailed in Note 7.
Other related party transactions
i) QM Specials Limited is a joint venture in which the Group has a 50% interest. During the year the Company received loan repayments of 
£115,000 (2016: £70,000) from QM Specials Limited. The total amount outstanding at the balance sheet date amounted to £310,000 (2016: 
£425,000) and is included in other debtors.
ii) During the year the Group made sales to QM Specials Limited totalling £477,000 (2016: £511,000). The outstanding receivable amount at the 
reporting date amounted to £35,000 (2016: £138,000).
Key management personnel remuneration
Key management personnel are considered to be the current Board of Directors and Senior executives.
The total remuneration for key management personnel is £1,923,000 (2016: £1,770,000), comprising short term benefits of £nil (2016: £nil),  
post employment benefits of £113,000 (2016: £135,000) and share based payments of £295,000 (2016: £26,000).
33 Accounting estimates and judgements
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired required an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation required estimation of future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details of CGU’s as well as further information about 
the assumptions made are disclosed in Note 14.
Capitalisation of development expenditure
Determining whether expenditure meets the IFRS criteria for capitalisation requires judgement as to whether the products are technically and 
commercially feasible and an estimation of the future economic benefits to arise from the products. The Group has a ‘New Product Development’ 
Committee (NPD) which meets monthly. The NPD committee assesses the technical feasibility of the product pipeline based on scientific and market 
data presented by its in house experts. Following confirmation of technical feasibility the key judgement is in respect of the estimated commercial 
returns from the developments, which requires estimates of potential market size, market share and product profitability. Capitalisation of development 
expenditure occurs from the point of approval. All initial research of a product is expensed to the consolidated income statement as incurred. 76

Financial statements
1  Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Company’s 
financial statements, except as noted below.
1.1  Basis of preparation
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’).  
The amendments to FRS 101 (2014 15 Cycle) issued in July 2015 and effective immediately have been applied.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with 
Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
financial statements. 
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures;
• a cash flow statement and related notes; 
• disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries; 
• disclosures in respect of capital management; 
• the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;
• disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel; and
• disclosures of transactions with a management entity that provides key management personnel services to the Company.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available 
in respect of the following disclosures:
• certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures.
1.2  Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: 
derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-for-sale, biological assets 
investment property and liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated  
at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
1.3  Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company’s functional currencies at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency 
at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that 
are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
1.4  Leases
Operating lease payments
Payments (excluding costs for services and insurance) made under operating leases are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-
line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the profit and loss account as an integral part of the total 
lease expense.
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is 
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Contingent rents are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
1.5  Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will 
have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised 
as an expense in the profit and loss account in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.

Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Share based payments
The share option programme allows certain employees to acquire shares of the Company. The grant date fair value of share-based payment 
awards granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of 
awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised  
as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. 
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such 
conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial statements, an 
increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its consolidated 
financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity. Amounts recharged to the subsidiary are recognised as a 
reduction in the cost of investment in subsidiary. If the amount recharged exceeds the increase in the cost of investment the excess is recognised 
as a dividend. When the cost of investment in subsidiary has been reduced to nil, the excess is recognised as a dividend.
Where the Company’s parent grants rights to its equity instruments to the Group’s or the Company’s employees, which are accounted for  
as equity-settled in the consolidated accounts of the parent, the Group or the Company as the case may be account for these share-based 
payments as equity-settled. Amounts recharged by the parent are recognised as a recharge liability with a corresponding debit to equity.
1.6  Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds)  
only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial 
liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and 
b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation  
to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s exchanging  
a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the 
legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium 
account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
1.7  Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Loans
Loans to joint ventures are stated at amortised cost less impairment. Financial instruments held for trading are stated at fair value, with any 
resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part  
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-
bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
1.8  Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that  
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 80
Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements
1  Accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and  
the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating  
to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised.

Arrangement fees associated with the new facilities were £480,000. 82
Quantum Pharma Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements
8 Other interest-bearing loans and borrowings continued
The bank term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a variable margin (1.0% to 2.75%) which is dependent upon the leverage at the end of each 
quarter and is repayable in quarterly instalments from January 2016. 
The revolving credit facility, of which £nil (2016: £5,000,000) was drawn at 31 January, also bears interest at LIBOR plus a variable margin  
(1.0% to 2.75%) for any amounts drawn on the facility. Any unutilised amounts of the facility attract a fee of 40% of the applicable margin for the 
availability period.
At the reporting date the Company’s borrowings, comprised the bank term loan and revolving credit facility and include issue costs of £290,000 
(2016: £411,000). The issue costs of each instrument, together with the interest expense, are allocated to the consolidated income statement over 
the term of the respective facilities at a constant rate based on the original value of each instrument. The term loan and the revolving credit facility 
are secured by a fixed and floating charge over the Company’s assets.
