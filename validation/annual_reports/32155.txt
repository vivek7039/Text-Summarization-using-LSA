Strategic Report 
Introduction
This is Burberry’s Strategic Report for the financial year ending 31 March 2017.  
The Report sets out information on the Burberry brand, business operations,  
strategy, people and responsibility activities.
The following messages from Sir John Peace and Christopher Bailey highlight  
Burberry’s performance during the year and the outlook for the Company. Good early progress against Burberry’s ambitious plans.
Sir John Peace
Chairman
As Carol Fairweather and John Smith had signalled  
their intention to step down as Chief Financial Officer  
and Chief Operating Officer respectively, focus was  
also on the succession of these roles, with the decision  
to combine them to align with the change programme.
The Board unanimously supported the appointment of 
Marco Gobbetti as Chief Executive Officer who will join  
the Board on 5 July 2017 (with Christopher transitioning  
to his new role at that time), and Julie Brown who joined  
the Board as Chief Operating and Financial Officer on  
18 January 2017. The Board believes that the combination  
of Christopher’s creative talent and vision for Burberry  
and Marco’s extensive skills in luxury and retail, as  
well as Julie’s financial and commercial track record,  
will provide strong leadership for the next phase of 
Burberry’s evolution. 
The Board would like to thank Carol Fairweather for her 
immense contribution to Burberry over the past ten years, 
and John Smith for his contribution to Burberry over the 
past seven years, first as a non-executive director and 
latterly as Chief Operating Officer. We wish them all the 
best for the future.
Financial performance and shareholder returns
As a whole, the luxury sector has continued to remain 
challenging during the year, with some signs of 
improvement during the second half. We have made 
strategic long-term choices to strengthen the brand  
and reposition Burberry for growth over time, and good 
progress with the implementation of our programme 
including the establishment of our five key pillars to 
underpin our growth and productivity agenda. More  
detail on our progress is set out in Christopher’s letter  
and in this Report.
Burberry has delivered 2016/17 revenues of £2.8bn  
(down 2% underlying), and adjusted profit before tax of 
£462m (up £42m and down 21% underlying). This was in 
part impacted by a decrease in licensing profit due to the 
planned expiry of our Japanese licences and other actions 
we have taken to build and reinforce our brand positioning. 
We also delivered the planned £20m of cost savings in  
FY 2017. This is expected to build to c. £50m in FY 2018 
and is on track to deliver the target of at least £100m 
annualised in FY 2019.
Last year I highlighted the fundamental changes taking 
place in the luxury sector and in consumer behaviour. 
These were influenced by a challenging global environment, 
which had impacted the performance of the sector as a 
whole, as demand slowed sharply in many of Burberry’s 
key markets. To stay ahead of these changes and to  
create future value for shareholders, we announced an 
acceleration of our productivity and efficiency agenda, 
particularly looking at our ways of working. We identified 
significant future organic revenue growth opportunities  
and a programme of actions to deliver at least £100m of 
annualised cost savings by FY 2019. 
The Board also considered with Christopher Bailey, the 
shape of the leadership team required to maximise our 
growth opportunities and to successfully implement these 
plans. It was concluded that there was a need for a new 
chief executive with strong luxury retail experience to lead 
on the commercial, operational and financial elements of 
the business, who could partner closely with Christopher, 
who would continue his leadership of the brand and design 
elements of the business as President and Chief Creative 
Officer. Since taking on the combined role of Chief Creative 
and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher has made 
significant progress against a backdrop of challenging 
market conditions. The Board is appreciative of his efforts 
in working with the Board to identify a new chief executive  
to partner with him on the execution of our growth plans.

Strategic Report – Introduction
Chairman’s 
Letter The Group ended the year with a strong cash balance  
of £809m, up £149m year-on-year after £97m of share 
buyback and £164m of dividends. Consequently, the  
Board has recommended a 5% increase in the full year 
dividend to 38.9p, in line with our progressive dividend 
policy resulting in a 50% pay-out ratio based on adjusted 
earnings per share. This reflects the Board’s confidence  
in the future growth of the business.
Our approach to capital allocation is based on a framework 
which defines our priorities for uses of cash, underpinned 
by our principle to maintain a strong balance sheet with 
solid investment grade credit metrics. This underlines our 
commitment to increasing shareholder returns over time, 
which remains a key priority for the Board.
Over the past five years, Burberry has returned around  
£700m to shareholders through dividends, and in April 2017 
completed £100m of a £150m announced share buyback.  
A further share buyback of £300m will be completed  
in FY 2018, in addition to the £50m already announced.  
This is inclusive of the distribution of the Coty upfront sum. 
Other Board developments
The composition of the Board has evolved significantly  
over the past few years with the appointment of four new 
non-executive directors and one longer-serving Board 
member stepping down. Further changes are planned  
over the coming year. The aim is to continue to refresh the 
Board while ensuring stability and continuity, particularly  
in the context of significant management change. 
Following a previous review of the Board Committees, 
changes were implemented during the year. This  
included the appointment of Jeremy Darroch as Chair  
of the Audit Committee and Fabiola Arredondo as Chair  
of the Remuneration Committee, as well as changes to  
the composition of those Committees. 
People and pay
Our new Remuneration Policy will be presented to 
shareholders for their vote at our upcoming Annual General 
Meeting (AGM), and so our Remuneration Committee Chair 
Fabiola Arredondo has been meeting with our shareholders 
and consulting with them on the proposed Policy. You can 
read more about the Policy in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 87 to 111. 
Governance and diversity
The Board seeks to operate to the highest standards  
of corporate governance. The work of the Board and its 
Committees during the year, along with the assessment  
of its performance, is set out in the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 70 to 86. Burberry continues to support 
diversity in all its forms across the organisation including 
the Board. While all Board appointments are made on 
merit, the Board continues to believe in the importance of  
a diverse Board and has always had strong gender diversity 
amongst its membership, including at executive level. The 
Board will continue to monitor diversity, including across 
the business, and to take such steps as it considers 
appropriate to maintain its position as a meritocratic  
and diverse business.
Looking ahead
To conclude, this has been an important year of change  
for Burberry, not only due to macro trends but also the  
way that Burberry operates as a business. Looking ahead 
to 2017/18, we will continue to focus on our brand, our 
products and the execution of our key strategies. Although 
there is still much to be done as Burberry continues its 
multi-year programme, the Board firmly believes that  
the new leadership team coupled with the actions we  
are taking, will significantly enhance our ability to deliver  
long-term sustainable growth. 
Finally, I would like to thank all of our people for their hard 
work and dedication, particularly during this time of change 
for Burberry. I would also like to thank the Board for its hard 
work and commitment to Burberry, and to thank you, our 
shareholders, for your support over the past 12 months.

Strategic Report – Introduction Christopher Bailey
Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer
Alongside this more moderate growth outlook, we 
anticipate the industry will be shaped by different  
dynamics in the years ahead. Our customer is evolving 
rapidly, prioritising more distinctive experiences, more 
personal relationships with brands and greater product 
innovation. The influence of digital technology is extending 
still further across every aspect of what we do – from 
production techniques to the customer experience, in every 
channel. And demographic changes, from the maturing  
of millennials to the intensification of wealth in cities,  
mean we must keep developing and tailoring how we  
think and work to stay ahead. 
Against this backdrop, we continued last year to take 
actions to elevate our luxury retail and digital business, 
strengthen our brand and reposition Burberry for growth, 
as we maintained our focus on maximising long-term 
shareholder value. In addition to our ongoing actions in 
wholesale and licensing, this included our announcement 
last May of a multi-year programme to accelerate our 
productivity and efficiency agenda, having identified 
significant opportunities across our existing channels, 
products and regions, and our ways of working. We 
touched on these in our last report, and have since  
distilled them into comprehensive plans covering five  
key areas: Product Focus; Productive Space; E-commerce 
Leadership; Operational Excellence and Inspired People, 
the detail of which I will turn to shortly. 
To deliver on this ambitious programme we have also 
strengthened our executive leadership team with the 
extensive luxury experience of Marco Gobbetti, who will 
take on the role of Chief Executive Officer in July 2017,  
and the transformation expertise of Julie Brown, our new 
Chief Operating and Financial Officer. And we have made 
further appointments over recent months to complement 
and enhance the existing skills of our senior team, including 
in key areas such as design, merchandising, technology 
and brand experience. 
As such, the scope and scale of the changes we are  
making to our business are significant, and it will take  
time to realise their full benefits, particularly in respect  
of revenue growth. But our progress with laying the 
foundations for the future is encouraging.
With recent estimates suggesting a broadly flat 
performance in calendar 2016, the subdued result from  
the sector as a whole reflected fundamental shifts that  
have been shaping the industry over the past few years, 
including slowing Chinese consumption, reduced scope  
for space expansion and less pricing flexibility. The impact 
of these trends was exacerbated during the early part of  
the year by macro factors such as sluggish developed and 
developing economies, and consumer unease and travel 
disruption linked to geopolitical events. 
However, we also began to see clear signs of recovery in 
the industry towards the end of the year, as the Chinese 
consumer rallied, Continental Europe improved and the  
UK continued to enjoy strong tourism with the sustained 
weakness of sterling following the Brexit vote. These 
contributed to an improved sector performance in calendar 
Q4, following nearly two years in flat or negative territory.  
Our own performance was consistent with these  
broader trends.
While these more encouraging signs have continued  
into the start of 2017, some challenges remain – not  
least for us given the uneven performance of the US  
and Hong Kong markets, both key for Burberry. As such,  
the outlook for the sector is mixed, with industry experts 
continuing to anticipate more tempered growth in the 
medium term, compared with the historic highs of the  
post-financial crisis years.
2016/17 was a foundational year for Burberry, in an environment that remained 
challenging for luxury – although with sector dynamics improving in the second half. 
Against this backdrop, we continued to elevate our luxury retail and digital business, 
and began implementing wide-ranging changes for the future.
12
Strategic Report – Introduction
Chief Creative and Chief 
Executive Officer’s Letter Performance summary
Before turning to our renewed productivity and efficiency 
agenda, let me first summarise our performance  
for 2016/17.
Revenue was £2.8bn for the year, down 2% underlying,  
with retail outperforming at up 3% overall and up  
1% on a comparable store sales basis. A notably  
strong performance in EMEIA, driven by the UK, and an 
acceleration in mainland China were offset by continued 
challenging conditions in other markets including the  
US and Hong Kong, as well by the impact of our ongoing 
actions to build and reinforce our luxury brand positioning 
for the future. This included the loss of licensing income as 
we build our direct operations in Japan, the rationalisation 
of wholesale distribution globally, including in Beauty,  
and actions to protect the brand in a highly promotional 
environment in the US. 
With adjusted profit before tax down 21% underlying to 
£462m, these factors weighed on the bottom line – although 
their impact was partially offset by the delivery of £20m of 
planned cost efficiencies in the year, and our plans are on 
track for at least £100m by 2018/19. 
We ended the year with a strong net cash position, up 
£149m to £809m, and we increased the full year dividend 
to 38.9p, up 5%. In April we completed £100m of a £150m 
announced share buyback. A further share buyback of 
£300m is to be completed in 2017/18, in addition to the 
£50m already announced. This reflects the Board’s 
confidence in the growth prospects for the business and  
its ongoing commitment to maintaining a strong balance 
sheet with solid investment grade metrics. 
While we actively managed the business through  
near-term market dynamics during the year, we also 
continued to take actions to position it more strongly  
for the long term. As noted above, this included starting  
to implement a wide-ranging productivity and efficiency 
programme to enhance future growth. While we are still 
early in this process, progress across its five areas of  
focus underpinned a number of improvements through  
the year – from the outperformance of fashion and strong 
growth in leather goods, to improved mainline retail 
conversion and customer retention, to the delivery of 
enhanced efficiencies. These initial results give us real 
confidence for the future.
Product Focus
The first pillar in this programme is to move from product 
breadth to product focus. This will allow the customer  
to connect more readily with the creativity, craft and 
storytelling that define and differentiate our offer. With 
significant scope to simplify our assortments, amplify the 
excitement in our products across price points and tailor 
our offer more effectively to the needs of the customer  
in different locations, we began to make changes in the 
year to unlock this opportunity.
Building a more strategic approach to drive outperformance 
in our core categories has been a central focus, with 
comprehensive plans now developed for the product areas 
we have identified as having the greatest growth potential 
for the coming years. The first area in which we have begun 
to implement this new approach is bags, with full price 
sales up 16% in the year. In line with our evolved strategy 
for the category, this was driven both by new launches such 
as the Bridle and Buckle bags, as well as increasing novelty 
in our more established styles. While we are still at the  
early stages of our plans for bags, this strong initial uplift  
is illustrative of the benefits we expect to build across other 
areas over time, with a pipeline of categories to follow. 
The second key area of progress is how we are evolving  
our merchandising approach, with particular emphasis  
on cultivating the local customer – a key opportunity for  
us. Our move to one Burberry label globally, together with 
reducing our assortments by 15 to 20% over the year, have 
been fundamental steps in creating the conditions to realise 
this opportunity. Then, within this significantly simplified 
assortment, we have implemented new tools and ways  
of working that mean we are more effectively tailoring our 
assortments to the individual needs of stores in different 
locations – from climate, to customer profile. Finally, this 
more streamlined approach is also allowing us to give  
far greater visibility to the fashion and newness that is  
so critical to building loyalty and repeat custom. This  
was reflected in the outperformance of fashion during  
the year, including the growth of our runway collections  
and the successful introduction of our new, lightweight 
tropical gabardine.
13
Strategic Report – Introduction All this is being enabled by changes to how we work  
across our product functions, to improve collaboration  
and focus from design to delivery. Part of this has been 
structural, with the evolution of our organisational model 
towards an end-to-end category management approach, 
meaning we are building cross-functional teams specific  
to the potential of each category, with shared accountability 
and KPIs. And we are reinforcing these structural changes 
by redesigning our processes as needed, for example 
getting local input earlier in the cycle. This is a significant 
evolution for us and although the changes will take time  
to embed, we are already seeing early benefits across  
our business. 
The final area I would highlight in respect of product is the 
announcement we made just after the year end of a new 
partnership with Coty, to accelerate the growth of Beauty. 
Consistent with our drive for greater focus across our 
product offer, this follows the successful repositioning and 
elevation of the business over four years of direct operation. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to lead all creative aspects 
of Beauty, while benefiting from Coty’s first-class industry 
expertise and distribution. We will transition to this new 
model in October 2017 and expect the deal to be earnings 
accretive from 2018/19.
Productive Space
Our second pillar is to move from new space to productive 
space. Following a decade of geographic expansion, our 
focus in this next phase is shifting to how we make all our 
space more productive – retail and wholesale, online and 
offline, and with an emphasis on our full-price channels.  
We have significant opportunity here. 
The foundation of our activity over the past year has  
been our Retail Excellence programme, covering all 
aspects of our retail operations, including how we serve  
our customers, approach customer cultivation and manage  
our stores. Results this year show good early traction. 
Within service, we increased our investment in training  
and introduced a new service model (‘CLIENT’), and  
we are currently embedding a new global customer 
feedback programme based on net promoter scores.  
These actions helped drive improvements in conversion 
and retention globally – with room for continued growth. 
Within cultivation, we accelerated the expansion of our 
Customer Value Management programme and Private 
Client teams to bring more customers closer to our  
brand and products through appointments, events and 
experiences. This richer, more personalised approach 
drove a significant uplift in repeat business in the year. 
Finally, within operations, investments in areas including 
point of sale systems and new staff scheduling tools drove 
improvements as we seek to standardise and simplify  
our processes globally. A standout area of progress here 
was our omni-channel programme, which has significantly 
increased the amount of product available to our online 
customers by enabling us to fulfil e-commerce orders  
from store stock. 
Alongside this initial emphasis on our retail business we are 
sharpening our focus on how we inspire customers more 
consistently across channels, not least working closely with 
our wholesale partners to create a stronger, more carefully 
curated Burberry offer globally. With scope to accelerate 
this activity to drive still-greater coherence and support 
brand perception, this is important work for the future.
E-commerce Leadership
Through early investment and focus, we have established  
a leading position in digital in our industry, with more  
than 48 million followers on social media worldwide  
and a ‘Genius’ ranking from the influential think-tank L2.  
We aim to consolidate this leadership position over the 
coming years, while deploying it more assertively to drive 
online sales on our own website, and through third parties.  
From enabling seamless customer journeys across digital 
platforms, to using technology to service our customers  
in stores, and – critically – linking these online and offline 
worlds, we are well-placed to extend our leadership in  
this area. 
The evolution of Burberry.com was a key focus during  
the year. The relaunch of the global site on mobile and 
desktop offered customers a richer brand experience at  
the same time as better functionality, improving conversion 
on both platforms and driving mobile to nearly 60% of our 
online traffic. Meanwhile, the redesign of our China site to 
tailor it more effectively to local preferences and behaviours 
drove increases of around 70% in direct-to-consumer 
sales, while giving valuable insights for our overall site 
development for the future. Finally, we soft-launched  
our new customer app towards the end of the year, ahead  
of a global rollout early in 2017/18. This will offer a more 
personalised shopping experience for our customers,  
both online and by linking them more effectively to our 
stores and sales associates globally.
14
Strategic Report – Introduction This emphasis on facilitating experiences across the 
physical and digital worlds has long been a focus for 
Burberry, because it reflects how our customers live  
today. And we have never been more excited about the 
opportunities that technology offers in this space, nor  
more convinced it must be central to how we evolve our 
offer. Whether partnering with leaders in social media to 
bring our physical moments to life for online audiences,  
or enabling purchases straight from the runway for next  
day delivery globally, we see great future potential here. 
Finally, we saw particularly strong growth in sales through 
third parties over the year, as we enhanced our focus on 
developing our relationships in this space. For example,  
we collaborated with established offline partners including 
Harrods in London, Shinsegae in Korea and Barneys in the 
US to develop unique products and experiences for their 
websites; we deepened our relationships with pure play 
online retailers such as My Theresa and Moda Operandi 
through elevated digital experiences for our runway shows 
and collections; and we continued to innovate in the area  
of social commerce, including making exclusive products 
available for purchase via WeChat. These kinds of 
partnerships will form an important part of realising  
our future e-commerce ambitions and we have exciting 
plans ahead.
Operational Excellence
Our fourth pillar, Operational Excellence, is focused on 
driving efficiency and investing appropriately to support  
our wider growth plans. We have real headroom in this 
area, with particular scope to simplify our processes, 
procure more effectively, optimise our inventory 
management and improve information and technology. 
Turning first to processes, following a detailed review of 
opportunities to standardise activities across our shared 
services we moved towards a simpler, single global way  
of working during the year, which drove good initial results. 
We intend to accelerate these in 2017/18 with the planned 
establishment of Burberry Business Services in Leeds,  
a new centre of excellence in which we intend to bring 
together our UK and EMEIA shared services teams from 
Commercial Procurement, Finance and HR, as well as 
some customer service and IT roles.
In procurement, we have begun to make changes that  
will enable us to realise significant financial benefits  
over time, including through the implementation of a  
new technology solution to streamline how we manage  
our non-stock purchases and using customer insight  
data to target our marketing spend more effectively. 
We also made further improvements to our inventory 
management process as we seek to provide our customers 
with a great experience, wherever and however they are 
shopping with us. Actions during the year included the 
expansion of our single pool of inventory programme,  
which allows us to fulfil customer orders from stock in  
both hubs and stores; quicker delivery times and enhanced 
delivery information for online purchases; and a new, 
facilitated returns process. 
Finally, the further development of our technology 
infrastructure is underpinning many of these early  
advances and will be central to delivering on our broader 
commitments across all of our strategic priorities over  
time. With work well progressed for new digital tools  
that will improve how we operate in areas from planning,  
to supply chain, to enhancing customer service in stores,  
we have an ambitious plan in place to initiate further 
changes to our systems over the coming year. This will 
prioritise business continuity, security and the rollout of  
a common, standardised technology platform globally,  
to facilitate efficiency business-wide. 
Inspired People
These changes to our systems and processes will be 
complemented by an evolution of our overall ways of 
working, which form a critical part of our final pillar, Inspired 
People. Our focus here is to ensure we have the right skills 
and capabilities to meet our strategic objectives, that we 
build an organisation that is the right shape and size for  
the future, and that our teams are motivated and inspired. 
We consider this work fundamental to the successful 
delivery of our overall productivity and efficiency ambitions, 
and are putting commensurate energy and care into  
its execution as we manage our organisation through  
a period of significant change. 
An important early step has been detailed work to  
consider how we might evolve our operating model.  
This has focused on how our structure could better  
support our aims of driving greater global consistency  
while better meeting the needs of our local customers,  
as well as simplifying our broader ways of working.  
We are currently concluding this work as we design  
our organisation for the future, and changes are  
already underway. 
15
Strategic Report – Introduction In tandem with changes to how we are structured  
and how we work, we have also renewed our focus on 
culture through a more vibrant engagement programme, 
designed to reignite our values of ‘Protect, Explore and 
Inspire’ and our distinctive pioneering spirit. From initiatives 
designed to immerse every employee in the creativity  
and craft behind our products, to new forums that bring 
together our global teams around shared priorities, we 
continue to explore new ways to inspire and connect our 
people. This has been further reinforced by an increased 
emphasis on fostering talent at all levels in the Company, 
with highlights in the year including the graduation of our 
first cohort of Burberry Apprentices and enhanced training 
and development opportunities. 
The final area I would highlight under Inspired People is our 
wider commitment to the places and communities where 
we live and work. This is a fundamental part of our culture 
as an organisation, and our focus on this area in recent 
years has seen us make a real impact, from the reductions 
in the environmental impact of our operations that saw us 
named last year as a Textiles, Apparel and Luxury Goods 
industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 
the first time, to the real difference we have made to the 
lives of thousands of disadvantaged young people around 
the world through the work of the Burberry Foundation.
Encouraged by this progress and with the appetite to  
do much more, we finalised plans during the year to bring 
together our sustainability work, philanthropic giving and 
volunteering under a new and more ambitious Burberry 
Responsibility strategy. This is designed to address the 
most material social and environmental challenges in and 
around our operational footprint and will focus on three 
areas: positively impacting the communities that sustain 
our industry; creating positive change through all our 
products; and achieving carbon neutrality and revaluing 
waste. Each of these will have a set of challenging,  
public-facing goals and a flagship programme to be 
delivered hand-in-hand with expert partners. We look 
forward to announcing the detail of this programme soon.
Clear objectives, timelines and success measures  
are now in place for each of these five strategies, and  
their delivery is being overseen by a newly established 
Transformation Management Office, reporting to our  
Chief Operating and Financial Officer.
Looking ahead 
And so, to close, a final few words about the future.
This will be my last letter to you as Chief Creative and  
Chief Executive Officer of Burberry, with Marco assuming 
the role of Chief Executive Officer in July. In many ways,  
I see one of the highlights of my term as Chief Executive 
Officer as the recruitment of Marco to be a partner for me, 
and a great leader for this Company. As I transition into  
the new role of President and Chief Creative Officer, this 
evolved structure will allow me to redouble my focus on 
design for this next phase, and on making products and 
telling stories that inspire our customers. This is the 
essence of who we are, and what we do – and my passion 
for making Burberry the most compelling brand, selling the 
most beautiful and finely crafted products, in the most 
innovative ways has never been stronger. 
Over the past three years I have worked with our  
leadership team to put Burberry on what we believe  
is the right track for the coming years, through a period  
of real challenge and change for our business and the 
industry as a whole. And, with a clear plan now in place,  
I will remain fully engaged with the implementation of  
this plan in my new role as I partner with Marco and our 
evolved senior leadership team to drive the Company’s 
future strategic direction. 
So it is with huge optimism that I look forward to the  
next chapter for this brand of which I am so proud.
Over the past 161 years, Burberry has never stood still.  
In the past 15 years alone, this is a Company that has 
transformed from a predominantly licensed business,  
to a wholesale business, to our focus today on creating  
a leading luxury retail and digital business for this next 
phase. Which means we have shown our ability to change 
and adapt in the past – and we are now positioned to  
do so again for the future. 
With so much opportunity identified across our business 
and a detailed programme in place to unlock it, we know 
this will be challenging work – and it will take time. But we 
are also confident of its rewards. With the right team and 
ways of working in place, we are ready.

Strategic Report – Burberry Group Overview
brand highlights
Burberry’s ambition is to bring pioneering British creativity and culture to the world by creating beautifully made products, 
inspiring with storytelling and shared experiences, delivering impeccable and distinctive services, and continually innovating. 
This underpins how Burberry seeks to connect with its customers globally, from runway shows, campaign talent and music  
to digital platforms, data and insight.
The Burberry brand continues to resonate strongly with luxury consumers around the world, ending the year as one of the  
best known luxury brands globally*.
Key focus areas during the year
Runway shows 
In February 2016, Burberry announced plans to change  
the way it creates, presents and sells its runway collections 
with the launch of its first ‘see-now-buy-now’ runway  
show. From September 2016, Burberry replaced its four-
show calendar of two mens and two womens shows, with 
two shows. The September and February shows featured 
both womenswear and menswear collections. The new 
show format and calendar were designed with a global 
customer in mind. More than 300 stores had three runway 
looks from the February 2017 collection, and the entire 
runway collection was available to purchase in 80 stores 
globally immediately following the runway show. Both the 
September and February collections were also available to 
purchase online as the products were shown on the runway. 
This industry leading change removed the traditional gap 
between the runway show and retail availability.
For the week following the September and February shows, 
the public were invited to visit Makers House, the Burberry 
show venue. In September, Burberry collaborated with The 
New Craftsmen, a selection of Britain’s finest craft makers, 
to create a daily changing programme of activities and 
installations showcasing their original works. In February, 
Burberry partnered with The Henry Moore Foundation to 
create an exhibition of Moore’s working methods and the 
evolution of his iconic sculptural ideas. The exhibition 
featured over 40 of his sculptures, monumental bronzes, 
working models, drawings and maquettes. 
Alongside this, a programme of events featured acoustic 
performances and workshops including life drawing, 
maquette and object making, textile printmaking and  
textile design. Makers House received over 20,000 visitors  
in September and over 30,000 visitors in February. 
Digital innovation 
Burberry is one of the most followed luxury companies  
on social media, with over 48 million followers and the 
brand is present on 20 social platforms including Twitter, 
Instagram, Facebook, Line, Kakao and WeChat. In March 
2017, Burberry was ranked Number 1 Digital Leader in the 
ContactLab Digital Competitive Map. Thirty-two major 
luxury peers were researched for the study and were  
rated across web, email, e-commerce and social media. 
During the year, Burberry launched WeChat commerce  
in China, and created a seamless commerce platform for 
Burberry on Facebook Messenger where customers could 
purchase Burberry products directly through the social 
media platform. Burberry also launched its first commercial 
app for iPhone with exclusive and personalised content. 
Burberry partnered with Snapchat for its February show  
by filming rehearsals, backstage activities and the Show 
itself using Snapchat Spectacles.
At the February Makers House show, Burberry built a 
portrait studio, a set inspired by Henry Moore’s studio. 
Guests were invited to have their portrait taken in the  
studio and share the image and GIF (animated image)  
on social media. This generated over four million 
impressions on social media in one week.
Product and campaign launches 
Mr. Burberry – April 2016
The Mr. Burberry fragrance campaign launched in April 
2016, including TV, print and a director’s cut film shot by

film featured British actor and musician Josh Whitehouse 
and British model and actress Amber Anderson, with the 
soundtrack ‘I Won’t Complain’ created by British singer-
songwriter and Mercury Music prize-winner Benjamin 
Clementine. Customers were able to personalise their  
Mr. Burberry bottle with a monogramming service  
Burberry’s brand strength is driven by a unique  
combination of heritage and innovation.  21
Strategic Report – Burberry Group Overview
available at Burberry.com and selected Burberry and 
wholesale stores. Users were also able to monogram  
their own virtual Mr. Burberry bottle using interactive 
advertising and to share it on Facebook, Twitter,  
Pinterest and Instagram.
As part of the Mr. Burberry launch, Burberry became the  
first luxury brand to have a dedicated experience in the 
Discover section of Snapchat. The Mr. Burberry Discover 
channel offered access to a wealth of style and fragrance 
content, including tailoring and grooming tips. 
My Burberry Black – August 2016
Burberry launched My Burberry Black, a new fragrance  
for women, with the brand’s first Snapchat Lens and  
a campaign starring British actress Lily James. Customers 
were able to watch the campaign unfold as Lily took over 
Burberry’s Snapchat channel. A unique My Burberry Black 
Lens was created to immerse users into the aesthetic of  
the campaign. The takeover culminated with the reveal  
of the TV campaign across multiple platforms globally, 
including on large outdoor screens in Piccadilly, London.
Artisans Campaign – September 2016
In its September print campaign, Burberry featured the 
artisans who create key Burberry products, giving the 
customers the chance to connect with, and understand  
the craftsmanship behind these products.
Kris Wu Edit – November 2016
Burberry revealed the ‘Kris Wu Edit’, a collaboration  
with the Chinese musician, actor and the brand’s new 
ambassador. The campaign, which ran in China, featured 
Kris wearing five curated Burberry looks. Burberry’s work 
with Kris Wu continued at the February 2017 runway show 
where he featured in exclusive show content filmed for  
the Asian Burberry social media platforms. 
Festive – November 2016
Burberry launched its Festive campaign with the film  
‘The Tale of Thomas Burberry’ directed by Academy 
Award
®
-winning director, Asif Kapadia. The film celebrated 
the life of Burberry founder, Thomas Burberry and starred 
Sienna Miller, Lily James, Domhnall Gleeson and Dominic 
West. Real-life moments re-enacted in the film included 
Thomas Burberry’s invention of the weatherproof fabric 
gabardine, dressing the military, and outfitting polar 
explorers and pilots. The film received 22 million views and 
was shared on social media platforms including YouTube, 
Instagram and Twitter. The campaign was complemented 
by Festive events and advertising including Burberry’s  
first-ever festive partnership with Harrods, through which 
Burberry designed and featured in all street level windows, 
and a dedicated pop-up space. 
The cape reimagined – February 2017
A collection of 78 limited-edition couture capes was 
presented as part of Burberry’s February show finale. 
Inspired by the scale and form of Moore’s elemental 
sculptures, each design was made using unique 
constructions and referencing elements from the  
Burberry archive. Each individually named cape was 
available for special order, and formed part of a travelling 
exhibition around the world to cities including Milan, 
Shanghai, Los Angeles, Dubai, New York, Hong Kong  
and Tokyo.
Tropical gabardine – February 2017
During the February runway show, Burberry launched 
tropical gabardine, a lightweight version of the 
weatherproof fabric found in Burberry’s heritage  
trench coats. 
DK88 bag collection – May 2017
Named after the house code for Burberry’s signature  
honey coloured gabardine, the DK88 bag collection is  
a tribute to the fabric at the heart of Burberry’s history.  
The collection includes top handle, satchel and luggage 
inspired styles for men and women. Each design is made 
from Burberry’s new trench leather, which is embossed 
with the pattern of gabardine by using special plates 
developed to create a unique leather finish. In May 2017, 
Burberry partnered with Mr. Bags, a Chinese influencer,  
for the exclusive WeChat shop launch of the DK88 in  
bright toffee colour.  Founded in 1856, Burberry is a global luxury brand with a distinctive British identity.
Since the invention of gabardine by Thomas Burberry more than 130 years ago, Burberry has built a reputation  
for design, innovation and craftsmanship. Outerwear has been at the core of the business and remains so  
today – best expressed through the iconic Burberry trench coat.
What Burberry does
Burberry designs, develops, makes and sells luxury products under the Burberry brand.
Designs and develops: At Burberry’s London headquarters the design studio acts as the creative hub of the Company,  
with creative talent and activities including product design and development centred there.
Makes: Fabrics, other materials and finished products are sourced and manufactured at Burberry-owned facilities in  
the UK and through an external supplier network, predominantly located in Europe. This includes the Burberry Mill and 
Burberry’s Castleford manufacturing facility, both of which are located in Yorkshire, England. More information on  
Burberry’s product mix is on page 26.
Sells: Creative and marketing content and programmes to engage consumers with the Burberry brand and its products  
are developed internally. Burberry products are sold globally through its directly operated store network and online at  
Burberry.com, as well as through franchisees and third-party retailers, both offline and online. In a few selected areas  
such as Eyewear and Beauty (from October 2017), Burberry uses the product and distribution expertise of licensing 
partners. More information on Burberry’s channel and regional mix is on pages 24 and 25.

BUSINESS MODEL How Burberry creates value
For its customers: By creating beautifully made products, inspiring with its storytelling and shared experiences,  
delivering impeccable and distinctive services and continually innovating.
For its shareholders: By maximising shareholder value through executing on Burberry’s strategies to deliver revenue  
growth and capital returns. More information on the Group’s Capital Allocation Framework is on page 59.
For its people and communities: By ensuring that employees are motivated and inspired and by adopting a responsible 
approach to everything it does, while investing in the communities in which Burberry operates. More information on  
Inspired People is on page 44 and Responsibility is on pages 47 to 51.
Burberry’s business model is best illustrated through the iconic Burberry trench coat – one of the many products 
Burberry designs, develops, makes and sells.
Burberry is committed to the creation of authentic and distinctive products and continuous innovation 
in fashion, design and manufacturing. The original trench coat was designed to serve the needs of the 
military in the early 20th century. Epaulettes displayed an officer’s rank, while the belt’s metal D-rings 
were used to attach equipment. Today, all products are created and designed in Burberry's London 
studios by a team of dedicated designers, with the customer front of mind.
Gabardine fabric was invented by Thomas Burberry more than 130 years ago. The innovative cotton 
fabric, which is both breathable and weatherproof, revolutionised rainwear that had been heavy  
and uncomfortable to wear. Burberry gabardine was used by explorers such as Sir Ernest Shackleton, 
who wore Burberry gabardine for three Antarctic expeditions. Burberry’s Heritage trench coat 
continues to be made from gabardine and the design reflects the key features of the original.
Burberry continues to innovate with the recent introduction of tropical gabardine, woven for ultra-
lightweight protection in mild weather. 
Burberry’s gabardine and tropical gabardine fabrics are dyed and woven at the Burberry Mill located 
in Keighley, Yorkshire. The Burberry Mill produces the check lining fabrics used in the Heritage trench 
coat, as well as fabrics for accessories such as shoes and bags. 23% of the cotton used to create 
gabardine is sourced from Peru, where Burberry has been sourcing cotton for over 30 years. 
The Heritage trench coat is made in Castleford, Yorkshire, by expert craftsmen and women combining 
traditional techniques with modern technology. The coats are handmade using over 100 individual 
processes, with the most intricate of these being the crafting of the collar which takes more than 180 
stitches to create a fluid curve. It can take up to a year for an individual to learn the sewing technique 
alone, demonstrating the skill and craftsmanship which goes into creating the iconic trench coat.
Once the Heritage trench coat has been finished the 'Burberry Made in England' label is applied  
and it is ready for customers to purchase globally in-store and online at Burberry.com. 
Monogramming is also available to enable customers to personalise their Heritage trench coat.

Key performance  
indicators
The Company assesses its performance against a wide range of measures. 
These key performance indicators (KPIs) help management measure progress 
against the Company’s key strategies.
Financial measures
The Board believes it is important to ensure alignment between executive management’s strategic focus and the long-term 
interests of shareholders. As a result, elements of executive remuneration are based on performance against the following 
measures: revenue growth, adjusted PBT growth and adjusted retail/wholesale return on invested capital, which are linked  
to the key strategies as shown below. For details of the Group’s key strategies, see pages 33 to 44. For details of the  
Group’s remuneration policy, see pages 87 to 111. 
Revenue growth*
This measures the appeal of the Burberry brand 
to customers, through all its sales channels. 
 For more detail on the Company’s revenue 
performance see pages 54 to 58.
Strategic link
All key strategies
Total revenue in FY 2017 
declined by 2% underlying. 
Retail growth of 3% was  
offset by a decline in 
wholesale (down 14%) and 
licensing (down 48%), in part 
reflecting actions to build  
and reinforce Burberry’s 
luxury brand positioning.
Adjusted PBT growth*
#
 
Adjusted PBT growth is a key profitability 
measure to assess the underlying performance 
of the Company.
Strategic link
All key strategies
Adjusted PBT in FY 2017  
was down 21% underlying. 
This reflected lower  
wholesale revenue, including 
Beauty, and a reduction in 
licensing income due to the 
planned expiry of Japanese 
licences, partially offset  
by cost savings.
Adjusted retail/wholesale return on  
invested capital (ROIC)
~
Adjusted retail/wholesale ROIC measures  
the efficient use of capital to ensure returns on 
future investments are attractive. It is 
calculated as the post-tax adjusted operating 
profit divided by average operating assets over  
the period for the retail/wholesale segment. 
Strategic link
All key strategies
Adjusted retail/wholesale 
ROIC has increased by  
70 basis points to 15.4% 
predominantly due to growth 
in reported adjusted PBT of 
10%. Operating assets have 
grown by 2% in the period, 
predominantly as a result of 
exchange rate movements.

Non-financial measures
Non-financial measures have a useful role alongside financial measures to inform decision-making and to evaluate  
Group performance. As announced in May 2016, against a backdrop of a challenging external environment for the luxury 
sector, Burberry has accelerated its productivity and efficiency agenda, particularly looking at its ways of working. As a  
result, Burberry has identified significant growth opportunities across its existing channels, products and regions. To exploit  
these opportunities Burberry is focusing on five key strategies, the details of which are set out on pages 33 to 44. Burberry  
is developing non-financial measures to assess its performance against its key strategies and will aim to disclose non-financial 
measures in the future. For detail on Burberry’s corporate responsibility activities and its progress against 2017 environmental 
targets, see pages 47 to 51.
Adjusted diluted EPS in  
FY 2017 was 77.4p up 11% 
at reported rates, reflecting 
growth in Group profit  
and lower non-controlling 
interests, partially offset  
by a higher tax rate.
Adjusted diluted EPS growth

Strategic Report – Burberry Group Overview Macro environment 
Economic
During the 2016 calendar year, the global economy grew 
by 3.1%, a deceleration versus 2015 at 3.5%. The year  
was marked by a slowdown of the US economy, heightened 
uncertainty in the Eurozone and increased geopolitical 
concerns in the Middle East and Russia. In addition 
commodity prices rebounded in 2016, particularly oil,  
which almost doubled in the year, leading to increased 
inflation rates in the US and Europe.
Across the major economies, the US grew by 1.6% after  
a slow start to the year. The recovery of oil prices and  
the stabilisation of the dollar enabled the economy to 
accelerate in the second half. In Asia, China’s economy 
grew by 6.7%, a continued deceleration from 6.9% in 2015 
and 7.3% in 2014. Increased public spending and credit 
growth measures exacerbated concerns around a real 
estate bubble and hastened capital outflows. Hong Kong 
experienced modest GDP growth of 1.9%, a decline from 
2.4% in 2015, impacted by slowing exports, a cooling 
property market and slowing private consumption. The 
Japanese economy returned to growth at 1.0% as exports 
recovered, although private consumption and capital 
expenditure remained weak. South Korea GDP growth 
remained stable at 2.7%, in line with 2015 at 2.6%, which 
was impacted by the MERS outbreak. The Eurozone 
declined slightly to 1.7% despite strong growth rates  
in Spain, Germany and Ireland. In the UK, GDP grew  
by 1.8%, a deceleration from 2.2% in 2015. Across key 
developing markets, Russia and Brazil exhibited early  
signs of a recovery from deep recession. Finally, the  
Middle East economy started to recover, supported by 
increasing oil prices.
Socio-economic and environmental
The year was marked by a number of socio-economic  
and environmental events. These included the results  
of the UK Brexit referendum, the highly polarised US 
election campaign, the worsening of the migrant crisis  
in the Eurozone, the increased incidence of cyber attacks  
and terrorist attacks such as those in Nice, Berlin, Paris  
and London. In addition, there was the continued impact 
of the El Niño weather phenomenon, which made 2016 the 
warmest year on record – the third consecutive year a new 
global annual temperature record has been set.
Luxury sector*
Markets
This challenging global macro-economic backdrop had a 
significant impact on the performance of the luxury sector. 
At constant exchange rates, sector sales growth in 2016 
was flat, in line with the 1% growth experienced in 2015, 
although performance improved significantly in the second 
half of the year. Underlying growth at constant exchange 
rates of 4% in China and 1% in Europe was partially offset 
by declines in the Americas and Japan.
Mainland China** experienced a recovery after several  
years of stagnation. Repatriation of Chinese consumption 
commenced as price differentials with other global  
markets narrowed and the Chinese government  
introduced initiatives to reduce grey market activities  
and limit overseas shopping. Despite the recovery in 
Mainland China, overall luxury consumption by Chinese 
nationals declined for the first time in recent records.  
In Continental Europe, performance was negatively 
impacted by declining tourist consumption due to terrorist 
attacks and stricter visa rules for Chinese visitors. These 
negative dynamics were offset by the recovery of local 
consumption in most countries and the strong tourist flows 
to the UK attracted by the devaluation of Sterling. In the 
Americas, the US market continued to underperform as  
the strong Dollar resulted in lower tourist spend and local 
consumption suffered from the uncertainty around the 
30
Strategic Report – Burberry Group Overview
MARKET 
OVERVIEW presidential election. Hong Kong, one of the most profitable 
luxury markets in the world, continued to decline due to its 
decreasing popularity as a destination for Chinese tourists. 
In Japan, the appreciation of the Yen reduced Chinese 
tourists’ consumption and stimulated overseas purchases 
by Japanese customers. South Korea grew by 13% 
at constant exchange rates driven by returning Chinese 
tourism after the 2015 MERS outbreak. Finally, the Middle 
East continued to decline, driven by poor consumption by 
both local and tourist customers. Eastern Europe started  
to recover, particularly with local consumers in Russia. 
More widely, luxury customers continue to mature 
becoming increasingly discerning in their shopping 
experiences, expecting a high level of service, exciting 
experiences and innovative and bespoke products.
Channels
Globally, the retail channel continued to outperform 
wholesale and now accounts for 35% of luxury 
consumption. This channel grew by 1%, driven by store 
perimeter expansion which more than offset negative  
like-for-like performance. Digital commerce remained the 
fastest-growing channel in the sector and now accounts  
for 7% of total luxury sales. Key drivers of this growth 
included strong performance in the Asia region and the 
sustained momentum of mobile commerce. Travel retail 
continued to outperform the sector and grew by high 
single-digits despite being negatively impacted by shifting 
tourist flows. Finally, the wholesale channel declined by  
2% in 2016, mainly driven by the continued deterioration  
of US department store sales and Asian watch retailers.
Products
For the sector, Beauty was the fastest-growing product 
category at 4% growth driven by Asia and the Americas. 
Accessories grew by 1% with positive momentum from 
shoes and leather goods, particularly at entry price  
points, men’s travel, and usage occasion products such  
as backpacks. The apparel category declined by 4%,  
driven by poor performance from luxury brands with  
a high apparel mix and partially offset by strong growth 
from luxury denim and down-jackets, and the resurgence  
of sports-lines and active wear. Finally, hard luxury 
continued to struggle driven by weak performance  
in Asia, particularly at high price points.
Outlook
Industry analysts forecast that the personal luxury  
sector will grow by low to mid single-digit percentage  
in the medium term at constant exchange rates, driven  
by a recovery of the US market and the rebound of Chinese 
global spending. Japan is expected to remain challenging, 
and the Hong Kong market difficult. Over the longer term, 
the luxury market should benefit from the growing Chinese 
middle class and the recovery of developed market 
consumers, increased concentration of wealth in global 
destination cities, improving macro and socio-economic 
trends, strong luxury consumer travel flows, and the 
continued increasing penetration of digital commerce.

key strategies
Burberry’s ambition is to bring pioneering British creativity and culture 
to the world by creating beautifully made products, inspiring with  
its storytelling and shared experiences, delivering impeccable and 
distinctive services, and continually innovating. Burberry’s key strategies 
and progress made during the year, are set out on the following pages. 34
Strategic Report – Key Strategies
INTRODUCTION: Driving 
growth and productivity
In May 2016, against the backdrop of a challenging external 
environment for the luxury sector, Burberry outlined its 
plans to accelerate its productivity and efficiency agenda, 
particularly its ways of working. Burberry also identified 
significant future organic revenue growth opportunities that 
would build over time and a programme of actions to deliver 
at least £100m of annualised cost savings by FY 2019.
For Burberry, FY 2017 has marked a transition year, with  
its plans for growth over time and simplification built into 
five key strategies. Three of these strategies are focused  
on optimising revenue growth (Product Focus, Productive 
Space and E-commerce Leadership), enabled by 
Operational Excellence and Inspired People, to improve 
efficiency and ensure Burberry has the right capabilities  
to deliver. These five key strategies are summarised  
below and listed, together with their relevant objectives  
and initiatives, in the table opposite.
 ·
Product Focus: Focusing on key product categories  
by establishing a strategic approach, implementing  
end-to-end category management, enhancing store 
assortments and simplifying the product offer.
 ·
Productive Space: Improving end-to-end retail disciplines 
to drive retail productivity, through a multi-year retail 
excellence programme focusing on improving service 
and customer cultivation and investing in in-store 
operations. Also reviewing Burberry’s channel mix  
to continue to elevate the brand.
 ·
E-commerce Leadership: Leveraging the strong digital 
capability Burberry has built to drive revenues both on  
its own platform and through third-party relationships, 
and to continue sector-leading innovation in this fast-
growing channel.
 ·
Operational Excellence: Improving the efficiency  
and effectiveness of core processes, realising savings 
through procurement, optimising inventory management 
and continuing to invest appropriately in information  
and technology to support Burberry’s growth and 
productivity plan.
 ·
Inspired People: Ensuring that Burberry has highly 
engaged people with the skills and capabilities needed  
to deliver its ambitions, with a focus on improved  
ways of working. This includes a continued commitment  
to Burberry’s unique culture and values, recognising  
and rewarding talent, as well as leading the industry  
in responsibility.
Burberry has worked to refine and embed these key 
strategies into the business, supported by a Transformation 
Management Office to drive and coordinate the delivery  
of these strategies, which is overseen by the Chief 
Operating and Financial Officer and which provides regular 
updates to the Board. In this first year, Burberry has put  
the foundations in place for the revenue growth drivers,  
the benefits of which are expected to build over time,  
and is encouraged by early results with the following:
 ·
new product outperforming and strength in bags
 ·
improved mainline retail conversion and retention
 ·
growth in digital as Burberry invests in omni-channel 
customer journeys
Burberry has delivered the planned £20m of cost savings  
in FY 2017. This is expected to build to c. £50m in FY 2018 
and is on track to deliver the target of at least £100m 
annualised in FY 2019. 
The following pages provide a more detailed summary  
of each of the five key strategies and progress on the 
initiatives supporting each of these.
Burberry has identified significant growth opportunities 
across its existing channels, products and regions that will 
build over time, underpinned by efficiency opportunities. 35

Best place to be Implementing new 
ways of working, 
while committed  
to unique culture  
and values Great product is the foundation of Burberry’s growth  
and productivity goals. Burberry has a broad product offer,  
with strength in both heritage and fashion across genders 
and categories. However, Burberry has generally a wider 
product assortment than its peers. Simplifying the product 
offer will enable the customer to discover fashion and 
newness more easily. It will also provide the opportunity  
to tailor the assortment more effectively for local  
customer needs. 
Key enablers of future growth include the following.
 ·
Build a strategic approach to core product categories: 
Developing mid to long-term strategies for Burberry’s 
core product categories to simplify the offer, reduce 
assortments, and to improve the visibility of fashion  
and newness.
 ·
Implement end-to-end category management: 
Introducing new ways of working across all product 
functions to align category performance, enhance 
accountability and ensure customers remain front  
of mind during the product development life cycle. 
 ·
Enhance store assortments and simplify the product 
offer: Using a centrally directed buying process to ensure 
the consistency and relevance of the global product offer, 
while also simplifying the customer shopping experience 
and reducing back-of-house complexity.
Progress during the year 
Build a strategic approach to core product categories
 ·
A comprehensive strategy is being developed to grow 
each core product category taking into account target 
customers, price points and product icons based  
around key pillars and shapes. The aim is to respond  
to demand for Burberry’s most luxurious products  
while also introducing more innovation and creativity 
at opening price points. 
 ·
During the year, the initial focus was on evolving 
Burberry’s bag offer around a new pillar and shape 
strategy. New launches included the DK88 signature 
collection, the Bridle bag and the Buckle bag family, 
which resulted from the commercialisation of last year’s 
Patchwork bag. The new shapes have been successful 
with women’s bag sales outperforming other categories 
during the year. 
 ·
Burberry announced its strategic partnership with Coty  
in April 2017 to accelerate the growth and development 
of its Beauty business, through an exclusive licensing 
agreement to take effect from October 2017. Leveraging 
the strengths of each partner, Burberry will lead on 
creative elements of the business while benefiting from 
Coty’s industry expertise and global distribution platform.
 ·
In the coming year, Burberry will continue to develop  
and execute on its product category strategies  
including building on its tradition in outerwear, heritage  
in cashmere and developing small leather goods to  
add innovation at the entry price offering. 
Implement end-to-end category management
 ·
Burberry is implementing new ways of working  
across all product functions including merchandising, 
planning, design, product development, supply chain  
and marketing. The aim is to improve collaboration  
and customer/product focus throughout the product-
development life cycle. Initial organisational changes 
have been implemented in the central teams, the 
Americas and EMEIA, with Asia to follow. This end-to-
end product focused approach will ensure that Burberry 
delivers inspirational products and brand experiences  
to its customers.
Enhance store assortments and simplify the product offer
 ·
In November, Burberry successfully implemented its 
move to one label across its retail network. This has 
simplified the customer shopping experience as well  
as reducing back-of-house complexity, with stores 
merchandised by product rather than label. The one  
label roll-out was supported by a comprehensive training 
programme for retail staff and visual merchandising. 
 ·
Burberry reduced its product option count by 15–20% 
over the year. This has simplified its product offering 
while balancing stronger focus on fashion and newness 
in-store.
 ·
Burberry has also developed a new store profiling model 
to support the evolved buying process. This tailors the 
product offer to reflect the particular store profile. In 
particular, this model classifies stores in greater detail, 
using a combination of in-house and local data sources, 
such as customer demographics and product purchasing 
behaviours, as well as data such as climate.
From product breadth to product focus.

Strategic Report – Key Strategies
PRODUCT  
FOCUS  37 Burberry’s business model has evolved from being a 
predominantly wholesale to a predominantly retail model. 
There is a significant opportunity to improve Burberry’s  
end-to-end retail disciplines and to continue to evolve  
the omni-channel experience. 
Alongside this initial emphasis on the retail business, 
Burberry is sharpening its focus on how it inspires 
customers across all channels. This includes working 
closely with its wholesale partners to create a stronger, 
more carefully curated Burberry offer globally, to drive 
greater coherence and to support the brand perception.
The initial focus for Productive Space is Burberry’s multi-
year retail excellence programme. Key areas of focus for 
the retail excellence programme include the following.
 ·
Elevate service and training: Elevating Burberry’s  
global approach to service, supported by improved  
sales associate training.
 ·
Improve customer cultivation and retention: Embedding  
a customer-centric mindset into all behaviours and 
decisions, supported by customer insight.
 ·
Invest in in-store operations: Improving store operations 
to a single global standard, to enhance the customer 
experience and streamline processes.
Progress during the year 
Elevate service and training
 ·
Burberry significantly increased its investment in globally 
consistent training, including enhanced retail sales 
associate conferences and field training. 
 ·
A new service model was rolled out to all retail sales 
associates in 2016/17, supporting both conversion  
and repeat business through a standardised and more 
elevated approach to client engagement. 
 ·
Burberry also designed and implemented a  
client feedback programme based on the net promoter 
score methodology which measures the quality of 
customer experience. Initial results from the global launch 
are already being used to redefine processes and to 
evolve the approach to store management.
Improve customer cultivation and retention
 ·
Burberry extended its Customer Value Management 
outreach programme and expanded its Burberry  
Private Client team by more than 50%. This has enabled 
the delivery of exceptional service to these important 
customers and improved sales conversion, with an 
average transaction value double the global average  
for the Company. 
 ·
A new and enhanced digital selling tool is being 
developed with a launch date planned for 2017/18.
 ·
Customer insight is a key component of Burberry’s 
Customer Value Management outreach programme. 
Customer insight uses data, including information on 
buying behaviours, to define customer segments and 
enable Burberry to better understand its customers  
and how best to target them.
Invest in in-store operations
 ·
Burberry commenced an investment programme  
to standardise and simplify Burberry’s global retail 
operations. A particular focus during 2016/17 was the 
development of a new point of sale system, with the 
global rollout planned to continue through to 2018/19. 
 ·
Omni-channel customer preferences have been identified 
and processes developed to cater to these preferences 
including the rollout of store-based fulfilment, which 
enables the shipment of products directly from store  
to customers, starting in 2017.
 ·
Burberry is designing and testing best practice back-
and-front-of-house store operations including trialling 
store staff scheduling software.

LEADERSHIP
Burberry is recognised as a digital leader in the luxury 
sector. With an estimated 70% of its retail sales having 
involved support from digital technology at some point  
in the customer journey, its ambition is for digital to  
remain a clear point of differentiation with scope to be  
more ambitious commercially. This includes enabling 
seamless customer journeys across digital platforms  
and using technology to service customers in-store, while 
ensuring that these online and offline worlds are linked. 
Key areas of focus include the following.
 ·
Grow Burberry.com: Continuing to develop the 
commercial success of Burberry’s digital channel 
through improved customer experiences, enhanced 
service propositions and new technologies.
 ·
Leverage third-party relationships: Strategically  
growing Burberry’s partnerships to extend its  
digital presence, while ensuring a consistent  
brand experience.

or channel, globally.
Progress during the year
Grow Burberry.com
 ·
The key focus for 2016/17 was the development  
of Burberry.com with a relaunch both on desktop  
and mobile. The new site offers richer brand and  
product storytelling experiences and elevated product 
photography, as well as improved functionality with 
simplified navigation and increased localised payment 
methods including Apple Pay. Digital traffic on  
Burberry.com has increased year-on-year, with 
conversion improving in both desktop and  
mobile channels.
 ·
Burberry.com in China was launched both for desktop 
and mobile, so that it is better aligned for local customer 
behaviours and preferences, driving an increase in  
direct-to-consumer sales of around 70%.
Leverage third-party relationships
 ·
Burberry continued to develop best-in-class  
relationships with retailers online. This included 
Burberry’s collaboration with Barneys to develop  
unique products for its in-store and digital customers, 
which helped to elevate the brand’s positioning. 
 ·
Burberry also continued to innovate in social commerce, 
leveraging new technologies to collaborate with new 
partners. This included the opportunity for consumers  
to buy the Bridle bag on social media platform WeChat 
after the September show. This was expanded for the 
February show, with the collection made available to 
purchase through social media platforms Line, Kakao 
and Facebook Messenger. 
Deliver innovative omni-channel journeys
 ·
Burberry focused on creating an enhanced digital 
experience around its runway shows and key purchase 
moments such as Festive. This included the Facebook 
Messenger experience, which enabled customers  
to explore the collection in an interactive way via a 
Facebook Messenger Bot for the September show,  
the development of the virtual reality experience for the 
February show, and the launch of new payment options.
 ·
During the second half of the year, Burberry soft-
launched a new customer app, providing a more 
personalised shopping experience by connecting 
customers more effectively to Burberry stores and 
associates. The app offers seamless mobile commerce 
and a platform for interactive storytelling. The app  
will be rolled out globally in 2017/18.
 ·
As referenced in Productive Space, a major initiative has 
been the creation of an effective single pool of inventory 
to allow Burberry.com sales to be fulfilled by inventory 
held in hubs and stores.  42

OPERATIONAL 
EXCELLENCE
Focusing on efficiency and investing appropriately.
Operational Excellence is a multi-year programme and 
involves re-engineering Burberry’s systems and processes  
to ensure that they are fit for purpose for the Company’s  
next phase of growth.
Key areas of focus include the following.

Burberry’s technology infrastructure to reflect changes  
in the Company’s scale and business model and to  
support the implementation of the key strategies.
Progress during the year 
Process simplification
 ·
Burberry undertook a detailed review of its key processes  
in finance, HR, IT, procurement and customer services, 
including benchmarking to peers. This highlighted a 
significant opportunity to simplify key business processes 
to increase efficiency and effectiveness, supported by  
the implementation of new technology solutions.
 ·
In May, Burberry announced plans to establish Burberry 
Business Services in Leeds. This will bring together shared 
services covering finance, HR, commercial procurement, 
and elements of IT and customer services. Savings will  
be generated from process improvements and lower  
facility costs.
Procure effectively
 ·
Burberry is working to transform procurement into  
a simplified and digitally enabled global process from 
sourcing to settlement, supported by the implementation  
of SAP Ariba technology. This should generate significant 
operational efficiencies and reduction in costs.
 ·
Burberry is focusing on improving the effectiveness of  
its marketing planning and spend, enabled by the use  
of its in-house customer data analytics and detailed 
econometric modelling.
Optimise inventory management
 ·
Burberry reviewed its current inventory flow to identify 
opportunities to streamline steps in the process, and  
to enable an improved omni-channel customer journey  
with greater product availability to customers. This will  
also enable Burberry to satisfy orders more efficiently  
from a virtual single pool of inventory, online delivery 
information, quicker delivery times and a facilitated  
returns process for customers. 
Improve information and technology
 ·
Burberry continues to develop its technology landscape  
to meet the fast-changing needs of the industry and  
to enable the Company to continue to drive innovation  
where it matters most. Programmes under way include  
the following.
 – Product Lifecycle Management Functions: A new digital 
tool to enable teams to better manage products from 
conception through to development, manufacture and 
final inspection. This tool will enable the more timely 
development of products, improved compliance and 
enhanced vendor and supplier collaboration.
 – Digital Sales Associate Tool: The development of  
a new retail staff tool to deliver enhanced customer 
service across the retail network using Customer 
Relationship Management software to improve  
product searches, manage aftersales service and  
capture customer information.
 – Global broadband: A network rollout to all stores to 
enable connectivity and to align the service through  
a single global contract.
 ·
The Company is preparing for further technology releases  
in 2017 to future-proof its core platforms. These changes 
will enable business continuity, improved security and  
the provision of a single global platform fit for purpose  
for the next phase of Burberry’s growth. The design  
process and the rollout timeline and phasing plans  
are prioritised based on business needs.  44

Progress during the year
Evolve operating model and improve ways of working
Burberry is redesigning its operating model across all 
regions and functions, and has agreed a transition and 
change management plan for phased implementation.  
The revised model aims to deliver the following.
 ·
A smaller and more streamlined central organisation.
 ·
Balancing global versus local operations to ensure  
that the needs of local customers are met while 
increasing global consistency. 
 ·
Simplified ways of working.
The redesigned operating model will provide increased 
accountability, a greater focus on a standardised global 
ways of working and better collaboration between  
regional and central teams.
Evolve culture and employee engagement 
A critical priority is to support and nurture Burberry’s 
unique culture, underpinned by strong employee 
engagement and Burberry’s values of Protect, Explore  
and Inspire. Burberry’s distinct culture reflects a global, 
united mindset; a pioneering, creative spirit; and  
a responsible approach to everything it does. 
A global programme in the second half of the year  
focused on reigniting these values across the business,  
and included the following. 
 ·
Burberry established a Change Champions group,  
as well as holding events and providing extensive 
communications to ensure employees understand  
the changes taking place within the Company and  
to obtain their feedback. 
 ·
Alongside the existing global employee engagement 
calendar, retail conferences were held in key markets, 
sharing new strategies and ways of working. 
 ·
Exceptional employee contribution across all areas  
of the business was celebrated through the annual 
Burberry Icon Awards, which received more than  
18,000 nominations, a record number. 
 ·
Craftspeople in the supply chain were celebrated  
in the September campaign, which showcased the 
artisans who make Burberry products. Employees 
continued to be connected to creative brand moments.
Enhance talent and reward programmes
Burberry focused on identifying and meeting the critical 
capabilities required to deliver the Company’s strategies.  
It also continued to foster a culture of recognition to support 
high performance and retention of talent through reward 
and enhanced training and development opportunities.  
Key achievements include the following.
 ·
The Company’s first cohort of Burberry Apprentices 
graduated during the year, having gained qualifications 
and experience in roles across retail, internal 
manufacturing and distribution in the UK.
 ·
A review of employee performance and talent 
management, resulting in a simplified approach.  
A successful pilot of this new approach took place,  
with the full rollout commencing in 2017/18.

While closing the old strategy, Burberry has also finalised 
ambitious new goals for the next five years, building on 
strong foundations, addressing key community, social  
and environmental challenges and opportunities,  
and leveraging Burberry’s unique assets in the most 
impactful way. Key areas of focus for the new strategy 
include the following.
 ·
Fostering resilient communities.
 ·
Creating positive change through sourcing and 
production.
 ·
Utilising key operational resources to reduce climate 
change impacts.
More details on Burberry’s new responsibility strategy  
will be available at www.burberryplc.com. 
Promoting responsible employment practices
 ·
The Company’s trading activities are guided by its 
Responsible Business Principles, which are underpinned 
by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the Fundamental Conventions of the International 
Labour Organisation and the Ethical Trading Initiative 
Base Code. Targets to promote and build fair and 
responsible employment practices are integrated into  
the performance objectives of the Company’s sourcing 
teams as well as at an individual level.
 ·
Burberry’s Ethical Trading Programme consists of 
announced and unannounced supply chain audits, 
ongoing monitoring and engagement, as well as focused 
improvement programmes. The Company continued to 
support factories in its supply chain through a number 
of engagement activities and new training programmes. 
Where access to grievance mechanisms is a particular 
challenge, confidential hotlines run by non-governmental 
organisations provide over 27,000

 workers across 53

factories with confidential support.

With Burberry’s Ethical Programme evolving year-on-year, 
the Company has focused on how it can make the most 
meaningful, positive impacts on the lives of people 
throughout its supply chain, rather than increasing the 
number of audits. Auditing remains, however, an important 
tool to help Burberry and its manufacturers identify areas 
that are in need of improvement.

Results of the FY 2017 audits show an overall positive shift 
in ethical trading performance by the Company’s apparel 
and non-apparel partners. New manufacturers who did not 
meet key requirements as outlined in Burberry’s Ethical 
Trading Code of Conduct were not accepted into the 
Company’s supply chain, others were found to meet key 
requirements but were asked to implement 
further improvements. 49
Strategic Report – Responsibility
 ·
Burberry completed its biennial Human Rights Impact 
Assessment and has set a number of mitigation actions, 
which have been reviewed by Ergon, a specialist 
consultancy in the field of human rights, and discussed with 
Oxfam, a globally renowned aid and development charity.
 ·
The Company also published its first statement in line  
with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, detailing the steps 
Burberry is taking to mitigate the risk of modern slavery 
occurring in its supply chain and business operations. 
Bespoke training was delivered to key teams and supply 
chain partners globally in order to build awareness and 
strengthen due diligence processes. This statement can 
be found at www.burberryplc.com.
 ·
Continuing its support for the Living Wage Foundation, 
Burberry joined the steering group of the Global Living 
Wage Initiative to discuss harnessing the increasing 
interest to address in-work poverty across all sectors  
and multiple geographies, as part of a unified, global 
approach with multi-stakeholder participation.
Human Rights Statement
The Group recognises its responsibility to respect human 
rights wherever it operates and conducted a Human Rights 
Impact Assessment in 2015 to identify the most salient risks 
in this area. This assessment was reviewed and updated in 
2017. The Group believes that potential risks arise in relation 
to its own workforce, its supply chain and communities, 
and its customers. Burberry’s Human Rights Policy sets  
out the Company’s commitments to respecting these 
stakeholders’ human rights. The Policy is informed by  
the International Bill of Human Rights and reflects the  
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
framework to Protect, Respect and Remedy. Responsibility 
for the Policy lies with Burberry’s Chief Creative and  
Chief Executive Officer.
Burberry has an established global team who work to 
promote human rights and good labour practices in the 
Burberry workplace as well as in the Company’s supply 
chain, as identified and prioritised through Human Rights 
Impact Assessments. Burberry provides grievance 
mechanisms for its global employees, as well as confidential 
hotlines in its supply chain where local labour laws are 
weak, absent or poorly enforced. Burberry publishes  
its Modern Slavery Statement in line with the UK Modern 
Slavery Act. This can be found at www.burberryplc.com. 
Investing in our communities
While conducting an in-depth review of its charitable giving 
activities over the last year, Burberry continued to support 
communities where its employees live and work through 
financial grants, employee time and in-kind donations.
 ·
Burberry continued to donate 1% of Group adjusted 
profits before tax (£4.6 million in FY 2017) to charitable 
causes around the world, with a significant proportion 
going to the Burberry Foundation (UK registered charity 
number 1154468). Other charitable investments included 
supporting the establishment of a new facility for the 
Defence and National Rehabilitation Centre, donating  
to disaster relief efforts and nurturing emerging creative 
talent through scholarships at the Royal College of  
Art and BAFTA.
 ·
The first cohort of Burberry Apprentices graduated in  
September 2016, with 90% of participants completing 
the programme. The Company expanded the programme 
in August when a second cohort joined the business, with 
new opportunities opening in the London headquarters 
and at the Burberry Mill in Yorkshire. 
 ·
The Company expanded its volunteering programme, 
enabling all its employees worldwide to dedicate up  
to three working days a year to impactful community 
projects, seeing volunteering as an opportunity to  
make a difference while strengthening teams, enhancing 
workplace skills and building employee engagement and 
motivation. Activities included career mentoring events, 
employability workshops, community revitalisation and 
fundraising projects. 
 ·
In-kind donations ranged from one-off gifts of non- 
trade mark fabric and materials to assist young people  
on creative courses, to donations of smart business 
clothing to support over 1,000 people enrolled in 
employability programmes.
Driving environmental sustainability
Burberry is strongly committed to reducing environmental 
impacts globally across its supply chain and internal 
operations.
 ·
Cotton, cashmere and leather are three of the Company’s 
key raw materials, representing around 30% of its 
greenhouse gas emissions. Burberry has focused 
on improving the traceability and sourcing of these 
materials, further deepening partnerships with its  
supply chain and industry stakeholders. As part of its 
commitment to more sustainable raw materials, Burberry 
began procuring cotton through the Better Cotton 
Initiative. In addition, in Peru, where the Company has 
been sourcing cotton for over 30 years, a three-year 
farmers engagement programme has helped to achieve  
a 14% increase in yields with lower environmental 
impacts such as a 69% reduction in chemical pesticide 
use. Burberry seed funded and continues to support the 
Sustainable Fibre Alliance to help promote sustainable 
cashmere production in Mongolia. Burberry is committed 
to encouraging environmental best practice at leather 
tanneries and collaborating with industry stakeholders  
to better understand challenges beyond tanneries.  50
 ·
Burberry increased its efforts to reduce energy  
and water use in the supply chain, including the 
implementation of a Natural Resource Defence Council 
assured impact reduction programme at key mills.  
To eliminate the release of chemicals that may have  
an adverse environmental impact, the Company 
continued to work with its partners to improve  
chemical management practices in the supply chain 
and support extensive research into new technology.
 ·
Recognising that waste plays a key role in resource 
depletion and climate change, Burberry is prioritising  
the reduction and repurposing of waste. Examples 
include recycling pre-consumer textile waste into new 
yarns in Italy, repurposing damaged garment waste into 
insulation and using textile waste for home furnishings  
in the UK. Additionally, over 87% of construction  
waste from major projects globally was recycled. 
 ·
Burberry remains committed to reducing environmental 
impacts from energy consumption at its offices,  
stores, manufacturing and distribution sites. 53% of  
the Company’s electricity use was generated on site  
or sourced through green tariffs, an increase from 37%  
in FY 2016. Over the same period, Burberry distribution 
centres achieved an absolute energy reduction of 11%, 
while energy consumption at the Company’s London 
headquarters reduced by 14%.
Progress against targets
Following an independent baseline assessment in 2012, Burberry set itself five-year targets to reduce environmental impacts 
arising from materials, energy, water, chemicals and waste. Over the years, all targets have been owned and monitored by 
members of the Senior Leadership Team. The Company’s five-year environmental strategy concluded in March 2017 and 
achievements are outlined in the table below. Whilst some targets have not been fully achieved, key successes and learnings 
from the last five years have proven invaluable in shaping the Company’s new responsibility strategy and goals for 2022, 
with a focus on addressing the most material issues, evolving internal governance, developing innovative partnerships and 
demonstrating real impacts on workers, communities and the environment. Further details on the new strategy will be 
available at www.burberryplc.com.

Note:
Burberry applies an operational control approach to defining its organisational 
boundaries. Data is reported for sites where it is considered that Burberry  
has the ability to influence energy management. Data is not reported for  
sites where Burberry has a physical presence, but does not influence the energy 
management for those sites, such as a concession within a department store. 
Overall, the emissions inventory reported equates to 96% of our sq.ft (net selling 
space). The Company uses the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (using a location and 
market-based approach to reporting Scope 2 emissions) to estimate emissions 
and applies conversion factors from Defra and IEA guidance. All material 
sources of emissions are reported. Refrigerant gases and fuels consumed in 
Company vehicles were deemed not material and are not reported. Burberry 
has updated greenhouse gas data for FY 2015 and FY 2016 to account for 
improvements in data availability and estimation methods. Further detail  
is available within Burberry’s basis of reporting at www.burberryplc.com.

Definition of Alternative Performance Measures
Adjusted profit before tax and adjusted diluted EPS are defined in note 2 of the financial statements. 
Underlying performance is presented as, in the opinion of the Directors, it provides additional understanding of the ongoing 
performance of the Group. Underlying performance is calculated before adjusting items and removes the effect of changes  
in exchange rates compared to the prior period. This takes into account both the impact of the movement in exchange rates 
on the translation of overseas subsidiaries’ results and also on foreign currency procurement and sales through the Group’s 
UK supply chain. 
Comparable sales is the year-on-year change in sales from stores trading over equivalent time periods and measured at 
constant foreign exchange rates. It also includes online sales.
Free cash flow is defined as net cash generated from operations, less capital expenditure plus cash inflows from disposal  
of fixed assets. A reconciliation of Free Cash Flow is set out in the five year summary on page 178.
Lease-adjusted net debt is defined as five times minimum lease payments, adjusted for charges and utilisation of onerous 
lease provisions, less net cash. This is considered to be a reasonable estimate of operating lease debt which is currently  
off balance sheet. For details of minimum lease payments see note 5 of the Financial Statements.

Strategic Report – Performance
During FY 2017 Burberry continued to elevate its luxury 
brand positioning. 
 ·
In retail, through service and cultivation initiatives  
and with the launch of our redesigned website.
 ·
In wholesale, including Beauty, through tightly  
controlling inventory and distribution despite challenging 
market conditions.
 ·
And in licensing, reflecting our move to direct luxury  
retail operation in Japan.
Retail 
77% of revenue (2016: 73%); with 209 mainline stores,  
200 concessions within department stores, digital 
commerce and 60 outlets. 
 ·
Retail sales up 3% underlying.
 ·
Comparable sales up 1% (H1: flat; H2: up 3%).
 ·
New space contributed the balance of growth. 
Asia Pacific
With retail accounting for almost 90% of revenue in the 
region, Asia Pacific saw broadly unchanged comparable 
sales with an improved performance in the second half. 
 ·
Mainland China delivered high single-digit percentage 
growth, accelerating through the year to deliver  
double-digit percentage growth in the fourth quarter.
 ·
Hong Kong improved through the period although 
remained negative for the full year, impacted by lower 
footfall partially offset by improved conversion.
 ·
Korea, Burberry’s third largest market in Asia,  
was impacted by both the macro environment and  
Burberry’s own actions to reduce promotional activity.
EMEIA
Retail accounted for 70% of regional revenue. Comparable 
sales increased by a high single-digit percentage, with  
an improvement to double-digit percentage growth in  
the second half.
 ·
Both local customers and tourists contributed to  
the positive trends.
 ·
 The United Kingdom, delivered an exceptional 
performance.
 ·
 Continental Europe saw improvements in most markets 
through the year, particularly France.
 ·
 The Middle East remained difficult, experiencing negative 
footfall trends.
Americas
With retail accounting for c. 70% of regional revenue, 
comparable sales reduced by a low single-digit percentage. 
 ·
The relative strength of the US dollar drove a strong 
increase in sales from US customers abroad, while 
demand at home reduced (both domestic and tourist).
 ·
Spend from US customers globally was stable.
 ·
Strategic actions were taken to protect brand positioning 
in the highly promotional US environment.
Wholesale 
22% of revenue (2016: 25%); generated from sales of 
apparel and accessories to department stores, multi-brand 
accounts, 48 franchise stores and travel retail; as well  
as Beauty to distributors.
Wholesale revenue down 14% underlying in line with 
guidance, with almost half of the decline from Beauty.
Reflecting the rationalisation of distribution in key  
markets to improve the brand positioning and distributor 
destocking, Beauty revenue declined by about 20% 
underlying (FY 2017: £171m). My Burberry and Mr. Burberry 
continue to gain share in key markets as emphasis was 
placed on building pillar fragrances.
Excluding Beauty, underlying wholesale revenue declined, 
led by a significant decline in Americas in part reflecting 
Burberry’s strategy to reposition the brand in the US. 
Licensing 
1% of revenue (2016: 2%); of which around half is  
from Japan, with the balance mainly from global  
product licences. 
Licensing revenue of £25m, down 48% underlying in  
line with guidance, primarily due to the planned expiry  
of the Japanese Burberry licence.

our cost efficiency programme;
 ·
Ongoing tight discretionary cost management to mitigate 
underlying cost inflation;
 ·
Investment of £8m to support our growth initiatives; and
 ·
The rebuilding of the performance related pay charge

Strategic Report – Performance
Beauty licence intangible
In the first half, in addition to the planned amortisation 
charge of £7.5m, a further £18.6m was recognised to write 
down the remaining balance of the intangible to nil, due to 
lower than previously planned Beauty revenue expectations. 
Costs associated with the transfer of Beauty operations 
Costs of £14.5m associated with the transfer of the Beauty 
operations to Coty in October 2017. These costs arose in  
FY 2017 as a result of decisions made during the period.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs of £20.8m were incurred, relating  
to Burberry’s cost and efficiency programme, in line  
with guidance.
China put option liability
The charge of £1.0m reflects the fair value movement of  
the put option liability in the period up to 1 August 2016 
when Burberry exercised its call option (see note 6 of the 
Financial Statements).
Burberry Middle East (BME) deferred consideration
The £5.2m charge principally reflects foreign exchange  
rate movements and the discount unwind on the deferred 
consideration for the BME transaction (see note 6 of the 
Financial Statements).
Taxation 
The tax rate on adjusted profit in FY 2017 was 25.8%  
(2016: 24.7%), higher than initially guided principally due  
to a change in the geographic mix of our taxable profits,  
in addition to a change in the transfer pricing approach  
by an overseas tax authority.
Tax on adjusting items has been recognised as appropriate. 
The tax charge of £107m (2016: £101m) resulted in an 
effective tax rate on reported profit of 27.1% (2016: 24.3%), 
higher than the effective tax rate due to certain adjusting 
items which are not subject to tax (see note 6 of the 
Financial Statements). 
Total tax contribution
The Group makes a significant economic contribution to  
the countries where it operates through taxation, either 
borne by the Group or collected on behalf of and paid  
to the relevant tax authorities. In FY 2017, the total taxes  
borne and collected by the Group in the UK and overseas 
amounted to £426.2m. In the UK, where the Group is 
headquartered and has significant operations, Burberry 
paid business taxes of £89.1m and collected a further 
£15.9m of taxes on behalf of the UK Exchequer.  
For further information see www.burberryplc.com.
Cash flow
Cash generated from operating activities in FY 2017 was 
£689m (2016: £503m). The year-on-year increase reflects 
the growth in adjusted operating profit and a cash inflow 
from working capital. Inventory was down 3% underlying, 
below retail sales growth, reflecting tight management  
in the second half. 
Capital expenditure was below guidance at £104m  
(2016: £138m) predominantly due to timing of projects  
and is expected to return to a more normalised level in  
FY 2018. Tax paid of £132m (2016: £95m) was higher than 
the prior year reflecting sterling weakness and timing  
of payments.
Free cash flow of £465m (2016: £274m) and net cash up 
£149m (after dividends, share buyback and payments for 
non-controlling interests in China and BME). Net cash at  
31 March 2017 of £809m (2016: £660m) and lease-adjusted 
net debt of £388m (2016: £441m).
Summary outlook
In what remains a rapidly changing environment, Burberry 
will continue to take actions to elevate the brand, maintain 
tight discipline on costs and efficient use of capital while 
executing its strategic agenda. Burberry’s focus is on the 
brand, its products and the execution of the five key 
strategies to return Burberry to growth.
Disclosure
To simplify its communication, Burberry is modifying its 
disclosure. With effect from FY 2018 Burberry will:
 ·
Report four times per annum
 –  First and Third Quarter Trading Updates reporting  
on retail
 –  Interim and Preliminary Results 
 ·
Publish consensus on the Burberry plc website. 58
Strategic Report – Performance
Detailed outlook
There is no change to Burberry’s expectation for FY 2018 
adjusted PBT at constant exchange rates. 
Retail: Burberry will focus on productivity from the current 
store footprint and therefore no material contribution from 
net new space is expected in FY 2018.
Beauty: Strategic partnership with Coty announced for 
Beauty from October 2017. 
 ·
The impact is expected to be broadly neutral to adjusted 
PBT in FY 2018 and accretive from FY 2019. 
 ·
In the second half of FY 2018, Burberry expects to 
receive cash payments of £130m for the long-term 
exclusive global licence and related transfer of the 
Beauty business, and c. £50m for assets transferring, 
principally inventory (which is subject to adjustments) 
totalling c. £180m.
 ·
Burberry currently expects c. £30m of one-off cash  
costs associated with this agreement.
 ·
From the second half of FY 2018 Beauty will transition 
from a wholesale business model to licensing. This is 
reflected in guidance below. Beauty wholesale revenue 
FY 2017: £171m (H1: £70m, H2: £101m).
Wholesale: Burberry expects total underlying wholesale 
revenue in the first half of FY 2018 to be down by a mid 
single-digit percentage (H1 2017: £287m). This reflects the 
potential business disruption for Beauty. Excluding Beauty, 
underlying wholesale revenue in H1 2018 is expected to  
be broadly unchanged year-on-year (H1 2017: £217m). 
Licensing: Total underlying licensing revenue for FY 2018  
is expected to be up c. 20% year-on-year.
FY 2018 adjusted PBT: 
 ·
At 28 April effective rates, the expected impact of  
year-on-year exchange rate movements on reported 
adjusted PBT is about £30m adverse. This is an adverse 
movement of c. £20m since guidance given in April 2017.
 ·
Burberry expects to deliver around £50m of cumulative 
cost savings and to invest about £20m.
In addition, to deliver the strategic savings, c. £40m  
of one-off restructuring costs are expected.
Tax rate: The tax rate on adjusted profit for FY 2018  
is currently expected to improve by about 80bps to  
about 25%.
Capital expenditure: Spend of about £140m is planned  
in FY 2018.

Burberry’s new Capital Allocation Framework is used to prioritise the use of cash generated by the Group. The framework 
addresses the investment needs of the business, regular dividend payments and additional returns to shareholders.  
The framework also seeks to maintain an appropriate capital structure for the business and a strong balance sheet with 
solid investment grade metrics.
The diagram below summarises the key priorities.

Burberry has applied its capital allocation framework during the year ended 31 March 2017, as follows.
 ·
Reinvested £104m into the business as capital expenditure.
 ·
Increased its full year dividend by 5% to 38.9p.
 ·
 Invested £69m in the strategic acquisition of non-controlling interests in China and the Middle East.
 ·
 From July 2016 to April 2017 £100m of an announced £150m was returned to shareholders via a share buyback 
programme. In addition, a further share buyback of £300m has been announced for completion in FY 2018,  
in addition to £50m already announced. This is inclusive of the distribution of the Coty upfront sum.

Strategic Report – Performance Effective management of risk is essential to the execution of the  
Group’s strategies, the achievement of sustainable shareholder value,  
the protection of the brand and ensuring good governance.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management 
and internal controls system and reviewing its effectiveness. 
The system is designed to identify and manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic 
objectives and to provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. More 
information on the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems can be found in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 70 to 86.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the 
nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take  
in achieving its strategic objectives (its risk appetite), and  
for ensuring that risks are managed effectively. The Board 
has delegated to the Audit Committee the responsibility  
for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control and risk management methodology. 
As part of this review, the Audit Committee considers the 
principal risks facing the Group and the nature and extent  
of these risks. The Group Risk function facilitates a risk 
assessment process in each key business area and global 
support function to review the significant risks facing Group 
operations and the controls and actions in place to mitigate 
these. The detailed assessments are then consolidated to 
provide input into the overall Group risk assessment. 
The Board and the executive management team use  
a combination of different and complementary skills to 
assess the risks facing the business. In determining its  
risk appetite the Board considers a variety of information 
when reviewing the Group operations and in approving key 
matters reserved for its decision. This information includes:
 ·
updates provided by senior management on key strategic 
and operational matters;
 ·
discussion and approval by the Board of the Group’s 
three-year strategic plan, budget and viability statement 
(see page 61);
 ·
information provided for the purposes of deciding 
whether to approve those significant matters which  
have been reserved for the Board;
 ·
Group risk assessments facilitated by the Group  
Risk function and the reports of the internal and  
external auditors; and
 ·
risk appetite guidelines relating to the Group’s  
principal risks.
The risks set out in the table on the following pages 
represent the principal risks and uncertainties which  
may adversely impact the performance of the Group  
and the execution of its key strategies. The Group’s  
key strategies are set out on pages 33 to 44. 
Within the table is a summary of how each risk is defined, 
its context, potential impact, mitigating activities and the 
Group’s assessment of the change in risk during 2016/17. 
This assessment is based on the external environment in 
which the Group operates, its business operations and the 
impact of the Group’s internal controls on the severity of the 
risk in the period. The Group’s risk exposure is continually 
reviewed by senior management and is therefore subject  
to change as a result of internal and external factors,  
future events or otherwise. It is not possible for the Group  
to implement controls to respond to all the risks it may  
face and the steps the Group has taken to address  
certain risks (including those listed) may not manage  
these risks effectively.
The principal risks are not listed in order of significance 
and each of the risks should be considered independently.  
If more than one of the events contemplated by the  
risks set out occurs, it is possible that the combined  
overall impact of such events may be compounded.  
The Group Risk function examines these risks for 
correlation impacts. Other factors could also adversely 
affect Group performance and so the risks set out  
should not be considered to be a complete set of all 
potential risks and uncertainties the Group may face.

PRINCIPAL 
RISKs
60 The key changes in the principal risks during the  
year include the following.
 ·
Following the outcome of the UK referendum to leave  
the EU and the invoking of Article 50, uncertainties 
remain about the impact of Brexit on the Group’s 
operations and financial performance. The Group has 
considered the possible consequences that Brexit could 
have upon the business and has concluded that it does 
not raise any new principal risks. However, it does have 
the potential to impact a number of the Group’s existing 
risks at an individual risk level including: outlook for the 
luxury sector remains uncertain, volatility of exchange 
rates, loss of key management personnel and regulatory 
requirements. The Group has established a Brexit 
Steering Committee to monitor developments arising 
from Brexit, headed by the Chief People and Corporate 
Affairs Officer, who will provide regular updates on this  
to the Board.
 ·
The previous risk relating to the failure to realign  
the organisational resource capability to deliver the 
productivity and efficiency agenda announced last  
May, has been reclassified as one relating more  
generally to the loss of key management personnel  
or the inability to attract and retain key employees.  
This shift reflects that the implementation of the  
Group’s growth and productivity and efficiency 
programme is well under way.
Longer-term viability statement 
During the year, the Directors have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks of the Group, set out  
on pages 62 to 65. The Directors have also identified  
those risks which they consider could potentially impact  
the viability of the Group. 
The Directors have assessed the potential impact of  
these risks materialising and the impact on the ability  
of the Group to continue in operation and to meet its 
obligations. This assessment consisted of an analysis  
of the potential impact of the net risks on the Group’s 
viability and, where appropriate, stress testing. 
The Group’s annual corporate planning process consists of 
the preparation of a three-year strategic plan, reforecasting 
of the current year business performance during the year 
and preparation of a more detailed budget for the following 
year. The Directors have reviewed the plans, forecasts and 
budget including assumptions regarding the Group’s 
products and markets, expenditure commitments and 
expected cash flows. 
The stress testing consisted of estimating the impact of 
revenue sensitivities on the profitability and cash generation 
in the Group’s strategic plan, together with reverse stress 
testing to identify the theoretical revenue sensitivity that  
the Group could absorb, without impacting its viability.  
The sensitivities took account of the likely mitigating  
actions available to the Directors through adjustments  
to the operating plan in the normal course of business, 
together with resulting impacts on returns to shareholders. 
The period considered for the assessment was three  
years to March 2020. This period was considered 
appropriate by the Directors on the basis of the following.
 ·
It is the period for which the Group’s strategic plan  
was prepared.
 ·
It is sufficient to encompass the completion of the almost 
all currently approved capital expenditure projects.
 ·
As the Group has no contracted income, and as most 
current projects will be completed in the three-year 
period, any projections beyond March 2020 will only  
vary as a result of estimates of sales growth and cost 
growth assumptions.
In assessing the viability of the Group, the Directors  
have also taken into account the Group’s current liquidity 
and available facilities (set out in note 21 of the Financial 
Statements) and financial risk management objectives  
and hedging activities (set out in note 25).
On the basis of this assessment, the Directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able  
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they  
fall due over the period to March 2020.
In making this statement, the Directors have made  
the key assumption that there is no material long-term 
impairment to the Burberry brand.

Strategic Report – Performance Risk Business impact Mitigation
A major breach in cyber 
systems or information 
security could adversely 
impact the Group’s 
business operations and/
or result in a major data 
loss adversely impacting 
the Group’s reputation.
The Group’s customer and employee data, 
Burberry.com business, digital strategy and 
operations mean that it is critical that the 
Group’s technology is robust, its systems are 
secure and data protected. Sensitive data 
faces the threat of misappropriation and  
a breach of cyber-security on key business 
systems could also affect business operations. 
Information systems and cyber-security continued to receive 
substantial Audit Committee focus during the year to ensure  
that the Group’s response to this developing risk is appropriate.
Investment in the ongoing cyber-security programme continued 
and a four-year security strategy was reviewed and approved  
by the Audit Committee. A new Information and IT security  
team was put in place.
Ongoing activities to detect and investigate threats and  
incidents including with the support of key technology  
partners and suppliers.

The outlook for the luxury 
sector remains uncertain.
Changes and events in the external market  
or environment could impact the Group’s 
performance and the delivery of its strategies. 
These changes or events could include: 
(i) a sustained economic slowdown, which 
adversely impacts the Group’s customers, 
suppliers and operations; (ii) a change in 
consumer behaviour or other events, which 
adversely impact consumer demand 
particularly in relation to key consumer groups 
who make a significant contribution to Group 
revenues; and (iii) increasing global economic 
uncertainty including matters such as Brexit 
which could have an impact on economic 
growth and adversely impact the Group or give 
rise to additional costs relating to movements 
of inventory within the supply chain.
With the outlook for demand in the luxury sector remaining 
uncertain and underlying cost pressures persisting for the  
sector, in May 2016 the Group outlined its productivity  
and efficiency agenda and its plans to optimise future organic 
revenue growth opportunities. 
The global reach of the Group helps to mitigate local economic 
and geopolitical risks. 
The Group focuses on engaging consumers through the Brand 
and realising its opportunities among key consumer groups  
and geographic markets.
The Group’s financial reporting and review processes are 
designed to highlight any change in ongoing sales performance  
to enable action planning to address underperformance. 
Counterparty credit checks are in place for all key customers  
and suppliers and flexible payment terms are used to assist 
suppliers as required. Group Treasury monitors the credit ratings 
of financial institutions which hold Group deposits to enable the 
Group to take appropriate action should there be a downgrade  
in their credit ratings.
The Group would seek to mitigate any adverse cost impacts 
arising as a result of Brexit, through optimisation of operations 
within the supply chain.

A Transformation Management Office (‘TMO’) has been 
established to drive and coordinate delivery and to monitor risks

Insufficient capability and capacity in senior 
management and insufficient employees  
with the right skills may limit the Group’s  
ability to execute the Group’s strategies

The period of change may result in a loss of  
key individuals or the inability to recruit and

of the business and adversely impact the 
Group’s ability to deliver its strategies.
Brexit may have an adverse impact on

training and reward and recognition.
The Board and Audit Committee regularly review key talent  
and resource risks. 
There is a programme of clear and open engagement with 
employees to promote an environment of trust and honesty.
Competitive incentive arrangements currently exist, with  
specific initiatives in place designed to retain key individuals. 
Recruitment is ongoing and talent review and succession 
planning programmes are in place and are regularly reviewed

Sustained breaches of  
the Group’s intellectual 
property rights and 
unauthorised sale of 
Burberry products.
Trade marks and other intellectual property  
(‘IP’) rights are fundamentally important to the 
Group’s reputation, success and competitive 
position. Unauthorised use of these, as  
well as the unauthorised sale of Burberry  
products and distribution of counterfeit 
products, damages the Burberry brand  
image and profits. 
The Group’s global Brand Protection team is responsible for  
the Group’s brand protection efforts globally, including in the 
digital environment. Where infringements are identified these are 
addressed through a mixture of criminal and civil legal action and 
negotiated settlement. IP rights are driven largely by national laws 
which afford varying degrees of protection and enforcement 
priorities depending on the country.

Volatility in foreign 
exchange rates could 
have a significant  
impact on the Group’s 
reported results. 
The Group operates on a global basis and 
earns revenues, incurs costs and makes 
investments in a number of currencies.  
The Group’s financial results are reported in 
Sterling. The majority of reported revenues  
are earned in non-Sterling currencies, with  
a significant proportion of costs in Sterling. 
Therefore, changes in exchange rates which 
are driven by a number of factors, such as 
global economic trends, Brexit or other 
developments, can impact the Group’s 
revenues, margins, profits and cash flows.
The Group seeks to hedge anticipated foreign currency 
transactional cash flows using financial instruments. These are 
mainly in the Group’s centralised supply chain and wholesale  
and Beauty businesses. The Group does not hedge intra-group 
foreign currency transactions at present. The Group monitors the 
desirability of hedging the net assets of non-Sterling subsidiaries 
when translated into Sterling for reporting purposes, but the 
Group has not entered into any material transactions for this 
purpose in the current or previous year.

Major incidents such  
as natural catastrophes, 
global pandemics or 
terrorist attacks affecting 
one or more of the 
Group’s key locations 
could significantly  
impact its operations.
A major incident at a key location could 
significantly impact business operations,  
with the impact clearly varying depending  
on the location and its nature. The impact  
of the loss of a distribution hub would clearly 
differ from a global pandemic, but both  
would impact revenue and profits.
Business continuity plans are in place to mitigate operational 
risks, but cannot ensure the uninterrupted operation of the 
business, particularly in the short term. The regional spread  
of the Group’s key distribution hubs helps to mitigate this risk. 
A Group incident management framework is in place that 
addresses the reporting and management of major incidents,  
and is tested each year using third-party specialists. Tailored 
plans have been produced for a number of high-impact  
events. These plans are regularly reviewed and updated.

The Group’s operations 
are subject to a broad 
spectrum of regulatory 
requirements in the 
various jurisdictions  
in which the Group 
operates. The pace  
of change and  
the consistency of 
application of legislation 
can vary significantly 
across these 
jurisdictions, particularly 
in an environment  
where public sector  
debt is often high and  
tax revenues are falling.
Failure to comply with these requirements 
could leave the Group open to civil and/or 
criminal legal challenge, significant penalties 
and reputational damage.
The Group monitors and seeks to continuously improve  
its processes to gain assurance that its licensees, suppliers, 
franchisees, distributors and agents comply with the Group’s 
contractual terms and conditions, its ethical and business 
policies and relevant legislation. 
Specialist teams at corporate and regional level, supported  
by third-party specialists where required, are responsible  
for ensuring employees are aware of regulations relevant  
to their roles. 
Assurance processes are in place to monitor compliance in  
a number of key risk areas, with results being reported to the

The Group operates in  
a number of emerging 
markets which are 
typically more volatile 
than developed markets, 
and are subject to 
changing economic, 
regulatory, social and 
political developments 
that are beyond the 
Group’s control. 
Infrastructure and 
services also tend  
to be less developed.
Typical potential risks faced in these markets 
include: seizure of assets or staff, business 
associate practices that are inconsistent  
with the Group’s ethical standards and the  
UK regulatory environment, and increased 
operational costs due to country-specific 
processes driven by the operating or

Board and Governance – Board of Directors Dear Shareholder, 
This has been an important year of change for Burberry 
with the implementation of the programme announced  
in May 2016, to accelerate our productivity and efficiency 
agenda, and the change of executive management  
during the year. 
As a Board we have spent a significant amount of time 
during the year monitoring progress of the implementation  
of this programme and the impacts on the organisation 
arising from changes in ways of working. In particular, the 
Board considered the leadership roles required to maximise 
Burberry’s ability to successfully implement these plans. It 
was identified that there was a need for a new chief executive 
with strong luxury retail experience to lead on the commercial, 
operational and financial elements of the business, who could 
partner closely with Christopher Bailey, who would continue 
his leadership of the brand and design elements of the 
business as President and Chief Creative Officer. These  
joint leadership roles would share responsibility for strategy 
and would report jointly to the Chairman. 
As Carol Fairweather had signalled her intention to step 
down as Chief Financial Officer and John Smith as Chief 
Operating Officer, focus was also on the succession of 
these roles. To align with the transformation programme, 
the aim was to seek an individual with a strong financial and 
commercial background who could combine these roles.
The Board unanimously supported the appointment of 
Marco Gobbetti as Chief Executive Officer who will join  
the Board on 5 July 2017, and Julie Brown who joined  
the Board as Chief Operating and Financial Officer on  
18 January 2017. Marco has more than 20 years’ experience  
in the luxury industry and has a proven track record for 
growing and developing brands through his strong retail 
and customer-focused strategies. He joined Burberry in 
January as Executive Chairman, Asia Pacific and Middle 
East enabling him to familiarise himself with this very 
important region for the Company and we look forward to 
him joining the Board in July. Julie has an outstanding track 
record in the commercial and financial aspects of a global 
business as well as business transformation and has 
already made a strong impact since joining in January.
I would like to express my gratitude to both Carol and John 
for their dedication and service to Burberry over the years 
and their professionalism and support in facilitating an 
orderly succession process. 
Board succession and composition will continue to remain 
a priority for the coming year as the Board continues to 
execute on its succession plan. The aim is to continue to 
refresh the Board while ensuring stability and continuity, 
particularly in the context of significant management 
change. The composition of the Board has evolved 
significantly over the past few years with the appointment 
of four new non-executive directors and one longer-serving 
director stepping down. Further changes are planned  
over the coming year. 
Following a previous review of the Board Committees, 
changes were implemented during the year. This included 
the appointment of Jeremy Darroch as Chair of the  
Audit Committee and Fabiola Arredondo as Chair of  
the Remuneration Committee, as well as changes to  
the composition of those Committees. 
As Chairman I am responsible for leading and ensuring  
an effective Board. I am pleased to advise that the  
Board has operated very effectively during the year. In 
particular, directors have contributed important insights 
and constructive challenge in support of the important  
changes taking place in the organisation and executive 
management. Our annual Board effectiveness review 
confirmed that the Board is comprised of high quality  
non-executive directors with the right mix of skills, 
experience and the right focus. I would like to thank the 
Board for its hard work and support during the year. 
It is also important to have an open and ongoing dialogue 
with our shareholders and other stakeholders, particularly 
during times of change. During the year, a combination of 
myself, individual non-executive and executive directors 
and other members of senior management participated  
in around 166 meetings with investors, including with the 
Group’s 25 largest investors.
Our new Remuneration Policy will be presented to 
shareholders for their vote at our upcoming AGM, and  
so our Remuneration Committee Chair Fabiola Arredondo 
has been meeting with our shareholders and consulting 
with them on the proposed Policy. You can read more 
about the Policy in the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
on pages 87 to 111.
I commend this report to all of our shareholders as it details 
the work of the Board and its Committees during the year 
along with the assessment of its performance. During the 
coming year the Board will continue to focus on supporting 
the change programme and the leadership team as they 
settle into their new roles.

the Board agenda and ensuring that any actions agreed  
by the Board are effectively implemented.
During the year, the Chairman maintained regular contact

to meet with the Company’s main institutional shareholders. 
The major commitments of the Chairman are detailed in

executive directors in the oversight of the Chairman.  
The Senior Independent Director is also available

Christopher Bailey, is responsible for the management of 
the business, developing the Group’s strategic direction for 
consideration and approval by the Board and implementing 
the agreed strategy. The Chief Creative and Chief Executive

Team who meet regularly. 
On Marco Gobbetti taking up his role as Chief Executive 
Officer on 5 July 2017, Christopher Bailey will transition to 
the role of President and Chief Creative Officer at that time, 
creating a shared leadership framework, with both Marco 
and Christopher reporting directly to the Chairman. Marco 
will be responsible for all commercial, operational and 
financial elements of the business, with Christopher 
responsible for all elements of brand and design, and 
shared responsibility for people and strategy. 
The Company Secretary, Catherine Sukmonowski, acts 
as Secretary to the Board and all the Board’s Committees 
and is responsible for supporting the Chairman in the 
delivery of the corporate governance agenda.

Board effectiveness
The Board has operated very effectively during the year, 
particularly to support the important changes taking place  
in the organisation.
Highlights of Board activities during 2016/17
During the financial year the Board held six scheduled 
meetings, including an in-depth two-day session on 
strategy, and an additional meeting to discuss the 
productivity and efficiency programme and ways of  
working review, which was announced by the Group in  
May 2016. In connection with this programme the Board 
spent a significant amount of time during the year on 
matters relating to the implementation of the programme, 
as well as on key strategic decisions such as the strategic 
partnership for the Group’s Beauty business. A significant 
amount of time was also spent, including outside of 
scheduled meetings, to consider the appointment of the 
new Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Operating and 
Financial Officer. 
The Board and Committee agendas were shaped to  
ensure that discussion was focused on the Group’s key 
strategies and monitoring activities, as well as reviews  
of significant issues arising during the year. The Group’s 
ongoing financial and strategic performance is reviewed  
at every meeting and the Chief Creative and Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Operating and Financial Officer 
comment on current trading, the market, products,  
key brand moments and Group culture.
In addition, to allow for opportunities for the Board  
to engage with senior management to discuss key  
elements of the business, individual Board members  
are offered meetings with senior management and a 
number of Board dinners were held during the year.
The table below gives the highlights of how the Board  
and its Committees spent their time during the FY 2017 
financial year (but it is not an exhaustive list of topics 
covered). Further information on the Group’s strategic  
focus during the year is set out in the key strategies  
section starting on page 33. The more detailed work  
of the Committees is set out in this report.

Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report Evaluating our performance in 2016/17
The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance 
and that of its Committees each financial year, and is 
required to conduct an external evaluation once every three 
years. This year’s review of the Board’s and Committees’ 
effectiveness was facilitated internally by the Company 
Secretary. The Board’s next external evaluation is due to 
take place during FY 2018.
This has been an important year of change for the Group 
with the productivity and efficiency programme and ways  
of working review announced in May 2016 and the change 
of executive management during the year. Against this 
backdrop the Chairman held one-to-one meetings with 
each of the directors to facilitate a wide-ranging discussion 
and, in particular, to ascertain directors’ reflections  
on events over the past year and views on the future 
composition and operation of the Board/Committees,  
including what areas of future priority the focus should  
be. The Chairman also discussed directors’ roles and 
performance (see ‘Directors’ performance’ on page 75).  
The Chairman reported to the Board on the key themes  
and recommended actions arising from this review.
The overall view from the feedback was that the Board  
had operated very effectively during the year, particularly  
to support the important changes taking place in the 
organisation including executive management. The Board 
was comprised of high quality non-executive directors with 
the right mix of skills and experience, and the right focus. 
During the coming year the Board should ensure that it 
continues to focus on important strategic matters and  
continues to track the Group’s progress with its key 
strategies and its productivity and efficiency programme. 
Progress with the Board’s succession plan should  
continue to be a priority.
Below is a summary of the key themes and 
recommendations/actions identified from the 2016/17 
review and progress against the actions arising from  
last year’s review.
Key themes 2016/17 review 2015/16 review
Views Actions Progress against prior year actions
Board 
composition  
and ongoing 
NED support
The Board was comprised of high quality 
non-executive directors, with the right 
skills and experience and the right focus.
Continuing the Board succession  
plan was a priority. The pace of change 
should continue to be balanced by  
the need to ensure stability given  
the significant management and 
organisational changes. 
The Board succession plan would 
continue to be a priority with the aim  
of appointing additional non-executive 
directors in the coming year, to enable 
longer-serving members to step down. 
Previous action: Specific areas for further 
‘deep dives’ into the business and 
competitive landscape were identified. 
The in-depth two day session on strategy 
had focused on specific areas of the 
business, the luxury sector and the 
Group’s peers. In addition, deep dives 
were given on the Group’s key strategies 
as part of the Board’s consideration and 
monitoring of progress with the Group’s 
productivity and efficiency programme.
Previous action: The Board should 
continue to focus on its succession plan.
The Nomination Committee had actively 
engaged in progressing the Board’s 
succession plan, meeting a number of 
potential candidates during the year. 
Board/ 
Committee  
focus
The Board should ensure that it continues 
to focus on important strategic matters 
and continues to track the Group’s 
progress with its key strategies and its 
productivity and efficiency programme.
These specific areas of Board focus 
would be incorporated into the Board 
agendas during the coming year.
Previous action: Future Board focus would 
continue to be on ensuring that its strategic 
focus reflected luxury sector dynamics.
See above: Board composition and 
ongoing NED support, progress against 
prior year actions.
Board/ 
Committee 
effectiveness
The Board/Committees work very well, 
with the right focus and good meeting 
dynamics. It is important that the Board  
is regularly updated on the progress of 
key items/actions. 
The format for regular updates to the 
Board would be reviewed including 
how these are woven into future  
Board agendas.
Previous action: The approach to Board 
meeting agendas, papers and timings 
would be reviewed to ensure that the 
directors’ time together was maximised. 
A review of the Board and Audit Committee 
agenda formats took place during the year 
which included input from the Group’s 
advisers and a review of other FTSE 100 
practice. As a result, the agenda formats 
were revised to prioritise the discussion  
on key items and to generally improve the 
overall effectiveness and efficiency of 
the meetings.
Following a review, the Board implemented 
changes to the composition of its 
Committees and rotated the Audit and 
Remuneration Committee Chairs.
74
Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report Time allocation 
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of 
appointment which sets out the terms and conditions  
of his or her directorship. The Chairman and the non-
executive directors are expected to devote such time as  
is necessary for the proper performance of their duties. 
This is expected to be approximately 20 days each year  
for basic duties. The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director are expected to spend additional time over and 
above this to discharge their added responsibilities.
During the financial year the Board held six scheduled 
meetings including an in-depth two-day session on 
strategy, and one additional meeting to discuss the 
productivity and efficiency programme and ways of working 
review which was announced by the Group in May 2016. 
The Remuneration Committee held three scheduled 
meetings and two additional meetings. These additional 
meetings were to consider 2015/16 target setting for the 
measures under the Group’s Executive Share Plan which 
had been postponed to enable alignment with the 
programme, and to deal with matters relating to the 
executive management changes.
Directors’ performance
The Chairman held discussions with each of the directors 
to discuss their individual performance and to raise any 
top-of-mind issues they may have including in relation  
to any matters of Board/Committee effectiveness.  
This assessment is used as the basis for recommending  
the re-election of directors by shareholders.
Outside of formal meetings, the non-executive directors 
spent significant additional time during the year on matters 
relating to the implementation of the Group’s productivity 
and efficiency programme and to management succession. 
In addition, individual Board members spent time visiting 
the Group’s business in its key regions and various 
operating facilities in the UK. The Board considers that  
it met sufficiently often to enable the directors to discharge 
their duties effectively.
External directorships
The Board’s executive directors are permitted to hold  
only one non-executive directorship of a FTSE 100 
company. Details of the directors’ other directorships  
can be found in their biographies on pages 68 and 69.
Board and Committee composition and succession
In the context of the Board’s consideration of the Group’s 
areas of future growth and its productivity and efficiency 
programme, the non-executive directors spent a 
considerable amount of time considering the executive 
leadership roles required to maximise Burberry’s  
ability to successfully implement these plans, with the 
announcements during the year of the appointments of  
the new Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Operating and 
Financial Officer and the transition of Christopher Bailey  
to President and Chief Creative Officer. Please see the 
Report from the Nomination Committee on pages 85 to 86. 
Chairman’s performance
The non-executive directors reviewed the Chairman’s 
performance. The feedback was that the Chairman had 
done an excellent job in leading the Board during this  
time of significant change for the Company and his 
leadership provided important stability in the context  
of executive management changes.

Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report In relation to its non-executive directors, the Board 
continued to focus on building on its relevant skills and 
competencies for the future under its succession plan.  
The aim is to continue to refresh the Board while ensuring 
stability and continuity particularly in the context of 
significant management change. The composition of the 
Board has evolved significantly over the past few years  
with the appointment of four new non-executive directors, 
with one longer-serving non-executive director stepping 
down. The Board plans to continue to execute against its 
succession plan and it is anticipated that there will be 
further changes to the Board in the coming year.
The current non-executive directors are drawn from  
a wide range of industries and backgrounds, including 
mobile, digital, technology, media, retail, financial services, 
consumer travel, hotels and hospitality, marketing, 
accountancy and general management expertise. They 
have extensive experience of complex organisations with 
global reach, including experience of the Group’s key 
markets of Europe, the Americas and Asia, reflecting  
the Group’s strategy. Their varied yet relevant experience 
brings a diversity of perspective and useful insight to Board 
discussions and important support to the management 
team. The biographical details of the current directors  
can be found on pages 68 and 69.
As part of its succession planning the Board also keeps 
under review the composition of its Committees and the 
tenure of the Committee Chairs to ensure that these  
roles are refreshed from time to time. Following a review 
last year, the Board implemented key changes to its 
Committees during the year. This included the appointment 
of Jeremy Darroch as Chair of the Audit Committee  
and Fabiola Arredondo as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. It also included a variation of Committee 
membership, evolving away from the past practice of all 
non-executive directors sitting on all Committees. This 
change was to enable a fresh perspective and reflects  
the increased time commitment and focus required from 
Committee members due to the expansion of the Group 
over the past few years, and the increasing complexity  
of the remit of the Committees in terms of regulatory and 
other requirements. 
To ensure that the appropriate linkage remains, regular 
Committee updates are provided to the Board. In addition, 
all non-executive directors continue to receive papers 
relating to all Committee meetings and are invited to  
attend Committee meetings whenever they wish.
Diversity – split of male/female Board members:
Male
Female
Board succession planning is focused on ensuring the right 
mix of skills and experience for the Board. All new Board 
appointments are based on merit, keeping in mind the 
Board composition principles. These principles are to:
 ·
maintain current core competencies;
 ·
add new competencies which reflect the evolution  
of the Group’s business;
 ·
ensure compatibility with Burberry’s culture and  
values; and
 ·
promote diversity, including in terms of gender.
Please see the Report from the Nomination Committee  
on pages 85 and 86 for more information on the  
appointment process.
The Board believes in the importance of diverse Board 
membership, including in relation to gender. The Board  
is supportive of the Lord Davies Report and the Hampton-
Alexander review target for women to represent 33%  
of boards by 2020. Currently, four out of our ten Board 
members are female (including our Chief Operating  
and Financial Officer), comprising 40% of our Board 
membership. The Board will continue to monitor diversity 
and take such steps as it considers appropriate to maintain 
Burberry’s position as a meritocratic and diverse business.
The Board believes that it is critical that women are able  
to succeed at all levels of the organisation. Currently, of  
a total workforce of approximately 10,000, approximately 
70% (7,000) is female and approximately 39% of senior 
management is female.
More broadly, diversity is at the heart of Group culture 
which is characterised by a meritocratic and collaborative 
ethos. At our London headquarters, 58 different 
nationalities are represented.
The Company continues to focus on evolving its strategies 
for recruiting and developing key talent within the business 
in a way which promotes the Group’s cultural values and 
diverse and meritocratic environment. See the Inspired 
People section on page 44.
76
Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report Board tenure
0 – 5 years
10 years or above
The balance of tenure of service of the directors is set out 
in the Board tenure diagram. At the time of the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting, Sir John Peace and Philip Bowman will 
have served on the Board for 15 years, Stephanie George 
will have been on the Board for 11 years and Ian Carter  
will have served for ten years. The performance of Philip 
Bowman, Stephanie George and Ian Carter has been 
subject to a rigorous review, including with regard to their 
independence. Their in-depth knowledge of the Group 
combined with the consistency they provide through their 
continued service, remains invaluable to ensure a smooth 
transition of the Board and its Committees. Each of these 
individuals continues to demonstrate the attributes of an 
independent non-executive director, including contributing 
to constructive challenge and debate at meetings, and 
there was no evidence that their tenure has impacted  
on their independence.
The Board is satisfied that all of its non-executive directors 
bring robust independent oversight and continue to remain 
independent.
Information flow and professional development
The Chairman works closely with the Company Secretary  
in the planning of the agendas and schedule of Board and 
Committee meetings, and in ensuring that information is 
made available to Board members on a timely basis and is 
of a quality appropriate to enable the Board to effectively 
discharge its duties.
As set out in the table ‘Highlights of Board activities during 
2016/17’ on page 73, the Board is kept up to date on legal, 
regulatory, compliance and governance matters through 
advice and regular papers from the Company Secretary 
and other advisers.
The Company Secretary assists the Chairman in designing 
and facilitating an induction programme for new directors 
and their ongoing training. Each newly appointed director 
receives a formal and tailored induction programme to 
enable them to function effectively as quickly as possible, 
while building a deep understanding of the business and 
the Group’s markets. Each induction typically consists of 
meetings with both executive and non-executive directors, 
briefings from senior managers across the Group on  
key business areas and operations, the luxury market, 
strategy, the corporate functions, and the Burberry  
brand and culture. In addition, non-executive directors  
are provided with opportunities to visit key stores, markets  
and facilities. This includes visits to the Group’s various 
operating facilities in the UK. The Chairman considers the 
training needs of individual directors on an ongoing basis.
The Board has direct access to the advice and services  
of the Company Secretary and the appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary is a matter reserved  
for the Board as a whole. Directors may also obtain, in  
the furtherance of their duties, independent professional 
advice, if necessary, at the Group’s expense.
Re-election of directors
At the Annual General Meeting in 2016, all continuing 
directors offered themselves for re-election. Each director 
was re-elected and no director received less than 91% in 
favour of the votes cast. At the Annual General Meeting  
in 2017, all of the directors will again retire and all will  
offer themselves for re-election or, in the case of the newly 
appointed directors, for election. As Marco Gobbetti will  
be joining the Board on 5 July 2017 he will offer himself  
for election at the Annual General Meeting.
The Board believes that each of the directors standing  
for re-election or election are effective and, accordingly,  
the Board recommends that shareholders approve the 
resolutions to be proposed at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting relating to the re-election or election of  
the directors.
Managing conflicts of interest
All directors have a duty under the Companies Act 2006  
to avoid a situation in which they have, or could have,  
a direct or indirect conflict of interest or possible conflict  
of interest with the Company and the Group.
Under the Group’s Articles of Association, the Board has 
the authority to approve situational conflicts of interest  
and has adopted procedures to manage and, where 
appropriate, to approve such conflicts. Authorisations 
granted by the Board are recorded by the Company 
Secretary in a register and are noted by the Board at  
its next meeting.
A review of situational conflicts which have been authorised 
is undertaken by the Board annually. Following the last 
review, the Board concluded that the conflicts had been 
appropriately authorised, no circumstances existed which 
would necessitate that any prior authorisation be revoked 
or amended, and the authorisation process continued to 
operate effectively.
77
Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report Engagement with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of regular open  
and constructive dialogue with shareholders and other 
stakeholders, not just ahead of the Annual General Meeting, 
but throughout the year.
The Investor Relations team participated in around  
450 investor meetings and events during the year. A 
combination of the Chairman, the Senior Independent 
Director, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, other 
individual non-executive directors, executive directors  
and other members of senior management participated in 
around 170 of these meetings. This engagement included 
presentations to institutional shareholders and analysts 
following the release of the Group’s Interim and Full Year 
results (which are available on the Group’s website at  
www.burberryplc.com), as well as meetings with the 
Group’s 25 largest investors. Topics discussed included 
(but were not limited to) the executive management 
changes, luxury sector growth dynamics, the Group’s 
performance and strategy, productivity and efficiency 
agenda, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the 
strategic partnership for the Group’s Beauty business.
The Group’s Investor Relations and Company Secretariat 
departments act as the centre for ongoing communication 
with shareholders, investors and analysts. The Board 
receives regular updates on the views of the Group’s major 
shareholders and stakeholders from this engagement or 
direct contacts.
The Group also conducts regular independent investor 
audits of its major investors through Makinson Cowell, a 
capital markets advisory firm, to gauge investor perception. 
The investor audit findings are discussed with the Board.
Evaluation of internal controls
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system 
of internal controls and risk management and it discharges 
its duties in this area by:
 ·
determining the nature and extent of the principal risks  
it is willing to accept in achieving the Group’s strategic 
objectives (the Board’s risk appetite); and
 ·
challenging management’s implementation of effective 
systems of risk identification, assessment and mitigation.
The Audit Committee has been delegated the responsibility 
for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and risk management arrangements. Ongoing 
review of these controls is provided through internal 
governance processes and the work of the Group  
functions is overseen by executive management,  
particularly the work of Group Risk and Internal Audit  
and the management Risk Committee. Further assurance  
is provided by the reviews conducted by the external 
auditor. Regular reports on these activities are provided  
to the Audit Committee as reflected in the standing items  
on the Audit Committee agenda, with further objective 
reporting provided by the external auditors.
The Board, through the Audit Committee, has conducted  
a robust assessment of the Group’s principal risks and the 
Group’s internal control framework and has considered the 
effectiveness of the system of internal controls in operation 
across the Group for the year covered by the Annual Report 
and Accounts and up to the date of its approval by the 
Board. This covered the material controls including 
financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management arrangements. The system of internal controls 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of  
not achieving business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The process followed by the Board, through the Audit 
Committee, in reviewing regularly the system of internal 
controls and risk management arrangements accords with 
the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’). It also accords with  
the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Control environment
The Group’s business model is based primarily on a central 
design, supply chain and distribution operation to supply 
products to global markets via retail (including digital) and 
wholesale channels. This is reflected in the internal control 
framework which includes centralised direction, resource 
allocation, oversight and risk management of the key 
activities of marketing, inventory management, brand and 
technology development. The Group has also established 
procedures for the delegation of authorities to ensure  
that approval for matters that are considered significant  
is provided at an appropriate level, either because of  
their value or their materiality to the Group. In addition, 
the Group has policies and procedures in place that are 
designed to support risk management across the Group. 
These include policies relating to treasury, the conduct  
of employees and third parties with which the Group 
conducts business including prohibiting bribery and 
corruption. These authorities, policies and procedures 
are kept under regular review. 
78
Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report The Group operates a ‘three lines of defence’ model  
which helps to achieve effective risk management and 
internal control across the organisation. This comprises 
the following.
 ·
The first line of defence: management owns and 
manages risk and is also responsible for implementing 
corrective actions to address process and control 
deficiencies.
 ·
The second line of defence: to help ensure the first  
line is properly designed, established and operating 
appropriately, management has also established various 
risk management and compliance functions to help  
build and/or monitor the first line of defence. These 
include, but are not limited to, functions such as Group 
Risk, Financial Governance, Health and Safety, Asset  
and Profit Protection and Business Continuity.
 ·
The third line of defence: Internal Audit provides the  
Audit Committee and management with independent and 
objective assurance on the effectiveness of governance, 
risk management and internal controls including the 
manner in which the first and second lines of defence 
achieve risk management and control objectives.
Risk management
The Group has an integrated approach to risk management 
and internal controls to ensure that its review of risk is  
used to inform the internal audit process and the design  
of internal controls.
A detailed three-year strategic plan and annual budget 
process provides the principal metrics against which the 
performance of the Group is measured. The strategic plan 
and budget are agreed with the Board together with defined 
performance targets and risks. The plan and the principal 
risks for delivering the strategy also form part of the  
Board’s annual review of Group strategy. The plan, and the 
assessment of the impact of the principal risks on the plan, 
forms the basis of the Board’s assessment of the viability of 
the Group as required by the Code. The executive directors 
also meet with senior management on a regular basis to 
discuss performance, operational and budget issues to 
identify any emerging risks to achieving the budget and 
strategic plan.
The Group Risk and Security Officer, who reports to the 
Chief Operating and Financial Officer, is responsible for 
ensuring that the Board’s requirements relating to risk 
management frameworks are met. This includes the design 
and facilitation of the risk assessment process, the risk 
appetite framework and providing oversight of key business 
change processes. As part of the Board’s consideration  
of the principal risks facing the Group, the Group Risk  
and Security Officer facilitates a risk assessment process  
in each key business area and global support function to 
review the principal risks facing its operations and any 
actions in place to further mitigate the risks. The materiality 
of the risk is measured based on financial and non-financial 
criteria, and the probability of the risk arising is also 
mapped. The detailed assessments are then consolidated 
to provide input into the Group risk assessment which  
is discussed and agreed by management at the Risk 
Committee prior to review by the Board.
The management Risk Committee meets at least three 
times per year and reports any key findings to the Audit 
Committee. The Risk Committee evaluates risk through 
reports made to it by Group Risk, Internal Audit and other 
assurance teams and management committees. The 
Committee benefits from cross-functional attendance 
encompassing senior management of key areas such  
as IT, finance, legal, brand protection, corporate 
responsibility, human resources, supply chain, asset  
and profit protection, information security and health  
and safety. The Risk Committee is chaired by the Chief 
Operating and Financial Officer and its members include 
the Chief People and Corporate Affairs Officer, the General 
Counsel, the Company Secretary, the Group Risk and 
Security Officer, the Vice President of Internal Audit and 
other members of senior management. Key findings of  
the Risk Committee are reported to the Audit Committee.
Further details on the Group’s risk management approach 
and its management and mitigation of each principal risk 
together with the Group’s viability statement, is set out  
in the Principal Risks section on pages 60 to 65. 
79
Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report Internal audit
All Internal Audit activity is conducted by the Internal Audit 
team under the leadership of the Vice President of Internal 
Audit, who reports to the Chief Operating and Financial 
Officer but has an independent reporting line to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. Internal Audit adopts  
a risk-based approach to developing the annual audit plan 
which involves undertaking a ‘mapping’ exercise between 
the principal risks, the potential impact on the achievement 
of the Group’s strategic objectives if those risks were to 
materialise and the extent to which other sources of 
assurance exist and can be relied upon to mitigate the 
principal risks. The output of this, together with a number of 
other factors, helps to identify areas of focus for the annual 
audit plan. Internal Audit stays abreast of any changes to 
the Group’s risk profile on an ongoing basis and will reflect 
this through changes to the audit plan as necessary during 
the year. Any proposed changes to the plan are discussed 
with the Chief Operating and Financial Officer and reported 
to the Audit Committee.
Ongoing visibility of the internal control environment is 
provided through Internal Audit reports to management  
and the Audit Committee. These reports are graded to 
reflect an overall assessment of the control environment 
under review, the significance of any control weaknesses 
identified, and also include any remedial actions which have 
been identified and agreed with management. Reports are 
also provided on the status of any open actions.
It is noted that from FY 2017/18, to bring enhanced focus  
on risk and on assurance over the execution of the Group’s 
productivity and efficiency agenda, the structure of the 
Internal Audit and Risk Management functions were 
realigned under the leadership of a newly appointed  
Senior Vice President – Risk Management and Audit.
Financial reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal controls over financial 
reporting. These controls are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements  
for external reporting purposes.
The Group has comprehensive planning, budgeting, 
forecasting and monthly reporting processes in place.  
A summary of the Group’s financial results supported  
by commentary and performance measures is  
provided to the Board each month.
In relation to the preparation of the Group financial 
statements, the controls in place include:
 ·
a centre of expertise responsible for reviewing new 
developments in reporting requirements and standards 
to ensure that these are reflected in Group accounting 
policies; and
 ·
a global finance structure consisting of employees  
with the appropriate expertise to ensure that Group 
policies and procedures are correctly applied. Effective 
management and control of the finance structure is 
achieved through the finance leadership team, consisting 
of key finance employees from the regions and  
London headquarters.
The reporting process is supported by transactional and 
consolidation finance systems. Reviews of controls are 
carried out by senior finance management. The results  
of these reviews are considered by the Board as part  
of its monitoring of the performance of controls around 
financial reporting.
The Audit Committee reviews the application of financial 
reporting standards and any significant accounting 
judgements made by management. These matters  
are also discussed with the external auditor.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole, is 
required to be fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy. The Board is satisfied that it has met 
this obligation. A summary of the directors’ responsibilities 
for the financial statements is set out on page 118. The 
report of the Auditors on page 119 includes a statement  
by the auditors concerning their reporting responsibilities.
80
Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report Report of the Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the 2016/17 report of the Audit 
Committee which describes how the Committee has 
carried out its responsibilities during the year. 
The role of the Audit Committee is to monitor the integrity of 
financial information and to provide assurance to the Board 
that the Group’s internal controls and risk management 
systems are appropriate and regularly reviewed, together 
with overseeing the work of the external auditors, approving 
their remuneration and recommending their appointment.  
In addition to the disclosure requirements relating to audit 
committees under the Code, the Committee’s Report sets 
out the areas of significant and particular focus for the 
Committee over the course of the year.
During the year, the Committee continued to focus on  
the usual work of the Committee as set out in the table on  
page 82. Some of the more in-depth areas of focus for the 
Committee during the year included the following matters.
 ·
Monitoring the Group’s progress with its productivity  
and efficiency programme and in particular, in relation  
to any risks arising from significant organisational change 
including in relation to the Group’s systems of controls 
and mitigation of risk and other possible impacts on the 
business. This will continue to be an area of regular focus 
of the Committee in the coming year.
 ·
With heightened global technology and information 
security risks becoming an increasingly significant issue 
for companies, the Committee continued to spend a 
significant amount of time on the Group’s progress with 
its information security improvement programme. With 
risks in this area continuing to evolve, the aim is to ensure 
that the Group continues to appropriately prioritise its 
focus and resources towards this critical area of risk. 
 ·
The Committee considered the Group’s viability 
statement (as set out on page 61) and the assurance 
work conducted by management which underpins the 
statement. It was considered that three years continued 
to remain an appropriate timeframe on which to base an 
assessment of the long-term viability of the Group on the 
basis that it aligns with the regular business planning 
period. The Committee also reviewed the outcome  
of the stress testing performed by management and 
recommended that the directors confirm that they have  
a reasonable expectation that the Group would be able  
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they  
fall due over the three-year period of assessment.
The Committee also considered the significant matters  
set out in the table on page 83. Where these significant 
matters related to the financial statements for the year,  
the Committee requested papers from management setting 
out its approach, the key estimates and judgements applied 
and management’s recommendation. The Committee 
reviewed and challenged these papers, together with the 
findings of the external auditors, in order to conclude on the 
appropriateness of the treatment in the financial statements.
All the members of the Committee are independent non-
executive directors. Following a review of the composition 
of the Board’s Committees as mentioned earlier in this 
Corporate Governance Report, Philip Bowman, Fabiola 
Arredondo, Ian Carter and Stephanie George stepped  
down from the Committee on 1 February 2017, with  
Philip Bowman having previously stepped down as Audit 
Committee Chairman on 1 August 2016. I would like to 
thank them for their invaluable work on the Committee  
and in particular, Philip, for his contribution as Chairman 
over a number of years.
The Audit Committee confirms that during 2016/17  
the Company has complied with the mandatory audit 
processes and audit committee responsibilities provisions 
of the Competition and Markets Authority Statutory  
Audit Services Order 2014, as outlined in this Report  
which describes the work of the Audit Committee in 
discharging its responsibilities.
The Committee has a constructive and open relationship 
with management and the auditors and I thank them on 
behalf of the Committee for their assistance during the year.

Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report Significant matters
The significant matters considered by the Committee during the year are set out below.
Significant matters for the 
year ended 31 March 2017 How the Audit Committee addressed these matters
Acquisition of non-controlling interests 
in the Group’s businesses in China and 
the Middle East.
During the year the Group exercised its call option to acquire the non-controlling interest in its  
business in China. The Group also acquired the non-controlling interest in its business in the  
Middle East. The Committee reviewed management’s proposals on how these transactions should  
be accounted for, including the derecognition of the put option liability, the treatment of deferred 
consideration arising from the acquisition of the Middle East non-controlling interest and the disclosure 
of these transactions in the financial statements. Accounting for these acquisitions is set out in note  
29 of the Financial Statements.
Impairment assessment of  
intangible assets.
The Committee considered management’s assessment of the recoverability of the intangible asset 
relating to the termination of the fragrance and Beauty relationship with Interparfums SA, using the latest 
projected sales and margins for the business. The reasonableness of these projections was considered, 
taking into account the current performance of the business. As a result of a reduction in projected sales 
since the last review, the asset was fully impaired in the period. The Committee considered the proposed 
disclosure relating to this impairment. Further details of the intangible asset are provided in note 12 of the 
Financial Statements.
Impairment assessment of property, 
plant and equipment and onerous  
lease provisions.
The Committee considered management’s assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value  
of retail assets held in property, plant and equipment, and, where applicable, the potential need for 
provisions relating to onerous lease contracts. The Committee considered the approach applied by 
management to review for potential indicators of impairment and the assumptions applied in this  
review. Where impairments were identified, the Committee considered the reasons for the impairment  
and management’s quantification of the impairment. The Committee requested management carry  
out a review across the property portfolio to identify any areas of risk in relation to potential future 
impairments. This review did not result in any change to the approach to the measurement of 
impairments within the current period. Further details of the impairment assessment are provided  
in note 13 of the Financial Statements.
The recoverability of the cost of 
inventory and the resulting amount  
of provisioning required.
The Committee considered the Group’s current provisioning policy, the historical loss rates incurred on 
inventory held at the balance sheet date and the nature and condition of current inventory. At the request 
of the Committee, management carried out a Group-wide review of the application of the policy and 
presented the findings to the Committee. The Committee concluded the carrying value of the inventory 
was appropriate. Movements in inventory provisioning are set out in note 16 of the Financial Statements.
Accounting for the licence and transfer 
of the Beauty operation.
On 3 April 2017, the Group entered into an agreement to licence its Beauty trade marks and transfer  
its Beauty operation to Coty. The Committee considered management’s assessment of how this 
transaction would be accounted for, including significant judgements regarding the appropriate 
treatment of receipts from Coty, the estimation of net realisable value of inventory being transferred  
to Coty and the timing of recognition of the transaction.
Income and deferred taxes. The Senior Vice President – Group Tax, who reports to the Committee at each meeting, presented a 
detailed update of the Group’s tax strategy, developments relating to discussions with tax authorities 
and the status of ongoing tax audits. The Committee reviewed and challenged the appropriateness  
of assumptions and judgements applied in order to estimate the amount of assets and liabilities to be 
recognised in relation to uncertain income tax and deferred tax positions. The Committee concluded 
that the assets and liabilities recognised and disclosures contained in the Financial Statements for the 
period were appropriate. Details of movements in tax balances are set out in notes 9 and 14 of the 
Financial Statements and further disclosure of tax contingent liabilities is given in note 30.
Fair, balanced and understandable 
reporting.
The Committee considered the Annual Report and Interim Report, on behalf of the Board, to ensure  
that they were fair, balanced and understandable, in accordance with requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. As part of this review, the Committee reviewed the report from the Strategic Report 
Drafting Team, highlighting key considerations. The Committee considered comments arising from the 
review of accounts by the executive directors. The Committee also considered the use of alternative 
performance measures by the Group, including the appropriateness of their current use and their 
disclosure in the financial statements and Strategic Report. The Committee concluded that their  
current use was fair, balanced and understandable.
Other matters. At the May and November meetings, the Committee also considered management’s papers on the 
following subjects:
 ·
assessment of the carrying value of goodwill;
 ·
accounting for contracts to buy back own shares; and
 ·
consideration of the potential impact of supplier rebates, which concluded that amounts received 
from supplier rebates did not have a material impact on the Group results.

Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report External auditors
The Committee oversees the work undertaken by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’). During the year  
the Committee met with the external auditors without 
members of management being present.
Appointment and fees
The Committee has primary responsibility for making  
a recommendation on the appointment, reappointment  
and removal of the external auditors. The Committee 
assesses on an annual basis the qualifications, expertise, 
resources and independence of the external auditors and 
the effectiveness of the previous audit process. Over  
the course of the year, the Committee has reviewed  
the audit process and the quality and experience of the  
audit partners engaged in the audit. The Committee also 
reviewed the proposed audit fee and terms of engagement 
for the 2016/17 financial year. Details of the fees paid to  
the external auditors during the financial year can be  
found in note 7 in the Financial Statements.
PwC have remained in place as auditors since prior to the 
IPO of the Company in 2002. They were reappointed with  
a new lead audit partner following a formal tender process 
undertaken by the Group for the 2010/11 financial year.  
As the external auditors are required to rotate the audit 
engagement partner every five years, a new engagement 
partner Paul Cragg commenced his appointment  
from the 2015/16 financial year. As a result of the UK’s 
implementation of the EU’s mandatory firm rotation 
requirements, the Company is required to replace PwC  
with another firm of auditors no later than for the financial 
year commencing 1 April 2020, and considers the most 
practical and business-driven approach to be to conduct  
a competitive tender no later than 2019.
During the year, the Committee approved the reappointment, 
remuneration and terms of engagement of PwC as the 
Group’s external auditor. The Committee recommended  
to the Board that it proposes to shareholders that PwC  
be reappointed as the Group’s external auditors at the 
Group’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Non-audit services
The Committee recognises that the independence of  
the external auditors is an essential part of the audit 
framework and the assurance that it provides. The 
Committee has adopted a policy which sets out a 
framework for determining whether it is appropriate  
to engage the Group’s auditors for non-audit services.
On 17 June 2016 the Financial Reporting Council  
('FRC') issued the final version of the Ethical Standards  
for Auditors which is the means by which the FRC is 
implementing the new restrictions on external auditors 
when supplying non-audit services to organisations such 
as Burberry which, as a UK entity with securities traded  
on an EU-regulated exchange, is considered a public 
interest company (PIE).
The standard applies for Burberry from 1 April 2017,  
i.e. for the financial year ending 31 March 2018. The  
overall objective being to ensure that the provision  
of non-audit services does not impair the external  
auditors independence or objectivity. This will include,  
but will not be limited to, assessing:
 ·
any threats to independence and objectivity resulting 
from the provision of such services;
 ·
any safeguards in place to eliminate or reduce these 
threats to a level where they would not compromise  
the auditor’s independence and objectivity;
 ·
the nature of the non-audit services; and
 ·
whether the skills and experience of the audit firm make  
it the most suitable supplier of the non-audit service.
The provision of non-audit services by the external  
auditor will also be restricted if they exceed the cap  
on the level of permitted non-audit service fees which  
can be billed. The cap on non-audit service fees is set  
at 70% of the average audit fees for the preceeding  
three years. The cap is calculated at two levels:
 ·
Group calculation – all fees billed by the external auditor 
globally i.e. to any Burberry entity by any network firm  
of the auditor. This is compared to the audit fees billed  
to the Burberry Group; and
 ·
UK calculation – all fees billed by the UK firm of the 
external auditor to any Burberry entity globally. This  
is compared to the audit fees billed by the UK audit  
firm for the audits of those entities. 
Burberry has chosen to early adopt some of the 
requirements. Burberry exercised judgement in its 
adherence to the list of prohibited non-audit services  
for FY 2016/17. 
Burberry has already been adhering in principle to  
the 'Group calculation' fee cap since 2014 and formally 
adopted the Group calculation fee cap restrictions from  
H2, FY2016/17. Accordingly, irrespective of the nature of  
the work to be performed, Burberry’s external auditors 
cannot undertake non-audit work which would result in  
this threshold being breached.
The UK fee cap restriction will be applied for the audit  
for the year ending 31 March 2021, at which point it  
will be based on the average of audit fees for the  
years ending 31 March 2018, 2019 and 2020. 
The auditors may provide non-audit services up to the  
70% threshold that do not prejudice their independence, 
subject to prior approval as set out in the policy. The  
Senior Vice President, Risk Management and Audit, and  
the External Auditor will jointly monitor the level of non-
audit services paid and approved throughout the year  
to ensure that the expected non-audit spend for each  
year will not exceed the 70% threshold.
84
Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report Proposed fees above £100,000 must be approved by the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, and fees must be activity 
based and not success related. At the half year and year 
end, the Audit Committee reviews all non-audit services 
provided by the auditors during the period and the fees 
relating to such services.
During the year, the Group spent £541k on non-audit 
services provided by PwC (being 27% of the average  
of Group audit fees received over the last three  
years). Further details can be found in note 7 of the  
Financial Statements.
Report of the Nomination Committee
Dear Shareholder,
This has been a busy year for the Committee. Following a 
business review that targeted future growth opportunities,  
in May 2016 the Group announced a productivity and 
efficiency programme including changes to ways of 
working. As part of this, with the full participation of all  
the non-executive directors, the Committee spent time 
considering the leadership roles required to maximise 
Burberry’s ability to successfully implement these plans.  
It was identified that there was a need for a new chief 
executive with strong luxury retail experience to lead on  
the commercial, operational and financial elements of the 
business, who could partner with Christopher Bailey,  
who would continue his leadership of the brand and  
design elements of the business as President and Chief 
Creative Officer. These joint leadership roles would share 
responsibility for strategy and would report jointly to the 
Chairman. As Carol Fairweather had signalled her intention 
to step down as Chief Financial Officer and John Smith  
as Chief Operating Officer, the Committee also focused  
on the succession of these roles. To align with the change 
programme, the aim was to seek an individual with a strong 
financial and commercial background who could combine 
these roles.
The Committee engaged Egon Zehnder who specialises  
in the recruitment of high-calibre directors and to ensure 
that the process could be truly global. Egon Zehnder has  
no other connection with the Group. A search was initiated 
against an agreed profile and regular reports provided to 
the Committee as the process progressed. This yielded  
a pool of candidates which was reduced to a shortlist of 
potential candidates. Shortlisted candidates were assessed 
and were met by key Board members first and then with  
the non-executive directors. This culminated in one-to-one 
discussions with me and each of the non-executive 
directors to seek their views on the candidates. I am  
very pleased that the Committee considered that the  
right candidate for the position of Chief Executive Officer 
was Marco Gobbetti, and for the combined role of  
Chief Operating and Financial Officer was Julie Brown.
The Committee recommended these appointments to the 
Board and following unanimous Board approval, they were 
announced on 11 July 2016. Julie joined the Board on 18 
January 2017 and Marco will join the Board on 5 July 2017. 
Carol stepped down from the Board on 18 January 2017 
and John on 31 March 2017.
The Committee continues to work diligently on assisting  
the Board on building on its relevant skills and competencies 
for the future under the Board Succession Plan. (See Board 
and Committee composition and succession and Diversity – 
split of male/female Board members on page 76). The 
composition of the Board has evolved significantly over  
the past few years with the appointment of four new  
non-executive directors, and with one longer-serving  
non-executive director stepping down. It is anticipated  
that there will be further non-executive director changes  
to the Board in the coming year. 
Following a review, the Committee Chairs were refreshed 
during the year with the appointment on 1 August 2016  
of Jeremy Darroch as the Chair of the Audit Committee  
and Fabiola Arredondo as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. The review also resulted in changes to the 
composition of those Committees effective 1 February 2017 
(see Board and Committee composition and succession  
on page 76). 
Board succession and composition will continue to remain 
a priority for the coming year.

Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report Role of the Committee
The main roles and responsibilities of the Nomination 
Committee are set out in written terms of reference,  
which are available on the Company’s website at  
www.burberryplc.com. The Committee reviews its  
terms of reference annually.
The key areas of responsibility include the following.
 ·
To review the balance and composition of the Board and 
its Committees, ensuring that they remain appropriate.
 ·
To be responsible for overseeing the Board’s succession 
planning requirements in light of the Group’s strategy  
and the Group’s position on diversity and inclusion. This 
includes the identification and assessment of potential 
Board candidates and making recommendations to the 
Board for its approval.
 ·
To keep under review the leadership needs of, and 
succession planning for, the Group in relation to both  
its executive directors and other senior executives. 
Activities during the year
The Committee met three times during the year under 
review. The table on page 75 gives details of directors’ 
attendance at these meetings.
Other regular attendees at Committee meetings include the 
Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief People 
and Corporate Affairs Officer and the Company Secretary.
Annual General Meeting and annual re-election  
of directors
As required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Notice of the 2016 Annual General Meeting was sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. 
A poll vote was taken on each of the resolutions put before 
shareholders. All directors serving at the time of the 2016 
Annual General Meeting attended, and the Chairman of 
the Board and the Chairs of each of the Committees were 
available to answer shareholders’ questions.
Voting at the upcoming 2017 Annual General Meeting  
will be by way of poll. The results of the voting at the  
Annual General Meeting will be announced and details of 
the votes will be available to view on the Group’s website  
at www.burberryplc.com as soon as possible after  
the meeting.
It is the intention that all directors, including the Chairs  
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, 
will attend the 2017 Annual General Meeting and will be 
available to answer shareholders’ questions.
All directors have, since the 2011 Annual General Meeting, 
offered themselves for annual re-election in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code. At the 2017 
Annual General Meeting, all of the directors will again  
retire and all will offer themselves for re-election or, in  
the case of any newly appointed directors, for election.
The biographical details of the current directors can be 
found on pages 68 and 69 of this Annual Report. The 
Chairman confirms that, following the evaluation conducted 
during the year and the review of individual director roles 
and performance led by the Chairman, the performance  
of each of the directors standing for election continues to 
be effective and demonstrates commitment to their roles, 
including commitment of time for Board and Committee 
meetings and any other duties. Accordingly, the Board 
recommends that shareholders approve the resolutions  
to be proposed at the 2017 Annual General Meeting  
relating to the re-election or election of the directors.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the directors, 
including the expected time commitment, are available  
for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Other governance disclosures
Tax strategy
The Group is committed to complying with global tax 
regulations in a responsible manner with due regard to 
governments and shareholders, and to engage in open  
and constructive relationships with tax authorities in the 
territories in which it operates. The Group’s tax planning  
is consistent with this responsible approach, and it will not 
enter into arrangements for the purpose of achieving a tax 
advantage. The Group tax strategy is implemented through 
the Group’s tax policy which directs and aligns the activities 
of the various functions within the Group in order to achieve 
the strategy’s objectives.
Tax governance framework
The Chief Operating and Financial Officer is responsible  
for the Group’s tax policy which is implemented with  
the assistance of the Finance Leadership team. This  
is reviewed on an ongoing basis as part of the regular 
financial planning cycle. In addition, the Group’s tax  
status is reported regularly to the Group Risk and  
Audit Committees. The Audit Committee is responsible  
for monitoring all significant tax matters including the 
Group’s tax policy. Audit Committee meetings are attended 
by a number of Group officers and employees including  
the Chief Operating and Financial Officer, the Senior  
Vice President – Group Tax, the Company Secretary,  
the General Counsel, and the Chief People and  
Corporate Affairs Officer, who oversees all corporate 
responsibility matters.

Board and Governance – Corporate Governance Report Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration Report which has been approved by both the Remuneration 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) and the Board for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
Thank you to Ian Carter for his leadership over the last four years, and thank you for entrusting me with the opportunity  
to lead the Committee. Looking forward, I would like to reflect the Remuneration Committee’s commitment to setting 
measured executive remuneration that motivates talent, supports the execution of the Company strategy, drives 
performance, and most importantly, is aligned with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. 
During the year the Board reviewed the composition of all its Committees. Given the increasing complexity and time 
commitment required of serving members, we reduced the Remuneration Committee to four non-executive directors:  
Philip Bowman, Stephanie George, Ian Carter and I. We are grateful to Jeremy Darroch, Matthew Key and Dame Carolyn 
McCall for their respective prior contributions. 
As you are aware, 2016/17 was a year of senior leadership Board level change at Burberry. This past January, Julie Brown 
joined as Chief Operating and Financial Officer and Marco Gobbetti joined as Executive Chairman, Asia Pacific and Middle 
East. On 5 July 2017 Marco will join the Board as Chief Executive Officer. Christopher Bailey will transition from his role of 
Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer to become President and Chief Creative Officer. Julie and Marco bring experience 
that is invaluable to the delivery of our strategy and the long-term growth of the business. Likewise, Christopher’s ongoing 
strategic contribution and creative talent will continue to advance the Burberry product and brand. Details of Marco,  
Julie and Christopher’s remuneration are set out on page 106.
After ten years at Burberry, Carol Fairweather stepped down as Chief Financial Officer in January and left the Company  
on 31 March 2017; John Smith resigned to pursue new interests and stepped down from his role as Chief Operating Officer  
in January and from the Board on 31 March 2017. He will leave the business on 12 June 2017. Both Carol and John have 
effectively supported Julie’s transition into the business, and I would like to thank them for their commitment to the 
Company. Details of payments to Carol and John are set out on pages 108 and 109.
2017 Remuneration Policy
In setting the 2017 remuneration policy (the ‘Policy’), the Committee prioritised the reduction of the overall maximum 
potential quantum and established clear measures to align the long-term interests of executives with those of shareholders.
Given the recent Executive Director level changes, the Committee decided that it was prudent to maintain the existing 
operational performance measures for the annual bonus and the Executive Share Plan (the ‘ESP’). However, we have  
added flexibility to the ESP by widening the ranges for the potential weightings of the measures that comprise it. Once  
the senior team is fully integrated and has the opportunity to further develop Burberry’s strategy, it may be necessary  
to make additional changes to the Policy in 2018. Should this occur, we will consult with shareholders, and potentially  
put the Policy to another vote at the 2018 AGM. 
For the 2017 Policy, the Committee is recommending the following key changes:
Reduction in pay policy maxima for executive directors
 ·
Reduction in the annual bonus policy maximum from 225% to 200% of salary
 ·
Reduction in both ‘normal’ and ‘exceptional’ maximum level of award under the ESP from 400% to 325% and from  
600% to 375% of salary respectively
 ·
Reduction in the level of vesting for threshold performance under the ESP from 25% to 15% of awards 
 ·
Reduction in the maximum annual salary increase from 15% to 10%, with the expectation that annual increases will not 
normally exceed the average increase for the employee population
 ·
Reduction of the maximum relocation benefits that may be paid to current executive directors from £250,000 to £200,000
 ·
Reduction of pension contribution from 30% to 20% of salary for new external executive director appointments
 ·
Removal of the ability to award ‘sign on’ bonus or share awards (other than buy-outs) on recruitment 
87
Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report
Directors’
Remuneration Report Alignment with shareholders
We have increased our shareholding guidelines to further align the interests of executives with shareholders. The guideline 
for Christopher Bailey will remain at 500,000 shares as this is considered a significant holding (circa eight times salary as  
at the 31 March 2017 closing price of £17.24). We have increased the guideline for the other executive directors from two 
times to three times base salary. We will continue to require retention of 50% of shares from the vesting of awards, and 
an investment of 50% of annual bonus paid (net of tax) until individual executives meet the guidelines. The Committee has  
also indicated to executive directors that, other than in exceptional circumstances, progress should be made towards the 
guidelines, even in years when incentives have not vested.
Formalising best practice into the Policy
For executive directors, clawback provisions apply to the annual bonus award. ESP awards granted to executive directors 
are subject to a holding period of five years from the date of award. Both clawback and malus provisions will now apply to 
the ESP award. The holding period and clawback best practice features will be included in the formal Policy going forward.
Remuneration for 2017/18
The details of the Committee’s intended approach to the operation of remuneration policy during the 2017/18 year are set 
out in section 4. Please note the following:
 ·
There are no increases to base salaries for executive directors.
 ·
There are no changes to the levels of annual bonus award for executive directors of up to 200% of salary at maximum. 
The annual bonus will continue to be 100% based on adjusted PBT. 
 ·
There are no changes to the levels of the ESP award for the executive directors: 325% of salary for Christopher Bailey  
and Marco Gobbetti and 300% of salary for Julie Brown. We have retained 2016 operational performance measures for 
the ESP that focus on revenue, profitability and the efficient use of capital, with the same weightings as in 2016/17. Targets 
have been carefully calibrated to ensure that they are stretching and aligned with strategy, latest performance objectives 
and long-term value creation for our shareholders.
Remuneration for 2016/17
As set out in the Strategic Report on pages 9 to 65, 2016/17 was a challenging year for the luxury sector overall. In addition  
to the macro environment, the Committee recognised that 2016/17 was a year of significant leadership transition for the 
Company, and that it was critical to retain key talent and keep the business moving forward during this period. In this business 
context, the Company delivered revenue of £2,766m and Adjusted profit of £462m, and the incentive outcomes are as follows:
 ·
Annual bonus: Adjusted PBT achieved was just below the bonus target resulting in a bonus payment of 46% of maximum. 
Notwithstanding the strong strategic progress made during the year, Christopher Bailey decided that he did not wish to be 
considered for any bonus in respect of 2016/17 in light of the underlying financial performance of the business for the 
year. The Committee welcomed and agreed with his decision. 
 ·
The long-term incentive awards based on Adjusted PBT and granted in 2014 – Co-Investment Plan (‘CIP’) awards and 
50% of Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’) awards – will not vest as Adjusted PBT declined over the three-year period ending  
in 2016/17. The remaining 50% of 2014 RSP awards based on total shareholder return (‘TSR’) relative to our peers will  
vest at 38.5% of maximum as we outperformed the median of our TSR comparator group. More detail is provided on 
pages 99 and 100.
 ·
The Committee has reviewed performance for the year against the criteria on Christopher’s 2014 exceptional share  
award and has determined that achievement for 2016/17 was 50% of maximum. This gives an overall vesting outcome  
of 61.7% of maximum for tranche 1 of this award based on annual assessment of performance over three years (2014/15: 
85%, 2015/16: 50% and 2016/17: 50%). The Committee believes this level of vesting appropriately reflects the progress  
of the business in executing our strategy and Christopher’s contribution to this over the period. This award will vest in  
July 2017 and section 2.6 of this report provides further detail.
 ·
As set out in the Remuneration Report last year, Christopher deferred the vesting date of the first tranche of his 2013 
exceptional award, made prior to joining the Board, from July 2016 to July 2017. Both the first and second tranches of  
this award will therefore vest in July 2017, as set out in section 2.7.

Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report The 2017 Remuneration Policy and the 2016/17 Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to the vote at the AGM  
on 13 July 2017. On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, thank you to our shareholders for your feedback on the 
development of the Policy. I look forward to on-going discussions on executive remuneration and appreciate your 
engagement, consideration and support at the AGM.

1. Directors’ remuneration policy 
Burberry’s directors’ remuneration policy as set out in this report will be put to shareholders for approval at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’) to be held on 13 July 2017. It is the Committee’s intention that the remuneration policy will apply  
to payments made from the date of the 2017 AGM. We have made the changes outlined in the introductory letter to reduce 
the policy maximum level of pay for executive directors, to reflect best practice, to align with shareholder expectations and 
to ensure that the policy has the necessary flexibility to support the business as the strategy evolves. Additionally, changes 
have also been made to increase clarity or to simplify. 
The Committee believes that Burberry’s remuneration should be strongly linked to business performance  
and strategic direction taking into account the global markets in which it operates and from which it recruits talent.  
The 2017 Remuneration Policy is based on the following principles:
Linked to the performance and strategy of the business: the overall remuneration framework should provide a balance 
between key short-term and long-term business objectives. Variable pay for executive directors includes (1) an annual cash 
bonus based on short-term indicators of the financial performance of Burberry and (2) long-term share-based incentives 
again linked to the financial performance and key performance indicators of Burberry. More detail on the Company’s key 
performance indicators linked to executive remuneration and their strategic alignment is set out on pages 28 and 29.
Shareholder value and alignment: remuneration should provide close alignment with long-term value creation for shareholders 
through the selection of appropriate performance measures and targets, should be tied to the future success of the Company, 
and should emphasise variable pay and deliver a significant proportion of remuneration in shares, some of which are 
expected to be retained in accordance with the shareholding guidelines.
Competitive in the global talent market: total remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain exceptional 
talent. The Committee takes into account Burberry’s main global competitors for talent and comparable UK companies 
when considering the total remuneration for executive directors. The Committee recognises that, for each executive,  
the relative importance of these reference groups may be different depending on the skills and experience required  
to undertake the specific role. Benefits are based on competitive market practice for each executive depending on  
individual circumstances.

Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report 1.1  Directors’ remuneration policy effective from 13 July 2017
Purpose
Maximum annual opportunity  
and link to performance Operation
Executive directors
Base salary 
To recognise the 
responsibilities, 
experience and  
ability of our talent in  
a competitive global 
environment, keeping  
our people focused  
on, and passionate 
about, the brand.
The maximum annual increase (per individual 
executive director) is 10% of base salary; 
however, annual increases will not normally 
exceed the average increase for the broader 
employee population.
Salary levels and any increases for executive directors are set within 
the same framework and ranges as those for all other employees, 
taking into account individual performance and overall contribution 
to the business during the year, cost to the Company, the external 
economic climate and positioning against peers.
The Committee considers the impact of any base salary increase  
on the total remuneration package.
Annual bonus 
To reward executive 
directors for achieving 
annual financial targets 
linked to the strategic 
plan agreed by  
the Board.
Maximum awards are:
 ·
200% of salary
Performance measure:
 ·
100% linked to adjusted profit performance
Percentage of maximum bonus payable at  
each level of performance:
 ·
25% at threshold
 ·
50% at target
 ·
100% at maximum
The Committee recognises that strong financial performance is key 
to delivering superior shareholder returns and that annual profitability 
is a key measure of this. 
Targets are set each year by reference to budget, the strategic plan, 
long-term financial goals, latest projections for the relevant year  
and broker earnings estimates for Burberry and its competitors.
Targets will be disclosed retrospectively following completion of  
the relevant financial year. 
Executives are required to invest 50% of any net bonus earned  
until executive shareholding guidelines are met.
Clawback provision: During the period of three years from date  
of payment (whether in cash or shares), the Company may seek to 
recover any bonus from individual directors in whole or in part in the 
event of a material misstatement in the Company’s audited financial 
statements or if the bonus outcome has been incorrectly calculated.
Use of judgement: The Committee may determine that it is 
appropriate to adjust the bonus outcome if, for example, outcomes 
are not considered to be reflective of underlying performance or 
where targets are no longer appropriate. It is anticipated that any 
adjustment would be infrequent and in exceptional circumstances 
only and within the limits of the policy. Details of any application  
of judgement would be disclosed at the time in the relevant 
remuneration report.

Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report Purpose
Maximum annual opportunity  
and link to performance Operation
Burberry Executive 
Share Plan (‘ESP’) 
To focus executives  
on, and reward them for, 
sustainable long-term 
performance and 
successful execution  
of the Company’s  
long-term strategy.
To help maintain the 
stability of the top 
executive team, and align 
executives’ interests with 
those of shareholders.
Maximum awards are:
 ·
325% of salary (in normal circumstances)
 ·
375% of salary (in exceptional 
circumstances, to be determined  
at the Committee’s discretion)
Performance measures for executive directors 
to be measured over three financial years:
 ·
 20% to 40% on growth in revenue
 ·
 40% to 60% on growth in adjusted profit
 ·
 20% to 30% on a measure to incentivise  
the efficient use of capital
For each of the measures the vesting profile 
shall be as follows:
 ·
 No more than 15% vesting for threshold 
performance
 ·
 100% vesting for maximum performance
Vesting: 50% after three years, remaining  
50% after four years.
Holding period: while executive directors  
are employed by Burberry, normally no ESP 
shares may be sold, except to cover any tax 
liabilities arising out of the award, until five  
years from the date of grant.
Targets for the measures will be calibrated ahead of each annual 
grant by reference to the latest strategic plan, long-term financial 
goals, latest three-year projections and broker earnings estimates 
for Burberry and its competitors. The threshold targets will be 
calibrated to be of median difficulty, and the maximum targets  
will be of upper quartile difficulty as determined by the Committee. 
Targets will be disclosed ahead of each annual grant and for 
completed cycles, detail on the performance achieved against  
the targets will be disclosed.
Burberry’s strategy currently aims to deliver both profit and  
revenue growth and therefore to align with strategy, a measure 
based on revenue growth is included as a transparent and 
quantifiable indicator of performance. Growth in adjusted profit  
has been chosen as the Committee believes strong growth in 
adjusted profit is key to delivering superior shareholder returns.  
The efficient use of capital measure is intended to incentivise 
management to combine superior growth in profit and revenue  
with attractive returns on future investment but not to act as a 
disincentive to invest. 
A cash payment equivalent to the value of dividends which would 
have been received during the vesting period will be paid only in 
respect of shares that vest.
The awards are structured as nil-cost options or conditional rights  
to receive free shares on vesting.
Discretion: The Committee retains the discretion to grant  
awards of up to 375% of salary in exceptional circumstances.  
The Committee may vary the weighting applied to each measure  
within the ranges shown.
Use of judgement: The Committee will have the ability to adjust  
the calculated level of vesting by reference to the quality of earnings  
and effective execution of strategy to ensure the growth delivered  
is long-term sustainable growth and within the limits of the policy 
only. Details of any adjustments would be disclosed in the relevant 
remuneration report.
Malus provision: Unvested shares or awards may be forfeited  
in whole or in part in the event of a material misstatement in the 
Company’s audited financial statements.
Clawback provision: During the period of three years from date  
of vest, the Company may seek to recover any vested shares or 
awards from individual directors in whole or in part (or cash of 
equivalent value) in the event of a material misstatement in the 
Company’s audited financial statements or if the outturn has  
been incorrectly calculated.
All-employee 
share plans 
To encourage employee 
share ownership  
at all levels.
Sharesave: maximum savings amount  
of £6,000 per annum, with which shares  
can be purchased with a 20% discount. 
Share Incentive Plan and International  
Freeshare Plan: awards with a value of  
up to £500 per annum.
Burberry operates two all-employee share plans:
The Sharesave Scheme offers eligible employees (including 
executive directors) an opportunity to enter into a three- or five-year 
savings contract to save a portion of their salary which can be  
used to purchase Burberry shares, normally at the end of the savings 
contract, at up to a 20% discount to the market price at the date  
of invitation.
Awards of shares or a cash equivalent (where the use of shares  
is not possible) are made annually to all eligible employees under  
the UK Share Incentive Plan and International Freeshare Plans.
Discretion: The Committee reserves the right to increase the 
maxima to the extent that the change is made on the same basis  
for all employees participating in the plan.
Pensions 
To offer market-
competitive benefits.
Maximum company contribution: 30% of salary 
per annum for the current executive directors.
For any new external executive director 
appointments, the maximum Company 
contribution will be no more than 20% of  
salary per annum.
Executive directors participate in defined contribution arrangements.
Participants may elect to receive some or all of their entitlement as  
a cash allowance.

Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report Purpose
Maximum annual opportunity  
and link to performance Operation
Other benefits 
and allowances  
To promote the well 
being of employees, 
allowing them to focus  
on the business.
Executive directors receive a cash allowance 
and non-cash benefits. The aggregate 
maximum value of benefits would not normally 
exceed £100,000 per individual per annum 
(other than in circumstances deemed to  
be exceptional by the Committee).
The Committee may agree that the Company  
will pay additional allowances linked to relocation 
or international assignment. For the purposes  
of providing a maximum, this will not exceed 
£200,000 in any year for any one existing director.
Christopher Bailey is entitled to a cash 
allowance of £440,000 per annum, as agreed in 
his previous role, prior to his appointment as an 
executive director. He is also entitled to receive 
the non-cash benefits, as noted to the right;  
the value of these is not normally expected  
to exceed £20,000 per annum.
Benefit levels are reviewed on an annual basis and, while the 
Committee does not intend to increase the level of provision above 
the maximum value, the cost to the Company of providing benefits 
can vary due to a number of factors outside the Company’s control.
Benefits for executive directors may include, but are not limited to:
 ·
 private medical insurance
 ·
 l i f e a s s u ran ce
 ·
 long-term disability insurance
 ·
 c a r a l l o w an ce
 ·
 c l oth i n g a ll o w a n c e
 ·
 e mp l o y e e d is c oun t
Reasonably incurred expenses will be reimbursed.
The Company may meet any tax liabilities that may arise  
on expenses.
Discretion: The Committee retains the discretion to provide  
other benefits to the executive directors as deemed necessary.
Discretion to honour all prior commitments 
The Committee reserves the right to make any payments (including exercising any discretion it has relating to such payments) where the  
terms were agreed before this policy came into effect or prior to an individual being appointed a director of the Company. For these purposes 
entitlements arising under the Company’s current remuneration policy (as approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM) will be incorporated  
into this policy, and ‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration, and an entitlement under an award over  
shares (or cash of equivalent value) arising at the time the award is granted.
Notes on share awards:
 – Adjustment of share awards: The number of shares subject to an award (and the option price, where relevant) can be adjusted on a rights issue, special dividend, 
de-merger or variation of capital or similar transaction. Subject to the plan rules, share awards can be satisfied by a cash payment equal to the value of shares 
the participant would otherwise have received.
 – In respect of our share plans, this table presents a summary of the key and relevant information for the Plan Rules. It is the Committee’s intention that these 
plans will operate in accordance with the Plan Rules as approved by shareholders (where applicable).
A summary of the changes between the Policy set out above for the executive directors and the Company current Policy (as approved at the 2014 AGM) is set out 
on pages 87 and 88 within the Committee Chair’s letter.

high-calibre chairman  
by offering a market-
competitive fee.
Maximum increase: 10% of fee  
(per annum over period since last review date).
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all responsibilities.
The fee level is reviewed at least every three years by

Fee levels are reviewed at least every three years by the 
Board, with reference to UK market levels in companies  
of a similar size.
Fees are paid in cash.
Chairman and NEDs 
– other benefits 
To enable the Chairman 
and NEDs to undertake 
their roles.
Non-executive directors receive a £2,000 attendance 
allowance per meeting for attendance at Board meetings 
outside of their country of residence (except the  
Chairman) and, as brand ambassadors, discount on

arise on expenses or benefits.
Attendance allowances are paid in cash.
Reasonably incurred expenses will be reimbursed.

a NED should the Company require significant additional 
time commitment in exceptional circumstances.
The Company currently has no intention to use this discretion.
The Policy above includes the addition of healthcare cover and a car and driver for the Chairman, which are considered appropriate benefits for this role.
1.2. Policy on recruitment and promotion arrangements
Except as described below, the Committee will pay new directors in accordance with the approved remuneration policy.  
The ongoing annual remuneration arrangements for new executive directors will therefore comprise base salary, annual 
bonus, ESP award, pension, benefits and all-employee share plans. In addition, the recruitment policy below permits the 
Committee to take the following actions, if appropriate, in the best interests of the Company and therefore shareholders.
 ·
For an internal appointment, any commitment made in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms. 
 ·
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will pay certain reasonable 
allowances linked to relocation (and the limit in the policy table for existing directors will not apply in this case) as 
appropriate and will meet reasonable expenses/reimburse an executive against additional costs on appointment.  
In addition, the Committee may agree that the Company will pay certain reasonable allowances linked to repatriation  
on termination of employment. 
 ·
For external appointments, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to take account of 
remuneration relinquished when leaving a former employer. As far as possible and appropriate, such payments would 
reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to the relinquished remuneration.
 ·
If necessary, the Committee may enter into a service contract with a longer initial notice period to secure the appointment 
of an executive from an environment where longer notice periods are market practice. The notice period would be 
reduced to 12 months or less on a rolling basis after the initial longer period has finished.
 ·
For internal appointments the terms and conditions of the individual employment prior to the appointment will remain  
in force unless the Committee otherwise decides and the individual agrees.
93
Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report 1.3. Supplementary information
Remuneration policy in the rest of the Company
The remuneration arrangements for executive directors outlined in section 1.1. above are consistent with those for the  
other senior executives, although quantum and award opportunities vary by executive level.
In making its decisions on executive remuneration, the Committee considers the reward framework for all employees 
worldwide, ensuring that the principles applied are consistent with the executive remuneration policy. Merit increases 
awarded to executives are determined within the broader context of employee remuneration. All our employees are  
eligible for an annual bonus based on performance and the principle of shareholder alignment is reflected throughout  
the organisation through our all-employee share plans, which are (where legally possible) extended to all eligible 
Burberry employees globally. 
Burberry is also a partner of the Living Wage Foundation and accredited as a UK Living Wage employer.
Indicative total remuneration levels
A substantial portion of executive director remuneration is dependent on Company performance. The charts below illustrate 
indicative levels of total remuneration which would be received by each executive director under the remuneration policy set 
out above on pages 90 to 92 for the first complete financial year in which the policy will apply (from 1 April 2017) at each of: 
(1) maximum, (2) target and (3) below threshold performance scenarios.

Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report Policy on service agreements and termination provisions
Executive directors
The Company’s general policy on executive directors’ service agreements is that they operate on a rolling basis with no 
specific end date and include a 12-month or less notice period both to and from the Company. The table below sets out 
information on service agreements for the current executive directors. Christopher Bailey has a service agreement put in 
place prior to implementation of this policy and includes at least a six-month notice period to the Company. 
Date of current  
service agreement
Date employment 
commenced
Notice period to  
the Company
Notice period from  
the Company
Christopher Bailey 30 April 2014 7 May 2001 6 months 12 months
Julie Brown 11 July 2016 18 January 2017 12 months 12 months
Standard terms on termination
Salary, benefits and allowances: Executive directors continue to receive salary, benefits and allowances during their 
notice period. Pursuant to the terms of Business Protection Agreements (which set out restrictive covenants and terms 
relating to the non-solicitation of employees) in place with the executive directors (except Christopher Bailey), payments 
equal to salary for the duration of certain restrictive covenants may be made if the employer chooses to enforce them to 
protect Burberry’s continuing business.
Annual bonus paid in cash: An executive considered to be a ‘good leaver’ (for example leaving the Company on retirement, 
redundancy, ill health, as a result of death in service or in other circumstances determined by the Committee) may remain 
eligible for a pro-rated payment of the annual bonus subject to achievement of bonus targets. An executive director who has 
left employment for a reason such as joining a competitor company during the performance period or before the payment is 
due, or who has given or been given notice, will not be eligible to receive an annual bonus. The Committee retains discretion 
to vary the approach and the payment of annual bonus to leavers, as outlined below.
ESP awards: For an executive considered to be a ‘good leaver’ (including leaving the Company on retirement, redundancy, 
ill health, as a result of death in service or in other circumstances determined by the Committee), outstanding awards will be 
pro-rated for time and vest subject to performance on the original vesting date. For an executive director whose employment 
is terminated for any other reason (such as leaving to join a competitor company) during the performance period, ESP 
awards will lapse in full. The Committee retains discretion to vary the approach and the extent to which awards vest for 
leavers, as outlined below.
Other: Reasonable disbursements (for example, legal or professional fees, relocation/repatriation costs) may be paid.  
Any other employee share plan entitlements (such as under the Sharesave Scheme, UK Share Incentive Plan or the 
International Freeshare Plan) will be dealt with in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan and the Committee  
may exercise the discretions provided under those plans.
Discretion: In the Committee’s experience, directors leave for a wide variety of reasons and individual circumstances,  
which do not all fall within the ‘good leaver’ categories outlined above. The Committee therefore retains discretion to  
approve payments to individuals based on individual circumstances and performance while in office or employment.  
In applying any such discretion, the Committee will make any decisions by considering the best interests of shareholders  
and those of the remaining employees including executive directors. Where awards are subject to performance conditions, 
these would be tested at the end of the relevant period(s) and any award which is allowed to vest would be pro-rated for  
time in office or employment.
Christopher Bailey
The Company has agreed specific arrangements with Christopher Bailey in relation to termination of his employment  
in substitution for the first two sections of the standard terms described in the previous section (‘Salary, benefits and 
allowances’ and ‘Annual bonus paid in cash’). These specific arrangements are described below.
The Company may terminate Christopher Bailey’s service agreement without cause by giving 12 months’ written notice.  
The Company may terminate the service agreement immediately, in its sole discretion, by written notice and electing to  
pay to Christopher Bailey either (1) a lump sum representing his salary in lieu of the unexpired notice period within 14 days  
of termination or (2) in monthly instalments of 1/12 of his annual salary and 1/12 of his annual allowance of £440,000 in  
lieu of the unexpired notice period or until Christopher Bailey commences any new employment or engagement if earlier. 
Christopher Bailey must use his reasonable endeavours to seek alternative employment during the balance of his unexpired 
notice period. The Company will also pay Christopher Bailey a bonus for the year in which employment terminated subject 
to achievement of the performance targets and other requirements of the bonus arrangements for that year, pro-rated to 
actual service in the bonus year. The bonus would be paid on the usual bonus payment date. 
95
Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report Christopher Bailey may terminate his service agreement at any time for ‘Good Reason’, provided he has requested that the 
Company remedy the relevant breach within 14 days of notification and the Company has failed to do so. ‘Good Reason’ 
means the Company is guilty of serious and continued non-observance or breach of the terms of the service agreement  
or of any applicable substantial laws which are detrimental to Christopher Bailey. On termination for ‘Good Reason’ 
Christopher Bailey is entitled to a lump sum payment representing his salary in lieu of notice. The Company will also  
pay Christopher Bailey a bonus for the year in which employment terminated subject to achievement of the performance 
targets and other requirements of the bonus arrangements for that year, pro-rated to actual service in the bonus year.  
The bonus would be paid on the usual bonus payment date. 
The Company may terminate the service agreement on health grounds by giving Christopher Bailey not less than six months’ 
notice once Christopher Bailey’s entitlement to Company sick pay has been exhausted or he has been incapacitated for more 
than 26 weeks (whether or not continuous) in any period of 52 weeks. The Company may, in its sole discretion, terminate the 
employment by making a payment of 130% of his salary, and pay the allowance in lieu of notice within 14 days of termination. 
The Company will also pay Christopher Bailey a bonus for the year in which employment terminated subject to achievement 
of the performance targets and other requirements of the bonus arrangements for that year, pro-rated to actual service in 
that year. The bonus would be paid on the usual bonus payment date. 
If Christopher Bailey dies during his employment with the Company, the Company will pay his estate his salary to the 
termination date and a bonus calculated as for an ill health termination described above.
Upon termination of the service agreement, Christopher Bailey’s entitlements (if any) under the relevant share plans in  
which he participates will be determined in accordance with the rules of those plans, as described above.
Corporate events
Upon a change in control of the Company, outstanding ESP awards will, unless the Committee determines otherwise, be 
pro-rated for time and vest subject to performance at the point of change in control. Alternatively, they can be exchanged  
for equivalent awards over shares in the acquiring company. The Committee can also allow full or partial vesting on a  
de-merger, special dividend, distribution in specie or if the participant is relocated in circumstances which would give rise  
to unfavourable tax treatment. Malus, clawback and holding period requirements will cease to apply following a change  
of control.
Any other employee share plan entitlements (such as under the Sharesave Scheme, UK Share Incentive Plan or the 
International Freeshare Plan) will be dealt with in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan and the Committee may 
exercise the discretions provided under those plans.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors serve under Letters of Appointment with the Company. Non-executive directors may continue 
to serve subject to the annual re-election by shareholders at each AGM of the Company, subject to six months’ notice by 
either party. There are no provisions for compensation for loss of office in the Letters of Appointment.
1.4. Development of directors’ remuneration policy
In developing and reviewing the directors’ remuneration policy, the Committee is mindful of the views of shareholders  
and is sensitive of the relativities of arrangements for executive directors to those for employees more generally.
The Committee proactively seeks feedback from shareholders when considering any significant changes to remuneration  
for executive directors. The Committee also listens to and takes into consideration investor views more generally throughout 
the year. For example, the Company consulted with its largest shareholders in the autumn of 2016 regarding 2016 ESP 
awards (in particular the performance measure targets that apply) and refined the proposals based on the feedback 
received and consulted in the spring of 2017 on the 2017 remuneration policy.
Employees are free to communicate their views internally on any topic including the remuneration policy for directors  
by using the Burberry internal social media platform or using the employee confidential helpline. In addition, many of 
Burberry’s employees are shareholders, through the Sharesave and Free Share plans, and they, like other shareholders,  
are able to express their views on directors’ remuneration at each general meeting. During 2017 Burberry will launch its  
all-employee engagement survey. Views of our employees generally and on their remuneration will be taken into account 
when building future plans. However, given the scale, geographic spread and the diversity of roles of Burberry’s employees, 
the Committee does not proactively consult with employees specifically on the remuneration policy for directors.

Notes:
1 The PBT performance condition attached to the 2014 CIP awards was not met and so none of these awards will vest. 
2  The amounts shown for 2014 RSP awards vesting for Christopher Bailey, John Smith and Carol Fairweather shown (for year to 31 March 2017) are based  
on a share price of £16.721 (average share price over the three months to 31 March 2017) as these awards have not yet vested. 
3  The amount shown as ‘2014 Exceptional award’ for Christopher Bailey relates to vesting of the first tranche of his 2014 exceptional share award, for which  
77,084 of a maximum 125,000 shares will vest on 31 July 2017. As this award has not yet vested the value is based on a share price of £16.721 (the average  
share price over the three months to 31 March 2017) and includes an estimated payment of £103,523 in lieu of dividends.
4  Remuneration for Julie Brown relates to the period 18 January 2017 to 31 March 2017. As compensation for the incentives she forfeited on leaving her previous 
employer, Julie Brown received a cash bonus of £550,000 (included in ‘Prior company bonus buyout’) and was granted nil-cost options over 240,000 shares 
(included in ‘Prior company shares buyout’) at a grant price of £16.6033 (the average share price over the 3 days prior to grant) used to calculate the value of  
the grant shown above. Further detail on these buyout awards is included on page 108. Julie Brown serves as a non-executive director of Roche Holdings and  
it was agreed that fees earned in connection with this appointment can be retained by her. For the period 18 January to 31 March 2017, Julie’s pro-rata fees for 
this appointment were £47,990. As set out in section 3.3, Julie will use 50% of her net of tax bonus buy-out award to buy Burberry shares.
5 2016/17 remuneration for John Smith relates to the period 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017, when he stepped down from the Board.
6 2016/17 remuneration for Carol Fairweather relates to the period 1 April 2016 to 18 January 2017, when she stepped down from the Board.
7 Fees for David Tyler for the 2015/16 year relate to the period 1 April 2015 to 31 December 2015, when he stepped down from the Board.

Notes:
1  Cash allowances for Fabiola Arredondo, Philip Bowman, Ian Carter and Stephanie George are attendance allowances of £2,000 for each meeting attended 
outside of their country of residence.
2  The reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by non-executive directors in the performance of their duties is deemed by HM Revenue & Customs to  
be subject to UK Income Tax. The tables above include figures for ‘Benefits/allowances’, including costs in respect of air travel and other incidental costs 
incurred in attending regular Board and Committee meetings. Any tax liabilities arising on the reimbursement of these costs will be settled by the Company. 
Amounts disclosed have been estimated and have been ‘grossed up’ at a tax rate of 45%. Note that expenses for Fabiola Arredondo, Ian Carter and Stephanie 
George include travel expenses from the USA. 
2.2. Salary and pension for 2016/17 (audited)
Christopher Bailey did not receive any increase to his salary for the 2016/17 year and his salary continues to be £1,100,000. 
Julie Brown’s salary from the date of appointment was £700,000. Carol Fairweather’s salary was £500,000 for the full year 
(£399,000 of this was for the period during which she served as a director, as shown in the table on page 97) and John 
Smith’s salary was £592,000.
Each executive director receives an annual pension contribution or allowance equal to 30% of base salary. No director has  
a prospective entitlement to receive a defined benefit pension.

Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report 2.3. Annual bonus outcomes 2016/17 (audited)
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for 2016/17 was 200% of salary for the Chief Creative and Chief Executive  
Officer and 150% of salary for other directors. Annual bonuses were based on Adjusted PBT (which includes adjustments  
for fragrance and beauty licence intangible asset charges, costs associated with the transfer of the Beauty operations, 
restructuring costs, China put option liability finance charge, and BME deferred consideration charges as set out in the 
Group Financial Review on pages 56 and 57). As set out in letters from the Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer and 
the Chairman, 2016/17 continued to be a challenging year for the luxury sector and for the Company. Against this uncertain 
background, and reflecting the plans for accelerating our productivity and efficiency agenda, the Committee set a realistically 
stretching target for Adjusted PBT of £334m for the 2016/17 annual bonus, with threshold level of performance at £320m 
and maximum at £366m (all at 2015/16 exchange rates). Whilst the 2016/17 Adjusted PBT outcome of £332m (at 2015/16 
exchange rates; £462m at reported rates) is above threshold, Christopher Bailey decided that he did not wish to be 
considered for any bonus in respect of 2016/17 in light of the underlying financial performance of the business for the  
year. The Committee considered his decision and deemed it to be appropriate. His bonus payment for 2016/17 will therefore 
be nil. The Committee also determined that Carol Fairweather and John Smith would receive their bonuses as previously 
agreed. Julie Brown was not eligible to receive a bonus for her period of service during the year.
The table below sets out the targets and actual performance for 2016/17. As a result of the restructure of the leadership 
team, Carol will be treated as a good leaver for the 2016/17 annual bonus. As John remained in employment and committed 
to business performance for the full 2016/17 financial year, the Committee determined that he would receive an annual 
bonus based on the Adjusted PBT performance outcome.

*  The bonus outcome is calculated using the average exchange rates of the 2015/16 financial year. The level of Adjusted PBT achieved for bonus purposes  
is therefore lower than the reported 2016/17 Adjusted PBT (at £462m) to reflect constant exchange rates.
2.4. Co-Investment Plan outcomes for 2016/17 (audited)
In June 2014, Christopher Bailey, Carol Fairweather and John Smith were granted Co-Investment Plan (‘CIP’) matching 
awards as detailed in the table below. As for the annual bonus, Carol is a good leaver, in-line with the rules of the plan,  
and John is eligible to receive any awards vesting before his leave date on 12 June 2017.
Vesting of 2014 CIP awards was subject to performance from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2017, as follows: 
- 25% of awards vest if growth in Adjusted PBT is 5% per annum over three years 
- 100% vest if Adjusted PBT growth is equal to or exceeds 10% per annum over three years 
The vesting outcome based on three-year Adjusted PBT growth is calculated using constant exchange rates. On this basis, 
Adjusted PBT declined over the three-year period to 31 March 2017, which is below the threshold growth required of 5% p.a. 
and none of the awards will vest, as set out in the table below.

Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report 2.5. Restricted Share Plan outcomes for 2016/17 (audited)
In June 2014, Christopher Bailey, Carol Fairweather and John Smith were awarded Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’) awards  
as detailed in the table below. As for the CIP, Carol is a good leaver, in-line with the rules of the plan, and John is eligible to 
receive any awards vesting before his leave date. Vesting of 2014 RSP awards was subject to performance from 1 April 2014 
to 31 March 2017, as detailed below. On this basis, Adjusted PBT declined over the three-year period to 31 March 2017, 
which is below the threshold growth required of 5% p.a. and none of the PBT element (50%) of these awards will vest. The 
remaining 50% of 2014 RSP awards based on TSR relative to our peers will vest at 38.5%, as detailed in the following table.

2.6. Christopher Bailey’s 2014 exceptional performance-based award – first tranche outcome (audited)
As reported in previous years, Christopher Bailey was granted an exceptional performance-based award of 500,000 shares 
in June 2014, on his appointment to Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer. Vesting of the award is phased over five 
years, subject to the extent that the performance criteria set out below have been met, measured from the date of grant  
to the relevant vesting date:
 ·
the strategic development of the business measured against the strategic plan approved by the Board from time to time;
 ·
the Company’s financial performance, in assessing which, the Remuneration Committee will have reference to the profit 
before tax condition applied to awards made in 2014 under the Burberry Group CIP. This performance condition requires 
growth in Adjusted PBT over three years of between 5% at threshold and 10% p.a. at maximum;
 ·
the personal contribution made by Christopher Bailey; 
 ·
the shareholder value delivered in the context of the evolution of the luxury goods markets in which Burberry operated 
over the period between the date of grant and the relevant vesting date; and 
 ·
any other performance factors which are appropriate in assessing the extent of vesting having regard to the interests  
of shareholders.
The first tranche (up to 125,000 shares) is due to vest on 31 July 2017. The remaining shares are due to vest as follows:  
up to 125,000 shares on 31 July 2018 and up to 250,000 shares on 31 July 2019.
The Committee assesses progress towards achieving the objectives each financial year, and prior to each vesting date 
determines the extent to which the objectives were achieved over the three, four or five-year performance period,  
having regard to the level of performance achieved in each relevant financial year.
100
Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report At the end of 2016/17 the Committee again reviewed performance against the key performance criteria as set out below. 
Strategic development
In May 2016 Burberry outlined its plans to accelerate its productivity and efficiency agenda, including a programme of  
action to deliver significant cost savings. These plans were built into the five key strategies. During the year the strategies 
have been embedded into the business and significant progress has been made against all of the objectives. Pages 33 to  
46 of the strategic report cover in detail what has been achieved during 2016/17 and the early results of this multi-year 
programme give us real confidence for the future.
Financial performance 
Adjusted PBT of £462m (down 21% underlying) was generated in 2016/17. This performance was in part impacted by  
actions to elevate the brand, including the rationalisation of distribution in several major markets (including Beauty) and  
also the benefits of the strategic cost saving programme. This is below the level of the CIP performance condition threshold 
of 5% growth. 
Additionally, revenue of £2.8bn (down 2% underlying) was delivered with retail outperforming at up 3% overall, negatively 
impacted by a substantial decline in US wholesale as actions were undertaken to reposition the brand and also by the 
planned licence expiry in Japan.
Personal contribution
Christopher has continued to drive the business through this transitional period, whilst evolving the key strategies. He has 
ensured the senior executive team continued to be focussed on both the delivery of the key strategies and the management 
of the business in a challenging economic climate. Christopher has also overseen significant change across the senior team 
and has embedded new executives and retained existing talent. 
Shareholder value
The share price has increased by 16% since Christopher’s appointment to Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer on 
1 May 2014 to 31 March 2017 and dividends for 2016/17 are 38.9p per share. This is an increase of 5% on 2015/16.
Overall Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) for Burberry for the three years to 31 March 2017 is 31.9% (as confirmed by Willis 
Towers Watson), which compares to an average TSR of 23.8% for our core luxury peers* and 24.3% for the FTSE 100.
* Boss, Coach, Ferragamo, Hermes, Kering, LVMH, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Richemont, Swatch, Tiffany, Tod’s.
The Committee considered Christopher’s performance across all of the performance criteria and recognised Christopher’s 
personal contribution to the delivery of the five key strategies. Balancing this against the overall financial performance of  
the Company which is below the CIP target, the Committee considered that a 50% performance achievement for 2016/17 
was appropriate.
The outcomes for each year to date are as follows (as a % of maximum): 2014/15: 85%; 2015/16: 50%; 2016/17: 50%. This level  
of achievement in the final year of the first tranche therefore results in an overall vesting outcome of 61.7% and so 77,084 shares 
of a potential 125,000 shares will vest on 31 July 2017.
101
Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report 2.7. Christopher Bailey’s 2013 exceptional award – vesting of first and second tranches
Before he was appointed to the Board, Christopher Bailey was granted an exceptional share award of 1,000,000 shares.  
As set out in the 2015/16 remuneration report, Christopher deferred the vesting of the first tranche of his award from July 
2016 to July 2017. The Committee have reviewed the appropriateness of any vesting in 2017 and it has been agreed that 
both the first and second tranches of shares, totalling 600,000 shares, will vest in July 2017.
Note: These shares do not appear in the 2016/17 single figure of total remuneration table on page 97 as they were awarded to Christopher prior to his appointment 
to the Board and are not subject to performance.
2.8. Change in the Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration relative to all employees
The table below sets out the year-on-year change (2016/17 vs. 2015/16) in Christopher Bailey’s base salary, benefits and 
bonus received and in the salary, benefits and annual bonus received for a comparator group of UK-based employees  
is also shown.
Salary Benefits Bonus
Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer Year-on-year change (%) 0% 0% 0%
Employees* Year-on-year change (%) 2.0% 0% +100%
*  The comparator group includes all employees in corporate roles based in the UK. This group has been chosen as these employees most closely reflect the 
economic environment in which the Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer operates. For the comparator group of employees, the salary and bonus year-
on-year changes include the annual salary review but exclude any additional changes made in the year, for example on promotion. In 2016/17, the bonus outturn 
based on Adjusted PBT performance was 46% of maximum, compared to 0% of maximum in 2015/16. The 0% increase for benefits for the comparator group of 
employees reflects no change to benefits policies or levels during the year. It does not reflect any changes to the level of benefits an individual may have received 
as a result of a change in role, for example on promotion. A meaningful year-on-year change for benefits and bonus for all Group employees cannot be provided 
due to the variation in structure of these pay elements across roles and regions.
2.9. Relative importance of spend on pay for 2016/17
The table below sets out the total payroll costs for all employees over 2016/17 compared to total dividends payable for  
the year.

Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report 3. Outstanding share interests
The information set out in this section has been subject to external audit where indicated.
3.1. Conditional share awards granted in 2016/17 (audited)
The table below summarises the long-term conditional share awards granted to directors during 2016/17.
As set out in our Directors’ Remuneration Report 2015/16, the Company delayed the grant of the 2016 ESP awards  
while the initiatives to deliver productivity and efficiency improvements (announced in May 2016) were first being 
implemented. This was to ensure that the ESP performance targets were properly aligned with Burberry’s updated  
strategic goals. The targets set recognised that 2016/17 year was a transitional year for the Company and senior team  
and addressed the business need to retain and motivate talent during this critical period. Although lower in absolute  
terms than those set in prior years, the Committee is satisfied that the targets set for the 2016 ESP awards are stretching, 
requiring a demanding level of performance, and are closely linked to our performance goals and aligned with long-term 
value creation for shareholders.

1  The ESP shares were granted on 30 January 2017 and will vest 50% after three years and 50% after four years from grant date, subject to the performance 
conditions outlined above.
2  The face value of each award has been calculated using the three-day average price prior to the date of grant (£16.6033). As receipt of these is conditional on 
performance, the actual value of these awards may be nil. Vesting outcomes will be disclosed in the 2019/20 remuneration report.
3  Carol Fairweather received an ESP award in line with Policy to recognise her significant contribution to the business during the year. She is a good leaver and 
any vesting based on performance will be pro-rated for Carol’s service during the performance period.
4  On 3 April 2017, it was announced that Burberry had entered into an agreement with Coty Inc under which they acquire the exclusive long-term global license 
rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare. For the purpose of assessing Revenue growth performance for the ESP awards already 
granted, as well as awards to be granted in 2017, revenue for the ‘base year’ has been re-calculated on the assumption that this agreement had applied in that 
year to ensure revenue growth is being calculated on a like-for-like basis with the way targets have been set.
3.2. Further information on conditional share awards granted in 2016/17 (audited)
Growth in Adjusted PBT and revenue
The vesting outcomes based on each of three-year revenue and three-year Adjusted PBT growth are calculated using 
revenue and Adjusted PBT as disclosed in the annual accounts, subject to any adjustments (down or up) made by the 
Committee to reflect constant exchange rates and any other items deemed to be outside of management’s control.
Adjusted retail/wholesale Return on Invested Capital (‘ROIC’)
Adjusted retail/wholesale ROIC measures the efficient use of capital to ensure that returns on future investment are 
attractive. Group ROIC includes the contribution from the high-return licensing business. Given the licensing business  
is not capital intensive, ROIC will continue to be measured on Burberry’s retail/wholesale business only.
Retail/wholesale ROIC, for the purposes of the ESP performance measure, is calculated as the retail/wholesale post-tax 
adjusted operating profit divided by the average retail/wholesale operating assets, measured over the three year period,  
on a reported currency basis. A calculation of adjusted retail/wholesale ROIC is included in the five-year summary on  
page 178.

Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report Shareholding guidelines
To further align the senior executive team with the interests of shareholders, we have increased the minimum shareholding 
requirement for executive directors, other than Christopher Bailey whose guideline is already significant, as set out in the 
introductory letter. The guidelines are now set at the following levels:
 ·
500,000 shares for Christopher Bailey
 ·
three times base salary for other executive directors
 ·
one times base salary for other senior executives
 ·
the Chairman and non-executive directors are expected to hold shares with a market value of £6,000 for each year  
of their appointment.
There is no specific timeline in which shareholding guidelines must be achieved, however there is an expectation for 
executives to make annual progress towards their guideline, regardless of any annual bonus paid or shares vesting.  
Only shares that are owned outright count towards the shareholding requirement. The shareholding guidelines are 
applicable whilst executive directors and senior executives are employed by Burberry.
As at 31 March 2017, Christopher Bailey owned 557,615 shares with a value of c. 8.5 times salary based on the share  
price at 31 March 2017 and has therefore achieved his shareholding guideline. As at 31 March 2017, having only joined  
the Company in January 2017, Julie Brown did not own any Burberry shares, however, Julie will invest 50% of her post  
tax bonus buy-out award in Burberry shares.
John Smith owned shares based on the share price at 31 March 2017 with a value of £637,397 (108% of his salary). John 
Smith became an executive director during 2013 and has made progress each year towards his executive shareholding 
requirement of two times salary. John will be leaving the Company in the summer of 2017.
Carol Fairweather left the Company on 31 March 2017. In view of her pending departure, the Committee agreed that she 
would be allowed to sell a portion of her shareholding in September 2016 for financial planning purposes. Based on the 
share price at 31 March 2017, Carol Fairweather owned shares worth 117% of her salary.
As at 31 March 2017, all of the non-executive directors had fulfilled the requirement to hold shares with a market value  
of £6,000 for each year of their appointment. 
This information on the achievement of shareholding guidelines has been audited.

Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report 4. Directors’ remuneration in 2017/18
The table below summarises how the remuneration policy will be implemented for executive directors in the year 2017/18. 
Marco Gobbetti will join the Board and take up his role as Chief Executive Officer on 5 July 2017. The remuneration detailed 
below is for this Board role and will take effect from this appointment date. 
2017/18 annual salaries will be £1,100,000 for Marco Gobbetti and £700,000 for Julie Brown, as detailed in July 2016 when  
we first announced their appointments. Christopher Bailey was not awarded any increase to his salary for the 2017/18  
year and as such his salary continues to be £1,100,000. Maximum bonus and ESP award levels are unchanged from 
previous years.

4.2. Further information on ESP performance measures
Whilst the ESP design has been agreed, the remuneration policy allows a degree of flexibility around a number of the  
ESP design elements. This flexibility allows the Committee to determine the most appropriate approach to the following 
parameters ahead of each annual award:
 ·
the weighting of each performance measure (within the specified ranges)
 ·
the definition (and calculation approach) of each performance measure
 ·
the threshold and maximum performance targets for each performance measure.
The Committee is pleased to set out these parameters for the 2017 ESP awards below.
Performance level
(% of maximum vesting)
ESP performance measure Definition
Weighting
(% of award)
Threshold
(15%)
Maximum
(100%)
Group Revenue 3-year growth, calculated on  
a constant currency basis
25% 1.0% p.a. 5.5% p.a.
Group Adjusted Profit Before Tax 3-year growth, calculated on  
a constant currency basis
50% 2.0% p.a. 10.0% p.a.
Adjusted retail/wholesale ROIC 3-year average 25% 16.2% 18.2%
The weightings and measures shall remain unchanged from 2015/16. The performance measures will be calculated on the 
same basis as for 2016/17 awards (as set out on page 103 of this report). The targets for all three performance measures  
have been carefully calibrated in light of a number of factors, including the latest Burberry strategic plan, our long-term financial 
goals, latest three-year projections and broker earnings estimates for Burberry and its competitors. The Committee has set 
these targets and believes they are stretching, extremely so at the maximum performance level, and will ensure management  
is incentivised to continue to deliver superior returns to shareholders.
106
Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report On 3 April 2017, it was announced that Burberry had entered into an agreement with Coty Inc under which they acquire the 
exclusive long-term global license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare. For the purpose of 
assessing revenue growth performance for the ESP award to be granted in 2017, as well as awards already granted in 2015 and 
2016, revenue for the ‘base year’ has been re-calculated on the assumption that this agreement had applied in that year  
to ensure revenue growth is being calculated on a like-for-like basis with the way targets have been set.
Subject to performance, ESP awards will vest 50% after three years and 50% after four years (from the date of grant). As  
set out in the Policy, the Committee also applies an additional holding period on ESP awards granted to executive directors  
to increase long-term alignment with shareholders. While executives are employed by Burberry, no ESP shares may normally  
be sold except to cover any tax liabilities arising out of the award until five years from the date of grant.

5. Further information on remuneration for new executive directors
5.1. Remuneration for Chief Executive Officer
Marco Gobbetti’s 2017/18 remuneration for his role as Chief Executive Officer (from 5 July 2017) is detailed below.
 ·
 Salary of £1,100,000 reflecting the experience in the luxury retail sector that will be invaluable to the delivery of our 
strategy and our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth
 ·
 An annual cash allowance of £80,000 (covering travel, car and clothing), a pension allowance of 30% of salary and  
other non-cash benefits in accordance with the remuneration policy
 ·
An annual performance-based bonus of up to 200% of salary
 ·
Eligible to participate in the performance-based ESP and a 2017 award will be granted as detailed on page 106.  
As previously announced, Marco was granted a 2016 award of 325% of salary
Buyout awards
In order to secure Marco Gobbetti’s appointment and to allow him to join Burberry at the earliest opportunity, the Committee 
agreed to buyout awards forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Upon appointment to the Chief Executive Officer  
role he will be granted nil-cost options with a total value at grant of €4.91m. In determining the value of these awards, the 
Committee considered historical levels of vesting and performance achieved at that time against the targets at Marco’s 
previous employer and discounted the value of outstanding awards to reflect this. The Committee considers the awards to 
be granted to be of broadly equivalent value to the awards forfeited. The grant value of these awards will be included in the 
2017/18 single figure of remuneration table. The nil-cost options will have no performance conditions and will only vest on 
the dates detailed below, which reflect the original vesting timeline of Marco’s forfeited awards policy, subject  
to Marco’s continued employment.
 ·
Restricted award with value at grant of €4,000,000 – vest 100% in November 2017
 ·
Restricted award with value at grant of €910,000 – vest 33% in July 2017, 33% in October 2018, 17% in October 2019  
and 17% in October 2020
107
Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report 5.2. Remuneration for Chief Operating and Financial Officer
Julie Brown’s remuneration for her role as Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer for 2016/17 is detailed below:
 ·
Salary of £700,000, reflecting responsibility for both the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer roles
 ·
An annual cash allowance of £30,000 (covering car and clothing), a pension allowance of 30% of salary and other  
non-cash benefits in accordance with the remuneration policy
 ·
An annual performance-based bonus of up to 200% of salary
 ·
Eligibility to participate in the performance-based ESP and a 2017 award will be granted as detailed on page 106.  
As previously announced, Julie was granted a 2016 award of 300% of salary. 
Buy-out awards
To secure Julie Brown’s appointment and to allow her to join Burberry at the earliest opportunity, the Committee agreed to 
buyout the non-cash and cash incentives forfeited on leaving her previous employer. The grant value of the nil-cost options 
over 240,000 shares is included in the single figure table under ‘Share awards buyout’. In determining the value of these 
awards, the Committee considered historical levels of vesting and performance achieved at that time against the targets  
at Julie’s previous employer and discounted the value of outstanding awards to reflect this. The Committee considers the 
awards granted to be of broadly equivalent value to the awards forfeited. This amount was converted into  
a number of shares at the time Julie’s appointment was agreed based on the share prices of Burberry and Julie’s previous 
employer at that time. The nil-cost options have no performance conditions and will only vest on the dates detailed below, 
which reflect the original vesting timeline of Julie’s forfeited awards, subject to Julie’s continued employment.
 ·
215,000 shares – vest 40% on 22 July 2017, 30% on 22 July 2018 and 30% on 22 July 2019
 ·
25,000 shares – vest 33% on 27 March 2018, 33% on 27 March 2019 and 34% on 27 March 2020
As compensation for her 2016 annual bonus forfeited from her previous employer, Julie also received a cash payment  
of £550,000. The amount was set by reference to both financial and personal performance at Julie’s previous employer at  
the time of offer at a level equivalent to the target cash bonus opportunity, the performance expectation at Julie’s previous 
employer at that time. This payment was made in April 2017, in line with Julie’s joining arrangements, and is also included in 
the single figure of remuneration table on page 97 under ‘Prior company bonus buyout’. Julie will be investing 50% of this 
bonus, post tax and NI, in Burberry shares.
6. Further information on remuneration of Carol Fairweather (audited)
The single figure of remuneration table (on page 97) details the remuneration Carol Fairweather received for the period of 
2016/17 that she served as an executive director. Carol continued to receive her salary, allowances, pension and contractual 
non-cash benefits up to 31 March 2017. A payment in lieu of notice equal to 12 months’ salary, allowances and benefits 
(including pension allowance) of £675,000 was paid as a lump sum to Carol in April 2017.
As already set out Carol will be treated as a good leaver and as such will receive an annual bonus for 2016/17 of £345,000 
for the full year, of which £275,000 is for the period to 18 January 2017 (when she stepped down from the Board) as shown 
on the table on page 99. Carol’s outstanding share awards will also vest on a pro rata basis. As detailed in section 2.4, the 
performance condition attached to 2014 CIP awards was not met and so Carol’s 2014 CIP award will lapse. Also as detailed 
in section 2.5, 2014 RSP awards will vest at 19.25% of maximum and so 9,792 shares of a total 50,870 shares will vest on  
12 June 2017. Carol’s outstanding awards under the ESP will vest at the normal vesting dates, subject to the achievement  
of the relevant performance conditions and time pro-rating. Subject to performance outcomes, Carol will be able to  
exercise her options and receive a maximum of 26,156 shares from July 2018, a maximum of 26,157 shares from July 2019,  
a maximum of 12,547 shares from January 2020 and a maximum of 12,548 from January 2021, less any shares sold to cover 
tax. In respect of the ESP shares that vest, Carol will also receive a cash payment equivalent to the dividends which would 
have been received on the shares during the vesting period. Carol exercised her options under the 2015 Sharesave scheme 
on 24 January 2017, as detailed in section 3.
The Committee agreed to make a payment of £5,000 in respect of legal services provided to Carol. 
Finally, the Committee determined that until 31 March 2018 (or later, if the Committee so determines), Carol will continue 
to receive private medical insurance and employee discount, each at a level consistent with those provided to her during  
the 2016/17 year and other Burberry executive directors.
Carol will not receive any further payments.
Board and Governance – Directors’ Remuneration Report
108 7. Further information on remuneration of John Smith (audited)
The single figure of remuneration table (on page 97) details the remuneration John Smith received during 2016/17. John 
stepped down from the Board on 31 March 2017 and will continue to receive his salary, allowances, pension and contractual 
non-cash benefits up to his leaving date of 12 June 2017.
John remained an executive director for the full 2016/17 financial year and, to recognise his contribution to the performance 
of the business for that year, the Committee determined that he would receive an annual bonus, based on Adjusted PBT 
performance for the 2016/17 year, as shown in the table on page 99.
Under the rules of the CIP and RSP, John remains entitled to receive any awards that vest prior to his leaving date. As 
detailed in section 2.4, the performance condition attached to 2014 CIP awards was not met and so John’s 2014 CIP award 
will lapse. Also as detailed in section 2.5, 2014 RSP awards will vest at 19.25% of maximum and so 7,729 shares of a total 
40,154 shares will vest on 12 June 2017. The three-year performance period was completed on 31 March 2017, prior to 
John’s departure and he remained an executive director for the duration of the period. John’s outstanding awards under  
the 2015 and 2016 ESP awards will lapse in full upon his departure from Burberry, in accordance with the rules of each plan.
John will not receive any other payments.
8. Remuneration Committee in 2016/17

At the invitation of the Committee, except where their own remuneration was being discussed, the following people attended 
meetings and provided advice to the Committee: Sir John Peace (Chairman), Christopher Bailey (Chief Creative and Chief 
Executive Officer), Julie Brown (Chief Operating and Financial Officer), Carol Fairweather (former Chief Financial Officer),

During the 2016/17 financial year, the Committee received external advice from Willis Towers Watson, as detailed in the

selected at that time following a formal tender process. Willis Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ 
Group (‘RCG’), which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the voluntary Code of Conduct that clearly 
sets out the role of executive remuneration consultants and the professional standards by which they advise their clients 
and, as such, the Committee is satisfied that its advice is objective and independent.
Linklaters LLP provided advice to the Committee in relation to compliance with legislation, namely the regulations governing 
the disclosure of directors’ remuneration in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Deloitte LLP also provided the Committee with advice in connection with executive remuneration as set out below. Deloitte

line with its policy (2016: £nil). In keeping with the Company’s 
approach in prior years, shareholder approval is being 
sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, as a 
precautionary measure, for the Company and its subsidiaries 
to make donations and/or incur expenditure which may  
be construed as ‘political’ by the wide definition of that  
term included in the relevant legislation. Further details are 
provided in the Notice of this year’s Annual General Meeting.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and 
policies are set out within note 25 of the Financial 
Statements. Note 25 also details the Group’s exposure  
to foreign exchange, share price, interest, credit, capital 
and liquidity risks. This note is incorporated by reference 
and deemed to form part of this report.

on the Company’s website at www.burberryplc.com.
The directors consider that each of the proposed resolutions 
to be considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the 
best interests of the Company and its shareholders and  
are most likely to promote the success of the Company

of directors, the Company follows the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 and is governed by its Articles  
of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and related 
legislation. The Articles of Association may be

Significant contracts – change of control
Revolving credit facility
Pursuant to the Companies Act 2006, the directors  
disclose that in the event of a change of control, the 
Company’s borrowings under the Group’s £300m revolving 
credit facility (dated 25 November 2014) could become 
repayable. Details of the service agreements of the 
executive directors are set out on page 95 of the

The provisions of the Company’s employee share plans 
may cause options and awards granted under such  
plans to vest upon a change of control.
Licence agreement
On 3 April 2017, Burberry entered into an exclusive licence 
agreement with Coty pursuant to which Coty will develop, 
manufacture, market, distribute and sell Burberry Beauty 
products. The agreement is anticipated to take effect from 
October 2017 from which time ongoing royalty payments 
will be payable to Burberry. The agreement provides that 
Burberry will receive cash payments of £130m in the 
second half of FY 2017/18 for the long-term exclusive  
global licence and related transfer of the Beauty business. 
Burberry will also receive c. £50m for assets transferring 
(which is subject to inventory adjustments). Pursuant to the 
Companies Act 2006, the directors disclose that a change 
of control of Burberry will, in limited circumstances, result 
in Coty having a right of termination of the licence 
agreement.
Employee involvement
Employee communication
The Group believes that employee communication is  
an important tool to enhance the Company culture and 
connectivity and to motivate and retain its employees.  
A global communications programme, incorporating 
various physical and digital channels, enables all 
employees to connect and collaborate closely. These 
channels are used to efficiently communicate the 
Company’s key strategies, financial performance  
and other matters of interest and importance.
‘Burberry World’ is the key digital intranet channel  
used by the Company to communicate to its employees. 
However, other methods and channels are also used, 
including face-to-face briefings, open discussion forums 
with senior management, email and instant messaging. 
Burberry ‘Chat Live’ global video broadcasts are hosted  
by the Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer and senior 
management and provide real-time updates to highlight the 
Group’s performance and its ongoing strategic initiatives 
and projects. The Company also uses videos and digital 
web pages to communicate key initiatives, events and  
other brand messages, to enhance internal communication, 
employee connectivity and the Burberry culture.
Employee share ownership
The Group encourages share ownership at all levels and 
runs incentive schemes and share ownership schemes for 
the benefit of employees. Further details of these schemes 
are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 
87 to 111.
The Group again intends to grant free share awards  
or equivalent cash-based awards to all eligible  
employees during 2017/18. The Group also intends,  
where possible, to invite eligible employees to take  
part in the Sharesave Scheme.
Further information regarding the Group’s approach to 
employee involvement and communications is provided  
in Inspired People on page 44. 
Employment policies

118 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, which includes the Strategic Report; the Directors’ Report;  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report; and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union, and the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ and 
applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that  
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for  
that period. In preparing these financial statements the directors are required to: 
· 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
· 
state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the Group financial statements 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the Company financial statements, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent Company financial statements 
respectively;  
· 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
· 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group  
and Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The directors consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and the Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 68 to 69 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
· 
the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, 
and applicable law), give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company; 
· 
the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and 
· 
the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group and the Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Our audit approach 
Context 
Burberry Group plc is a British global luxury goods manufacturer, retailer and wholesaler listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The Group operates globally across over 30 countries. The context for our audit has been set against the Group’s structure and 
strategy as well as the more challenging trading conditions. This was particularly relevant for the work performed on inventory 
provisioning, impairment of property, plant and equipment and onerous lease provisions. 
The area of focus where work was primarily performed by component teams was the assessment of inventory provisioning.  
The judgements in respect of the completeness and valuation of provisions for tax exposures, impairment of fragrance and 
beauty licence intangible asset, impairment of property, plant and equipment and onerous lease provisions and presentation  
of non-GAAP measures are primarily taken at a Group level. 
Overview 
Materiality Overall Group materiality: £19 million which represents approximately 5% of profit before taxation (2016: £20 million). 
Audit 
Scope 
• Of the Group’s 80 reporting units we identified six reporting units which, in our view, require a full scope audit of their financial 
information, either due to their size or their risk characteristics. 
• These reporting units are located in the UK, China, Hong Kong and Korea and two are located in the US. We used local teams  
in these countries to perform those full scope audits relating to the relevant reporting units. 
• The Group audit team visited reporting units in the UK, US, China and Hong Kong during the course of the year in order to attend 
local management meetings. Throughout the year, the Group audit team held regular meetings with all reporting units at all stages 
of the audit to direct and supervise the work of these local teams and to ensure that we had a full and comprehensive 
understanding of the results of their work – particularly insofar as it related to the identified areas of focus. They also reviewed the 
working papers for financially significant reporting units. 
• The six components where we performed full scope audits represented 75% (2016: 76%) of Group revenue and 79% (2016: 89%) 
of profit before taxation. 
Areas of 
Focus 
• Inventory provisioning. 
• Impairment of property, plant and equipment and onerous lease provisions. 
• Completeness and valuation of provisions for tax exposures. 
• Impairment of fragrance and beauty licence intangible asset. 
• Presentation of results and non-GAAP measures.  120
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Burberry Group plc

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits 
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of 
bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, 
are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific 
areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our 
procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Inventory provisioning  
The Group manufactures and sells luxury goods and is subject  
to changing consumer demands and fashion trends, increasing  
the level of judgement involved in estimating inventory provisions 
(inventory as at 31 March 2017: £505.3m; refer to note 16 to  
the financial statements). Judgement is required to assess the 
appropriate level of provisioning for items which may be ultimately 
destroyed or sold below cost as a result of a reduction in consumer 
demand particularly in light of the current challenging trading 
conditions and the one label strategy. Such judgements include 
management’s expectations for future sales and inventory  
liquidation plans. 
 
For both finished goods and raw materials, we critically assessed the 
basis for the inventory provisions, the consistency of provisioning in line 
with policy and the rationale for the recording of specific provisions in 
the context of management’s key strategies.  
In doing so we tested the provision calculations and determined that 
they appropriately took into account the ageing profile of inventory, 
the process for identifying specific problem inventory and historical  
loss rates.  
As a result, we satisfied ourselves that both finished goods and  
raw materials inventory provisions have been prepared in line with 
policy and are supportable on the basis of historical trends as well  
as management’s expectations for future sales and inventory 
management plans. 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and onerous  
lease provisions 
 
The Group has a material operational asset base which may be 
vulnerable to impairment in the event of trading performance being 
below expectations.  
The value-in-use models used to determine the amount of any 
impairment charge are based on assumptions including revenue 
forecasts, gross and operating margins, which are store specific,  
and discount rates, which are country specific (refer to note 13 to the 
financial statements). Such stores may be located in both emerging 
markets, which are typically more volatile than developed markets,  
as well as more established economies such as the US, where the 
Group is working towards consolidating its position within the market.  
The same judgements are used in determining whether an onerous 
lease provision is required and in calculating the appropriate amount 
of the provision. In addition, judgement is required in assessing 
whether there are any alternative uses for stores which may affect  
the amount of onerous lease provision required. 
Management’s assessment resulted in the recognition of a  
net impairment charge for the year ended 31 March 2017 of  
£23.0m (2016: £45.3m), including £15.3m (2016: £24.2m) for  
store impairments and £7.7m (2016: £21.1m) for onerous leases. 
We focused on this area because of the inherent judgement  
involved in determining key assumptions such as future sales  
growth, profit margins and discount rates, and the magnitude  
of the assets under consideration and the lease obligations. 
We tested management’s assessment of indicators for both  
impairment and onerous lease provisions taking into consideration  
the challenging trading conditions in some territories, and are  
satisfied that they appropriately took into account internal and  
external impairment indicators, including the trading performance  
of each store. 
We tested the value-in-use models for assets where an impairment 
trigger or potential requirement for an onerous lease provision  
has been identified, including challenging management forecasts  
and other assumptions including discount rates and long term  
growth rates, and found that these assumptions were reasonable. 
In particular we focused on the forecasts for sales growth and are 
satisfied that they reflect reasonable expectations for each store, 
taking into account the maturity of each store, the market in which  
it is located and management’s specific plans for improving 
store performance. 
Given the judgement inherent in the impairment and onerous  
lease provision calculations, particularly relating to revenue  
growth assumptions, management has disclosed a sensitivity  
analysis in the financial statements (refer to note 13 to the financial 
statements). Having re-performed the sensitivity calculations and 
considered whether any other sensitivities might be more appropriate, 
we are satisfied that the financial statements adequately disclose the  
potential risk of future impairment if the performance of the stores  
with indicators of impairment do not meet management’s expectations.  121

we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of 
bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, 
are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific 
areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our 
procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Inventory provisioning  
The Group manufactures and sells luxury goods and is subject  
to changing consumer demands and fashion trends, increasing  
the level of judgement involved in estimating inventory provisions 
(inventory as at 31 March 2017: £505.3m; refer to note 16 to  
the financial statements). Judgement is required to assess the 
appropriate level of provisioning for items which may be ultimately 
destroyed or sold below cost as a result of a reduction in consumer 
demand particularly in light of the current challenging trading 
conditions and the one label strategy. Such judgements include 
management’s expectations for future sales and inventory  
liquidation plans. 
 
For both finished goods and raw materials, we critically assessed the 
basis for the inventory provisions, the consistency of provisioning in line 
with policy and the rationale for the recording of specific provisions in 
the context of management’s key strategies.  
In doing so we tested the provision calculations and determined that 
they appropriately took into account the ageing profile of inventory, 
the process for identifying specific problem inventory and historical  
loss rates.  
As a result, we satisfied ourselves that both finished goods and  
raw materials inventory provisions have been prepared in line with 
policy and are supportable on the basis of historical trends as well  
as management’s expectations for future sales and inventory 
management plans. 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and onerous  
lease provisions 
 
The Group has a material operational asset base which may be 
vulnerable to impairment in the event of trading performance being 
below expectations.  
The value-in-use models used to determine the amount of any 
impairment charge are based on assumptions including revenue 
forecasts, gross and operating margins, which are store specific,  
and discount rates, which are country specific (refer to note 13 to the 
financial statements). Such stores may be located in both emerging 
markets, which are typically more volatile than developed markets,  
as well as more established economies such as the US, where the 
Group is working towards consolidating its position within the market.  
The same judgements are used in determining whether an onerous 
lease provision is required and in calculating the appropriate amount 
of the provision. In addition, judgement is required in assessing 
whether there are any alternative uses for stores which may affect  
the amount of onerous lease provision required. 
Management’s assessment resulted in the recognition of a  
net impairment charge for the year ended 31 March 2017 of  
£23.0m (2016: £45.3m), including £15.3m (2016: £24.2m) for  
store impairments and £7.7m (2016: £21.1m) for onerous leases. 
We focused on this area because of the inherent judgement  
involved in determining key assumptions such as future sales  
growth, profit margins and discount rates, and the magnitude  
of the assets under consideration and the lease obligations. 
We tested management’s assessment of indicators for both  
impairment and onerous lease provisions taking into consideration  
the challenging trading conditions in some territories, and are  
satisfied that they appropriately took into account internal and  
external impairment indicators, including the trading performance  
of each store. 
We tested the value-in-use models for assets where an impairment 
trigger or potential requirement for an onerous lease provision  
has been identified, including challenging management forecasts  
and other assumptions including discount rates and long term  
growth rates, and found that these assumptions were reasonable. 
In particular we focused on the forecasts for sales growth and are 
satisfied that they reflect reasonable expectations for each store, 
taking into account the maturity of each store, the market in which  
it is located and management’s specific plans for improving 
store performance. 
Given the judgement inherent in the impairment and onerous  
lease provision calculations, particularly relating to revenue  
growth assumptions, management has disclosed a sensitivity  
analysis in the financial statements (refer to note 13 to the financial 
statements). Having re-performed the sensitivity calculations and 
considered whether any other sensitivities might be more appropriate, 
we are satisfied that the financial statements adequately disclose the  
potential risk of future impairment if the performance of the stores  
with indicators of impairment do not meet management’s expectations.

Completeness and valuation of provisions for tax exposures  
The directors are required to apply significant judgement when 
determining whether, and how much, to provide in respect of tax 
assessments leading to uncertain tax positions in a number of 
jurisdictions (refer to notes 9, 14 and 30 to the financial statements). 
Given the inherent uncertainty over the outcome of pending tax 
assessments, significant judgement is applied by the directors  
in estimating the final outcome of such tax assessments.  
We focused on this area due to the inherent complexity and 
judgement in estimating the amount of provision required, which  
is increased by the number of jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates. As noted in note 30 to the financial statements, the  
Group is subject to tax audits and claims in a number of jurisdictions. 
Through discussions with management, we understood the  
Group’s process for identifying uncertain tax positions and the 
related accounting policy for provisioning against tax exposures.  
Based on this, we assessed the extent to which provisions are 
supported by underlying circumstances and determined that  
they are being made on a consistent basis to previous years. 
We assessed the appropriateness of provisions recorded in  
the financial statements, or the rationale for not recording a 
provision, by using our specialist tax knowledge, reading the  
latest correspondence between the Group and the various tax 
authorities and advisors, and by obtaining written responses  
from the Group's external advisors on the material tax exposures. 
These procedures assisted in our corroboration of management’s 
position in respect of significant tax exposures, and with our 
assessment that the disclosures and provisions recorded in the 
financial statements, including whether any provisions sufficiently 
addressed probable penalties and interest, were appropriate and 
reflected the latest developments. 
Impairment of fragrance and beauty licence intangible asset  
In the year ended 31 March 2013, the Group reacquired the licence  
to sell fragrance and beauty products, resulting in the recognition of 
a fragrance and beauty licence intangible of £70.9m, which was  
being amortised on a straight-line basis over the period 1 April 2013 
to 31 December 2017. The licence was fully impaired during the 
period, resulting in a charge of £18.6m. 
We have focused on this area due to the size of the fragrance and 
beauty licence intangible and the inherent judgement involved in 
forming a valuation of the intangible, and the fact that future sales  
and profit forecasts for this part of the business were considered  
to no longer support the recoverability of the asset during the period. 
We challenged management’s assessment of fragrance and beauty 
performance by comparing actual results to forecasts. Having 
compared the Group’s future plans and forecasts for these products  
to actual results and market conditions, we are satisfied that it is 
appropriate to impair the fragrance and beauty licence intangible. 
We also considered the related disclosures and are satisfied that the 
financial statements adequately disclose the impairment. 
Presentation of results and non-GAAP measures  
The presentation of results continues to be a focus area for 
regulators, particularly the use of adjusted and underlying measures 
to explain business performance, and the classification of items as 
adjusting, especially where they recur each year. There is a risk that 
the use of such measures means that the overall presentation of 
results is not fair, balanced and understandable. 
In the year ended 31 March 2017 the Group has identified five 
adjusting items, being the charge relating to the fragrance and beauty 
licence intangible asset, restructuring costs, revaluation of deferred 
consideration liability, costs relating to the transfer of the Beauty 
operations and the put option liability finance charge (refer to note 6 
to the financial statements). 
We considered management’s recognition of adjusting items and the 
related presentation and accompanying disclosures and are satisfied 
that the selection of adjusting items is consistent with prior years, in 
line with management’s accounting policies and adequately explained 
in the financial statements. 
We noted no instances of inappropriate or inconsistent presentation  
of results and non-GAAP measures. Specifically, we are satisfied that 
non-GAAP measures are adequately explained and reconciled to 
GAAP measures. 
 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographical structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls,  
and the industry in which the Group operates.  
The Group operates across three regions and is structured across two segments, being retail/wholesale and licensing.  
The financial statements are a consolidation of 80 reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses and holding 
companies across the two segments. 
Based on our risk and materiality assessments, we determined which entities were required to report full-scope audit opinions 
to us having considered the relative significance of each entity to the Group, locations with significant inherent risks and the 
overall coverage obtained over each material line item in the consolidated financial statements. We identified six reporting units 
which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, either due to their size or their risk characteristics. 
These reporting units accounted for 75% (2016: 76%) of Group revenue and 79% (2016: 89%) of Group profit before taxation. 
Of these, three reporting units have been determined to be financially significant based on their contribution to Group revenue 
or profit before taxation. This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level relating primarily to the 
consolidation, taxation, litigation, impairment and earnings per share, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole.  122
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Burberry Group plc 
122 
In addition to the audits performed on full-scope components, we gathered other audit evidence across the rest of the Group 
through testing of the Group’s global monitoring controls, Group-level analytical procedures and testing at the London and 
Hong Kong Shared Service Centres.  
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the 
reporting units by us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors within PwC UK and from other PwC network 
firms operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level  
of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. We sent 
detailed instructions to all in scope component audit teams, which included communication of the areas of focus above and 
other required communications. Our Group engagement team’s involvement also included various site visits and component 
auditor working paper reviews across each of the Group’s three regions, together with conference calls with the component 
audit teams and participation in all in scope component audit clearance meetings. 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and  
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect  
of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Overall Group materiality £19 million (2016: £20 million). 
How we determined it 5% of profit before taxation. 
Rationale for benchmark applied Burberry is a profit orientated entity and hence profit before taxation has been selected as the benchmark. 
Component materiality For each component in our audit scope, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group 
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £3.5 million and  
£16.0 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also  
less than our overall Group materiality. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £1 million 
(2016: £1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 130, in relation to going concern.  
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation 
to the directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in 
operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.  
As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because  
not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to  
continue as a going concern. 
Other required reporting 
Consistency of other information 
Companies Act 2006 opinion 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
· 
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
· 
the Strategic Report and Director’s Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Director’s Report.  
We have nothing to report in this respect.   123

less than our overall Group materiality. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £1 million 
(2016: £1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 130, in relation to going concern.  
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation 
to the directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in 
operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.  
As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because  
not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to

ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
Information in the Annual Report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
We have no  
exceptions to report. 
The statement given by the directors on page 118, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance  
Code (the “Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit. 
We have no  
exceptions to report. 
The section of the Annual Report on page 83, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of the  
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. 
We have no  
exceptions to report. 
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to  
in relation to: 
The directors’ confirmation on page 61 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, that they  
have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
We have nothing 
material to add or  
to draw attention to. 
The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated. We have nothing 
material to add or

they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period  
to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
We have nothing 
material to add or  
to draw attention to. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review 
was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process 
supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and 
considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review.

(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.  124
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Burberry Group plc

What an audit of financial statements involves 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  
This includes an assessment of:  
· 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed;  
· 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and  
· 
the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our  
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report  
and Directors’ Report, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the company financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended  
31 March 2017 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the Financial Statements

1. Basis of preparation 
Burberry Group plc and its subsidiaries (the Group) is a global luxury goods manufacturer, retailer and wholesaler. The Group 
also licences third parties to manufacture and distribute products using the ‘Burberry’ trade marks. All of the companies which 
comprise the Group are controlled by Burberry Group plc (the Company) directly or indirectly. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the European Union endorsed 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations and parts of  
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention, except as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.  
Taking into account reasonable possible changes in trading performance, and after making enquiries, the directors consider it 
appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
There have been no new standards, amendments or interpretations issued and made effective for the financial period 
commencing 1 April 2016 that have had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.  
As at 31 March 2017, the following new and revised standards, amendments and interpretations, which may be relevant  
to the Group’s results, were issued but not yet effective:  
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 
This standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 replaces the guidance 
in IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.  
The new standard: 
1. retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets:  
amortised cost; fair value through OCI; and fair value through P&L; 
2.  introduces a forward-looking impairment model based on expected credit losses on financial instruments; and 
3.  updates hedge accounting requirements, to more closely align the accounting with the risk management activities.  
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The most significant impact of adopting this standard  
is expected to be as a result of the changes to the hedge accounting requirements, whereby cash flow hedges will need to be presented on the 
balance sheet as part of the carrying value of inventories rather than in equity. The adoption of this element of IFRS 9 is an accounting policy 
choice but will become a requirement when IFRS 9 Macro Hedging is endorsed by the European Union. The full impact of adopting this new 
standard is still being assessed and will be quantified closer to the date of adoption. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers  
This standard deals with revenue recognition and replaces both IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction contracts, providing a single revenue 
standard to be applied across all industries. Under the new standard, revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or 
service. IFRS 15 establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows 
arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Adopting 
this new standard may result in a delay in the timing of the recognition of a portion of the Group’s revenue however it is not anticipated that  
this will have a material impact on the overall Group result. There will also be additional disclosure requirements.  
IFRS 16 Leases 
This standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors.  
It replaces IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease. The most significant changes are in relation  
to lessee accounting. Under the new standard, the concept of assessing a lease contract as either operating or financing is replaced by a  
single lessee accounting model. Under this new model, substantially all lease contracts will result in a lessee acquiring a right-to-use asset and 
obtaining financing. The lessee will be required to recognise a corresponding asset and liability. The asset will be depreciated over the term of 
the lease and the interest on the financing liability will be charged over the same period. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2019, however it is not currently endorsed by the European Union. Adopting this new standard will result in a fundamental 
change to the Group’s Balance Sheet, with right-to-use assets and accompanying financing liabilities for the Group’s retail stores, warehouses 
and offices being recognised for the first time. The Income Statement will also be impacted, with rent expense relating to operating leases being 
replaced by a depreciation charge arising from the right-to-use assets and interest charges arising from lease financing. The full impact of these 
changes is currently being assessed as part of an on-going IFRS 16 implementation project and will be quantified closer to the date of adoption. 
Refer to note 23 for details of the Group’s future minimum lease commitments at 31 March 2017. 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group’s annual financial statements comprise those of Burberry Group plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries, presented 
as a single economic entity. The results of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using 
consistent accounting policies across the Group.

Notes to the Financial Statements

1. Basis of preparation (continued) 
Basis of consolidation (continued) 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity 
when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Where there is a  
loss of control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the results for the portion of the reporting period 
during which the Group had control. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised profits on transactions between Group 
companies are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements. The Group treats transactions with non-controlling 
interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For acquisitions of additional interests in subsidiaries from non-
controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of  
net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals of interests in subsidiaries to non-controlling 
interests are also recorded in equity.  
Key sources of estimation and judgement  
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires that management make certain 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure 
of contingent liabilities. If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgements 
at the date of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimate and assumptions will be 
updated as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key areas where the estimates 
and assumptions applied have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities, 
and where judgements applied have a material impact on the presentation of the Group financial statements, are discussed 
below. Further details of the Group’s accounting policies in relation to these areas are provided in note 2: 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and onerous lease provisions 
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash 
generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and 
estimates in the period. Where the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is negative, the need for an onerous lease 
provision in relation to the committed future minimum lease payments is considered. Refer to note 13 for further details of 
property, plant and equipment and impairment reviews carried out in the period. Refer to note 20 for further details of onerous 
lease provisions. 
Impairment of the fragrance and beauty licence intangible asset 
The fragrance and beauty licence intangible asset is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. Where a review for impairment is carried out, the recoverable amount of 
the intangible asset is determined from a value-in-use calculation of the anticipated incremental income earned by the Group as 
a result of selling Beauty products through retail and wholesale channels rather than under licence. The value-in-use calculation 
is prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates of the future trading performance of the Beauty product 
division. Refer to note 12 for further details of the fragrance and beauty licence intangible asset. 
Inventory provisioning 
The Group manufactures and sells luxury goods and is subject to changing consumer demands and fashion trends.  
As a result it is necessary to consider the recoverability of the cost of inventories and the associated provisioning required. 
When calculating inventory provisions, management considers the nature and condition of the inventory, as well as  
applying assumptions around anticipated saleability of finished goods and future usage of raw materials. Refer to note  
16 for further details of the carrying value of inventory.  132

Key sources of estimation and judgement (continued) 
Income and deferred taxes 
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Given the complexities of transfer pricing and other tax 
legislation, judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes in each territory. There are many transactions 
and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group 
recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. These are measured 
using either the Group’s single best estimate of a likely outcome or a weighted average approach where appropriate. Where  
the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will impact  
the income tax and deferred tax provisions and assets in the period in which such determination is made. The Group does  
not currently anticipate a significant risk of material change to the outcomes referred to above over the next financial year. 
Refer to notes 9, 14 and 30 for further details of income and deferred tax charges and balances and contingent liabilities. 
Deferred consideration on the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in Burberry Middle East LLC 
On 22 April 2016, the Group entered into an agreement to transfer the economic right to the non-controlling interest in  
Burberry Middle East LLC to the Group in consideration for fixed and contingent payments to be made to the minority 
shareholder. Management has applied judgement in assessing the nature of the payments associated with this transaction  
in order to determine the appropriate accounting treatment. Refer to note 29 for further details of this transaction. 
2. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies of the Group are: 
a) Revenue 
Revenue, which is stated excluding Value Added Tax and other sales related taxes, is the amount receivable for goods supplied 
(less returns, trade discounts and allowances) and royalties receivable. 
Retail sales, returns and allowances are reflected at the dates of transactions with customers. Wholesale sales are recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, with provisions made for expected 
returns and allowances. Provisions for returns on retail and wholesale sales are calculated based on historical return levels. 
Royalties receivable from licensees are accrued as earned on the basis of the terms of the relevant royalty agreement, which  
is typically on the basis of production volumes.  
b) Segment reporting 
As required by IFRS 8 Operating segments, the segmental information presented in the financial statements is reported in  
a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Chief Operating Decision 
Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance, has been identified as the Board of Directors.  
The Group has centralised activities for designing, making and sourcing, which ensure a global product offering is sold  
through retail and wholesale channels worldwide. Resource allocation and performance is assessed across the whole of  
the retail/wholesale channel globally. Hence the retail/wholesale channel has been determined to be an operating segment. 
Licensed products are manufactured and sold by third-party licensees. As a result, this channel is assessed discretely  
by the Chief Operating Decision Maker and has been determined to be an operating segment. 
The Group presents an analysis of its revenue by channel, by product division and by geographical destination.  133

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
c) Business combinations 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed  
at the date of exchange. Contingent payments are remeasured at fair value through the Income Statement. All transaction 
costs are expensed to the Income Statement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed 
in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any  
non-controlling interest. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity, and are 
initially measured either at fair value or at a value equal to the non-controlling interests’ share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired. The choice of the basis of measurement is an accounting policy choice for each individual business combination.  
The excess of the cost of acquisition together with the value of any non-controlling interest over the fair value of the  
identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net  
assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement. 
d) Share schemes 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation schemes, under which services are received  
from employees (including executive directors) as consideration for equity instruments of the Company. The cost of the  
share-based incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of  
grant. Appropriate option pricing models, including Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo, are used to determine the fair value  
of the awards made. The fair value takes into account the impact of any market performance conditions, but the impact of  
non-market performance conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant. Vesting conditions  
which relate to non-market conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to  
vest. The estimate of the number of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.  
In some circumstances, employees may provide services in advance of the grant date. The grant date fair value is estimated 
for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between the service commencement period and the grant date. 
The cost of the share-based incentives is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the awards, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. 
When options are exercised, they are settled either via issue of new shares in the Company, or through shares held in an 
Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) trust, depending on the terms and conditions of the relevant scheme. The proceeds 
received from the exercises, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital and share  
premium accounts.  
e) Leases 
The Group is both a lessor and lessee of property, plant and equipment. Determining whether an arrangement is or contains 
a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement. Leases in which substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental  
to ownership of an asset are transferred to the lessee by the lessor are classified as finance leases. Leases which are not 
finance leases are classified as operating leases. 
Gross rental expenditure/income in respect of operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
leases. Certain rental expenses are determined on the basis of revenue achieved in specific retail locations and are accrued 
for on that basis. 
Amounts paid to/received from the landlord to acquire or transfer the rights to a lease are treated as prepayments/deferred 
income. Lease incentives, typically rent-free periods and capital contributions, are held on the Balance Sheet in deferred 
income and non-financial accruals and recognised over the term of the lease.  
f) Dividend distributions 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividend 
becomes a committed obligation. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid.  134

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
g) Pension costs 
Eligible employees participate in defined contribution pension schemes, the principal one being in the UK with its assets held 
in an independently administered fund. The cost of providing these benefits to participating employees is recognised in the 
Income Statement as they fall due and comprises the amount of contributions to the schemes. 
h) Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is the excess of the cost of acquisition together with the value of any non-controlling interest, over the fair value 
of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill on acquisition is recorded as an intangible asset. Fair values are attributed 
to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition 
at that date. Adjustments are also made to align the accounting policies of acquired businesses with those of the Group.  
Goodwill is assigned an indefinite useful life. Impairment reviews are performed annually, or more frequently if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses recognised on  
goodwill are not reversed in future periods. 
Trade marks, licences and other intangible assets 
The cost of securing and renewing trade marks and licences, and the cost of acquiring other intangible assets, such as  
key money, is capitalised at purchase price and amortised by equal annual instalments over the period in which benefits  
are expected to accrue, typically ten years for trade marks, or the term of the lease or licence. The useful life of trade marks  
and other intangible assets is determined on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement 
and the nature of the asset. 
Computer software 
The cost of acquiring computer software (including licences and separately identifiable development costs) is capitalised  
as an intangible asset at purchase price, plus any directly attributable cost of preparing that asset for its intended use.  
Software costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which may be up to seven years. 
i) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment, with the exception of assets in the course of construction, is stated at cost or deemed cost, 
based on historical revalued amounts prior to the adoption of IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect  
any impairment in value. Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and 
transferred to completed assets when substantially all of the activities necessary for the asset to be ready for use have 
occurred. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost or deemed cost, less residual value, of the 
assets in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: 
Type of asset Category of property, plant and equipment Useful life 
Land Freehold land and buildings Not depreciated 
Freehold buildings Freehold land and buildings Up to 50 years 
Leaseholds  Leasehold improvements Over the unexpired term of the lease 
Plant and machinery Fixtures, fittings and equipment Up to 10 years 
Short life leasehold improvements Fixtures, fittings and equipment Up to 10 years 
Retail fixtures and fittings Fixtures, fittings and equipment Up to 5 years 
Office fixtures and fittings Fixtures, fittings and equipment Up to 5 years 
Computer equipment Fixtures, fittings and equipment Up to 7 years 
Assets in the course of construction Assets in the course of construction Not depreciated 
Profit/loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
Profits and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets represent the difference between  
the net proceeds and net book value at the date of sale. Disposals are accounted for when the relevant transaction  
becomes unconditional.  135

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
j) Impairment of non-financial assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that  
are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate  
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-
use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Non-financial assets, other than goodwill, for which an impairment has  
been previously recognised are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment at each reporting date. 
k) Investment properties 
Investment properties are freehold properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment properties 
are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value. Cost includes the original 
purchase price plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Investment properties are depreciated on a straight-line  
basis over an estimated useful life of up to 50 years.  
l) Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified as  
held for sale. Discontinued operations are presented on the Income Statement as a separate line and are shown net of tax. 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continued use, and a sale within the next 12 months is considered to be highly probable.  
Assets classified as held for sale cease to be depreciated and they are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less cost to sell. 
m) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost consists of all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, 
design costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. For inventories relating 
to the Beauty product division, including raw materials and finished goods, cost is measured using a weighted average method. 
For all other product divisions, the cost of inventories is determined using a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, taking account of 
the fashion seasons for which the inventory was offered. Where necessary, provision is made to reduce cost to no more than 
net realisable value having regard to the nature and condition of inventory, as well as its anticipated utilisation and saleability. 
n) Taxation 
Tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax charge. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the  
Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it  
further excludes items which are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liabilities method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the temporary 
difference arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at  
the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, no deferred tax will be recognised. Deferred  
tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and  
are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.  
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not  
reverse in the foreseeable future.   136
Notes to the Financial Statements 
136 
2. Accounting policies (continued) 
n) Taxation (continued) 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets  
against current tax liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on either the same taxable entities or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the 
balances on a net basis. 
o) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount of the obligation 
can be reliably estimated. When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated based on 
the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The present value is calculated using 
forward market interest rates as measured at the balance sheet reporting date, which have been adjusted for risks specific  
to the future obligation. 
Property obligations 
A provision for the present value of future property reinstatement costs is recognised where there is an obligation to return 
the leased property to its original condition at the end of an operating lease. Where a leased property is no longer expected 
to be fully occupied or where the costs exceed the future expected benefits, an onerous lease provision will be recognised 
for that portion of the lease in excess to the Group’s requirements and not fully recovered through sub-leasing, or through 
value-in-use.  
Restructuring costs 
Provisions for costs associated with restructuring programmes are recognised when a detailed formal restructuring plan  
has been approved and communicated. Examples of restructuring-related costs include employee termination payments, 
contract termination penalties and onerous contract payments. 
p) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are  
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including 
any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the Company until the shares  
are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received,  
net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to owners of the Company. 
q) Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet when the entity becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow  
expire or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the  
obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.  
Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method 
except for derivatives which are held at fair value and which are classified as held for trading, except where they qualify for 
hedge accounting. The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost mostly approximate  
their carrying amount due to the short maturity of these instruments. Where the fair value of any financial asset or liability  
held at amortised cost is materially different to the book value, the fair value is disclosed.  137

2 The fair value measurement hierarchy is only applicable for financial instruments measured at fair value. 
The measurements for financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised into different levels in the fair value  
hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation technique used. The different levels are defined as follows: 
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the 
measurement date. 
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
or indirectly. 
Level 3: includes unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
Observable inputs are those which are developed using market data, such as publicly available information about actual  
events or transactions. The Group has an established framework with respect to measurement of fair values, including  
Level 3 fair values. The Group regularly reviews any significant inputs which are not derived from observable market data  
and considers, where available, relevant third-party information, to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the 
requirements of IFRS. The classification level in the fair value hierarchy is also considered periodically. Significant valuation 
issues are reported to the Audit Committee. 
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and equity swap contracts is based on a comparison of the contractual 
and market rates and, in the case of forward foreign exchange contracts, after discounting using the appropriate yield  
curve as at the balance sheet date. All Level 2 fair value measurements are calculated using inputs which are based on 
observable market data. 
The fair value of the fixed payment component of deferred consideration is considered to be a Level 2 measurement and  
is derived using a present value calculation of the remaining fixed payments, discounted using an appropriate risk-free rate.  
The fair value of the contingent payment component of deferred consideration is considered to be a Level 3 measurement  
and is derived using a present value calculation, incorporating observable and non-observable inputs. This valuation  
technique has been adopted as it most closely mirrors the contractual arrangement. 
The Group’s primary categories of financial instruments are listed below:  
Cash and cash equivalents 
On the Balance Sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits with a maturity date of three  
months or less, held with banks and liquidity funds. In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents also  
include bank overdrafts, which are recorded under current liabilities on the Balance Sheet.  138

q) Financial instruments (continued) 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance  
sheet date. Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there  
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. 
The amount of the movement in the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.  
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Borrowings (including overdrafts) 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, inclusive of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated 
at amortised cost and the difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised 
in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method. Borrowings are classified 
as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months  
after the balance sheet date. 
Deferred consideration 
Deferred consideration is initially recognised at the present value of the expected future payments. It is subsequently 
remeasured at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value relating to changes in expected future payments 
recorded in the Income Statement as an operating expense or income. Changes in fair value relating to unwinding of 
discounting to present value are recorded as a financing expense. 
Derivative instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain 
trading transactions. The principal derivative instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge highly 
probable cash flows in relation to future sales, royalty receivables and product purchases. The Group also may designate forward 
foreign exchange contracts or foreign currency borrowings as a net investment hedge of the assets of overseas subsidiaries. 
When hedge accounting is applied, the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging 
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. 
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments 
that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method  
of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so,  
the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised 
assets and liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow 
hedges); (3) hedges of net investment of the assets of overseas subsidiaries (net investment hedges); or (4) classified as held  
for trading. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income 
Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.  139

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
q) Financial instruments (continued) 
Derivative instruments (continued) 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is  
deferred in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised 
immediately in the Income Statement. Amounts deferred in other comprehensive income are recycled through the Income 
Statement in the periods when the hedged item affects the Income Statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold,  
or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time 
remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement. When  
a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
transferred to the Income Statement within ‘net exchange gain/(loss) on derivatives held for trading’. If a derivative instrument  
is not designated as a hedge, the subsequent change to the fair value is recognised in the Income Statement within operating 
expenses or interest depending upon the nature of the instrument. 
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations through derivative instruments or foreign currency borrowings, 
the gains or losses on the effective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as a hedge 
of a net investment, or the gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in other comprehensive  
income and are reclassified to the Income Statement when the foreign operation that is hedged is disposed of.  
r) Foreign currency translation  
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Sterling which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies within each entity in the Group are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  
currencies, which are held at the year end, are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the 
balance sheet date (closing rate). Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Income Statement in the 
period in which they arise, except where these exchange differences form part of a net investment in overseas subsidiaries  
of the Group, in which case such differences are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve.  
Translation of the results of overseas businesses 
The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into the Group’s presentation currency of Sterling each month at the 
weighted average exchange rate for the month according to the phasing of the Group’s trading results. The weighted average 
exchange rate is used, as it is considered to approximate the actual exchange rates on the date of the transactions. The assets 
and liabilities of such undertakings are translated at the closing rates. Differences arising on the retranslation of the opening  
net investment in subsidiary companies, and on the translation of their results, are taken directly to the foreign currency 
translation reserve.  
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. 
The principal exchange rates used were as follows:

foreign exchange contracts executed on a monthly basis approximately 12 months in advance of royalty receipts, was  
Yen 159.3: £1 in the year to 31 March 2017 (2016: Yen 177.1: £1).   140

s) Adjusted profit before taxation  
In order to provide additional consideration of the underlying performance of the Group’s ongoing business, the Group’s  
results include a presentation of Adjusted profit before taxation (‘adjusted PBT’). Adjusted PBT is defined as profit before 
taxation and before adjusting items. Adjusting items are those items which, in the opinion of the directors, should be excluded 
in order to provide a consistent and comparable view of the performance of the Group’s ongoing business. Generally this will 
include those items that are largely one-off and material in nature as well as income or expenses relating to acquisitions or 
disposals of businesses or other transactions of a similar nature, including the impact of changes in fair value of expected 
future payments or receipts relating to these transactions. Adjusting items are identified and presented on a consistent basis 
each year and a reconciliation of adjusted PBT to profit before tax is included in the financial statements. Adjusting items and 
their related tax impacts are added back to/deducted from profit attributable to owners of the Company to arrive at adjusted 
earnings per share. Refer to note 6 for further details of adjusting items. 
3. Segmental analysis 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors. The Board reviews the Group’s internal 
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the operating segments based 
on the reports used by the Board. The Board considers the Group’s business through its two channels to market, being 
retail/wholesale and licensing.  
Retail/wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of luxury goods through Burberry mainline stores, concessions, outlets 
and digital commerce as well as Burberry franchisees, prestige department stores globally and multi-brand specialty accounts. 
The flow of global product between retail and wholesale channels and across our regions is monitored and optimised at a 
corporate level and implemented via the Group’s inventory hubs situated in Asia, Europe and the USA.  
Licensing revenues are generated through the receipt of royalties from global licensees of eyewear, timepieces and 
European childrenswear, and from licences relating to the use of non-Burberry trade marks in Japan.  
The Board assesses channel performance based on a measure of adjusted operating profit. This measurement basis excludes 
the effects of adjusting items. The measure of earnings for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Board includes 
an allocation of corporate and central costs. Interest income and charges are not included in the result for each operating 
segment that is reviewed by the Board.

6. Adjusting items 
Charge relating to the fragrance and beauty licence intangible asset 
During the year ended 31 March 2013, an intangible asset of £70.9m was recognised on the Balance Sheet, relating to the present 
value of the anticipated incremental income to be earned by the Group as a result of selling Beauty products through retail and 
wholesale channels rather than under licence, following the termination of the existing licence relationship with Interparfums SA. 
This asset was being amortised on a straight-line basis over the period 1 April 2013 to 31 December 2017.  
During the six months ended 30 September 2016, amortisation expense of £7.5m was recognised in relation to the fragrance  
and beauty licence intangible. At 30 September 2016, management carried out an impairment assessment of the carrying value  
of this asset based on a value-in-use calculation using latest estimates for cost and revenue projections. As a result of a reduction 
in projected revenue over the remaining life to 31 December 2017, compared to previous estimates, management concluded  
that the book value of the asset was not supported by its value-in-use. An impairment charge of £18.6m was recognised  
at 30 September 2016, to write the remaining balance of the intangible asset down to nil. 
The total charge in relation to the fragrance and beauty licence intangible for the year ended 31 March 2017 is £26.1m  
(2016: £14.9m). This has been presented as an adjusting item, which is consistent with the treatment of the cost recognised  
on termination of the licence relationship in the year ended 31 March 2013. A related tax credit of £5.1m (2016: £2.8m) has  
also been recognised in the current period.  
Restructuring costs 
Restructuring costs of £20.8m were incurred in the current period, arising as a result of the Group’s cost-efficiency programme 
announced in May 2016. These costs are presented as an adjusting item as they are considered material and one-off in nature, 
being part of a restructuring programme running from May 2016 to March 2019, with restructuring costs being incurred in  
the first two years. The most significant elements of the restructuring costs relate to redundancies and consultancy costs 
supporting organisational design and development of strategic growth and productivity initiatives, with the remainder  
relating to legal advice and project assurance. £16.7m of this cost was settled in the period with the balance being accrued  
at 31 March 2017. A related tax credit of £4.2m has also been recognised in the current period. 
Items relating to the deferred consideration liability 
On 22 April 2016, the Group entered into an agreement to transfer the economic right to the non-controlling interest in Burberry 
Middle East LLC to the Group in consideration of contingent payments to be made to the minority shareholder relating to an 
agreed percentage of the future revenue of Burberry Middle East LLC and its subsidiaries, Burberry Al Kuwait General Trading 
Textiles and Accessories Company WLL and Burberry Qatar WLL, over the period 2016 to 2023, together with fixed payments  
of AED 120.0m (£22.6m), relating to profits of Burberry Middle East LLC up to 31 March 2016, to be paid over the period 2016 to 
2019. A liability for the present value of the fixed and contingent deferred consideration of AED 236.0m (£44.6m) was recognised  
at this point. Refer to note 19 for further details of the deferred consideration liability. 
A charge of £3.0m in relation to the revaluation of this balance has been recognised in operating expenses for the year ended  
31 March 2017. A financing charge of £2.2m in relation to the unwinding of the discount on the non-current portion of the 
deferred consideration liability has also been recognised for the year ended 31 March 2017. These movements are unrealised. 
No tax has been recognised on either of these items, as the future payments are not considered to be deductible for tax 
purposes. These items are presented as adjusting items in accordance with the Group accounting policy, as they arise  
from changes in the value of the liability for expected future payments relating to the purchase of a non-controlling interest  
in the Group.  
Put option liability finance charge/income 
The financing charge of £1.0m for the year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: income of £9.9m) relates to fair value movements 
including the unwinding of the discount on the put option liability over the non-controlling interest in Burberry (Shanghai) 
Trading Co., Ltd. No tax has been recognised on this item, as the value of the option on exercise is not considered to be 
deductible for tax purposes. This item has been presented as an adjusting item in accordance with the Group accounting  
policy as it arises from changes in the value of the liability for expected future payments relating to the purchase of a  
non-controlling interest in the Group. Refer to note 19 for further details of the carrying value of the put option liability.

Costs relating to the transfer of the Beauty operations 
On 3 April 2017 Burberry entered into an agreement with Coty Geneva SARL Versoix (Coty) to grant Coty a licence for its 
fragrance and beauty products and to transfer Burberry’s Beauty operations to Coty. This agreement is expected to complete 
in October 2017. The licence agreement and the business transfer will be accounted for in the financial statements for the year 
ending 31 March 2018. Further details of the agreement to transfer the beauty operations business are set out in note 31. 
Costs of £14.5m arising in relation to the transaction have been incurred and recognised in the current period. These costs 
related to the write-off of software assets specifically relating to the Beauty operations of £7.3m (refer to note 12); a provision 
for the termination of a distributor agreement; and other ancillary charges incurred. None of these costs were paid in the period. 
These costs are presented as an adjusting item in accordance with the Group accounting policy as they arose in relation to  
the transfer of a business. A related tax credit of £2.9m has also been recognised in the period.

1 The goodwill reported for China does not include any goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest.  
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or where there is an indication that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 
amount of all cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis. Value-in-use calculations for each cash 
generating unit are based on projected three-year pre-tax discounted cash flows together with a discounted terminal value.  
The cash flows have been discounted at pre-tax rates reflecting the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for 
country-specific tax rates and risks. Where the cash generating unit has a non-controlling interest which was recognised  
at a value equal to its proportionate interest in the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the acquisition date,  
the carrying amount of the goodwill has been grossed to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest,  
for the purpose of impairment testing the goodwill attributable to the cash generating unit. The key assumptions contained  
in the value-in-use calculations include the future revenues, the margins achieved, the assumed life of the business and the 
discount rates applied. 
The value-in-use calculations have been prepared using management’s approved financial plans for the three years ending  
31 March 2020. These plans contain management’s best view of the expected performance for the year ending 31 March 2018 
and the expected growth rates for the two years ending 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2020. The plans are based on the 
performance achieved in the current year and management’s knowledge of the market environment and future business plans. 
A terminal value has been included in the value-in-use calculation based on the cash flows for the year ending 31 March 2020 
incorporating the assumption that there is no growth beyond 31 March 2020. 
For the material goodwill balances of China and Korea, a sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use 
calculations by assuming no growth beyond the year ending 31 March 2018. This sensitivity analysis indicated significant 
headroom between the recoverable amount under this scenario and the carrying value of goodwill and therefore management 
considered no further detailed sensitivity analysis was required. 
The pre-tax discount rates for China and Korea were 16.7% and 14.0% respectively (2016: 16.1%; 13.6%). 
The other goodwill balance of £21.3m (2016: £18.3m) consists of amounts relating to eight cash generating units, none of  
which have goodwill balances exceeding £10m as at 31 March 2017. 
No impairment has been recognised in respect of the carrying value of the goodwill balance in the year as, for each cash 
generating unit, the recoverable amount of goodwill exceeds its carrying value.  149

1 The goodwill reported for China does not include any goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest.  
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or where there is an indication that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 
amount of all cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis. Value-in-use calculations for each cash 
generating unit are based on projected three-year pre-tax discounted cash flows together with a discounted terminal value.  
The cash flows have been discounted at pre-tax rates reflecting the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for 
country-specific tax rates and risks. Where the cash generating unit has a non-controlling interest which was recognised  
at a value equal to its proportionate interest in the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the acquisition date,  
the carrying amount of the goodwill has been grossed to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest,  
for the purpose of impairment testing the goodwill attributable to the cash generating unit. The key assumptions contained  
in the value-in-use calculations include the future revenues, the margins achieved, the assumed life of the business and the 
discount rates applied. 
The value-in-use calculations have been prepared using management’s approved financial plans for the three years ending

1 Included in fixtures, fittings and equipment are finance lease assets with a net book value of £1.3m (2016: £1.7m). 
During the year to 31 March 2017, a net impairment charge of £23.0m (2016: £45.3m) was recorded as a result of the annual 
review of impairment of retail store assets. A charge of £15.3m (2016: £24.2m) was recognised against property, plant and 
equipment, and £7.7m (2016: £21.1m) was charged in relation to onerous lease provisions. Refer to note 20 for further details  
of onerous lease provisions. 
Where indicators of impairment were identified, the impairment review compared the value-in-use of the cash generating units 
to the carrying values at 31 March 2017. The pre-tax cash flow projections were based on financial plans of expected revenues 
and costs for each retail cash generating unit, as approved by management, and extrapolated beyond the budget year to the 
lease exit dates using growth rates and inflation rates appropriate to each store’s location. The pre-tax discount rates used  
in these calculations were between 11.4% and 21.6% (2016: between 11.4% and 19.7%), based on the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital adjusted for country-specific tax rates and risks. Where the value-in-use was less than the carrying 
value of the cash generating unit, an impairment of property, plant and equipment was recorded. Where the value-in-use  
was negative, onerous lease provisions were assessed in relation to the future contracted minimum lease payments. Potential 
alternative uses for property, such as subletting of leasehold or sale of freehold, were considered in estimating both the value 
for impairment charges and onerous lease provisions.

13. Property, plant and equipment (continued) 
Management has considered the potential impact of changes in assumptions on the total recorded as a result of the review for 
impairment of retail store assets and consideration of onerous lease provisions. The most significant estimate is the future level 
of revenues achieved by the retail stores. It is estimated that, for the stores subject to an impairment or onerous lease provision 
in the year, a 5% decrease/increase in revenue assumptions for the year ending 31 March 2018, with no change to subsequent 
forecast revenue growth rate assumptions, would result in an £8m increase/£9m decrease in the charge in the year ended  
31 March 2017. 
The impairment charge recorded in property, plant and equipment relates to 33 retail cash generating units (2016: 32 retail  
cash generating units) for which the total recoverable amount at the balance sheet date is £22.0m (2016: £18.2m). Impairment 
charges of £0.6m (2016: £2.3m) arose relating to other assets in the year.

1 Deferred tax balances within the ‘Other’ category in the analysis above include temporary differences arising on property provisions of £9.1m (2016: £8.5m), accrued 
intercompany expenses of £20.2m (2016: £23.0m) and other provisions and accruals of £26.5m (2016: £32.4m). 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related benefit through 
the future taxable profits is probable. The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of £79.8m (2016: £62.3m) in respect  
of losses and temporary timing differences amounting to £272.2m (2016: £215.1m) that can be set off against future taxable 
income. There is a time limit for the recovery of £37.0m of these potential assets (2016: £24.8m) which ranges from two to ten  
years (2016: three to ten years).  
Included within other temporary differences above is a deferred tax liability of £5.0m (2016: £1.2m) relating to unremitted 
overseas earnings. No deferred tax liability is provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
where the Group is able to control the remittance of earnings and it is probable that such earnings will not be remitted in the 
foreseeable future, or where no liability would arise on the remittance. The aggregate amount of temporary differences in 
respect of unremitted earnings is £300m (2016: £270m).

17. Derivative financial instruments 
Master netting arrangements 
The Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts and equity swap contracts are entered into under International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting arrangements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each 
counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single 
amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances, such as when a default occurs, all outstanding 
transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable  
in settlement of all transactions. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the Balance Sheet as the 
Group’s right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events such as default. The Group’s Balance Sheet 
would not be materially different if it had offset its forward foreign exchange contracts and equity swap contracts subject  
to these ISDA agreements.

17. Derivative financial instruments 
Master netting arrangements 
The Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts and equity swap contracts are entered into under International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting arrangements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each 
counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single 
amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances, such as when a default occurs, all outstanding 
transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable  
in settlement of all transactions. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the Balance Sheet as the 
Group’s right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events such as default. The Group’s Balance Sheet 
would not be materially different if it had offset its forward foreign exchange contracts and equity swap contracts subject  
to these ISDA agreements.

19. Trade and other payables (continued) 
Put option liability over non-controlling interest 
Following the acquisition of the Burberry retail and distribution business in China, Sparkle Roll Holdings Limited, a non-Group 
company, retained a 15% economic interest in the Group’s business in China. Put and call options were granted over this 
interest stake which were exercisable after 1 September 2015 in the case of the call option, and after 1 September 2020 in the 
case of the put option. The net present value of the put option liability was recognised as a non-current financial liability under 
IAS 39. On 1 August 2016, the Group exercised the call option relating to the economic interest. As a result, the put option 
expired at this date. 
The value of the put option liability is £nil at 31 March 2017 (2016: £45.8m). The movement in the liability for the period includes 
an increase of £1.0m relating to unrealised fair value movements, as described in note 6, together with an increase due to the 
translation of the put option liability to the Group’s presentational currency, combined with the derecognition of £51.0m on its 
expiry. Refer to note 29 for further details. 
Deferred consideration 
Following the purchase of the economic right to the non-controlling interest in Burberry Middle East LLC on 22 April 2016,  
the Group has recognised a liability in relation to the deferred consideration for this transaction. Refer to note 29 for further 
details of this transaction. The deferred consideration consists of fixed payments to be paid over the period 2016 to 2019,  
and contingent payments calculated as an agreed percentage of the future revenue of Burberry Middle East LLC and its 
subsidiaries, over the period 2016 to 2023. 
The fair value of the deferred consideration relating to the fixed payments has been derived via a present value calculation of the 
remaining fixed payments of AED 38.1m (£8.3m) discounted at an appropriate risk-free rate applicable to Burberry Middle East LLC. 
The fair value of the deferred consideration relating to the contingent payments has been estimated using a present value 
calculation, incorporating observable and non-observable inputs. The inputs applied in arriving at the value of this component 
of the deferred consideration are an estimate of the future revenue of Burberry Middle East LLC and its subsidiaries from  
the current period to 2023 and an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate for Burberry Middle East LLC. 
The carrying value of the deferred consideration relating to contingent payments is dependent on assumptions applied  
in determining these inputs, and is subject to change in the event that there is a change in any of these assumptions.  
The valuation is updated at every reporting period or more often if a significant change to any input is observed. 
A 10% increase/decrease in the estimate of future revenues of Burberry Middle East LLC and its subsidiaries would  
result in a £2.3m increase/decrease in the carrying value of the deferred consideration relating to contingent payments at  
31 March 2017 and a corresponding £2.3m decrease/increase in the profit before taxation for the year ended 31 March 2017.   157

21. Bank overdrafts and borrowings 
Included within bank overdrafts is £31.3m (2016: £44.9m) representing balances on cash pooling arrangements in the Group. 
The Group has a number of committed and uncommitted arrangements agreed with third-parties. At 31 March 2017, the Group 
held bank overdrafts of £3.0m (2016: £6.6m) excluding balances on cash pooling arrangements. 
On 25 November 2014, the Group entered into a £300m multi-currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks.  
At 31 March 2017, there were £nil outstanding drawings (2016: £nil). During the year the Group exercised an option to extend 
the maturity of the facility to November 2021, after receiving consent from all members of the syndicate. The Group is in 
compliance with the financial and other covenants within this facility and has been in compliance throughout the financial year. 
The fair value of borrowings and overdrafts approximate the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.   158

The Company has a general authority from shareholders, renewed at each Annual General Meeting, to repurchase a maximum 
of 10% of its issued share capital. During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase 
£100m of its own shares back as part of a share buy-back programme. Own shares purchased by the Company, as part of a 
share buy-back programme, are classified as treasury shares and their cost offset against retained earnings. When treasury 
shares are cancelled, a transfer is made from retained earnings to capital redemption reserve, equivalent to the nominal value 
of the shares purchased and subsequently cancelled. The cost of shares purchased by ESOP trusts are offset against retained 
earnings, as the amounts paid reduce the profits available for distribution by the Company.  
As at 31 March 2017 the amount held as treasury shares by the Company and offset against retained earnings is £97.2m (2016: £nil) 
including stamp duty of £0.5m (2016: £nil). As at 31 March 2017 the Company held 6.7m treasury shares (2016: nil), with a market 
value of £116.1m (2016: £nil). £3.3m (2016: £nil), relating to the cost of shares not yet purchased under the current share buy-back 
agreement, has been charged to retained earnings in the period, with the payment obligation recognised in other payables (note 19). 
As at 31 March 2017 the amount of own shares held by ESOP trusts and offset against retained earnings is £44.7m 
(2016: £39.9m). As at 31 March 2017, the ESOP trusts held 3.5m shares (2016: 3.1m) in the Company, with a market value  
of £59.6m (2016: £42.7m). In the year to 31 March 2017 the ESOP trusts have waived their entitlement to dividends of  
£1.7m (2016: £1.2m). 
During the year profits of £nil (2016: £2.0m) have been transferred to capital reserves due to statutory requirements of 
subsidiaries. In the year ended 31 March 2016, £6.2m was transferred from capital reserves to retained earnings due  
to the disposal and merger of subsidiaries. No such activity took place in the current year. The capital reserve consists  
of non-distributable reserves and the capital redemption reserve arising on the purchase of own shares. 
Other reserves in the Statement of Changes in Equity consists of the capital reserve, the foreign currency translation reserve, 
and the hedging reserves. The hedging reserves consist of the cash flow hedge reserve and the net investment hedge reserve.

23. Financial commitments 
The Group leases various retail stores, offices, warehouses and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease 
arrangements. The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. The Group has commitments relating 
to future minimum lease payments under these non-cancellable operating leases as follows:

Total  909.5 856.4 
The financial commitments for operating lease amounts calculated as a percentage of revenue (‘revenue leases’) have been 
based on the minimum payment that is required under the terms of the relevant lease excluding any contingent payments. 
Under certain revenue-based leases, there are no minimums and therefore no financial commitment is included in the table 
above. As a result, the amounts charged to the Income Statement may be materially higher than the financial commitment  
at the prior year end.  
The total of future minimum payments to be received under non-cancellable leases on investment properties and subleases 
on land and buildings is as follows:

25. Financial risk management 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, cash and short-term deposits, external borrowings  
(including overdrafts), trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables arising directly from operations. 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks (including foreign exchange risk, share price risk 
and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. 
Risk management is carried out by the Group treasury department (Group Treasury) based on forecast business requirements 
to reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest in cash and cash 
equivalents safely and profitably. Group Treasury does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the 
underlying business requirements. The policies of Group Treasury are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.  
The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. 
Market risk 
Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures. 
The Group’s Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency. To reduce exposure to currency 
fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign 
exchange contracts (see note 17). These transactions are recorded as cash flow hedges. The Group’s foreign currency 
transactions arise principally from purchases and sales of inventory. 
The Group’s treasury risk management policy is to hedge anticipated cash flows in each major foreign currency that qualify  
as ‘highly probable’ forecast transactions for hedge accounting purposes within the current or previous year. Currently, the 
Group does not hedge intercompany foreign currency transactions. 
The Group monitors the desirability of hedging the net assets of overseas subsidiaries when translated into Sterling for 
reporting purposes. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge net assets of overseas subsidiaries, relating 
to surplus cash whose remittance is foreseeable. The outstanding net investment hedges as at 31 March 2017 had a principal 
value of KRW 28.5bn (£20.3m) and CNY 471m (£54.6m), (2016: KRW 42.7bn (£26.0m) and CNY nil). 
At 31 March 2017, the Group has performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of Sterling strengthening/weakening  
by 20% (2016: 20%) against other currencies with all other variables held constant. The effect on translating foreign currency 
denominated net cash, trade, intercompany and other financial receivables and payables and financial instruments at fair  
value through profit or loss would have been to decrease/increase operating profit for the year by £18.2m (2016: decrease/ 
increase £16.5m). The effect on translating forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges would have 
been to decrease/increase equity by £7.6m (2016: decrease/increase £11.5m) on a post-tax basis. 
The following table shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the year end in currencies other  
than the local currency of operation, after accounting for the effect of any specific forward foreign exchange contracts used to 
manage currency exposure. Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and other amounts to be received  
or paid in cash. Amounts exclude intercompany balances which eliminate on consolidation. Foreign exchange differences on 
retranslation of these assets and liabilities are recognised in ‘Net operating expenses’ with the exception of the put option liability 
over the non-controlling interest which is recognised in ‘Other financing income and charges’.

25. Financial risk management (continued) 
Market risk (continued) 
Share price risk 
The Group is exposed to employer’s national insurance liability due to the implementation of various employee share  
incentive schemes. 
To reduce exposure to fluctuations in the employer’s national insurance liability due to movements in the Group’s share price, 
the Group has a policy of entering into equity swaps at the time of granting share options and awards. The Group does not 
seek hedge accounting treatment for equity swaps. The Group monitors its exposure to fluctuations in the employer’s national 
insurance liability on an ongoing basis. The net impact of an increase/decrease in the share price of 50.0p would have resulted 
in an increase/decrease in profit after tax of £nil (2016: £nil). 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash, short-term deposits and external 
borrowings (including overdrafts). 
The floating rate financial liabilities at 31 March 2017 are £34.3m (2016: £51.5m). This includes cash pool overdraft balances 
of £31.3m (2016: £44.9m) which are offset by cash balances for the purpose of interest calculations. At 31 March 2017 the 
remaining borrowings were £3.0m (2016: £6.6m) and any change in interest rates would not significantly impact profit.  
The floating rate financial assets as at 31 March 2017 comprise short-term deposits of £574.8m (2016: £429.7m), interest 
bearing current accounts of £34.2m (2016: £41.7m) and cash pool asset balances of £32.9m (2016: £45.4m). At 31 March 2017, 
if interest rates on floating rate financial assets had been 100 basis points higher/lower (2016: 100 basis points), excluding the 
impact on cash pool asset balances and with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 
£3.9m (2016: £3.6m) higher/lower, as a result of higher/lower interest income. 
Credit risk 
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The trade receivables balance is spread across a large number 
of different customers with no single debtor representing more than 7% of the total balance due (2016: 10%). The Group  
has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Sales to retail 
customers are made in cash or via major credit cards. In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis  
with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant and default rates have historically been very low.  
An ageing of overdue receivables is included in note 15.  
During the year ended 31 March 2013 the Group entered into a retail leasing arrangement in the Republic of Korea. As part  
of this arrangement, a KRW 27bn (£19.3m) 15 year interest-free loan was provided to the landlord. The Group holds a registered 
mortgage over the leased property for the equivalent value of the loan which acts as collateral. At 31 March 2017 the discounted 
fair value of the loan is £14.8m (2016: £13.9m). The book value of the loan, recorded at amortised cost, is £13.3m (2016: £11.0m). 
Other than this arrangement, the Group does not hold any other collateral as security. The maximum exposure to credit risk at 
the reporting date with respect to trade and other receivables is approximated by the carrying amount on the Balance Sheet. 
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short-term deposits and certain 
derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum 
exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure  
to any financial institution and only deposits funds with independently rated financial institutions with a minimum rating of  
‘A’ other than where required for operational purposes. A total of £13.4m (2016: £49.1m) was held with institutions with a  
rating below ‘A’ at 31 March 2017, of which £nil (2016: £38.6m) was held in a UK government majority owned institution.  
These amounts are monitored on a weekly basis and regularly reported to the Board. 
The Group has deposited CHF 0.3m (2016: CHF 0.3m), AED 0.3m (2016: AED 0.3m) and GBP nil (2016: GBP 0.3m) which  
is held as collateral at a number of European banks.  162

25. Financial risk management (continued) 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s financial risk management policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet foreseeable needs 
and close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain 
flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available. For further details of this, see note 21.  
All short-term trade and other payables, accruals, bank overdrafts and borrowings mature within one year or less.  
The carrying value of all financial liabilities due in less than one year is equal to their contractual undiscounted cash flows. 
The maturity profile of the contractual undiscounted cash flows of the Group’s non-current financial liabilities, excluding 
derivatives used for hedging, is as follows:

Total financial liabilities  59.0 120.2 
Other non-current financial liabilities relate to other payables, onerous lease provisions and the put option liability over  
non-controlling interests.  
Capital risk 
The Board reviews the Group’s capital allocation policy annually. Our capital allocation framework defines our priorities for uses of 
cash, underpinned by our principle to maintain a strong balance sheet with solid investment grade credit metrics. The framework 
has four priorities: 
· 
re-investment in the business to drive organic growth; 
· 
maintaining a progressive dividend policy; 
· 
continuing to pursue selective strategic investment; and 
· 
to the extent that there is surplus capital to these needs, provide additional returns to shareholders. 
At 31 March 2017, the Group had net cash of £809.2m (2016: £660.3m) and total equity excluding non-controlling interests of 
£1,692.5m (2016: £1,565.0m). The Group has access to a facility of £300m which was undrawn at 31 March 2017. For further 
details refer to note 21. 
In May 2016, having considered the future cash generation, growth, productivity and investment plans, taking into consideration 
the current challenging external environment and relevant financial parameters, the Group decided to commence a share buyback 
programme of up to £150m. During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase £100m  
of its own shares back as part of the share buy-back programme. At 31 March 2017 the Company had purchased £97.2m of its 
own shares including stamp duty. For further details refer to note 22.  163

Share options granted to directors and employees 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation schemes for its directors and employees. Details  
of each of these schemes are set out in this note. The share option schemes have been valued using the Black-Scholes  
option pricing model.  
The key inputs used in the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value include the share price at the commencement 
date; the exercise price attached to the option; the vesting period of the award; an appropriate risk-free interest rate; a dividend 
yield discount for those schemes that do not accrue dividends during the course of the vesting period; and an expected share 
price volatility, which is determined by calculating the historical annualised standard deviation of the market price of Burberry 
Group plc shares over a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the vesting period of the option.  
The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan (‘the RSP’), which has market-based performance conditions attached, 
has been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with a discount applied to this value, based on information 
obtained by running a Monte Carlo simulation model on the scheme.  
Where applicable, equity swaps have been entered into to cover future employer’s national insurance liability (or overseas 
equivalent) that may arise in respect of these schemes.  164

Savings-Related Share Option Scheme  
In the financial year ended 31 March 2007, a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave) offering Burberry Group plc 
ordinary shares was introduced for employees. 
On 16 June 2016, further options were granted under this scheme with a three-year and five-year vesting period offered to 
employees. The savings contract commencement date for this grant was 1 September 2016. These options are exercisable  
for a period of up to six months from 1 September 2019 and 1 September 2021 for the three-year and five-year schemes 
respectively, with vesting dependent on continued employment, as well as a saving obligation over the vesting period.  
The exercise price for these options is calculated at a 20% discount to market price over the three dealing days preceding  
the invitation date. Three day averages are calculated by taking middle market quotations of a Burberry Group plc share from 
the London Stock Exchange.  
The fair value per option for the three-year and five-year grants is £0.94 and £0.45 respectively. The fair values have been 
determined by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The key factors used in determining the fair value were  
as follows: 
  3 year grant 5 year grant 
Share price at contract commencement date  £10.69 £10.69 
Exercise price  £8.72 £8.72

employees. The savings contract commencement date for this grant was 1 September 2016. These options are exercisable  
for a period of up to six months from 1 September 2019 and 1 September 2021 for the three-year and five-year schemes 
respectively, with vesting dependent on continued employment, as well as a saving obligation over the vesting period.  
The exercise price for these options is calculated at a 20% discount to market price over the three dealing days preceding  
the invitation date. Three day averages are calculated by taking middle market quotations of a Burberry Group plc share from 
the London Stock Exchange.  
The fair value per option for the three-year and five-year grants is £0.94 and £0.45 respectively. The fair values have been 
determined by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The key factors used in determining the fair value were  
as follows: 
  3 year grant 5 year grant 
Share price at contract commencement date  £10.69 £10.69 
Exercise price  £8.72 £8.72

The Burberry Group plc Executive Share Plan 2014 (‘the ESP’) 
The ESP was set up in the year ended 31 March 2015, to replace the previous two long-term incentive plans – the Burberry  
Co-Investment Plan and the RSP. The ESP aims to reward executives and senior management for sustainable long-term 
performance and successful execution of the Group’s long-term strategy. 
Under the ESP, participants are awarded shares, structured as nil-cost options, up to a maximum value of four times base 
salary per annum. Awards may be subject to a combination of non-market performance conditions, including compound  
annual Group adjusted PBT growth; compound annual Group revenue growth; and average retail/wholesale adjusted return  
on invested capital (‘ROIC’). Performance conditions will be measured over a three-year period from the last reporting period 
prior to the grant date. Each performance condition will stipulate a threshold and maximum target. The portion of the scheme 
relating to each performance target will vest 25% if the threshold target is met, and then on a straight-line basis up to 100%  
if the maximum target is met. Dependent on the performance of the vesting conditions, 50% of the award will vest on the third 
anniversary of the grant date, and the remaining 50% of the award will vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date.  
Awards made to the Senior Leadership Team will be subject to all three non-market performance conditions and will be 
measured 50% based on annual adjusted PBT growth; 25% based on annual revenue growth; and 25% based on adjusted 
retail/wholesale ROIC.  
Awards made to Senior Management in 2015 will be subject to two non-market performance conditions and will be measured  
75% based on annual adjusted PBT growth and 25% based on annual revenue growth. Awards made to Senior Management 
during the current year will be subject to two non-market performance conditions and will be measured 50% based on annual 
adjusted PBT growth and 50% based on annual revenue growth. 
Awards made to Management will not be subject to performance conditions apart from continued service during the  
vesting period. 
During the year, the following grants were made under the ESP:

30 January 2017 201,670 £16.26 Management Continued service N/A N/A 
The annual ESP grant usually occurs in July, aligned with the timing of the Group performance review process. The grant date 
for the 2016 ESP award was delayed until January 2017 as a result of the on-going productivity and efficiency agenda, to allow 
appropriate targets to be set and agreed. For all participants apart from executive directors, it was agreed that the vesting 
dates will be aligned with the standard performance review timetable, meaning that for those participants, dependent on the 
performance conditions being met, 50% of the grant will vest on 22 July 2019 and 50% of the grant will vest on 22 July 2020. 
For the executive directors, the vesting dates fall on the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. 
The fair values for the above grants have been determined by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The key factors 
used in determining the fair value were as follows: 
  30 January 2017

Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan 2004 (‘the RSP’)  
The final grant under the RSP was made on 12 June 2014. 
Under the RSP participants were awarded shares, structured as nil-cost options, up to a maximum value of two times base 
salary per annum. Certain participants were granted awards subject to both market and non-market performance conditions, 
while other participants were granted awards subject to non-market performance conditions only. A limited number of awards 
were granted without performance conditions. 
The market performance condition is a measure of TSR performance relative to sector peers. The non-market performance 
condition is compound annual adjusted PBT growth over a three-year period from the date of grant. 
Awards subject to both market and non-market performance conditions will vest in full if the Group achieves at least upper 
quartile TSR relative to its global peers, and if the maximum adjusted PBT growth target is achieved. A proportion of the award 
(12.5%) vests if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer group, or if the threshold adjusted PBT growth target is 
achieved. Vesting against each metric occurs on a straight-line basis between the threshold and maximum. None of the award 
vests if TSR performance is below the median of the peer group and if the adjusted PBT growth is below the threshold. Of the 
shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vest after three years. The remaining 50% vest in two equal tranches on the 
fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. 
Awards subject to non-market performance conditions only will vest in full if the maximum adjusted PBT growth target is 
achieved. A proportion of the award (25%) vests if the threshold adjusted PBT growth target is achieved. Vesting occurs  
on a straight-line basis between the threshold and maximum. None of the award vests if the adjusted PBT growth is below  
the threshold. Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vest after three years. The remaining 50% vest in

The Burberry Co-Investment Plan  
The final award granted under the Burberry Co-Investment Plan was made on 12 June 2014. 
Under the Burberry Co-Investment Plan, executive directors and certain senior management were able to defer receipt of all  
or part of their annual bonus and invest it in ordinary shares in the Company with up to a 2:1 match based on individual and 
Group performance during the year. The matching share awards do not vest for three years and are forfeited if the executive 
leaves within that period. The exercise price of these share awards is £nil. The awards are also subject to secondary 
performance conditions. 
Awards granted in 2014 vest in full only if the Group achieves at least 10% per annum adjusted PBT growth over the three- 
year vesting period. A proportion of the award (25%) vests if growth in adjusted PBT achieves 5% per annum. Vesting occurs  
on a straight-line basis between the threshold and the maximum. None of the award vests if adjusted PBT growth is below  
5% per annum.

29. Transactions with non-controlling interests 
During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Group entered into two transactions with non-controlling interests. The impact  
of these transactions has been presented in the financial statements of the Group in the following manner: 
 
Burberry Middle East  
transaction 
£m 
Burberry Shanghai 
transaction 
£m 
Total 
£m 
Charge taken through statement of changes in equity 44.6 53.7 98.3 
Cash outflow recognised in statement of cash flows (15.1) (53.7) (68.8) 
A liability in relation to the remaining deferred consideration to be paid on the Burberry Middle East transaction has also  
been recognised. Refer to note 19 for further details on the carrying value of the liability at 31 March 2017. 
Burberry Middle East LLC 
On 22 April 2016 the Group entered into an agreement to transfer the economic right to the non-controlling interest in  
Burberry Middle East LLC to the Group in consideration for payments to be made to the minority shareholder relating  
to an agreed percentage of the future revenue of Burberry Middle East LLC and its subsidiaries, Burberry Al Kuwait General 
Trading Textiles and Accessories Company WLL and Burberry Qatar WLL, over the period 2016 to 2023, together with fixed 
payments of AED 120.0m (£22.6m), relating to profits of Burberry Middle East LLC up to 31 March 2016, to be paid over the 
period 2016 to 2019. 
In the judgement of management, the fixed payments of AED 120.0m are most appropriately treated as part of the 
consideration for purchasing the non-controlling interest in Burberry Middle East LLC. Therefore the transaction has been 
accounted for as a purchase of the non-controlling interest in Burberry Middle East LLC and its subsidiaries by the Group,  
for fixed and contingent deferred consideration, with the exception of a 12% interest in Burberry Qatar WLL which will  
continue to be held by another minority shareholder. 
The present value of the fixed and contingent deferred consideration in total, at the date of the transaction, was estimated  
to be AED 236.0m (£44.6m). Non-controlling interests with a book value of £25.5m were transferred to retained earnings. 
Deferred consideration of AED 80.7m (£15.1m) was subsequently settled in the period.  
Burberry (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd 
On 1 August 2016, the Group acquired the remaining 15% economic interest in its business in China, which was held by 
Sparkle Roll Holdings Ltd, a non-Group company, for consideration of CNY 470.9m (£53.7m), through the exercise of a  
call option held by the Group. The transaction has been accounted for as a purchase of the 15% non-controlling interest  
in Burberry (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd, for consideration of £53.7m. Non-controlling interests with a book value of £27.7m 
were transferred to retained earnings. 
The Group had also granted a put option over the same 15% economic interest to Sparkle Retail Holdings Ltd which was 
exercisable after 1 September 2020. The net present value of the expected put option payment was held as a non-current 
financial liability. Upon exercise of the call option by the Group, the put option expired and as a result, the value of the liability 
at the date of exercise, being £51.0m, was transferred directly to retained earnings.  176

30. Contingent liabilities 
In a number of jurisdictions the Group is subject to claims against it and to tax audits. These typically relate to Value Added 
Taxes, sales taxes, customs duties, corporate taxes, transfer pricing, payroll taxes, various contractual claims and other 
matters. During the year, the Group reached a resolution of its dispute with the Spanish tax authorities regarding the tax 
treatment of interest paid during the year ended 31 March 2005. Where appropriate, the estimated cost of known obligations 
have been provided in these financial statements in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies but these matters are 
inherently difficult to quantify. While changes to the amounts that may be payable could be material to the results or cash  
flows of the Group in the period in which they are recognised, the Group does not currently expect the outcome of these 
contingent liabilities to have a material effect on the Group’s financial condition. 
31. Events after the balance sheet date 
On 3 April 2017 Burberry entered into an agreement with Coty Geneva SARL Versoix (Coty) to grant Coty a licence for its 
fragrance and beauty products and to transfer Burberry’s Beauty operations to Coty. Under this agreement, Coty will make  
an upfront payment to Burberry of £130m for the licence and related transfer of the Beauty operations. Coty will also pay 
Burberry for assets transferring, principally inventory, estimated to be approximately £50m subject to any completion 
adjustments. Burberry will receive further payments, relating to royalties, over the term of the licence. 
This agreement is expected to complete in October 2017. Burberry will receive the above sums on completion of the 
transaction. Associated costs will be incurred, currently estimated to be £30m. The licence agreement and the business 
transfer will be accounted for in the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2018. Some of the costs arising in 
relation to the transaction have been incurred and recognised in the current period (refer to note 6).

Our opinion 
In our opinion, Burberry Group plc’s Company financial statements (the “financial statements”): 
· 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017; 
· 
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
· 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
What we have audited 
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise:

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Burberry Group plc 
181 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:  
· 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed;  
· 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and  
· 
the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our  
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary  
to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies  
with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report, we consider those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Burberry Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2017.

It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting policies (see note C).

B. Accounting policies 
The following principal accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated:  
Going concern  
Taking into account reasonable possible changes in trading performance and after making enquiries, the directors  
consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended  
31 March 2017. 
Share schemes 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation schemes, under which services are received from 
employees (including executive directors) as consideration for equity instruments of the Company. The cost of the share-based 
incentives is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant. Appropriate 
option pricing models, including Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo, are used to determine the fair value of the awards made.  
The fair value takes into account the impact of any market performance conditions, but the impact of non-market performance 
conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant. Vesting conditions which relate to non-market 
conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to vest. The estimate of the number  
of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.  
In some circumstances, employees may provide services in advance of the grant date. The grant date fair value is estimated  
for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between the service commencement period and the grant date. 
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is 
treated as a capital contribution. In the Company’s financial statements, the cost of the share-based incentives is recognised 
over the vesting period of the awards as an increase in investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding increase  
in equity. Where amounts are received from Group companies in relation to equity instruments granted to the employees  
of the subsidiary undertaking, the amount is derecognised from investments in Group companies, to the extent that it was 
initially treated as a capital contribution, with any remaining amounts recognised as an increase in equity.  
When options and awards are exercised, they are settled either via issue of new shares in the Company, or through shares held 
in the ESOP trusts, depending on the terms and conditions of the relevant scheme. The proceeds received from the exercises, 
net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital and share premium. Share-based payments 
disclosures relevant to the Company are presented within note 26 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plc’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the year in which the dividend 
becomes a committed obligation. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid. 
Investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provisions to reflect impairment in value. 
Impairment of investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised 
for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s net 
realisable value and value-in-use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which 
there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).

Notes to the Company Financial Statements

B. Accounting policies (continued) 
Taxation 
Tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax charge. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit because it excludes  
items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items which are never taxable 
or deductible. The current tax liability is calculated using tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date. 
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liabilities method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, if the temporary difference arises from 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, no deferred tax will be recognised. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.  
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.  
Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow expire  
or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities, with the exception of derivative financial instruments, are stated at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities held at amortised 
cost approximate their carrying amount due to the use of market interest rates. 
The Company’s primary categories of financial instruments are listed below: 
Cash at bank and in hand 
On the Balance Sheet, cash at bank and in hand comprises cash held with banks. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are included in current assets. Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment 
of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the movement in the provision is recognised in the  
Income Statement. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, inclusive of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated  
at amortised cost and the difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised  
in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method. Borrowings are classified  
in creditors amounts falling due within one year unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

in creditors amounts falling due within one year unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
  
Notes to the Company Financial Statements

B. Accounting policies (continued) 
Financial instruments (continued) 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Company uses equity swap contracts to economically hedge its exposure to fluctuations in the Company’s share price 
which impacts the social security costs payable by Group companies in relation to share-based compensation schemes. 
The equity swap contracts are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and classified as held for trading. All subsequent 
changes in fair value are recognised in the Income Statement up to the maturity date.  
Foreign currency translation 
Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which  
the Company operates (the functional currency). The financial statements are presented in Sterling which is the Company’s 
functional and presentation currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies  
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at  
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are held at the year end, 
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on 
monetary items are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise.  
Called up share capital  
Called up share capital is classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to owners of the Company until the shares are cancelled, 
reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to owners  
of the Company. 
C. Key sources of estimation and judgement  
Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires that management make certain judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent 
liabilities. If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgements at the date  
of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimate and assumptions will be updated as 
appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key areas where the estimates 
and assumptions applied have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
are discussed below: 
Impairment of investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. When a review for potential 
impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on the higher of an investment’s fair value less costs  
to sell and value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates. Refer to note D for 
further details of investments. 
Impairment of trade and other receivables 
The Company is required to make an estimate of the recoverable value of receivables. When assessing potential impairment  
of receivables, management considers factors including any specific known problems or risks. Refer to note E for further  
details on the net carrying value of trade and other receivables.

G. Called up share capital (continued) 
The Company has a general authority from shareholders, renewed at each Annual General Meeting, to repurchase a maximum 
of 10% of its issued share capital. During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase 
£100m of its own shares back as part of a share buy-back programme. Own shares purchased by the Company, as part of  
a share buy-back programme, are classified as treasury shares and their cost offset against the profit and loss account. When 
treasury shares are cancelled, a transfer is made from the profit and loss account to the capital redemption reserve, equivalent 
to the nominal value of the shares purchased and subsequently cancelled. The cost of shares purchased by ESOP trusts are 
offset against the profit and loss account, as the amounts paid reduce the profits available for distribution by the Company.  
As at 31 March 2017 the amount held as treasury shares by the Company and offset against the profit and loss reserve is 
£97.2m (2016: £nil) including stamp duty of £0.5m (2016: £nil). As at 31 March 2017 the Company held 6.7m treasury shares 
(2016: nil), with a market value of £116.1m (2016: £nil). £3.3m (2016: £nil), relating to the cost of shares not yet purchased  
under the current share buy-back agreement, has been charged to the profit and loss account in the period, with the payment 
obligation recognised in other payables. 
As at 31 March 2017 the amount of own shares held by ESOP trusts and offset against the profit and loss account is  
£44.7m (2016: £39.9m). As at 31 March 2017, the ESOP trusts held 3.5m shares (2016: 3.1m) in the Company, with a market 
value of £59.6m (2016: £42.7m). In the year to 31 March 2017 the ESOP trusts have waived their entitlement to dividends  
of £1.7m (2016: £1.2m).  
The capital reserve consists of the capital redemption reserve arising on the purchase of own shares.

A final dividend in respect of the year to 31 March 2017 of 28.4p (2016: 26.8p) per share, amounting to £123.6m, has been 
proposed for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting subsequent to the balance sheet date. The final 
dividend has not been recognised as a liability at the year end and will be paid on 4 August 2017 to shareholders on the  
register at the close of business on 7 July 2017. 
I. Financial guarantees 
On 25 November 2014, the Group entered into a £300m multi-currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of third-party 
banks. At 31 March 2017, there were £nil outstanding drawings (2016: £nil). During the year the Group exercised an option  
to extend the maturity of the facility to November 2021, after receiving consent from all members of the syndicate.  
The companies acting as guarantor to the facility consist of Burberry Group plc, Burberry Limited, Burberry Asia Limited, 
Burberry (Wholesale) Limited (US) and Burberry Limited (US). The fair value of this financial guarantee as at 31 March 2017  
is £nil (2016: £nil). 
A potential liability may arise in the future if one of the Group members defaults on the loan facility. Each guarantor,  
including Burberry Group plc, would be liable to cover the amounts outstanding, including principal and interest elements. 
J. Audit fees 
The Company has incurred audit fees of £0.1m for the current year which are borne by Burberry Limited (2016: £0.1m). 
K. Employee costs 
The Company has no employees and therefore no employee costs are included in these financial statements for the year  
ended 31 March 2017 (2016: £nil).  General shareholder enquiries

Dividends
An interim dividend for the financial year ended 31 March 
2017 of 10.5p per ordinary share was paid on 27 January 
2017. A final dividend of 28.4p per share has been proposed 
and, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on  
13 July 2017, will be paid according to the following timetable:
Final dividend record date 7 July 2017 
Deadline for return of DRIP mandate forms 14 July 2017 
Final dividend payment date 4 August 2017
The ADR local payment date will be approximately five 
business days after the proposed dividend payment date 
for ordinary shareholders.
Dividends can be paid by BACS directly into a UK  
bank account, with the tax voucher being sent to the 
shareholder’s address. This is the easiest way for 
shareholders to receive dividend payments and avoids the 
risk of lost or out of date cheques. A dividend mandate 
form is available from Equiniti or at www.shareview.co.uk.
If you are a UK taxpayer, please note that you are eligible 
for a tax-free Dividend Allowance of £5,000 in each tax 
year. Any dividends received above this amount will be 
subject to taxation. Dividends paid on shares held within 
pensions and Individual Savings Accounts (‘ISAs’) will 
continue to be tax-free. Further information can be found  
at www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends. 
Dividends payable in foreign currencies
Equiniti is able to pay dividends to shareholder bank 
accounts in over 30 currencies worldwide through the 
Overseas Payment Service. An administrative fee will be 
deducted from each dividend payment. Further details can 
be obtained from Equiniti or online at www.shareview.co.uk.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
The Company’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan (‘DRIP’) 
enables shareholders to use their dividends to buy  
further Burberry shares. Full details of the DRIP can be 
obtained from Equiniti. If shareholders would like their  
final 2017 dividend and future dividends to qualify for the 
DRIP, completed application forms must be returned to  
Equiniti by 14 July 2017.
Duplicate accounts
Shareholders who have more than one account due  
to inconsistency in account details may avoid duplicate 
mailings by contacting Equiniti and requesting the 
amalgamation of their share accounts.

Unauthorised brokers (boiler room scams)
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports. These are typically from overseas-based 
‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders offering to sell them 
what often turn out to be worthless or high-risk shares in 
US or UK investments. These operations are commonly 
known as boiler rooms.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice, get the 
correct name of the person and organisation and check 
that they are properly authorised by the FCA before getting 
involved by visiting www.fca.org.uk/register/.
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be  
eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme if things go wrong. 
If you think you have been approached by an unauthorised 
firm you should contact the FCA consumer helpline on  
0800 111 6768.
More detailed information can be found on the FCA  
website at www.fca.org.uk/consumers/protect-yourself/
