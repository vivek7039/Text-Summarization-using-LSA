CHRIS HOLMES
CHAIRMAN
Chairman’s Statement
REVIEW OF THE YEAR
The financial year ended 2 September 
2017 was a challenging year as the 
Group’s financial performance was 
impacted by external factors affecting 
both divisions which were highlighted  
in our trading update on 20 July 2017. 
Despite this, the year was also one  
of investment and significant progress 
towards achieving the Group’s medium 
term strategic objectives.
In our Agriculture division, while the UK 
business benefited from a recovery in 
farmgate milk prices and consequently 
improved farmer confidence, sales 
volumes in our USA feed block business 
were affected throughout the year by 
lower cattle prices. This was partially 
mitigated by a gradual recovery in the 
second half which has continued into 
the new financial year. In October 2017 
we completed the acquisition of Pearson 
Farm Supplies Ltd in line with our 
strategy of strengthening our presence 
in current locations.
With the backdrop of this recovering 
USA trading environment, the strategic 
investment made in our new low 
moisture feed block plant in Tennessee, 
USA will provide us with access to new 
geographic markets in the Eastern  
and South Eastern states of the USA.  
The plant is expected to be completed 
before the end of December 2017  
and following this the Group will have 
comprehensive coverage of all the major 
cattle areas in the USA. 
In our Engineering division, we suffered 
a significant setback during the year as  
a result of a delay to the commencement 
of a major contract and the poor 
profitability of certain other contracts 
during the period. As previously disclosed 
in our trading update on 20 July 2017, 
the delayed contract has now been 
signed and work has begun which will 
continue throughout the current and  
into the next financial year. 
During the year we also invested  
in the acquisition of two engineering 
businesses. In October 2016 we acquired 
a German family-owned engineering 
business, STABER GmbH, which designs 
and develops specialised technology 
and is highly complementary to 
Wälischmiller, our German remote 
handling business. Since its acquisition, 
STABER has been integrated with 
Wälischmiller and we are investing in the 
extension of our premises in Markdorf, 
Germany to consolidate both operations 
into one site and provide additional 
efficiency, flexibility and capacity. 
In August 2017 we announced the 
acquisition of NuVision Engineering, Inc., 
a world renowned technology and 
engineering company based in the USA, 
specialising in the supply of products 
and services to the nuclear industry.  
The acquisition will provide the Group 
with a foothold into new major nuclear 
markets and the opportunity to market 
Wälischmiller products in the USA.  
In addition, we have continued to invest 
in extending our reach into new markets, 
particularly China, where significant 
opportunities lie in the supply chain  
as part of the country’s increased 
development and investment in the 
nuclear power market.
We have also increased the strength  
and depth of our management team  
in the Engineering division through the 
appointment of a Divisional Managing 
Director who will oversee and coordinate 
the businesses in the UK, Germany and 
the USA.
In total, the Group has invested up  
to £24.3 million in expanding its USA 
feed block operations and in growing 
the Engineering division through 
acquisitions which take the Group  
into new geographic markets, provide 
additional capabilities, and support  
our growth ambitions. We therefore 
remain confident in the future prospects 
of both divisions. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Revenue for the year increased by 9.9% 
to £346.2 million (2016: £314.9 million). 
Operating profit before amortisation  
of intangible assets and non-recurring 
items was down 28.5% to £9.3 million 
(2016: £13.0 million), with Agriculture 
contributing £8.6 million (2016: £10.4 
million) and Engineering £0.7 million 
(2016: £2.6 million). The contribution 
from associates and joint ventures was up 
35.2% at £2.8 million (2016: £2.1 million).
The Group incurred a number of non-
recurring items in the year, totalling  
£1.3 million. This included acquisition 
costs of £1.4 million, primarily related  
to the acquisitions of NuVision and 
STABER, and a net credit relating to 
Chirton Engineering of £0.4 million.  
The net credit comprised an exceptional 
credit of £2.1 million for contingent 
consideration no longer payable and  
an impairment charge against the 
associated goodwill of £1.7 million.  
There was also a loss of £0.2 million  
on the disposal of an old, unutilised 
Agriculture site and restructuring costs 
of £0.1 million. 
Reported operating profit after 
amortisation of intangible assets and 
non-recurring items was down 38.3%  
at £7.9 million (2016: £12.8 million).
Despite challenges  
in both of our divisions, 
the year was one of 
investment and significant 
progress towards 
achieving the Group’s 
medium term  
strategic objectives. Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
05
Profit before tax before amortisation  
of intangible assets and non-recurring 
items was down 20.2% to £11.4 million 
(2016: £14.3 million), and reported  
profit before tax was down 29.0% at 
£10.0 million (2016: £14.1 million). Basic 
earnings per share were down by 28.0% 
to 7.7 pence (2016 continuing operations: 
10.7 pence), with fully diluted earnings 
per share of 7.6 pence (2016 continuing 
operations: 10.5 pence) and adjusted 
earnings per share, excluding 
amortisation of intangible assets and 
non-recurring items, of 8.9 pence  
(2016 continuing operations: 10.9 pence). 
Net debt at 2 September 2017  
was £14.1 million (2016: net cash of  
£8.1 million). The movement included 
£13.2 million generated from operations, 
£14.3 million used for acquisitions and 
capital expenditure, and £19.5 million 
paid in dividends.
DIVIDEND
The Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 2.1 pence per ordinary share, which 
together with the two interim dividends 
of 0.95 pence per ordinary share paid on 
12 May 2017 and 6 October 2017, make  
a total of 4.0 pence per share for the year 
(2016: 3.8 pence per share) excluding the 
special dividend of 17.54 pence per share 
paid in October 2016. The final dividend, 
if approved by the shareholders, will be 
paid on 12 January 2018, to shareholders 
on the register on close of business  
15 December 2017, and the shares will  
go ex-dividend on 14 December 2017.
BOARD COMPOSITION AND 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In line with our commitment to continual 
improvements in corporate governance, 
during the year we engaged 
Independent Audit Limited, a leading 
specialist in corporate governance,  
to conduct an external evaluation  
of the effectiveness of the Board and  
its Committees. That review concluded 
that the Board and its Committees  
were functioning well and noted that 
improvements had been made since  
the previous external review which  
we carried out in 2013. It also made  
a number of further recommendations 
which the Board has already begun  
to work towards implementing.  
The Board remains firmly committed  
to good governance. 
Some changes have been made this  
year to the composition of the Board’s 
Committees and to the Group’s 
Remuneration Policy in light of feedback 
received from shareholders and investor 
reporting bodies following our 2016 
Annual Report. We always welcome  
the views of all Carr’s Group plc 
stakeholders, particularly where  
it can lead to improvements in our  
governance framework. 
Full details of our approach to Corporate 
Governance, the independent review 
undertaken during 2017 and our policy 
on continued improvement are set  
out on pages 26-29 of our Annual Report 
and Accounts.
OUTLOOK
The Group remains focused on 
delivering its stated strategic objectives 
of investing in both its people and its 
asset base whilst continuing to drive 
product innovation and deliver growth, 
both organically and by acquisition, 
across our two divisions. 
The outlook for UK Agriculture remains 
positive with farm incomes continuing 
to improve in the near term. Additionally, 
we continue to see a gradual 
improvement in cattle prices in the USA, 
resulting in improved feed block 
volumes, which is expected to continue. 
In Engineering, the difficulties in our UK 
business largely caused by a significant 
contract delay have been addressed and, 
with the beneficial effects of other 
contract wins and strengthened 
management, we expect to see  
a significant improvement in the year 
ahead. The recent acquisitions enhance 
the depth of our offering and provide 
further opportunities to drive growth. 
We are also encouraged by the 
opportunities apparent within our 
Engineering division, particularly  
in China and the USA.
Looking further ahead, it remains unclear 
what the UK’s terms of exit from the 
European Union will look like. However, 
the Board will continue to monitor  
the position closely and the Group will 
remain flexible to respond to any 
challenges that may arise. 
Overall, trading in the new financial year 
has started well and in line with the 
Board’s expectations, with a particularly 
good start to the year in our USA  
feed block business and strong order 
books across the Engineering division.  
We believe, that with the investments 
made in acquisitions and research  
during the year in both Agriculture  
and Engineering, we have laid a solid 
foundation for sustained growth and are 
confident in the outlook for the Group.

Agriculture
After three difficult years across the global agricultural 
sector, prices in dairy and livestock markets have stabilised 
and begun to recover as 2017 has progressed. In the UK 
this recovery has been supported further by the continued 
weakness seen in sterling as the Brexit process has 
unfolded over the past twelve months.
Brexit adds uncertainty in the UK especially for agriculture 
and in the longer term the industry may move through  
a period of some significant change and restructuring in 
response. But long term prospects for agriculture remain 
strong – whatever the outcome of Brexit the need to 
increase productivity in the UK, Europe and globally to feed 
the growing world population remains critical. Moreover,  
to offset challenges that may emerge in the UK industry  
as a result of the Brexit process means that the need for 
productivity enhancing technologies remains strong.
The strategic aim across the Agricultural division remains  
to strengthen the businesses’ geographical position and 
reach across core markets in the UK, Europe and the USA 
taking advantage of rising incomes in the dairy and beef 
sectors while also starting to develop a leadership position 
in dairy nutrition.
• Growing manufactured feed volumes in UK market.
• Continued investment in UK retail store development.
• Global investment including a new low moisture block 
plant in Shelbyville, Tennessee, a new Pick Block plant  
at Oldenburg, Germany and continued development of 
feed block markets in New Zealand and South America.
Engineering
Growing opportunities across the global nuclear industry 
continue to offer a good platform on which to develop  
and strengthen our Engineering division. The product 
development programme in remote handling is progressing 
well enabling the opening up of exciting new markets such 
as China. Exploration into the adjacent markets of defence 
and nuclear new-build amongst others also remains  
an important element of the divisional strategy as does 
building long term strategic relationships with key clients 
such as Sellafield.
The STABER GmbH integration process has progressed well 
and works are ongoing to extend premises at Markdorf, 
Germany to fully consolidate the business. The acquisition 
of NuVision Engineering, Inc. has provided the Engineering 
division with a foothold in the USA and the opportunity  
to promote the full range of Wälischmiller’s products in that 
market. Further acquisition opportunities are also under 
review across the sector.
• Medium term manufacturing pipeline looking good, with 
benefit of £48m Sellafield Vessels and Tanks framework 
contract expected to begin during 2018.
• Acquisition of NuVision, a leading technology and 
applications engineering company based in the USA, 
opens up market access and manufacturing capability 
across North America.
• Increased strength and depth in management to bring 
full coordination and the benefit of synergies across the 
division globally.

The development of the Simarghu® range by Workware  
(a division of Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Ltd) aligns with 
the Group’s long-term strategy of focusing on markets with 
growth potential and differentiating ourselves by investing  
in technology and innovation. The range has proved very 
successful and has significantly elevated the profile of the 
Workware division.
Top: The Simarghu® harness in action.
Bottom: The Gemini (female) harness.
Case Study: Simarghu® 
In 2017 the Group’s Workware 
division launched its Simarghu® 
range of arborist harnesses  
and products. 
Developed over a number of years, and backed by patent-
pending technology, Simarghu® represents the very best  
in safety and performance. 
Named after the mythical dragon who protects the tree of life, 
the Simarghu® harnesses are the product of a collaboration 
with renowned industry and design experts. Recognising the 
importance of comfort whilst working at height, the design 
process heavily involved occupational therapists to ensure that 
the Simarghu® range continues to perform throughout use. 
The meticulous design process has resulted in range of 
harnesses that have been described as truly “game-changing” 
with full ergonomic adjustability and practical features which 
are designed specifically with arborists in mind. 
Perhaps the most notable development is the production  
of the very first female-specific harness which better levels  
of comfort and support over traditional unisex harnesses. 
The Simarghu® range was first revealed at the Tree Care 
Conference in Augsburg, Germany and officially launched  
at the ARB Show, National Arboretum on 12 May 2017. 
The industry response has been extraordinary with arborists 
providing ongoing positive feedback and endless reviews/
discussions on social media. Since launch, further products  
have also been added to the range which complement  
the harnesses and enhance performance. Workware has 
already been able to appoint distributors across Europe and 
has plans to launch Simarghu® into the USA, Canada, Australia 
and New Zealand. 
During the year, the Group 
made strategic investment in 
technologies which will provide  
a platform for further growth  
in key markets.

Case Study:  
NuVision Engineering, Inc.
On 7 August 2017, Carr’s Group 
plc announced its acquisition of 
USA-based engineering business 
NuVision Engineering, Inc. 
NuVision was founded in 1971 and is split between its 
headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and operations  
in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is recognised internationally  
as a leading technology and engineering solutions business 
specialising in supplying products and services at nuclear and 
power plant facilities, government waste remediation facilities 
and in waste clean-up programmes. 
NuVision boasts an impressive customer base including the  
US Department of Energy, major nuclear energy suppliers  
and public utilities worldwide, and international governments. 
Its specialist products and services include:
•
 MSIP®: a patented technology for improving the safety and 
operational life of nuclear plant by reducing the stresses 
exerted onto welds and crack mitigation;
•
 Powerfluidics™: maintenance-free systems for mixing, 
sampling and retrieving radioactive liquids, slurries and sludges;
•
 Decontamination: efficient and effective systems for 
decontaminating pipe-ends and other artefacts in nuclear 
power plants during standard maintenance procedures;
•
 Robotics: a suite of heavy duty manipulators for use in clean-up 
operations, complementing the range currently offered by the 
Group’s existing remote handling operations; and
•
 R&D consultancy: working with the US Department of Energy 
to develop innovative solutions for the nuclear industry.
As part of the deal, the Group also acquired NuVision’s 49% 
stake in Mid Columbia Engineering, Inc., an engineering and 
fabrication business based in Richland, Washington and local 
to the Hanford Site nuclear complex. 
The acquisition provides a strong foothold into USA nuclear 
markets and will enable significant revenue synergies with  
the Group’s existing engineering businesses, including the 
opportunity to market Wälischmiller’s products in the USA.  
It aligns with the Group’s strategy of international growth, 
particularly in markets with significant potential, and to be  
at the forefront of innovation and technology. 
MSIP®
Mechanical Stress Improvement Process 
(MSIP®) is a patented technology that was 
invented, developed and first used in 1986 
by NuVision for mitigating stress cracking 
in nuclear plant pipe welds.  
The process works by hydraulically 
compressing a pipe either side of  
a weld joint by approximately 1-2%.  
By compressing the weld, the tensile 
stresses are redistributed and the safety 
and operational life of plant is improved.  
Each application requires a highly 
engineered bespoke clamp to be 
manufactured and meticulous planning  
so that installation can be completed 
during nuclear plant outages.
MSIP® is accepted by the United States 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission  
as a stress mitigation process and has 
successfully been applied to over 6,000 
welds on nuclear power plants worldwide 
and on pipes from 2-34 inches in diameter. Carr’s Group plc

Agriculture
The Agriculture division has experienced 
a challenging year. Lower farming profits 
in the USA, resulting from lower cattle 
prices, impacted sales volumes of our 
feed blocks. However, this was partially 
offset by a recovery in UK Agriculture  
as farmgate milk prices and farmer 
confidence improved. 
FEED BLOCKS
In the USA, pressure from lower cattle 
prices impacted our feed block business, 
with sales volumes, including joint 
ventures, down 4.1% year on year.  
As anticipated, the second half of the 
year saw the beginning of a recovery, 
resulting in volumes being marginally 
ahead of previous expectations.  
This gradual recovery is expected  
to continue in the current year. 
Our new low moisture feed block plant 
in Tennessee is expected to be fully 
operational by the end of December 
2017, providing access to new markets 
across the Eastern and South Eastern 
states of the USA and providing 
additional capacity as the market 
recovery continues. 
UK feed blocks performed well, 
demonstrating the strength of our 
brands, despite milder spring weather 
conditions which caused a slowdown  
in the second half. 
Overall, feed block sales were down  
2.1% on last year. 
We continue to develop opportunities  
to expand geographically. In South 
America, our trials at FAI Farms  
(a commercial research institute in Brazil) 
and the Instituto de Zootecnia near 
Ribeirao Preto, São Paulo State are 
progressing well. Completion of the 
trials is expected in the current financial 
year and initial results are encouraging. 
In New Zealand we have incorporated  
a subsidiary company and established  
a direct sales operation distributing  
to farmers through key merchants  
as we make progress towards 
establishing our feed block products  
in this important market.
Investment in research in all our 
territories continues as we demonstrate 
the continued value of our existing 
brands such as Crystalyx® and SmartLic® 
as well as the introduction of new 
products, such as FlaxLic® and 
Megastart®. The continued investment  
in research which confirms the efficacy 
of our products is the foundation  
for the success of our feed block 
business globally, and sets us apart  
from our competitors.
Despite difficult market conditions and a disappointing 
performance in our UK Manufacturing business, we have 
continued to invest in our business, which is consistent  
with our vision to be recognised as a truly international  
business at the forefront of innovation and technology  
across Agriculture and Engineering.

UK AGRICUL TURE
The recovery we witnessed in the first 
half in UK Agriculture continued into  
the second half with manufactured feed 
volumes, which includes compound feed 
and blends, increasing 10.9% year on 
year, against a national market rise of 
6.6%
1
. This is a strong performance which 
demonstrates the value we bring to our 
customers. On 5 June 2017 we acquired 
the trade and assets of Mortimer Feeds,  
a feed merchant business operating 
principally in Cheshire. This acquisition 
adds incremental feed volumes,  
converts some existing merchant 
business into direct sales, and is in line 
with our strategy of strengthening  
our presence in current locations and 
leading in dairy nutrition.
The retail business has delivered another 
strong performance, with the country 
store network across Northern England 
and Southern Scotland reporting  
an increase of 0.8% in like-for-like  
sales and a 2.2% increase in total sales 
following the opening of Penicuik,  
East Midlothian in December 2016  
and the acquisition of Horse and Pet 
Warehouse Ltd, Ayr in March 2017. 
On 31 October 2017 we acquired the 
entire issued share capital of Pearson 
Farm Supplies Ltd, an agricultural retail 
business with locations across Yorkshire, 
Lancashire and North West Wales.  
This will significantly expand our 
customer base, bring together key 
people and provide key synergies across 
the Group. The acquisition takes our 
total retail footprint to 43 locations.
The strategy for the retail business 
remains the expansion of our geographic 
reach into adjacent territories, 
redeveloping existing facilities and 
expanding our product offering to meet 
the needs of our customers, particularly 
those located in rural communities.  
As part of our strategy, we continue  
to ensure that our retail stores have  
the best possible locations alongside 
livestock auction markets and in key 
agricultural locations. 
In addition, we had a strong 
performance in agricultural machinery 
where sales achieved a record level, 
increasing 27.8% year on year. New 
tractor sales were up 42% year on year 
against a market increase of 21% and our 
market share for key brands increased  
by 3% to 19%.
The oil distribution business saw sales 
volumes decline 3.5%, which was  
a resilient performance given the mild 
weather conditions, with ambient 
temperatures during winter and spring 
higher than the prior year. Our continued 
good performance can be attributed  
to our product offer and excellent levels 
of customer service. 
AGRICULTURE OUTLOOK
Farmer confidence has returned during 
the year as a result of the increase  
in farmgate milk prices and improved 
revenues from beef and sheep leading 
to a recovery in farm incomes. We expect 
farm incomes to continue to improve 
throughout the current financial year. 
The uncertainty following the outcome 
from the EU referendum remains, 
particularly relating to the future of the 
single farm payment and support for  
UK farmers. However, in the short-term 
UK livestock and dairy prices have 
responded positively due to a number  
of factors, including the devaluation  
of sterling. 
The division is well placed both 
operationally and geographically to 
adapt to future market conditions whilst 
continuing to support the needs of our 
farming customers.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
The Engineering division had  
a disappointing year with a poor 
performance in UK Manufacturing due 
largely to a delayed contract. Despite 
this, the division made significant 
strategic progress with the highlights 
being the acquisition and integration  
of STABER into our remote handling 
business and the acquisition of NuVision. 
This takes the business into new markets 
in the USA, increases the focus on 
nuclear and its adjacent markets, and 
brings new technology and capabilities 
to the Group. 
UK MANUFACTURING 
Revenues declined in the year as a result 
of the contract delay in the first half  
of the year. As announced on 30 March 
2017, efforts to mitigate the effects of 
that delay were only partially successful. 
The impact of the reduction in revenues, 
together with poor margins on work 
completed during the year, largely  
as a result of the continuing pressures  
in the oil and gas markets, resulted in  
a loss in our UK Manufacturing business. 
We have strengthened the management 
team in the UK Manufacturing business 
in the final quarter of the financial year. 
Also, we were pleased to report on  
20 July 2017 that the delayed contract 
had been signed. This will be delivered 
throughout the current financial year 
and into the next financial year. 
Additionally, work within the  
Sellafield Vessels and Tanks Category 
Management Framework is expected to 
commence during the current financial 
year. This contract, with a value of £48m 
at the time of the tender, secures design 
and manufacturing services relating  
to Sellafield’s highest complexity vessels 
for a 10 year period. This underpins  
the growth and development of our  
UK Manufacturing business over the 
medium and long term. 
The Group’s focus on the nuclear 
industry has continued although, as 
previously reported, the pivot by part of 
the manufacturing business away from 
oil and gas to nuclear and its adjacent 
markets, including defence, has been 
slower than initially anticipated due to 
the aforementioned contract delay. 
The UK nuclear industry has benefited 
from the Government’s commitment  
to both the ongoing decommissioning 
process and the future construction  
of new nuclear power facilities. 
Consequently, the division is seeing  
an increase in the level of activity and 
engagement with the new build sector 
and is establishing itself as a strategically 
relevant partner to the international 
effort behind the new build programme.
USA ENGINEERING
On 7 August 2017, we announced the 
acquisition of USA-based engineering 
business NuVision Engineering, Inc. 
which operates from locations in 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Charlotte, 
North Carolina.  
The Group acquired the company for  
an initial consideration of $11.5m (£8.8m), 
before adjustments for working capital, 
and a total consideration of up to  
$20m (£15.4m) dependent upon future 
financial performance. NuVision is 
recognised internationally as a leading 
technology and engineering solutions 
business specialising in supplying 
products and services at nuclear and 
power plant facilities, government  
waste remediation facilities and in waste  
clean-up programmes. 
The acquisition provides a strong 
foothold into USA nuclear markets  
and will enable significant revenue 
synergies with the Group’s existing 
engineering businesses, including the 
opportunity to market Wälischmiller’s 
products in the USA. NuVision is already 
a key supplier under a major nuclear 
contract being delivered by the UK 
Manufacturing business. 
REMOTE HANDLING 
During the year the remote handling 
business performed ahead of the  
Board’s expectations with high levels  
of activity, particularly in relation  
to the manufacturing of products  
for the Chinese market. Furthermore,  
the order book is at its highest level  
for several years.

Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements
In January 2017 we were notified that 
the Group had won the tender for the 
supply of a number of manipulators, 
including three A1000s, 36 A100s and 
four A200s, into China. Manufacturing 
commenced during the second half  
of the year and continues in the current 
financial year. This is particularly 
encouraging given the significant 
increase in the planning and 
construction of new nuclear power 
plants and forms part of the Chinese 
Government’s strategic plan to remove 
its current reliance on coal generated 
power. As part of that plan, power 
companies are mandated to include 
remote handling capability within  
the design of a new nuclear power 
station in order for it to be able  
to handle waste and potential future  
decommissioning requirements.
During the year it was confirmed by 
Statoil that funding would continue to 
be supplied for the Demo 2000 project 
which involves the development of  
a lightweight Telbot® especially for use 
on oil and gas platforms and which is 
designed to reduce risk and downtime 
during tank inspections.
On 24 October 2016 we acquired 
STABER GmbH, one of the primary 
suppliers to Wälischmiller, our German 
remote handling business, including  
all of its associated intellectual property 
for a total cash consideration of €7.9m 
(£6.98m). STABER and Wälischmiller have 
been working together closely for over 
50 years and its acquisition will help 
drive efficiencies and profitability within 
the division. 
The first stage of integrating STABER 
into Wälischmiller has been successfully 
completed, with key personnel being 
retained and working together effectively, 
and the extension of the premises  
in Markdorf, Germany is underway.  
This will provide additional flexibility  
and capacity, and consolidates both 
operations into one facility which will 
complete the integration process and  
be of significant benefit. 
Following the acquisition of NuVision  
in August 2017, which has its own range  
of heavy-duty manipulators, the Group 
has one of the most technologically 
advanced ranges of remote handling 
equipment in the world.
MANAGEMENT
To maximise opportunities and synergies 
following the strategic progress made 
during the year, we have strengthened 
the management in the Engineering 
division through the appointment of a 
Divisional Managing Director to oversee 
Engineering operations across the Group.
ENGINEERING OUTLOOK
We continue to invest in the ongoing 
development of our products and 
services within the Engineering division 
to ensure that they remain at the 
forefront of innovation and technology. 
When combined with our existing 
decommissioning portfolio and strong 
pipeline of current and potential 
contracts, the Group is well positioned 
to benefit from future opportunities and 
developments, particularly in the nuclear 
sector where our reputation as a premium 
supplier of high integrity equipment  
is already well established.

Risk Management
The Group adopts a risk profile aligned  
to our vision to be recognised as a truly 
international business at the forefront  
of technology and innovation. 
Our available capital and resources are 
applied to underpin our four strategic 
pillars: acquisitions, people, investment  
and innovation.
The Board believes that in managing the 
Group’s business it is critical to strike the 
right balance between an appropriate 
and comprehensive control environment 
and encouraging entrepreneurial 
behaviours required to seek out and 
develop the business.
However well this is struck, the business 
will always be subject to a number of 
risks and uncertainties. Our approach to 
risk management is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that our assets are 
safeguarded. The risks facing the business 
are assessed and, where possible, 
mitigated and all relevant information  
is disclosed and reported to the Board.
ORGANISATION AND PROCESS
The Board assumes overall responsibility 
for the management of risk and for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems.
The Board has established a clear 
organisational structure with well-defined 
accountabilities for the principal risks  
the Group faces in the short, medium, 
and long term, across all divisions. This is 
overseen by the Executive Directors, who 
have an active responsibility for focusing 
on the principal areas of risk to the Group. 
The Board reviews these risk areas, 
including consideration of environmental, 
social, and governance matters.  
This review is undertaken quarterly.
For each of our principal risks we have  
a risk management framework detailing 
our assessment of the risk, the controls 
we have in place, who is responsible for 
managing the risk, as well as any further 
mitigating actions required.
BOARD’S ASSESSMENT OF 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE RISK 
MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The Board review the principal risks 
quarterly. This is supported by an annual 
review of the risk management system 
undertaken by the Audit Committee. 
Details of the activities of the Audit 
Committee in relation to this can be 
found in the Audit Committee Report  
on pages 30-32. Decisions that could 
have a material impact on the Group  
are reviewed as and when required  
at Board meetings.
PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS
Our business is subject to a variety of risks 
and uncertainties. On the following 
pages we have identified the risks we 
regard as most significant to our Group 
and performance at this time. These may 
change as the Group develops over the 
year. We have commented on mitigating 
actions that we believe help us manage 
these risks. However, we may not  
be successful in deploying some or all  
of these mitigating actions. If the 
circumstances in these risks occur or are 
not successfully mitigated, our cash flow, 
operating results, financial position, 
business and reputation could be 
materially adversely affected. 
Our risk appetite  
and approach  
to risk management
Our success as a Group depends on the ability to identify  
and maximise the opportunities generated by our businesses  
and the markets in which we operate. 
In doing so, we continue to develop an embedded approach  
to risk management which puts risk and opportunity assessment  
at the heart of our strategy. Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

KEY RISKS
DESCRIPTION OF THE RISK WHAT WE ARE DOING TO MANAGE THE RISK
IT AND CYBER-SECURITY
The Group relies on information technology and key 
systems to support the business. In common with other 
organisations, the Group undertakes development of its  
IT systems and is susceptible to cyber-attacks with the risk  
of a financial loss and threat to the overall confidentiality 
and availability of data in systems.
The Group has a comprehensive suite of IT security 
solutions in place, which are reviewed and tested by 
specialist third parties. 
From a system development perspective, major projects 
are subject to appropriate project governance arrangements.
BREXIT
The UK’s impending exit from the European Union (EU) 
highlights a number of risks for the Group, particularly  
in the Agriculture division.
Part of our customer base is inherently reliant on 
agricultural subsidies from the EU, and therefore future 
government policy and support for the agricultural sector 
will potentially impact on our customers with a knock on 
effect to our agricultural business.
Similarly, for some areas of the business the Group imports 
raw materials from within the EU. The imposition of tariffs 
or other related cost increases could impact the cost base 
of the Group.
The Group benefits from its operational and geographic 
diversity and is not substantially dependent on the EU  
for either raw materials or revenues. 
We will continue to monitor developments in the Brexit 
process and incorporate steps into our future business 
planning where these may be required in order to mitigate 
any potentially adverse consequences including the 
imposition of any tariffs.
ACQUISITIONS
The Group is acquisitive and is therefore exposed to the 
possibility of acquiring a company based on inaccurate 
information, unrealistic synergies and financial benefits,  
or an inappropriate deal structure. 
Failure to effectively integrate acquired businesses could 
also undermine any expected synergies.
A thorough and careful due diligence process is 
undertaken, utilising relevant skilled internal personnel,  
as well as external expertise when required. Individual 
business unit and Group resource is used to analyse 
potential synergies and financial benefits. Consideration  
is given to the composition and skills of the management 
team of the acquired company and support and relevant 
training is provided by Group personnel as part of  
a detailed plan to ensure a successful integration.  
The deal structure and proposed financing arrangements 
are determined on a case by case basis.
Post-acquisition reviews are also undertaken to identify 
any areas for improvement in future transactions.
MANAGING COSTS
Margins may be affected by fluctuations in raw material 
prices due to factors such as harvest and weather 
conditions, crop disease, crop yields, alternative crops,  
and by-product values.
In some cases, due to the basis for pricing in sales 
contracts, or due to competitive markets, we may not  
be able to pass on to customers the full amount of raw 
material price increases or higher energy, freight or other 
operating costs.
The Group has a number of strategies in place to manage 
this risk. These include:
• strategic long term relationships with suppliers;
• multiple-source suppliers for key ingredients;
• raw material and forward energy purchasing policies  
to provide security of supply and cost; and
• close monitoring of contract execution to ensure supply 
is within agreed terms.

Risk Management continued
DESCRIPTION OF THE RISK WHAT WE ARE DOING TO MANAGE THE RISK
RELIANCE ON KEY CUSTOMERS
Some businesses within the Group have a significant 
proportion of their revenue generated from a small number 
of key customers. A loss of one or more of these customers 
could adversely affect the performance of a division and  
in turn the Group. 
The businesses have established good long term 
relationships with key customers to ensure that demands 
and expectations are met. The Group is constantly 
investing in its businesses to ensure that they are able  
to satisfy customer needs and are market leaders. 
The Group is continually working on identifying new 
markets, products, and opportunities to expand the 
customer base of all its businesses. 
PEOPLE
Performance, knowledge and skills of employees are 
central to the success of the Group. We must attract, 
integrate, and retain the talent required to fulfil our 
strategic growth ambitions. Inability to retain key 
knowledge and adequately plan for succession could  
have a negative impact on the Group’s performance.
The Group has remuneration policies designed  
to attract, retain and reward employees with the ability  
and experience to execute the Group’s strategy.
Management development programmes are in place, 
alongside detailed succession planning across the Group. 
Succession plans for senior roles are reviewed by the 
Nominations Committee annually.
STRATEGIC PARTNERS
The Group has a number of strategic partners, particularly 
in the Agriculture division, who are involved either as joint 
venture partners or significant minority shareholders.  
A successful working relationship with these partners  
is paramount to those businesses’ success.
Close working relationships are maintained with all the 
Group’s strategic partners. This includes regular meetings, 
both formally and informally, and close involvement in the 
setting and monitoring of strategy for those businesses.  
In addition, arrangements are appropriately documented  
in contracts and legal agreements.
CUSTOMER DEMAND
Changes in customer demand, be that retail, commercial  
or government customers, caused by economic factors or 
delays in planning contracts could result in a fall in demand 
for the Group’s product offering, resulting in a significant 
loss in revenue. 
The Group operates in diverse worldwide markets, which 
provide some resilience for the Group against difficulties 
faced by any one market or economy. The businesses are 
managed flexibly to react to changing demands in their 
own sector.
TREASURY
We are exposed to a variety of financial risks in relation  
to treasury.
The Group must ensure that it has an adequate level  
of facilities to provide sufficient funding to operate its 
businesses and to develop growth opportunities.
Changes to the value of currencies can fluctuate widely 
and could have a significant impact on a division’s  
results due to the translation of overseas results into  
our functional currency and because some sales receipts 
and purchase payments are denominated in foreign 
currencies. Furthermore, because the Group has 
international businesses it is subject to exchange risks  
in the translation of the underlying net assets and earnings 
of its foreign subsidiaries.
The level of facilities are regularly reviewed by the Group 
Finance Director, and these are also regularly reported  
to and discussed by the Board.
The Group operates a treasury policy of hedging all 
significant transactional currency exposures. Additionally, 
translational hedging instruments are sometimes used  
to limit the potential impact of fluctuating currencies  
on reported earnings from foreign subsidiaries.
For interest rate risk on floating rate debt, we maintain  
a mix of fixed rate debt, primarily finance lease, and 
floating rate debt. These levels are monitored and assessed 
against forecast changes in interest rates and forward 
guidance from interest rate setting authorities. 
BUSINESS CONTINUITY
The operation of manufacturing plants involves many  
risks that could cause a temporary or permanent stoppage 
in production and could have a material adverse effect  
on the Group.
The Group has Business Continuity arrangements in place 
to enable continuity of supply, as quickly as practicable,  
of product to customers in the event of a natural disaster  
or major equipment or plant failure. A programme  
of insurance is also in place to protect against the cost  
of major business interruptions.
KEY RISKS Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Viability Statement
The Group’s focus is particularly on 
developing its supplements business, 
because of the opportunities for 
international expansion and product 
development, and its nuclear 
engineering business because of the 
global expansion opportunities in the 
nuclear sector and adjacent markets.
The Group’s prospects are assessed 
primarily through its strategic planning 
process. This process is led by the Chief 
Executive across all aspects of the Group. 
The Board participates fully in the annual 
process through an annual strategy day, 
detailed strategic presentations on all 
areas of the business by business leaders 
throughout the year, and an annual half-
year strategic update. Part of the Board’s 
role is to consider whether the plan 
continues to take appropriate account  
of the changing external environment.
The output of the strategic planning 
process is a set of Group strategic 
objectives and a number of strategic 
priorities for the forthcoming financial 
year. The latest updates to the strategic 
plan were finalised in May 2017 following 
this year’s review. This considered  
the Group’s current position and the 
development of the business as a whole 
over the next three years.
Given the nature of the business cycles 
in both Agriculture and Engineering,  
it was decided that a period of three 
years to 31 August 2020 was the most 
appropriate for the purpose of a viability 
assessment. The Group has prepared 
detailed financial forecasts for the 3 year 
period to 31 August 2020, so that 2 years 
10 months remains at the time of 
approval of this year’s Annual Report 
and Accounts. The first year of the 
financial forecasts form the Group’s 
operating budget and is subject to  
a re-forecast process at the half-year. 
Forecasts for the second and third years 
are prepared in a similar level of detail.
The Group’s principal risks are set out  
on pages 14-16. The purpose of the 
principal risks table is primarily to 
summarise those matters that could 
prevent the Group from delivering on  
its strategy. A number of other aspects  
of the principal risks – because of their 
nature or potential impact – could also 
threaten the Group’s ability to continue 
in business in its current form if they 
were to occur. Of the principal risks 
identified, the following are the most 
important to the assessment of the 
viability of the Group:
1. Brexit;
2. Managing costs;
3. Reliance on key customers;
4. Strategic partners;
5. Customer demand; and
6. Treasury.
It was determined that none of these 
individual risks would, in isolation, 
compromise the Group’s viability.
Although the strategic plan reflects the 
Directors’ best estimate of the future 
prospects of the business, they have  
also tested the potential impact on the 
Group of a number of scenarios over  
and above those included in the plan  
by quantifying their financial impact and 
overlaying this on the detailed financial 
forecasts in the plan.
These scenarios represent ‘severe but 
plausible’ circumstances that the Group 
could experience.
The scenarios tested included:
• Significant reductions in profitability 
and associated cashflows associated 
with the risks highlighted above,  
with consumer demand affecting all 
business units and additional impacts 
on Agriculture business units from 
commodity costs, and from strategic 
partners; and
• Interest costs increasing by a factor  
of two.
The results of this stress testing showed 
that, due to the stability of the core 
business, the Group would be able to 
withstand the impact of these scenarios 
occurring over the period of the financial 
forecasts by making adjustments to its 
operating plans within the normal 
course of business.
The Group also considered a number  
of scenarios that would represent serious 
threats to its liquidity. None of these was 
considered to be plausible.
Based on their assessment of prospects 
and viability above, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the three year period 
ending 31 August 2020.
The Directors also considered it 
appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on the going concern  
basis, as explained in the Basis of 
Accounting paragraph in the principal 
accounting policies.
The Group’s business model and strategy are central to an 
understanding of its prospects, and details can be found on pages  
6-7. The Group is very diverse both operationally and geographically.  
The Group set down a strategic plan three years ago, which is subject  
to ongoing monitoring and development as described below.

Current and Future 
Development  
and Performance
REVENUE 
Reported revenues from continuing 
operations were £346.2m, 9.9 per cent 
ahead of last year (2016: £314.9m). 
Revenues have increased primarily  
as a result of higher sales volumes in the 
UK Agriculture business.
OPERATING PROFIT
Group operating profit before 
amortisation and non-recurring items  
of £9.3m is down 28.5 per cent on last 
year (2016: £13.0m). As a percentage  
of revenues, Group operating margin 
before amortisation and non-recurring 
items is 2.7 per cent compared to 4.1  
per cent in 2016. 
These reductions are due to the trading 
issues experienced in the last year in UK 
Manufacturing and in USA Feed Blocks.
Operating profits, before amortisation and non-recurring items and from continuing 
operations, per division and as a percentage of divisional revenues are as follows:
AMORTISATION AND  
NON-RECURRING ITEMS
The Group incurred a number of non-
recurring items in the year, totalling 
£1.3m. This included acquisition costs  
of £1.4m, primarily related to the 
acquisitions of NuVision and STABER, 
and a net credit relating to Chirton 
Engineering of £0.4m. The net credit 
comprised an exceptional credit of £2.1m 
for contingent consideration no longer 
payable and an impairment charge 
against the associated goodwill  
of £1.7m. There was also a loss of £0.2m  
on the disposal of an old, unutilised 
Agriculture site and restructuring  
costs of £0.1m.
SHARE OF ASSOCIATES AND JVS
The Group’s share of the post-tax result 
in its associates and joint ventures was 
£2.8m, compared to £2.1m in 2016.  
The result reflected both an increase in 
its associates’ profitability and an increase 
in joint venture profitability, primarily 
driven by a recovery in the European 
dairy market which assisted feed block 
performance and a better performance 
in the USA AminoMax business.
FINANCE COSTS
Net finance costs of £0.7m were lower 
than the previous year (2016: £0.8m), 
reflecting lower borrowings throughout 
the year. Interest cover was 15.5 times 
based on reported profit (18.1 times  
on an underlying profit basis) compared 
to 19.2 times in 2016.

PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Profit before tax from continuing 
operations before amortisation and  
non-recurring items at £11.4m was  
20.2 per cent lower than in the previous 
year (2016: £14.3m). Reported profit 
before taxation was £10.0m (2016: £14.1m).
TAXATION
The Group’s effective tax charge on 
profit from activities after net finance 
costs and excluding profits from 
associates and joint ventures was  
23.7 per cent (2016: 24.2 per cent).  
A reconciliation of the actual total  
tax charge to the standard rate  
of corporation tax in the UK of  
19.58 per cent is given in note 7  
to the financial statements.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The profit attributable to the equity 
holders of the Company amounted to 
£7.0m (2016: £12.5m), and basic earnings 
per share from continuing operations 
was 7.7p (2016: 10.7p), a decrease of  
28.0 per cent.
Adjusted earnings per share from 
continuing operations of 8.9p  
(2016: 10.9p) is calculated by dividing  
the profit attributable to equity holders 
for the year, before amortisation and 
non-recurring items, by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue  
during the year. 
ACQUISITIONS 
The Group has made a number of 
acquisitions in the year in both divisions.
The entire issued share capital of STABER 
GmbH was acquired by Wälischmiller 
Engineering GmbH on 24 October 2016 
for cash consideration of €7.85m, 
including €2m of deferred consideration. 
The deferred consideration is payable 
upon successful transfer of intellectual 
property, and is due by 30 June 2018.
The Group acquired the entire issued 
share capital of Horse and Pet 
Warehouse Ltd, a retailer of animal 
health products for the pet, equine and 
smallholding market, on 17 March 2017 
for a cash consideration of £139,000.  
On 5 June 2017, the Group also acquired 
the business and certain assets  
of Mortimer Feeds Ltd for cash 
consideration of £579,000, including 
£125,000 of contingent consideration. 
Both acquisitions have been subsequently 
hived up and incorporated into Carrs 
Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited.
NuVision Engineering, Inc. was acquired 
by the Group on 4 August 2017 for  
a total consideration of up to $20m.  
The initial consideration payable was 
$11.5m, with contingent consideration  
of up to $8.5m payable over a three  
year period dependent on future 
financial performance.
Further details on all acquisitions  
are given in note 29 to the financial 
statements.
CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT
A free cash flow of £11.3m was 
generated in the year, representing an 
increase of 73.2 per cent on £6.5m in the 
previous year. 
This increase was substantially due to 
improvements in working capital. After 
payment of £19.5m of dividends, 
including a £16.0m special dividend, and 
£13.2m on acquisitions, the cash flow for 
the year was £22.3m, resulting in closing 
net debt of £14.1m.
Headroom against existing facilities was 
£30.2m at the year end. Other than the 
Group’s overdraft, which is renewable 
annually, the Group’s existing facilities 
are due for renewal in June 2019.
PENSIONS
The Group operates its current pension 
arrangements on a defined benefit and 
defined contribution basis. The defined 
benefit scheme is closed to new 
members and closed to future accrual. 
The scheme currently has 106 deferred 
members and 227 current pensioners. 
The valuation on an IAS 19 accounting 
basis showed a surplus before the 
related deferred tax liability in the 
scheme at 2 September 2017 of £5.2m 
(2016: £0.3m). This is after an actuarial 
gain of £5.0m (2016: loss of £2.7m) which 
has been recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Key Performance Indicators
We monitor our performance against the strategy by means  
of key performance indicators (‘KPIs’):
(5.5)% 13.1% 4.1% £6.5m 13.0%
Comments:
Revenues are monitored by the Board. Our volume 
driven businesses are all subject to significant raw 
material price variations, the majority of which are 
passed through to selling prices. Hence increasing raw 
material prices are expected to lead to higher revenues.
Comments:
Gross margin is a reflection on how successfully we have 
managed raw material price volatility in our markets, 
together with how successful we have been in pricing  
in other areas of our business in competitive markets.  
Our gross margin from continuing operations fell to 11.2% 
in the current year, which reflects the market conditions 
in USA Agriculture and the poor performance of UK 
Manufacturing partly as a result of major contract delay.
Comments:
The underlying Group operating margin reflects the 
gross margin achieved, which is described above,  
but also indicates the efficiency of our operations from 
both an administrative and distribution perspective.  
The fall in underlying operating margin from continuing 
operations to 2.7% reflects the financial performance in 
USA Agriculture and UK Manufacturing.
Comments:
This KPI indicates how much cash is available for the 
Group to utilise for expansionary capital investment, 
paying dividends, or financing/repaying borrowings.  
The increase in FY17 is predominantly due to working 
capital changes across the business.
Comments:
Return on net assets fell to 10.8% this year. This reduction 
also reflects the financial performance in USA Agriculture 
and UK Engineering. The 2016 calculation excludes profit 
before tax of discontinued operations of £3.5m.

PEOPLE
People are fundamental to every 
business and our employees are critical 
to the successful delivery of our strategic 
objectives. One of our four key pillars is 
“investing in people, who are vital to the 
long term success of the business” .
Our values of trust, respect, and integrity 
run throughout all our businesses.  
Our high levels of teamwork and 
co-operation are a major contributing 
factor to our success. We strive to  
ensure that employees across the Group 
are kept informed about business 
performance through the issue of  
regular briefing notes by the Executive 
Directors or Senior Management.  
These are circulated as a matter of routine 
at regular intervals and also whenever 
there are significant developments 
across the Group or which affect  
a particular division or business unit. 
Management within the Group are also 
kept informed on issues that may affect 
employees which enables effective, 
transparent communication and 
consultation where appropriate.
Continuing to identify talent and 
develop our people will remain  
key priorities for us going forward.  
We remain committed to providing  
a working environment that:
• is consistent and fair;
• is free from discrimination; 
• aids development and skills; and
• supports employee engagement.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to an active 
equal opportunities policy promoting  
an environment free from discrimination, 
harassment and victimisation, where 
everyone will receive equal treatment 
regardless of gender, colour, ethnic or 
national origin, disability, age, marital 
status, sexual orientation or religion.  
All decisions relating to employment 
practices will be objective, free from bias 
and based solely upon work criteria and 
individual merit. The Group is responsive 
to the needs of its employees, customers 
and the community at large. We are  
an organisation which uses everyone’s 
talents and abilities and where diversity 
is valued.
Employees with disabilities
It is our policy that people with 
disabilities should have full and fair 
consideration for all vacancies and 
opportunities. We remain committed to 
maintaining the current open, fair and 
non-discriminatory recruitment process 
operated throughout the Group,  
and seek to have full engagement with 
any employee who becomes disabled 
during their employment.
Sharesave
The Group operates a Sharesave scheme 
in which all UK-based employees  
are entitled to participate. The Group 
recognises that the scheme is a well-
established method of employee 
engagement, facilitating ownership  
in the Group.
Development overview of year
This has been another good year in 
developing our people at all levels. 
The Group Wide Senior Leadership 
Development Programme concluded  
in February 2017 with the presentation 
of Strategic Business Projects to the  
CEO and Managing Directors. Detailed 
feedback was obtained which clearly 
demonstrated achievement of the initial 
programme objectives. We intend  
to continue our successful working 
relationship with the Brathay Trust  
on future development programmes. 
The Carrs Billington Branch Supervisors 
Development Programme concluded in 
January 2017 and detailed feedback from 
throughout the programme was collated 
which resulted in a further session 
chaired by the Managing Director to 
work with the supervisors regarding 
areas such as credit control, product 
knowledge, systems, customer service 
and pricing structures. One outcome 
from this was an increase in product 
knowledge training across the business.
A further outcome was a half day 
programme in customer service which 
has been delivered to over 280 Carrs 
Billington employees earlier in the year. 
The feedback from the programme  
has led to Regional Branch Managers 
requesting follow up training to expand 
on the learnings from the first session 
and to ensure implementation of the key 
learning points.
We believe that an employee’s first 
impressions of an organisation have  
a significant impact on their integration 
within the team and their level of job 
satisfaction. As a result of this we have 
introduced a Carr’s Group induction 
programme as an opportunity to 
welcome all new recruits, regardless  
of position, to help them settle in and 
ensure they have the knowledge and 
support needed to thrive at work.
It is important to us that induction is not 
just treated as a ‘tick box’ exercise, but is 
seen as a great opportunity to introduce 
new employees to the culture and  
ways of working of the business. We all 
need to invest time in inducting new 
employees to help them settle in, 
become productive more quickly and  
to take our business forward. 
The programme covers the  
following areas:
• Company History;
• Company Structure;
• Vision, Strategy and Values;
• The Way We Work;
• Health and Safety; and
• Customer Service.
As part of our ongoing commitment to 
supporting professional development, 
we have run three Management 
Development Programmes throughout 
2017 for Line Managers to enhance their 
management skills.
The programme includes essential 
modules that help managers  
increase their level of knowledge  
and implement effective workplace 
principles and practices.

Leadership and Management
Module 2  Problem Solving and

HEAL TH AND SAFETY
The Group remains fully committed  
to the maintenance of high standards  
of health and safety for all of its 
employees, visitors, customers,  
and any others who may be affected  
by the activities of its businesses.  
Health and safety is continually 
monitored and the Group strives to 
make progressive improvements.
The CEO, Group FD and Group Risk 
Manager meet monthly in advance  
of each Board meeting to review health 
and safety which is a permanent high-
agenda item. Every Board meeting 
involves a detailed review of statistics, 
auditing activity and other initiatives  
as well as ensuring the Board are alerted 
to key risk management and legislative 
changes. The Board also endorses an 
ongoing programme of improvements.
Since his appointment as a Non-
Executive Director in 2015, Ian Wood  
has closely overseen health and safety 
across the Group at Board level 
providing support to the Executive 
Directors and Group Risk Manager.  
This has helped the Group deliver its 
programme of improvements and 
ensure that policies and practices are  
in line with the recommendations  
of the Institute of Directors and HSE.
The Group Risk Manager continuously 
monitors safety performance to ensure 
there is a high standard of health and 
safety management across all Group 
businesses. This includes a rolling 
programme of site audits.
The overall number of accidents for the 
Group as a whole, including the overseas 
businesses, was 44, a reduction of 1  
on the 45 recorded the previous year 
(excluding Carr’s Flour Mills Ltd). 
The number of RIDDOR reportable 
injuries and overseas equivalents has 
however increased to 4 from 2 the 
previous year. The number of days lost  
in the year arising from these was 
consequently 57, an increase from 25  
the previous year.
During 2016-2017 there have been 
several Health and Safety training 
initiatives in both the UK and overseas 
which will help lay the foundations for 
future improvement and a reduction  
in accidents. 
The Board is committed to improving 
standards of health and safety and 
remains confident the overall trend  
of reduction in accident numbers seen  
in recent years will continue.

Carr’s Group – Carbon CO2 Generation 2016/17 v 2015/16
SUSTAINABILITY 
As a Group, we are committed to 
improving our environmental impact 
and continue to make progress towards 
our target of achieving a 25% reduction 
in our carbon footprint by 2020  
(against our 2012 baseline). The Group’s 
Environmental Committee meets four 
times each year with active representation 
from UK subsidiaries across the Group. 
Through continued investment in state 
of the art equipment, energy efficient 
lighting and in improving processes,  
the Group continues to reduce its  
carbon generation. The Group wide 
Environmental Reporting System is fully 
operational for both UK and overseas 
subsidiaries. Each subsidiary and 
business location reports the following 
monthly data and performance against 
pre-set benchmarks:
• Energy and Carbon Generation;
• Water Utilisation;
• Waste Generation and Recycling; 
• Transport Fuels; and
• Environmental Legislation/Compliance.
During 2015 the Group undertook a full 
Energy Audit in accordance with the 
mandatory Energy Savings Opportunity 
Scheme (ESOS), and the findings and 
energy saving opportunities identified 
from the audit were presented to the 
CEO and duly signed off as required  
by law. We have already adopted many  
of the recommendations highlighted  
in that report, and will continue with  
our programme of implementation, 
which has resulted in progressive 
improvements to the Group’s 
environmental impact. A second ESOS 
Energy Audit will be undertaken by the 
Group before December 2019. 
During 2017, and in light of the results 
from our ESOS Energy Audit, we carried 
out a comprehensive review of how 
energy data is collected across the 
Group in order to ensure that the  
data we collect is accurate, readily 
comparable and consistently recorded. 
That review has helped improve the 
manner in which data is collected and 
can be reported. 
All Engineering and Manufacturing  
sites across the UK within the Group 
now purchase their energy from  
Haven Power Limited which, during  
the 12 months ended 31 March 2017, 
sourced 77.8% of its electricity from  
renewable sources.*

Carbon Generation Report
The Group did not generate any 
additional greenhouse gases other  
than Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from the 
utilisation of grid supplied electricity  
and natural gas during the year ended  
2 September 2017. 
The energy intensive UK feed block 
business continued to be in receipt of 
Climate Change Discount Agreements  
in exchange for target carbon 
reductions. Those targets were met  
by the business during the year.

Transport Fuels
During the year ended 2 September 2017 
the Group utilised 1,067,984 litres of 
diesel and petrol fuel for fleet vehicles 
and company cars throughout its UK 
operations. The amount of CO2 generated 
from this fuel consumption was 2,858 
tonnes, down from 4,405* tonnes in the 
previous year. 
Total CO2 Generated by the Group
The total amount of CO2 generated 
across the Group during the year  
ended 2 September 2017 was 16,692 
tonnes, down from 16,795 tonnes in the  
previous year.* 
*2016 figures included Carr’s Flour Mills Ltd.  
2017 figures include additional feed block plant  
at Silver Springs, USA
Intensity Metric
Due to the diverse nature of operations 
across the Group, we have determined 
that measuring tonnes of CO2 generated 
against total number of employees 
represents the best Key Performance 
Indicator for measuring improvements in 
Group-wide carbon footprint. For the year 
ended 2 September 2017, the intensity 
metric stood at 16.5 tonnes of CO2 per 
employee (being 16,692 tonnes/1,014 
employees), which is down 31.3% from 
24.3 tonnes of CO2 per employee in 2016.
The CO2 emissions data is reported  
in metric tonnes. The CO2 emissions  
data has been calculated on the basis  
of measured energy and fuel use and 
multiplied by relevant CO2 conversion 
factors, as approved by the Department 
of Energy. Fuel and energy use are based 
on direct measurement verified through 
purchase invoices for the vast majority  
of our sites and collected centrally for 
the entire Group. 
Environmental Protection 
We remain committed to protecting the 
environment and reducing the impact  
of our business through best practice. 
Large manufacturing sites across  
the Group continue to operate within 
the emission levels set by the UK 
Environment Agency and their current 
permit conditions. All sites operate 
within the framework of a full 
Environmental Management System.
All employees across the Group are 
actively encouraged to reduce waste 
and improve energy efficiencies and we 
carefully monitor waste and recycling 
across the businesses. We have a strict 
Group Environmental Policy which is 
managed by the Group’s Environmental 
Committee. Waste and energy 
consumption targets are set for each 
business across the Group annually.
During the year ended 2 September  
2017 the amount of waste disposed  
to landfill across the Group reduced  
by 9.1% and the amount of waste 
recycled increased by 39.6%. We were 
able to reduce overall water consumption 
across the Group by 10.9%. The Group 
will continue to monitor these statistics 
and set targets for improvement as part 
of its commitment to reducing its 
environmental impact.
COMMUNITY
We take an active role in supporting  
the communities in which we operate. 
During 2017, that support has taken  
a variety of forms including charitable 
monetary donations, fundraising and 
voluntary work. 
Carrs Billington continues to be part of 
Zeus Packaging Group’s global initiative 
to support children’s charities in Ireland, 
the UK, Spain, Portugal, New Zealand 
and Australia. This has seen Carrs 
Billington be provided with the exclusive 
distribution rights of Zeus Purple Silage 
wrap and Purple Netwrap in the UK to 
support WellChild, the national charity 
for sick children.
In addition to the proceeds raised by 
Carrs Billington, we launched another 
competition in 2017 to support WellChild 
which required farmers to create eye-
catching displays from their purple  
hay bales customised with accessories. 
Farmers taking part submitted photos  
of their creations, which were then 
displayed on social media. 
The Group maintains its relationship with 
Carlisle Youth Zone, which continues  
to serve the social, recreational and 
emotional needs of young people in the 
Carlisle area.
In 2017 we participated in the Dream 
Placement Programme, developed by 
the Centre for Leadership Performance, 
designed to give young people industry 
experience and an insight into the work 
of senior management and leaders of 
leading Cumbrian businesses.

CHAIRMAN
CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
The Group’s governance framework  
is designed to safeguard its long-term 
success for the benefit of shareholders 
and other stakeholders. It continues  
to evolve as the Group develops and 
promotes transparency, respect and 
accountability. It ensures that the Board 
can operate in a culture of openness 
which, coupled with its wealth of 
expertise and the collaborative attitude 
which permeates the Group, optimises 
its effectiveness. 
The Board is pleased to describe its 
approach to governance in the following 
report, which describes how the Group 
has integrated the main principles  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the “Code”). 
During the year, the Board reviewed  
its membership of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees in the light 
of comments received from certain 
shareholders. As a result, I stood down 
from both Committees which are now 
comprised exclusively of Non-Executive 
Directors that are considered by the 
Board to be independent. I am pleased 
to report that as a result the Board now 
considers that it is in full compliance 
with the Code.
CHRIS HOLMES DL 
Chairman 
22 November 2017
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE 
WITH UK CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE CODE
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
dated April 2016 and issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council sets out 
standards of good practice in relation  
to issues such as:
• Board composition and effectiveness;
• the role of Board committees;
• risk management;
• remuneration; and
• relationships with shareholders.
We are required to state how we have 
applied the principles contained in the 
Code and explain any areas where 
compliance has not been possible during 
the year. The Board considers that the 
Company has, during the year ended  
2 September 2017, complied with the 
requirements of the Code save 
paragraphs C.3.1 and D.2.1 (as is more 
particularly described below) which  
had not been fully complied with whilst  
Chris Holmes remained a member of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
THE BOARD
The Directors have a collective duty  
to promote the long term success  
of the Company for its shareholders.  
In determining long-term strategy and 
objectives of the Group, the Board is 
mindful of its duties and responsibilities 
to shareholders as well as employees 
and other stakeholders. The Board 
reviews management and financial 
performance, and monitors strategic 
delivery and achievement of  
business objectives.
The Board’s time can be grouped  
into six key areas as outlined below.  
A portion of the Board’s time is also 
spent on administrative matters.
Good governance  
is central to the integrity, 
reputation and 
performance of Carr’s.  
The Board remains 
committed to maintaining  
high standards.

The powers of the Directors are set out 
in the Company’s Articles of Association. 
The Directors are aware of their legal 
obligations and responsibilities that must 
be considered when exercising those 
powers, including those arising under 
the Companies Act 2006.
During the year ended 2 September 
2017, the Board comprised of two 
Executive Directors, a Non-Executive 
Chairman, and three Non-Executive 
Directors. There is a Company Secretary 
to the Board. The biographies of the 
Board can be found on page 21.
The Board met 12 times throughout the 
year. In addition to regular scheduled 
meetings, unscheduled supplementary 
meetings may also take place as and 
when necessary. During this financial 
year there was one unscheduled 
meeting in relation to the acquisition of 
NuVision Engineering, Inc. Directors who 
are unable to attend a particular meeting 
receive relevant briefing papers and  
are given the opportunity to discuss any 
issues with the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive or the Group Finance Director. 
To enable the Directors of the Board  
to carry out their responsibilities,  
all Directors have full and timely access  
to all relevant information. The Board 
maintains a schedule of matters reserved 
for the Board which is reviewed against 
best practice. A summary of those matters 
is set out below and a full schedule  
is available on the Company’s website. 
The Board is responsible for:
• the Group’s strategy;
• acquisitions and divestment policy;
• corporate governance, risk and 
environment policy and management;
• approval of budgets;
• general treasury policy;
• major capital expenditure projects;
• dividend policy; and
• monitoring the Group’s profit and  
cash flow performance.
The Board has delegated its authority  
to the Audit, Remuneration, and 
Nominations Committees to carry out 
certain tasks as defined in their written 
terms of reference approved by the 
Board; these are also available on the 
Company’s website. 
The Code stipulates that there should  
be a clear division of responsibility 
between Board governance and 
executive management.
The Chairman is responsible for:
• setting the Board agenda;
• the leadership of the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness on all 
aspects of its role;
• providing strategic insight from his 
long business experience in the 
industry and with the Company; and 
• providing a sounding board for the 
Chief Executive on key business 
decisions and challenging proposals 
where appropriate.
The Chief Executive is responsible for:
• the day-to-day management of the 
Group’s business;
• leading the business and the rest of 
the management team in accordance 
with the strategy agreed by the Board; 
• leading the development of the 
Group’s strategy with input from the 
rest of the Board; 
• leading the management team  
in the implementation of the Group’s 
strategy; and
• bringing matters of particular 
significance to the Chairman for 
discussion and consideration by  
the Board if appropriate.
Elections
The Company’s Articles of Association 
provide that one third of the Directors 
retire by rotation each year at the  
Annual General Meeting, however,  
the Company considers it best practice  
to require all the Directors to retire and 
stand for re-election annually. 
Attendance and Agenda
In advance of all Board meetings the 
Directors are supplied with detailed  
and comprehensive papers covering  
the Group’s strategy, performance and 
operations. Members of the executive 
management teams of businesses within 
the Group attend from time to time  
and make presentations. The Company 
Secretary is responsible to the Board for 
the timeliness and quality of information.
Details of the number of meetings of, 
and members’ attendance at, the Board, 
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees during the period are set 
out in the table at the foot of this page.
Support 
Directors can obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense in performance of their duties 
as Directors. None of the Directors 
obtained independent professional 
advice in the period under review.  
All Directors have access to the advice 
and the services of the Company 
Secretary. In addition to these formal 
roles, the Non-Executive Directors have 
access to senior management across  
the Group either by telephone or via 
involvement at informal meetings.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS  
OF INTEREST
The Companies Act 2006 and the 
Company’s Articles of Association 
require the Board to consider any 
potential conflicts of interest.  
The Board has a policy and procedures 
for managing and, where appropriate, 
authorising actual or potential conflicts 
of interest. Under those procedures, 
Directors are required to declare all 
directorships or other appointments  
to organisations that are not part of the 
Group and which could result in actual 
or potential conflicts of interest, as well 
as other situations which could result  
in a potential conflict of interest.

The Board is required to review 
Directors’ actual or potential conflicts  
of interest at least annually. Directors  
are required to disclose proposed new 
appointments to the Chairman before 
taking them on, to ensure that any 
potential conflicts of interest can be 
identified and addressed appropriately. 
Any potential conflicts of interest  
in relation to proposed directorships are 
considered by the Board prior to their 
appointment. In this financial year  
there have been no declared conflicts  
of interest.
BOARD EVALUATION 
During 2017 the Board conducted an 
independent review facilitated by 
Independent Audit Limited which built 
upon the internal review conducted 
during 2016 and the previous external 
review in 2013. The review covered the 
whole Board together with its Audit, 
Nominations and Remuneration 
Committees which were each 
considered separately. Particular focus 
was given to the effectiveness and 
appropriateness of the composition  
of the Board and of the Committees. 
Scrutiny was also applied to the  
question of the independence of  
Non-Executive Directors. 
The review commenced with discussions 
between Independent Audit and the 
Chairman and Company Secretary. 
Those discussions led to the design  
of detailed and bespoke questionnaires 
which were subsequently disseminated 
to the Board, certain other senior 
executives and, in the case of the 
evaluation of the Audit Committee,  
the Company’s auditors (PwC).  
The questionnaires were completed, 
entirely in confidence, and a draft report 
was produced by Independent Audit 
analysing the feedback provided. 
Following further discussions between 
Independent Audit and the Chairman 
and Company Secretary, a full report 
was produced and presented to the 
Board by Independent Audit.
The report drew positive conclusions 
including that the Board and its 
Committees were performing effectively 
and are appropriately constituted.  
It went on to make recommendations 
for further continued improvements 
including the planning of agendas to 
include further business-specific reviews 
and increasing the focus on succession 
planning and people issues more 
generally. The Board noted that 
improvements continue to be made  
to the Group’s governance framework  
and that matters highlighted in the 2013 
and 2016 reviews had been addressed. 
The Board will continue to make 
improvements where necessary and 
appropriate to ensure that governance 
arrangements remain effective as the 
Group continues to develop. An internal 
review will take place during the current 
financial year.
The report also confirmed the Board’s 
views in relation to Non-Executive 
Director independence. This was given 
greater focus due to the tenure of Alistair 
Wannop being in excess of nine years. 
The report did not highlight any issues or 
concerns in relation to the independence 
of any Directors and confirmed the 
Board’s view that independence cannot 
be determined solely by reference to the 
tenure of any Director, particularly in the 
absence of any other circumstances  
or matters (including those detailed  
at paragraph B.1.1. of the Code) which 
could give rise to independence being 
questioned. The Board noted that Alistair 
Wannop had no material business 
relationships with the Company, does 
not hold a significant shareholding  
or represent any shareholder, does not 
have any family connections with the 
Company, and has not served the 
Company in any capacity other than  
as a Non-Executive Director. The Board 
was entirely satisfied that Alistair 
Wannop continued to exercise the  
level of objectivity and challenge that 
would be expected of an independent 
Non-Executive Director and that his 
knowledge of the Group and the markets 
in which it operates was of enormous 
benefit to the Board. The Board  
is accordingly satisfied that Alistair 
Wannop, Ian Wood and John Worby 
remain independent. The question of 
Non-Executive Director independence  
is a matter which is kept under review 
and assessed annually by the Board. 
The Chairman evaluated the 
performance of the Directors through 
informal discussions and observations. 
The Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and the other Non-Executive 
Directors have met, without the 
Chairman present, to appraise  
his performance.
Overall the Board considered the 
performance of each Director to be 
effective and concluded that the Board 
and its Committees provide effective 
leadership and that appropriate 
governance and controls are in place. 
The Board will continue to review its 
procedures, effectiveness and 
development in the future.
BOARD COMMITTEES
As is detailed below, changes were 
made during 2017 to the composition  
of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees to ensure compliance  
with the Code. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s key function  
is to review the effectiveness of the 
Company’s financial reporting and 
performance of the external auditor.
The Audit Committee comprises three 
Non-Executive Directors: John Worby 
(Chairman), Ian Wood and Alistair 
Wannop. During the year the Committee 
also included Chris Holmes who  
ceased to be a member owing to the 
requirement under the Code that the 
Committee is comprised solely of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board considers that the Committee 
meets the requirements of the Code  
and is appropriate for a company its size. 
In particular, the three members bring 
financial, agricultural and engineering 
experience to the Committee together 
with a good understanding of the 
businesses within the Group and the 
risks that they face. The work, 
responsibilities and governance of the 
Audit Committee are set out on pages 
30-32. The Chairman of the Audit 
Committee will be available at the AGM 
to answer any shareholder questions on 
the Committee and its activities.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee 
comprises three Non-Executive 
Directors: Ian Wood (Chairman), John 
Worby and Alistair Wannop. During the 
year the Committee also included Chris 
Holmes who ceased to be a member 
owing to the requirement under the 
Code that the Committee is comprised 
solely of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Alistair Wannop held the 
position of Chairman until September 
2017 when Ian Wood took over having 
served on the Committee for in excess 
of one year. The work, responsibilities 
and governance of the Remuneration 
Committee are set out on pages 33-43.  
The Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee will be available at the AGM 
to answer any shareholder questions  
on the Committee and its activities.
Nominations Committee
During the year the Nominations 
Committee comprised of Chris Holmes 
(Chairman), Alistair Wannop, John Worby 
and Ian Wood. The work, responsibilities 
and governance of the Nominations 
Committee are set out on pages 44-45.  
 
Corporate Governance Report continued Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The Chair of the Nominations 
Committee will be available at the AGM 
to answer any shareholder questions  
on the Committee and its activities.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board recognises and values the 
importance of good communications 
with all shareholders. The Group 
maintains dialogue with substantial  
and institutional shareholders and 
analysts, and hosts presentations  
on the preliminary and interim results. 
Shareholders have access to the 
Company’s website at  
www.carrsgroup.com and its  
investor website at  
investors.carrsgroup.com.
We engage with our shareholders 
through regular communications. 
Significant matters relating to trading  
or development of the business are 
disseminated to the market by way  
of Stock Exchange announcements.  
We announce our financial results on  
a six monthly basis with all shareholders 
provided with our half year statement,  
and we produce trading updates  
during the year. All reports and updates 
are made available on the Company’s 
investor website.
The Annual General Meeting (AGM)
provides all shareholders with the 
opportunity to develop further their 
understanding of the Company.  
It is the principal forum for all the 
Directors to engage in dialogue with 
private investors. All shareholders are 
given the opportunity to raise questions 
on any matter at the meeting. The Group 
aims to send notices to shareholders  
at least 20 working days before the 
meeting, as required by the Code,  
and it is the Company’s practice to 
indicate the proxy voting results on all 
resolutions at the meetings. Following 
the AGM the voting results for each 
resolution are published and are 
available on the Company’s website.
FAIR, BALANCED AND 
UNDERSTANDABLE
The Directors have also reviewed the 
financial statements and taken as a 
whole consider them to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
INTERNAL CONTROL 
The Board of Directors has overall 
responsibility for the Group’s system  
of internal control and for reviewing  
its effectiveness, including: financial, 
operational and compliance controls  
and risk management, which safeguard 
the shareholders’ investment and the 
Group’s assets. Such systems can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss, being designed to manage  
rather than eliminate the risk of failure  
to achieve business objectives.
The Board of Directors is not aware of 
any significant losses caused by breaches 
of internal control in the year.
The Group operates within a clearly 
defined organisational structure with 
established responsibilities, authorities 
and reporting lines to the Board.  
The organisational structure has been 
designed in order to plan, execute, 
monitor and control the Group’s 
objectives effectively and to ensure that 
internal control becomes embedded in 
the operations. The Board confirms that 
the key on-going processes and features 
of the Group’s internal risk based control 
system, which accord with the Turnbull 
guidance, have been fully operative 
throughout the year and up to the date 
of the Annual Report being approved. 
These include: a process to identify and 
evaluate business risk; a strong control 
environment; an information and 
communication process; a monitoring 
system and a regular Board review  
for effectiveness. The Group Finance 
Director is responsible for overseeing  
the Group’s internal controls. 
The Group’s internal controls systems 
cover controls over the financial 
reporting process, including monthly 
reporting from subsidiaries, its associates 
and joint ventures. This reporting  
is subject to detailed review by the  
Chief Executive and the Group Finance 
Director and detailed validation by the 
Group finance team, and forms the  
basis for information presented to and 
reviewed by the Board. All monthly 
reporting is prepared in line with Group 
accounting policies, which are reviewed 
annually and are also subject to review 
by the external auditors.
The management of the Group’s 
businesses identified the key business 
risks within their operations, considered 
the financial implications and assessed 
the effectiveness of the control 
processes in place to mitigate these risks. 
The Board reviewed a summary of the 
findings and this, along with direct 
involvement in the strategies of the 
businesses, investment appraisal  
and budgeting process, enabled the 
Board to report on the effectiveness  
of internal control. A summary of the risk 
management framework and key risks to 
the business are set out on pages 14-16.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE
The Board considers that it complied 
with the Code throughout the year,  
with the exception of the following:
• C.3.1. requires the Board’s Audit 
Committee to be comprised of at least 
two Non-Executive Directors who  
are considered to be independent  
and provides that the Chairman may 
be a member if independent upon 
appointment. Until September 2017 
Chris Holmes was a member of the 
Audit Committee despite not meeting 
the independence criteria upon  
his appointment as Chairman.  
Such membership was previously 
considered appropriate given that  
two Non-Executive Directors were 
appointed during 2015. Chris Holmes 
is no longer a member of the  
Audit Committee which is now 
comprised solely of Non-Executive 
Directors considered by the Board  
to be independent.
• D.2.1. requires the Board’s 
Remuneration Committee to be 
comprised of at least two Non-
Executive Directors who are 
considered to be independent and 
provides that the Chairman may  
be a member if independent upon 
appointment. Until September 2017 
Chris Holmes was a member of the 
Remuneration Committee despite  
not meeting the independence criteria 
upon his appointment as Chairman. 
Such membership was previously 
considered appropriate given that  
two Non-Executive Directors were 
appointed during 2015. Chris Holmes 
is no longer a member of the 
Remuneration Committee which  
is now comprised solely of Non-
Executive Directors considered by the 
Board to be independent.

Audit Committee Report
JOHN WORBY
CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
INTRODUCTION 
On behalf of the Audit Committee,  
I am pleased to present this report  
to shareholders. The purpose of the 
report is to highlight the areas that the 
Committee has reviewed and how  
we have discharged our responsibilities 
effectively during the year.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The key responsibility of the Committee 
is to provide effective governance over 
the appropriateness of the Company’s 
financial reporting. 
Under its terms of reference, the 
Committee is required, amongst other 
things, to:
• monitor the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Company including 
the appropriateness of the accounting 
policies adopted and whether the 
Annual Report was fair, balanced  
and understandable; 
• review, understand and evaluate  
the Company’s internal financial risk, 
and other internal controls and risk 
management systems; 
• appraise the Board on how the 
Company’s prospects are assessed; 
• oversee the relationship with 
the external auditors, making 
recommendations to the Board  
in relation to their appointment, 
remuneration and terms  
of engagement; 
• monitor and review the effectiveness 
of the external audit including the 
external auditors’ independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness and  
to approve the policy on the 
engagement of the external auditors 
to supply non-audit services; and
• keep under review the requirement for 
and extent of internal audit activities 
in the Company.
The terms of reference can be  
found on the Company’s website  
www.carrsgroup.com.
MEETINGS
The Audit Committee met three times 
during the year (see page 27), and has  
an agenda linked to the Group financial 
calendar. It invites the Chairman, the 
Chief Executive, the Group Finance 
Director, the Group Financial Controller 
and the external auditors to attend its 
meetings. The Committee met with the 
external auditors at the conclusion of the  
audit without the Executive Directors 
being present.
The Committee has met once since the 
end of the financial year to consider the 
results and the Annual Report for the 
year ended 2 September 2017.
In addition to its Chairman, the Audit 
Committee comprises Ian Wood  
and Alistair Wannop. Chris Holmes  
stood down as a member of the Audit 
Committee in 2017 as explained  
on page 28.
MAIN ACTIVITIES  
DURING THE YEAR
Set out below is a summary of the key 
areas considered by the Committee 
during the year and up to the date  
of this report.
FINANCIAL REPORTING 
During the year the Audit Committee 
reviewed reports and information 
provided by both the Group Finance 
Director and the external auditors  
in respect of the half year and annual 
financial report.
An important responsibility of the Audit 
Committee is to review and agree 
significant estimates and judgements 
made by management. To satisfy this 
responsibility, the Committee reviewed 
a written formal update from the Group 
Finance Director on such issues at the 
two meetings that reviewed the half 
year and year end results, as well as 
reports from the external auditors.  
The Committee carefully considered the 
content of these reports in evaluating 
the significant issues and areas of 
judgement across the Group.
We have placed  
significant focus on 
Engineering and 
on accounting for the 
recent acquisitions. Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
31
The key areas of judgement in the year 
were as follows:
• The assumptions adopted for  
the accounting valuation of our 
defined benefit pension scheme.  
The Committee concluded that the 
assumptions used were appropriate;
• Potential impairment of assets 
including goodwill particularly in 
relation to the UK Engineering 
businesses of Bendalls and Chirton, 
given the performances of these 
businesses in the year. The performance 
of Bendalls had been impacted by  
a significant contract delay and losses 
on certain other contracts however,  
in the light of the delayed contract 
coming back on stream, other 
contracts won in the year and 
improvements made to controls in the 
business, the Committee determined 
that no impairment was required.  
In relation to Chirton, the committee 
concurred with the need to impair  
the goodwill of £4.2m by £1.7m.  
In reaching this conclusion,  
the Committee was satisfied that  
the recovery in performance required 
to support the remaining goodwill 
was reasonably achievable;
• Provisioning policies in relation to 
accounts receivable, particularly in the 
Agriculture division. The Committee 
determined that the judgements 
made were appropriate to justify the 
provisions held at 2 September 2017;
• Provisioning policies in relation to 
contractual disputes. The Committee 
determined that the judgements  
made were appropriate to justify the 
provisions held at 2 September 2017;
• Accounting for long term contracts. 
The Committee reviewed 
performance on certain contracts  
in the UK Engineering business that 
were only part complete at the year 
end and agreed with management’s 
judgements; and
• The valuation of certain intangible 
assets and goodwill of STABER  
and NuVision following their 
acquisition in October 2016 
and August 2017 respectively.  
The Committee concluded the 
valuations were appropriate.
The Committee, further to the Board’s 
request, has reviewed the annual report 
and financial statements with the 
intention of providing advice to the 
Board on whether, as required by the 
Code, ‘the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy’.
To make this assessment, the Committee 
reviewed a report prepared by the Group 
Finance Director outlining the relevant 
key matters worthy of consideration.  
The Committee also considered and  
was satisfied that all the key events  
and issues which have been reported to 
the Board in the CEO’s monthly reports 
during the year, both good and bad, 
have been adequately referenced  
or reflected within the annual report.
The Committee has also reviewed the 
Group’s going concern and viability 
statement disclosures. It received  
a written report prepared by the Group 
Finance Director which enabled it to 
review the base assumptions and various 
sensitised scenarios throughout the 
forecast period. The Committee was 
comfortable with the disclosures made.
INTERNAL CONTROL  
AND RISK MANAGEMENT
During the year the Committee 
reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems.
Given the changing nature of the 
Group’s engineering activities,  
it commissioned a specific internal 
controls report on the UK Engineering 
business during the year. The report 
recommended some improvements  
in controls to support the greater level  
of complexity in the business, which are 
in the process of being implemented.
The Committee reported to the Board 
that it had reviewed and, subject  
to implementation of the improved 
controls in the UK Engineering business 
referred to in the previous paragraph, 
was satisfied with the effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal control and risk 
management systems. The Committee 
noted the significant progress made in 
implementing a more integrated risk and 
assurance framework and, in the light  
of this, has established a plan for further 
improvements in the oversight of the 
assurance activities in the year ahead.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
recommendations for the appointment, 
reappointment or removal of external 
auditors and for approval of  
their remuneration. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC)  
and its predecessor firms have been  
the Auditor for Carr’s Group plc since 
1909. The Audit Committee assesses 
annually the qualification, expertise  
and independence of the auditors and 
the effectiveness of the audit process.  
PwC’s current engagement partner  
is Bill MacLeod, and he has been in place 
since September 2013.
Following approval by shareholders  
to re-appoint PwC at last year’s AGM, 
the Audit Committee reviewed and 
approved the terms of engagement and 
remuneration of the external auditors.
The Committee is planning to carry out a 
tendering process during the year ahead 
with a view to appointing a new auditor 
for the 2019 year end following the 
conclusion of the five year term of the 
current audit partner. This will comply 
with EU/FRC rotation requirements.
AUDIT EFFECTIVENESS
The effectiveness of the external audit 
process is dependent on appropriate 
audit risk identification at the start of the 
audit cycle. PwC present their detailed 
audit plan to us each year identifying 
their assessment of these key risks.
Our assessment of the effectiveness  
and quality of the audit process and 
addressing these key risks is formed by, 
amongst other things, the reporting 
from the auditors and also seeking 
feedback from management on the 
audit process.
The Committee remain satisfied with 
PwC’s performance and is of the view 
that there is nothing of concern that 
would impact the effectiveness of the 
external audit process.

Audit Committee Report continued
AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
The Group meets its obligations for 
maintaining an appropriate relationship 
with the external auditors through  
the Audit Committee, whose terms  
of reference include an obligation to 
consider and keep under review the 
degree of work undertaken by the 
external auditor other than the statutory 
audit, to ensure such objectivity and 
independence is safeguarded.
In accordance with the Auditing 
Practices Board Ethical Standards, PwC 
has to implement rules and requirements 
which include that none of their 
employees working on our audit can 
hold any shares in Carr’s Group plc.  
PwC is also required to tell us about any  
significant facts and matters that may  
reasonably be thought to bear on their 
independence or on the objectivity  
of the lead partner and the audit team.  
The lead partner in the audit team must 
change every five years.
The Audit Committee reviewed and 
approved the non-audit services policy, 
the objective of which is to ensure that 
the provision of such services does not 
impair, or is not perceived to impair,  
the external auditors’ independence or 
objectivity. The policy imposes guidance 
on the areas of work that the external 
auditors may be asked to undertake and 
those assignments where the external 
auditors should not be involved. There is 
a further category of services for which  
a case-by-case decision is necessary. 
In order to ensure that the policy is 
effective and the level of non-audit  
fees is kept under review, major work  
to be awarded to the audit firm must  
be agreed in advance by the Audit 
Committee Chairman. For the 2017 
financial year end, the non-audit to  
audit services ratio was 0.05 : 1. Note 3  
on page 68 provides further detail  
on non-audit service fees.
Historically, PwC undertook tax 
compliance activities for the Group.  
In compliance with regulatory changes 
which took effect in 2016, PwC did not 
undertake any such activities during the 
financial year ended 2 September 2017 
as a result of which the Group appointed 
an alternative adviser. 
Taking into account our findings  
in relation to the effectiveness of the  
audit process and in relation to the 
independence of PwC, the Committee  
is satisfied that PwC continues to be 
independent, and free from any 
conflicting interest with the Group.  
As a result, the Committee has 
recommended to the Board that PwC  
be proposed for reappointment at the 
forthcoming AGM in January 2018. 
INTERNAL AUDIT
Consideration was given during the year 
to whether there should be an internal 
audit function within the Group. 
Following the acquisitions of NuVision 
and STABER it was determined by the 
Committee to be appropriate, given  
the increased diversity and geographic 
spread of the Group’s Engineering 
division, for an internal audit function  
to be established. This function will be 
established and begin to operate during 
the 2017/18 financial year.
OTHER ACTIVITIES 
The Committee also reviewed its terms 
of reference, its effectiveness, the 
Group’s policies on whistleblowing, 
business ethics and on the prevention  
of bribery and modern slavery.
As Chairman of the Committee, I will  
be available at the Annual General 
Meeting to respond to any shareholder 
questions that might be raised on the 
Committee’s activities.

Remuneration Committee Report
IAN WOOD
CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
ANNUAL STATEMENT  
FROM THE CHAIR OF THE 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
On behalf of the Remuneration 
Committee I am pleased to present  
my first report to shareholders following 
my appointment as the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman.
The Committee’s report is presented  
in the following sections:
1. This Annual Statement, which 
summarises the key decisions made  
by the Committee during the year  
and forms part of the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. 
2. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy, 
which sets out the Policy for the 
Executive Directors, Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy will be put  
to a binding shareholder vote at the 
forthcoming AGM.
3. Annual Report on Remuneration, 
which sets out how the Remuneration 
Policy has been applied in 2016/17,  
the remuneration received by Directors 
for the year and how the policy will be 
applied in 2017/18. The Annual Report 
on Remuneration will be subject to an 
advisory shareholder vote at the AGM.
Proposed policy changes
The current Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy was approved by shareholders  
at the January 2017 AGM, however,  
a number of shareholders voted against 
the policy or abstained. The Committee 
has been conscious of the level of 
support received at the last AGM and 
also feedback that has been received 
from shareholders in relation to the policy. 
Over the last year, the Committee has 
therefore spent time reviewing the policy 
against that feedback in conjunction 
with best practice and considering how 
this best fits with the Group. As result of 
this review the Committee has decided 
to make certain changes to the policy 
and put a revised Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy to a binding vote at the next AGM.  
The Committee is proposing to 
introduce the following key changes:
• Introduction of bonus deferral – the 
Committee recognises the importance 
of bonus deferral in strengthening  
the alignment of Executive Directors 
with shareholder interests. Therefore 
the Committee has introduced  
a requirement for Executive Directors 
to defer 25% of any bonus earned into 
shares for 2 years.
• 2-year post-vesting holding 
requirement – for Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) awards made in 
2018 and in subsequent years, a 2-year 
post-vesting holding period will apply 
to Executive Directors. 
•
 Introduction of malus and clawback 
provisions – the policy now includes 
malus and clawback provisions which 
will apply to both the annual bonuses 
and LTIP awards. 
• LTIP performance measures – the 
current remuneration policy only allows 
for earnings per share (EPS) as the sole 
measure for assessing performance. 
The new policy allows for one or more 
additional measures to be introduced 
in the future; the Committee 
recognises a second measure would 
provide a useful balance but wishes to 
spend time considering what is right 
for the Group. The Committee will 
consult with shareholders prior to the 
introduction of any new performance 
measure. Awards granted in 2018 will 
continue to be subject to stretching 
EPS targets.
Performance and remuneration  
in 2016/17
As described in the Strategic report,  
the Group’s financial performance in the 
year under review was disappointing. 
Whilst overall revenue increased to 
£346.2m (2016: £314.9m), reported  
profit before tax was down to £10.0m 
(2016: £14.1m) and adjusted Earnings  
Per Share was down to 8.9p (2016: 10.9p). 
Notwithstanding this financial 
performance, good progress was made 
towards achieving the Group’s strategic 
targets and in positioning the business 
well for future growth. Performance 
outcomes are reflected in the 
remuneration received by Executive 
Directors and despite the strategic 
progress made by the Group, no annual 
bonus awards were made to Executive 
Directors in relation to the financial  
year ended 2 September 2017.  
The performance period of the 2014  
LTIP awards ended during the year but, 
because average adjusted EPS growth 
was below the threshold set by the 
Committee upon granting the awards, 
no long-term awards vested to 
Executive Directors.
How the new policy will  
be implemented in 2017/18
The Remuneration Committee 
continually reviews the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy to ensure it 
promotes the attraction, retention and 
incentivisation of high calibre executives 
to deliver the Group’s strategy.
For 2017/18, the maximum annual bonus  
for the Executive Directors’ will remain 
100% of salary. 25% of any bonus will be 
deferred for two years. The Committee 
also intends to grant LTIP awards of 
100% of salary, which will be based upon 
stretching EPS targets. 
Salary increases were awarded to the 
Executive Directors effective 1 September 
2017 of 2.5%. This is consistent with the 
rest of the workforce.
I hope that you are able to support the 
proposed changes to the policy at the 
forthcoming AGM.

REMUNERATION POLICY
This part of the report sets out the 
Remuneration Policy for the Group and 
has been prepared in accordance with 
The Large and Medium sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013  
(as amended). The policy report will be 
put to shareholders for approval at the 
AGM of the Company to be held on 9 
January 2018 and, subject to approval, 
will take effect from that date.
The role of the Committee
The primary role of the Remuneration 
Committee is to make recommendations 
to the Board on the Company’s  
policy for executive remuneration.  
The Committee also has delegated 
responsibility for determining the 
remuneration and benefits of the 
Chairman, the Executive Directors  
and the Secretary. 
Key responsibilities include:
• determining the framework for  
the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and Chairman;
• determining the total remuneration 
packages, authorise terms and 
conditions, and issue contracts for  
the Board;
• approving the design and determine 
the targets for performance related 
pay schemes of the Executive Directors; 
• reviewing the ongoing 
appropriateness and relevance  
of the Remuneration Policy to ensure 
that is it aligned with the strategy  
of the Group;
• ensuring that the Group rewards  
fairly and responsibly, with clear links 
to both corporate and individual 
performance; and
• reviewing the design of any share 
incentive plans for approval by the 
Board and shareholders.
Overview of policy
When setting the policy for Directors’ 
remuneration, the Committee takes into 
account the overall business strategy, 
considering the long-term interests  
of the Group, with the aim of  
delivering rewards to shareholders.  
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy  
is ultimately designed to appropriately 
incentivise Executive Directors with  
a view to maximising shareholder value.
The Group’s policy is that the overall 
remuneration packages offered should 
be sufficiently competitive to attract, 
retain and motivate high quality 
executives and to align the rewards  
of the Executive Directors with the 
progress of the Group, whilst giving 
consideration to salary levels in similar 
size quoted companies in similar industry 
sectors and views of shareholders. 
The remuneration package is split into 
two parts:
• a non-performance related element 
represented by basic salary, benefit 
and pension; and
• a performance related element in the 
form of an annual bonus and a Long 
Term Incentive Plan.
KEY CHANGES TO THE POLICY
As outlined in the Committee 
Chairman’s statement, and subject to 
approval at the AGM, the following 
changes will apply:
• Introduction of bonus deferral. 
• 2-year post-vesting holding 
requirement for Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (“LTIP”) awards made in 2018  
and in subsequent years. 
• Introduction of malus and  
clawback provisions.
• Consideration of the future introduction 
of one or more additional LTIP 
performance measures following prior 
consultation with leading shareholders.
CONSIDERATIONS OF 
CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE  
IN THE GROUP
In determining the remuneration of the 
Group’s Directors, the Committee takes 
into account the pay arrangements  
and terms and conditions across the 
Group as a whole. The Committee  
seeks to ensure that the underlying 
principles which form the basis for 
decisions on Directors’ pay are consistent 
with those on which pay decisions  
for the rest of the workforce are taken. 
For example, the Committee takes into 
account the general salary increase for 
the broader employee population when 
conducting the salary review for the 
Executive Directors.
However, there are some differences  
in the Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy compared to that for the wider 
workforce, which the Committee 
believes are necessary to reflect the 
differing levels of seniority and 
responsibility. A greater weight is placed 
on performance-based pay through  
the quantum and participation levels  
in incentive schemes to ensure the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors 
is aligned with the performance of the 
Group and the interests of shareholders.
CONSIDERATION OF 
SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
In formulating this policy, the 
Committee has taken into account 
guidance issued by shareholders and 
proxy agencies. The Committee noted 
comments made by proxy agencies prior 
to last year’s AGM and that a number  
of shareholders voted against the 
Remuneration Policy or abstained. 
During the last year further discussions 
were held to understand these views. 
These views have been taken  
into account in the policy below.  
The Committee continues to welcome 
feedback from shareholders received  
at each AGM and any feedback received 
throughout the year.

will normally align 
with the general 
increase for the 
broader employee 
population  
of the Group.  
More significant 
increases may be

to recognise,  
for example, 
development  
in role and change 
in position  
or responsibility.
Current salary

package. 
Executive Directors are entitled to participate in a defined 
contribution pension arrangement or to receive a cash 
alternative to those contributions.
Company contributions are up to 15% of base salary.  
To the extent that pension contributions exceed annual  
tax-free allowances, Executive Directors will be entitled

Annual bonus Designed to 
reward delivery 
of key strategic 
priorities during 
the year.
Bonus levels and appropriateness of performance measures 
and weighting are reviewed annually to ensure they continue 
to support our strategy. Bonuses are capped at 100%  
of base salary. 25% of any bonus earned will be deferred  
into awards over shares, with awards normally vesting after  
a two-year period. 
Performance is measured against stretching targets. These may 
include financial and non-financial measures. Financial 
measures will account for the majority and will typically include 
a profit related target. Performance targets will be disclosed 
retrospectively. The threshold level of bonus under each 
measure is 0%.
The cash element of the bonus is usually paid in November 
each year for performance in the previous financial year.
Dividends will accrue on deferral awards over the vesting 
period and be paid out either as cash or as shares on vesting 
and in respect of the number of shares that have vested.
A malus and clawback mechanism applies in specific 
circumstances including in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s accounts and also for other 
defined reasons. These provisions apply to both the cash  
and deferred elements of the bonus.
Maximum of 100%

Award levels and performance conditions required for vesting 
are reviewed annually to ensure they continue to support the 
Group’s strategy. Awards are capped at the equivalent of 100% 
of base salary at the date of award.
Awards up to and including the 2017 award are based solely 
upon an EPS measure. Awards from 2018 onwards will be based 
on an EPS measure and may also include one or more additional 
measures of performance. The Committee will consult with 
leading shareholders before introducing any new measures.
25% vests at threshold performance. There is straight line 
vesting between threshold and maximum. 
Two year post-vesting holding period applies to the net of tax 
shares for awards granted in 2018 and beyond. 
A malus and clawback mechanism applies in specific

REMUNERATION  
COMMITTEE DISCRETIONS
The Committee will operate the annual 
bonus plan and LTIP according to their 
respective rules. To ensure the efficient 
operation and administration of these 
plans, the Committee retains discretion 
in relation to a number of areas.  
This is consistent with market practice 
and these include (but are not limited to) 
the following:
• the participants; 
• the timing of grant and/or payment; 
• the size of grants and/or payments 
(within the limits set out in the  
Policy table); 
• the determination of vesting based  
on the assessment of performance;
• the determination of a “good leaver” 
and where relevant the extent  
of vesting in the case of the share-
based plans; 
• treatment in exceptional 
circumstances such as a change  
of control;
• making the appropriate adjustments 
required in certain circumstances  
(e.g. rights issues, corporate 
restructuring events, variation  
of capital and special dividends); 
• cash settling awards; and 
• the annual review of performance 
measures, weightings and setting 
targets for the discretionary incentive 
plans from year to year. 
The Committee also retains the ability  
to adjust existing performance 
conditions for exceptional events so that 
they can still fulfil their original purpose. 
Any varied performance condition would 
not be materially less difficult to satisfy 
in the circumstances.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES  
AND TARGETS
Our Group strategy and business 
objectives are the primary consideration 
when we are selecting performance 
measures for incentive plans. The annual 
bonus is based on performance against  
a stretching combination of financial and 
non-financial measures. Profit before tax 
reflects the Group’s strategic objective 
to increase profit. In addition, Executive 
Directors are assessed on strategic 
objectives as agreed by the Committee 
at the beginning of the year. The LTIP  
is currently assessed against growth  
in adjusted Earnings Per Share as it 
rewards improvement in the Group’s 
underlying financial performance and is 
a measure of the Group’s overall financial 
success and is visible to shareholders. 
Targets within incentive plans that are 
related to internal financial measures, 
such as profit, are typically determined 
based on our budgets. The threshold 
and maximum levels of performance  
are set to reflect minimum acceptable 
levels at threshold and very stretching 
but achievable levels at maximum.  
At the end of each performance period 
we review performance against the 
targets, using judgement to account  
for items such as changes in accounting 
treatment, foreign exchange rate 
movements and significant one-off 
transactions. The application of 
judgement is important to ensure that 
final assessments of performance are  
fair and appropriate. In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee reviews the 
bonus and incentive plan results before 
any payments are made to Executive 
Directors or any shares vest and has full 
discretion to adjust the final payment  
or vesting downwards if they believe  
the circumstances warrant it.

APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT 
REMUNERATION
The remuneration package for a new 
Executive Director would be set in 
accordance with the terms of the 
Company’s approved Remuneration 
Policy in force at the time of appointment.
Buy-out awards
In addition, the Committee may offer 
additional cash and/or share-based 
elements (on a one-time basis or 
ongoing) when it considers these  
to be in the best interests of the  
Group (and therefore shareholders).  
Any such payments would be limited  
to a reasonable estimate of value  
of remuneration lost when leaving the 
former employer and would reflect the 
delivery mechanism (i.e. cash and/or 
share-based), time horizons and whether 
performance requirements are attached 
to that remuneration. 
Maximum level of variable pay
The maximum initial level of long-term 
incentives which may be awarded to a 
new Executive Director will be limited to 
the maximum Long Term Incentive Plan 
limit of 100% of base salary. Therefore 
the maximum initial level of overall 
variable pay that may be offered will be 
200% of base salary (i.e. 100% annual 
bonus plus 100% Long Term Incentive 
Plan). These limits are in addition to the 
value of any buy-out arrangements 
which are governed by the policy above.
In the case of an internal appointment, 
any variable pay element awarded  
in respect of the prior role would be 
allowed to pay out according to its 
terms, adjusted as relevant to take into 
account the appointment. In addition, any 
other previously awarded entitlements 
would continue, and be disclosed in the 
next annual report on remuneration.
Base salary and relocation expenses
The Committee has the flexibility to set 
the salary of a new appointment at  
a discount to the market level initially, 
with a series of planned increases 
implemented over the following few 
years to bring the salary to the 
appropriate market position, subject  
to individual performance in the role.
For external and internal appointments, 
the Committee may agree that the 
Group will meet certain relocation 
expenses as appropriate.
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
For the appointment of a new Chairman 
or Non-Executive Director, the fee 
arrangement would be set in accordance 
with the approved remuneration policy 
in force at that time. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’  
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT  
AND LOSS OF OFFICE 
The Group’s current policy is not to enter 
into employment contracts with any 
element of notice period in excess  
of one year. All Non-Executives are 
appointed for terms of 12 months and 
will stand for re-election annually at the 
Company’s AGM. Copies of Executive 
Directors’ service contracts and  
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office 
during normal hours of business and  
will be available at the Company’s AGM.
Dates of service contracts and first 
appointment to the Board for all 
Directors are given in the table below.
An Executive Director’s service contract 
may be terminated summarily without 
notice and without any further payment 
or compensation, except for sums 
accrued up to the date of termination,  
if they are deemed to be guilty of gross 
misconduct or for any other material 
breach of the obligations under their 
employment contract. 
The Group has the right to terminate 
contracts by making a payment in lieu  
of notice. Any such payment will 
typically reflect the individual’s salary, 
benefits and pension entitlements.  
The Group has the ability to mitigate 
costs and phase payments, if alternative 
employment is obtained.
There will be no automatic entitlement 
to a bonus if an Executive Director has 
ceased employment or is under notice. 
However, the Committee may at its 
discretion pay a pro-rated bonus in 
respect of the proportion of the financial 
year worked. Such payment could  
be payable in cash and not subject  
to deferral.
Any share-based entitlements granted 
to an Executive Director under the 
Group’s share plans will be treated in 
accordance with the relevant plan rules. 
Usually, any outstanding awards lapse 
on cessation of employment. However, 
in certain prescribed circumstances, such 
as death, ill-health, injury, disability, 
redundancy, retirement with the consent 
of the Committee, or any other 
circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee, “good leaver” status may be 
applied. 
For good leavers under the LTIP, 
outstanding awards will vest at the 
original vesting date to the extent that 
the performance condition has been 
satisfied and be reduced on a pro-rata 
basis to reflect the period of time which 
has elapsed between the grant date and 
the date on which the participant ceases 
to be employed by the Group. For good 
leavers under the deferred bonus plan, 
unvested awards will usually vest in full 
upon cessation. 
In determining whether a departing 
Executive Director should be treated as  
a “good leaver”, the Committee will take 
into account the performance of the 
individual and Group over the whole 
period of employment and the reasons 
for the individual’s departure.
In the event of a change of control 
resulting in termination of office, the 
Executive Directors are entitled to 12 
months’ base salary. 
The Non-Executive Directors are not 
entitled to any compensation for loss  
of office.

ANNUAL REPORT  
ON REMUNERATION
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report sets out a summary of how the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy was 
applied during 2016/17.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee 
comprises Ian Wood (Chairman),  
John Worby and Alistair Wannop. 
Chris Holmes stood down as a member 
of the Remuneration Committee in 2017 
to ensure that it is comprised solely  
of Non-Executive Directors considered 
by the Board to be independent  
in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016. As is further 
explained on page 28, Ian Wood took 
over from Alistair Wannop as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee in 2017. 
The Committee met on 3 occasions 
during the year with all members in 
attendance (see page 27).
The Executive Directors and the 
Chairman may attend meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee by invitation 
and in an advisory capacity only.  
No person attends any part of a meeting 
at which his or her own remuneration  
is discussed. The Chairman and the 
Executive Directors determine the 
remuneration of the other Non-
Executive Directors. The Chair of the 
Committee will be available at the AGM 
to answer any shareholder questions on 
the Committee and its activities.
During the year the Committee 
considered:
• levels of basic pay for Executive 
Directors, the Chairman and  
senior management;
• the outcome of bonus arrangements 
for Executive Directors and  
senior management;
• the award of long term incentives  
for Executive Directors and  
senior management; 
• overall remuneration of Executive 
Directors; and
• shareholder feedback in relation to 
prior bonus arrangements, long term 
incentives and remuneration policy.
2017 Remuneration  
In this section we summarise the pay 
packages awarded to our Executive 
Directors for performance in the 2017 
financial year versus 2016. The table  
at the top of the next page shows  
all remuneration that was earned by 
each individual during the year and 
includes a single total remuneration 
figure for the year. 
2017 ANNUAL BONUS PAYOUT
The annual bonus uses a combination  
of financial and strategic performance 
targets which are set with regard to 
Group budget, historic performance, 
market outlook and future strategy. 
50% of the bonus was based on  
Group adjusted profit before tax (PBT).  
The remainder of the financial targets 
were based upon the adjusted PBT 
generated by the two Group divisions 
excluding joint ventures and associates. 
Adjusted PBT is calculated as reported 
PBT after adding back or deducting 
amortisation and non-recurring items 
outside of normal trading that were  
not anticipated at the time targets were 
set, such as acquisition related costs.  
The Group is committed to disclosing  
its performance targets retrospectively 
save where this is prevented due  
to commercial sensitivities. For the year 
ended 2017, PBT targets were set  
in accordance with the table below.

The tables below provide estimates of the potential future remuneration of each 
Executive Director based on the remuneration opportunity granted in the 2018 
financial year. Potential outcomes based on different scenarios are provided for 
each Executive Director.
The assumptions underlying each scenario are described below.
Fixed Consists of base salary, pension and other benefits.
Base salaries are as at 1 September 2017.
Benefits are valued using the figures in the total remuneration  
for the 2017 financial year table, adjusted for any benefits that will  
not be provided during 2018. 
Pensions are valued by applying the appropriate percentage to the 
base salary.

If the Group overall generated adjusted 
PBT of £14.9m then, regardless of 
individual divisional performance, then 
the maximum bonus would be payable. 
Upon the minimum bonus thresholds 
being met, annual bonus payments are 
calculated in accordance with the table 
below. Payments are adjusted on a 
straight line basis between the threshold 
and maximum PBT targets.

Strategic targets, which account for  
20% of the bonus, were set at the  
start of the year. Details of the targets 
and their performance against them  
is summarised in the table on the 
previous page.
In addition to those strategic 
performance indicators, the Committee 
has a discretion to consider matters such  
as good corporate governance which 
can include environmental, social and 
governance considerations. 
At the end of the financial year,  
the Committee noted that significant 
progress had been made against the 
strategic targets. However, despite that 
progress, and following discussions with 
the Executive Directors, a decision was 
made not to pay any bonus in relation  
to this element of the scheme owing to 
the disappointing financial performance 
of the Group.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
The awards made to Executive Directors 
in 2014 were subject to Average EPS 
growth targets over a three year period 
ended on 2 September 2017. Threshold 
vesting was set at 3% average annual 
growth. The Average EPS growth over 
the three year period was less than  
3% and, accordingly, no shares under the 
long-term awards made to Executive 
Directors in 2014 vested.

Annual consultations take place across 
the Group between the Executive 
Directors, senior management and  
the Group Head of HR in relation to 
employee pay. The outcome of that 
exercise, and any changes to employee 
pay levels, are considered when 
determining the appropriateness  
to changes in Executive Director pay.

EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Executive Directors did not receive 
any remuneration in respect of any 
external appointments in 2016/17.
IMPLEMENTATION  
OF THE POLICY IN 2017/18
For 2017/18, the maximum annual bonus 
for the Executive Directors’ will remain 
100% of salary. 25% of any bonus will  
be deferred for two years in the form  
of shares. Performance will be assessed 
against stretching targets which will  
be 80% financial and 20% strategic. 
Financial targets will be based upon 
adjusted PBT for the Group only and will 
not have any divisional splits. All annual 
bonus targets will vest at thresholds of 
0%. Targets will be disclosed respectively 
in next year’s report.
The Committee intends to grant LTIP 
awards of 100% of salary, with future 
vesting conditional upon stretching 
targets based upon an adjusted EPS 
growth measure (the base for adjusted 
EPS will be fixed at a level which reflects 
changes within the Group including 
acquisitions). Awards will vest at a 
threshold of 25% for average growth of 
3% per annum and will rise on a straight 
line basis to the maximum 100%  
for average growth of 10% per annum 
during the performance period.  
The Committee is currently considering 
the introduction of an additional 
measure for awards to be made during 
2019 however it wishes to spend time 
carefully assessing which measure would 
be most appropriate for the business. 
The Committee will seek to consult  
with leading shareholders prior to the 
introduction of any additional 
performance measure.
Salary increases were awarded to the 
Executive Directors effective 1 September 
2017 of 2.5%. This is consistent with the 
rest of the workforce.
EXTERNAL ADVISORS
Following the review of our remuneration 
structures by the Committee, an external 
advisor was appointed to provide an 
external perspective. New Bridge Street 
(part of Aon plc) was appointed to 
advise the Committee; however, due to 
the timing of their appointment no fees 
were incurred in FY 2016/17. New Bridge 
Street is a signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Code of Conduct, which 
requires that its advice be objective and 
impartial. New Bridge Street has no 
other connection with the Group and 
provides no other services to the Group.
2017 AGM
The 2016 remuneration report received  
a 68.5% vote in favour (19,600,000 votes), 
with 18.3% against (5,240,335 votes)  
and 13.2% withheld (3,763,395 votes).  
The 2016 remuneration policy received  
a 64.5% vote in favour (18,455,190 votes), 
with 21.7% against (6,201,259 votes) and 
13.8% withheld (3,946,281 votes).
In light of the shareholder response to 
the 2016 remuneration report, contact 
was made with certain of the Company’s 
major shareholders and shareholder 
reporting bodies with a view to discuss 
any concerns. The Remuneration 
Committee considered the feedback 
received at length during 2017. 
As can be seen from the new Policy,  
a number of changes have been made to 
Remuneration Policy which are designed 
to address the comments offered by 
shareholders and proxy agencies in 
response to the 2016 Report. The Board 
welcomes shareholder feedback and 
believes that the changes proposed  
to the Policy and additional disclosures 
now made in the Annual Remuneration 
report address those comments.

Nominations Committee Report
CHRIS HOLMES
CHAIR OF THE NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
This year the Committee has been  
active in developing strategies for the 
succession of both Board members and 
senior management across the Group.
COMPOSITION  
AND CONSTITUTION
The Nominations Committee comprises 
the Chairman of the Company and all  
of the Non-Executive Directors. 
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee meets at least once  
a year. It reviews the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and considers 
the optimal level of independence, 
diversity of skills, knowledge and 
experience required for the Board to 
operate effectively. It oversees Board 
succession planning and is responsible 
for considering and making 
recommendations on the appointment of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee also evaluates 
succession planning and recruitment 
strategy for senior management 
throughout the Group, taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities 
facing the Group and the skills, 
experience and leadership required 
across its diverse range of businesses. 
In performing its responsibilities the 
Committee gives full consideration  
to the benefits of diversity (whether 
cultural, ethnic, gender or otherwise) 
both within the Board and across the 
Group’s leadership teams. Working 
closely with the Board, the Committee  
is focused upon ensuring that the Board 
and the management teams are able  
to deliver Group strategy.
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee met once during the 
year to consider the following matters:
• the Committee’s Terms  
of Reference to ensure they reflect  
the Committee’s remit;
• the succession plans in place for the 
Board and senior management across 
the Group; and
• the structure, size, composition and 
diversity of the Board, its Committees 
and senior management across  
the Group.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD  
AND ITS COMMITTEES
There have been no changes in the 
membership of the Board during  
the year which remains comprised  
of two Executive Directors and four 
Non-Executive Directors. 
In November 2016 Matthew Ratcliffe 
was appointed to the position  
of Company Secretary following  
the departure of Katie Wood.
As is explained in more detail in the 
Corporate Governance Report  
on pages 26-29, during the year the 
Company received feedback from 
certain shareholders which resulted  
in changes being made to the 
composition of the Board’s Audit  
and Remuneration Committees. 
Those changes, which were announced 
in September 2017, were as follows: 
• Ian Wood took over as Chairman  
of the Remuneration Committee 
having served as a member since 
October 2015.
• I ceased to be a member of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees which 
would thereafter be comprised solely 
of Non-Executive Directors considered 
by the Board to be independent.
EXTERNAL REVIEW
During the year, the size, composition 
and effectiveness of the Board and its 
Committees were the subject of an 
external review facilitated by corporate 
governance specialists, Independent 
Audit Limited. That review, which 
generated positive feedback, confirmed 
that the Board and its Committees were 
appropriately constituted and provided 
effective management of the Group  
as a whole. The review also involved  
a consideration of the continued 
independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors and the commitment  
required from each in order to properly 
fulfil their duties. 
Following the review, and in 
consideration of all circumstances,  
it was determined by the Board that  
all Directors committed sufficient time  
to properly fulfil their responsibilities  
and that John Worby, Ian Wood and 
Alistair Wannop were considered to be 
independent. As such, there are no 
current plans to change the make-up  
of the Board. For more information 
concerning the external review,

SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Group’s succession strategy was 
developed in 2014. Efforts have since 
focused upon ensuring that appropriate 
and sufficient employees are recruited or 
developed internally to meet the future 
management needs of the Group taking 
into account continued growth and 
overall Group strategy. 
In 2017 we appointed a Divisional 
Managing Director for Engineering who 
will oversee the Engineering Division 
globally and provide specialist industry 
and strategic support to the Board. 
Across the Group we have established 
career pathway and employee 
development initiatives which are 
designed to attract, retain and develop 
the best talent. Further details of those 
initiatives are described on page 23.
DIVERSITY 
The Group has a strict equal 
opportunities policy and ensures  
that appropriate consideration  
is given to diversity in determining  
the requirements of the business and  
in making recruitment decisions.  
The Group’s principal concern when 
making appointments is ensuring that 
candidates possess the skills, knowledge 
and experience, or the potential to 
develop the required skills, knowledge 
and experience, to meet the requirements 
of the Group. All appointments are made 
on the basis of merit regardless of race, 
colour, nationality, religion, gender, 
marital status, family status, sexual 
orientation, disability or age. 
RE-ELECTION
At the Annual General Meeting on  
9 January 2018, all the Directors will 
stand for re-election in accordance with 
best practice under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016.
The Board will set out in the Notice  
of Annual General Meeting its reasons 
for supporting the re-election of the 
Directors at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. Their biographical 
details on page 21 demonstrate the 
range of experience and skills which 
each brings to the benefit of the Group.
The Chair of the Nominations 
Committee will attend the Annual 
General Meeting to respond to any 
shareholder questions that might be 
raised on the Committee’s activities.

Subject to approval at the Annual

be paid on 12 January 2018 to members 
on the register at the close of business 
on 15 December 2017. Shares will be 
ex-dividend on 14 December 2017.
The Group profit from continuing 
activities before taxation was £10.0 
million (2016: £14.1 million). After taxation 
charge of £1.7 million (2016: £2.9 million), 
the profit for the year is £8.3 million 
(2016: £11.2 million).  
PENSIONS
Estimates of the amount and timing  
of future funding obligations for the 
Group’s pension plans are based on 
various assumptions including, among 
other things, the actual and projected 
market performance of the pension  
plan assets, future long-term corporate 
bond yields, longevity of members and 
statutory requirements. 
The Group continually reviews this risk 
and takes action to mitigate where 
possible. In addition, while the Group  
is consulted by the trustees on the 
investment strategies of its pension 
plans, the Group has no direct control 
over these matters as the trustees are 
directly responsible for the strategy.
Details of the Group’s pension plans  
are in note 26 in the Notes to the 
Financial Statements.
EMPLOYMENT POLICIES  
AND EMPLOYEES
The Company is committed to its 
employees and further details on the 
Company’s policies and commitment 
can be found in the Corporate 
Responsibility Report on page 23.
ENVIRONMENT
The Company’s report on sustainability 
including carbon footprint and energy

POLITICAL AND  
CHARITABLE DONATIONS
During the period ended 2 September 
2017 the Group contributed £26,300  
(2016: £32,175) in the UK for charitable 
purposes. Further details have  
been included with the Corporate 
Responsibility statement on page 25. 
There were no political donations during 
the year (2016: £Nil).
SHARE CAPITAL
The Company has a single class of share 
capital which is divided into Ordinary 
Shares of £0.025 each. The movement  
in the share capital during the  
year is detailed in note 27 to the  
financial statements.
At the last Annual General Meeting  
the Directors received authority from  
the shareholders to:
Allot Shares – this gives Directors the 
authority to allot shares and maintains 
the flexibility in respect of the 
Company’s financing arrangements.  
The nominal value of ordinary shares 
which the Directors may allot in the 
period up to the next Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 9 January 2018,  
is limited to £752,393.93 which  
is equal to 33 percent of the nominal 
value of the issued share capital on  
14 November 2016.  
The Directors submit their report and  
the audited accounts of the Company  
for the year ended 2 September 2017
The Company is a public limited company incorporated  
and domiciled in England and Wales whose shares are listed  
and traded on the London Stock Exchange. The address  
of its registered office is Old Croft, Stanwix, Carlisle CA3 9BA. Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

The Directors do not have any present 
intention of exercising this authority 
other than in connection with the  
issue of ordinary shares in respect  
of the Company’s share option plans. 
This authority will expire at the end  
of the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 9 January 2018.
Disapplication of rights of pre-emption 
– this disapplies rights of pre-emption 
on the allotment of shares by the 
Company and the sale by the Company 
of treasury shares. The authority will 
allow the Directors to allot equity 
securities for cash pursuant to the 
authority to allot shares mentioned 
above, and to sell treasury shares  
for cash without a pre-emptive offer  
to existing shareholders, up to  
an aggregate nominal amount of 
£114,221.60, representing 5 percent  
of the Company’s issued share capital as 
at 14 November 2016. This authority will 
expire at the end of the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 9 January 2018.
To buy own shares – this authority 
allows the Company to buy its own 
shares in the market, as permitted  
under the Articles of Association of the 
Company, up to a limit of 9,137,729 
Ordinary Shares being 10 per cent of the 
Company’s issued share capital at 14 
November 2016. The price to be paid for 
any share must not be less than 0.25p, 
being the nominal value of a share,  
and must not exceed 105 percent  
of the average middle market quotations 
for the Ordinary Shares of the Company  
as derived from the London Stock 
Exchange Daily Official List for the  
5 business days immediately preceding 
the day on which the Ordinary Shares  
are purchased. The Directors have no 
immediate plans to exercise the powers 
of the Company to purchase its own 
shares and undertaken that the authority 
would only be exercised if the Directors 
were satisfied that a purchase would 
result in an increase in expected 
earnings per share and was in the best 
interests of the Company at the time. 
This authority will expire at the end of 
the Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 9 January 2018. The Directors would 
consider holding any of its own shares 
that it purchases pursuant to this 
authority as treasury shares.
The interests of the Directors, as defined 
by the Companies Act 2006, in the 
Ordinary Shares of the Company, other 
than in respect of options to acquire 
Ordinary Shares (which are detailed  
in the analysis of options included  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 33-43), are as follows:
All the above interests are beneficial. 
There have been no other changes to 
the above interests in the period from  
2 September 2017 to 13 November 2017.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and  
the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREPARING 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Company law requires the Directors  
to prepare financial statements for each 
financial period. Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare  
the Group and parent Company  
financial statements in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit  
or loss of the Group for that period.  
In preparing those financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements  
on the going concern basis, unless it  
is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and  
of the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements and 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
Company website.  
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the  
annual report and accounts, taken  
as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess a company’s performance, 
business model and strategy. 
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT AS TO 
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  
TO AUDITORS
The Directors who were members of the 
Board at the time of approving the 
Directors’ Report are listed on page 21. 
Having made enquiries of fellow 
Directors, each of the Directors at the 
date of this report confirms that:
• he is aware there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and 
• he has taken all the steps that he 
ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
Each of the Directors, whose names and 
functions are listed on page 21 confirm 
that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU,  
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group; 
• the Chief Executive’s Review includes  
a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Group; and
• the Risk management review provides  
a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that the Company faces.

Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of Carr’s Group plc 
OPINION
In our opinion, Carr’s Group plc’s  
Group financial statements and 
Company financial statements  
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the Company’s 
affairs as at 2 September 2017 and  
of the Group’s profit and the Group’s 
and the Company’s cash flows for  
the 52 week period (the “period”)  
then ended;
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union and, as regards 
the Company’s financial statements, 
as applied in accordance with  
the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements,  
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, 
included within the Annual Report, which 
comprise: the Consolidated and Company 
balance sheets as at 2 September 2017; 
the Consolidated income statement and 
Consolidated and Company statements 
of comprehensive income, the 
Consolidated and Company statement 
of cash flows, and the Consolidated  
and Company statements of changes  
in equity for the 52 week period then 
ended; the accounting policies; and the 
notes to the financial statements.
Our opinion is consistent with our 
reporting to the Audit Committee.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK)  
are further described in the Auditors’ 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our 
report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the  
Group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the 
UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and  
belief, we declare that non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the 
Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in note 3  
to the financial statements, we have 
provided no non-audit services  
to the Group or the Company in the 
period from 4 September 2016 to  
2 September 2017.
Report on the audit of the  
financial statements
OUR AUDIT APPROACH
 
 
 
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: £565,000 (2016: £845,000), based on 5% of profit before tax 
before amortisation and non-recurring items.
• Overall Company materiality: £400,000 (2016: £435,000), based on 0.5% of total assets.
• We identified five reporting units within the Agriculture and Engineering divisions 
alongside the Company, which in our view required an audit of their complete financial 
information. Three of these reporting units were deemed financially significant and the 
other three were selected for particular risk characteristics, which included coverage of the 
risks relating to pension assumptions, fraud in revenue, and of the profit from the associate.
• Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were performed on a further 
reporting unit in the UK, in order to gain coverage of individual material financial statement 
line items.
• Goodwill impairment in Chirton Engineering.
• Defined benefit pension scheme surplus.
• Acquisition accounting.
• Receivables provisioning.
• Assumptions made within contract accounting.
• Fraud risk in revenue recognition.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit,  
we determined materiality and assessed 
the risks of material misstatement  
in the financial statements. In particular,  
we looked at where the Directors made 
subjective judgements, for example  
in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain.  
As in all of our audits we also addressed 
the risk of management override  
of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias  
by the Directors that represented a risk 
of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, 
in the auditors’ professional judgement, 
were of most significance in the audit  
of the financial statements of the current 
period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identified 
by the auditors, including those which 
had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources 
in the audit; and directing the efforts  
of the engagement team. These matters, 
and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were 
addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole,  
and in forming our opinion thereon,  
and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identified by our audit. 
KEY AUDIT MATTER
HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED  
THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  
IN CHIRTON ENGINEERING
The Group has a material goodwill balance in respect  
of the acquisition in 2014 of Chirton Engineering.  
The downturn in the oil and gas market has adversely 
affected the expected performance of this business  
giving rise to an increase risk of impairment.
The Directors’ assessment of the ‘value in use’ of the  
Cash Generating Unit involved judgements about the 
future results of the business and the discount rates 
applied to future cash flow forecasts.
We reviewed the composition of future cash flows  
to ensure that all relevant elements were included or 
excluded as appropriate. We compared current year actual 
results with the FY17 figures included in the prior year 
forecast to assess the accuracy of management’s historic 
forecasts. We challenged management’s assumptions 
within the forecasts for short and mid-term growth by 
comparing to the previous performance of the business 
and understanding and validating the measures 
implemented by management to achieve this growth.
We considered the suitability of the discount rate by 
assessing the cost of capital for the Company and 
comparable businesses. We assessed the sensitivity 
analysis performed by management and determined that 
the calculations were most sensitive to the assumptions 
regarding profits in the terminal period. We reviewed the 
adequacy of the disclosures given in note 11 in respect  
of the impairment assessment performed by management.
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEME SURPLUS
The Group has a defined pension scheme with post-
retirement assets of £75.1m and post-retirement liabilities 
of £69.9m. The valuation of the Group surplus is sensitive  
to changes in key assumptions such as the discount rate, 
inflation and mortality estimates. 
The setting of these assumptions is complex and an area  
of judgement. Changes in any of these assumptions could 
lead to a material movement in the net surplus.
We tested the membership census data used in the 
valuation of the scheme to payroll information.  
We benchmarked and performed sensitivity analysis  
on key variables in the valuation model including salary 
increases, mortality rates, inflation and discount rates.
We obtained third party confirmation over ownership and 
valuation of pension scheme assets. We ensured that the 
Company is entitled to recognise any surplus by examining 
the Trust Deed and Rules documentation.
ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING
The Group has made two significant acquisitions during 
the financial year. On purchase of STABER and NuVision  
the assets of the companies purchased were recognised  
at their fair values. 
The fair values recognised involve judgement from 
management over the existence of any intangible assets, 
and the inputs into the models that support these 
valuations, including future projections of the businesses 
performance, and the discount rates used.
We reviewed the valuations papers produced by 
management for each acquisition in conjunction with our 
valuation specialists. 
We considered the suitability of the models used by 
management to adjust the assets purchased to their fair 
values, and have corroborated the inputs to these models. 
As part of this work we also considered the suitability of 
the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the 
Company and comparable businesses. We challenged 
management’s assumptions within the forecasts for short 
and mid-term growth by comparing to the previous 
performance of the business and understanding and 
validating the measures implemented by management  
to achieve this growth.
We challenged the completeness of the assessment of any 
intangible assets acquired as part of the business combination.

Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements
KEY AUDIT MATTER
HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED  
THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
RECEIVABLES PROVISIONING
Within the Agriculture division there are material  
amounts of trade receivables that are past due and  
there has historically been a slower collection pattern 
within this division. 
Management’s provisions in respect of these amounts are 
an area of subjectivity with respect to the recoverability  
of balances. 
We understood management’s receivables provisioning 
policy and tested the accuracy of the aging of balances in 
order to recalculate management’s provision. We analysed 
the provision to identify significant balances for which the 
methodology had not been applied and understood and 
validated any such exceptions.
We performed testing over the operating effectiveness  
of controls with respect to approval of credit limits and 
monthly reviews of the receivables ledger. For individually 
significant aged receivables balances, we understood  
the rationale for management’s provision by considering 
historic payment patterns and other supporting 
information. We tested the levels of cash received after the 
year end on overdue receivables balances to assess the 
adequacy of the provision made.
ASSUMPTIONS MADE WITHIN CONTRACT 
ACCOUNTING
Within Carr’s Engineering Limited there have been  
a number of contracts in the year on which performance 
has been worse than expected.
This increases the risk that the assumptions made  
by management in respect of costs forecast to complete 
contracts are not accurate.
We focused on the judgements required to account for 
long term contracts. This involved a detailed review of 
contracts in place at the year end in order to understand 
the nature of the services provided. As part of this review 
we conducted an assessment of the costs to completion 
on the contract, and an evaluation of the stage of completion 
of the contract based on the evidence available. 
We discussed each contract with members of 
management outside of the finance function to 
understand how forecasts of cost to come have been built 
up, and the accuracy of these forecasts.
We also evaluated management’s assessment of the stage 
of completion through performing a look back test to 
assess management’s previous estimations as well as on a 
sample basis agreeing the inputs into the calculation of the 
revenue to supporting documentation and reperforming 
the calculation.
From the work we performed no material exceptions  
were noted.
FRAUD RISK IN REVENUE RECOGNITION
ISAs (UK) presume there is a risk of fraud in revenue 
recognition. We have determined this to apply specifically 
to the occurrence of revenue in all divisions because of the 
pressure management may feel to achieve the planned 
results. Within the Agriculture division this is specifically  
in relation to whether a sale has occurred, and within the 
Engineering division this is in relation to the judgements 
involved in long term contract accounting.
For the Agriculture division this involved testing the 
operating effectiveness of controls around dispatches and 
invoicing in certain components, as well as substantively 
testing that revenue agrees to accounts receivable and 
cash received. Where revenue did not directly agree  
to accounts receivable or cash further work was performed  
to understand and substantively test those transactions. 
In addition to the work described above specifically in 
relation to long term contracts we performed additional 
procedures in the Engineering division to substantively test 
that revenue agreed to accounts receivable and cash 
received. Where revenue did not directly agree to accounts 
receivable or cash further work was performed to 
understand and substantively test those transactions.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the Company, with the exception of the defined benefit 
pension scheme surplus as described above, to communicate in our report. Carr’s Group plc

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to 
ensure that we performed enough work 
to be able to give an opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole, taking 
into account the structure of the Group 
and the Company, the accounting 
processes and controls, and the industry 
in which they operate.
The Group is split into two principal 
divisions, Agriculture and Engineering. 
Within these divisions there are  
a number of UK subsidiary companies. 
There are also a number of overseas 
subsidiary companies, in the US and 
Germany, which report separately to 
these divisions. Group management are 
based in the UK, along with the Group 
finance function. 
Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) 
Limited and Carrs Agriculture Limited, 
which form part of the UK Agriculture 
division, have been selected as full  
scope audit components as a result  
of their contribution to Group profits. 
Wälischmiller, a German subsidiary 
which operates within the engineering 
market, has also been selected as a full 
scope component for this reason.  
Carr’s Group plc has been selected  
as a full scope component due to its 
significant net assets balance, and the 
fact that the Group pension scheme  
is recognised within its accounts, which 
is a key audit matter as noted above. 
Carr’s Engineering Limited has also  
been selected as a full scope component 
due to the greater judgement involved 
in determining its contribution to Group 
revenue, which is a significant risk for  
our audit.
Carrs Billington Agriculture (Operations) 
Limited, an associate which the Group 
owns 49% of, has been selected for full 
scope reporting. Mitchell Charlesworth, 
a component auditor, undertake  
the audit of this component.  
Carrs Properties Limited has been 
selected for limited scope reporting over 
fixed assets, as a result of its contribution 
to this financial statement line item.
We have held planning calls with the 
component auditors for both Carrs 
Billington Agriculture (Operations) 
Limited and Wälischmiller, to understand 
their planned audit approach and  
ensure that it provides the comfort  
we require as part of our Group audit. 
We have been involved in the clearance 
meeting between management  
and the component auditors for both 
components, and have carried out  
a review of the working papers which 
support the reporting provided.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced 
by our application of materiality.  
We set certain quantitative thresholds 
for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us  
to determine the scope of our audit  
and the nature, timing and extent  
of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and 
disclosures and in evaluating the effect 
of misstatements, both individually and 
in aggregate on the financial statements 
as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, 
we determined materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole as follows:
For each component in the scope of our 
Group audit, we allocated a materiality 
that is less than our overall Group 
materiality. The range of materiality 
allocated across components was 
between £200,000 and £800,000. 
Certain components were audited to a 
local statutory audit materiality that was 
also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee 
that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during  
our audit above £28,250 (Group audit) 
(2016: £42,250) and £20,000  
(Company audit) (2016: £22,000) as well 
as misstatements below those amounts 
that, in our view, warranted reporting  
for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report 
as follows:
 Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall 
materiality
£565,000 (2016: £845,000). £400,000 (2016: £435,000).
How we 
determined it
5% of profit before tax  
before amortisation and  
non-recurring items.
0.5% of total assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
Based on the benchmarks 
used in the annual report, 
profit before tax before 
amortisation and  
non-recurring items is the 
primary measure used by the 
shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the Group, 
and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark.
The Company is a holding 
company, and as such we believe 
total assets is the primary 
measure used to assess the 
performance of the entity,  
and is a generally accepted 
auditing benchmark.
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything 
material to add or draw attention to in respect 
of the Directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the Directors 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing  
the financial statements and the Directors’ 
identification of any material uncertainties  
to the Group’s and the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern over a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval 
of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all 
future events or conditions can 
be predicted, this statement is 
not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ 
statement relating to Going Concern  
in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3)  
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.

Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements
REPORTING ON  
OTHER INFORMATION 
The other information comprises all  
of the information in the Annual Report 
other than the financial statements  
and our auditors’ report thereon.  
The Directors are responsible for the 
other information. Our opinion on the 
financial statements does not cover  
the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion  
or, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any form  
of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the 
financial statements, our responsibility  
is to read the other information and,  
in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit,  
or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify an apparent 
material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required  
to perform procedures to conclude 
whether there is a material misstatement 
of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. 
If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there  
is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report 
that fact. We have nothing to report 
based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report  
and Directors’ Report, we also 
considered whether the disclosures 
required by the UK Companies Act 2006 
have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described 
above and our work undertaken in the 
course of the audit, the Companies Act 
2006, (CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) require us also to report certain 
opinions and matters as described 
below (required by ISAs (UK) unless 
otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the period ended 2 September 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course  
of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency  
or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on pages 14-16 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency  
or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 17 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities  
as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group.  
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ 
process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the Directors, on page 29, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the 
Group and Company obtained in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 30-32 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. (CA06) Carr’s Group plc

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
AND THE AUDIT
Responsibilities of the Directors  
for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, the Directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements in accordance with 
the applicable framework and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. The Directors are also responsible 
for such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, 
the Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless  
the Directors either intend to liquidate 
the Group or the Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit  
of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ 
report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level  
of assurance, but is not a guarantee  
that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect  
a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud  
or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate,  
they could reasonably be expected  
to influence the economic decisions  
of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
A further description of our 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the 
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions,  
has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16  
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no 
other purpose.  
We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person  
to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent  
in writing.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Companies Act 2006  
exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006  
we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• we have not received all the 
information and explanations  
we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited  
by us; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are  
not made; or
• the Company financial statements  
and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited 
are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising 
from this responsibility. 
Appointment
Following the recommendation  
of the audit committee, we have been 
appointed as auditors since at least  
1909 to audit the financial statements  
for the year ended 31 March 1909 and 
subsequent financial periods. The period 
of total uninterrupted engagement  
is 109 years, covering the years ended  
31 March 1909 to 2 September 2017.

The equity compensation reserve reflects the cumulative accounting impact, at the balance sheet date, of the fair value of the share schemes over the 
vesting periods. The movement on the equity compensation reserve is taken through the consolidated income statement. During the year £766,000 
(2016: £264,000) was transferred from the equity compensation reserve to retained earnings in respect of options exercised in the year and £nil  
(2016: £57,000) was also transferred on the disposal of Carr’s Flour Mills Ltd.
The Group has opted to use previous revaluations of property made under UK GAAP as deemed cost. On adoption of IFRS the revaluation reserve  
was reclassified to other reserves.
In the prior year £642,000 was transferred from other reserves to retained earnings in respect of previous revaluations of property owned  
by Carr’s Flour Mills Ltd, a subsidiary undertaking which was sold during the prior year.
In the prior year an adjustment of £104,000 was made to remove balances in respect of dormant subsidiaries dissolved in the prior year from  
non-controlling interests. Carr’s Group plc

The equity compensation reserve reflects the cumulative accounting impact, at the balance sheet date, of the fair value of the share schemes over 
the vesting periods. The movement on the equity compensation reserve is taken through the income statement where it relates to employees of the 
Company and to investment in subsidiaries where it relates to employees of the subsidiaries. During the year £618,000 (2016: £7,000) was transferred 
from the equity compensation reserve to retained earnings and £201,000 (2016: £321,000) was transferred from the equity compensation reserve  
to investment in subsidiaries in respect of options exercised in the year.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2 SEPTEMBER 2017 Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The consolidated and Company financial statements are prepared on a 
going concern basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) and International Financial Reporting Standards 
Interpretation Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations endorsed by the 
European Union (EU) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled 
in England and Wales whose shares are listed and traded on the London 
Stock Exchange. The address of its registered office is Old Croft, Stanwix, 
Carlisle CA3 9BA.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts  
of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Although these 
estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, 
event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ materially from  
the estimates.
Accounting policies have been applied consistently, other than where 
new policies have been adopted.
The consolidated and Company financial statements are prepared under 
the historic cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial 
assets and financial liabilities (including derivative financial instruments)  
at fair value through profit or loss.
The accounting policies for the Group and Company are as follows:
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements comprise Carr’s Group plc 
and all its subsidiaries, together with the Group’s share of the results 
of its associates and joint ventures. The financial information of the 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is prepared as of the same 
reporting date and consolidated using consistent accounting policies. 
Group inter-company balances and transactions, including any 
unrealised profits arising from Group inter-company transactions, are 
eliminated in full. Profits and losses on transactions with the associates 
and joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the 
current and prior financial year were included in the financial statements 
from the effective date of control or up to the date of cessation of 
control. The separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of the 
acquired subsidiary undertakings were incorporated into the financial 
statements on the basis of the fair value as at the effective date of the 
Group acquiring control.
IFRS 10 introduced a new definition of control which could affect 
whether an entity is consolidated into the Group accounts. An investor 
controls an investee when it is exposed, or has right, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee. Control requires power over 
the investee, exposure, or rights, to variable returns and the ability to use 
power to affect returns.
Subsidiaries are entities that meet the new definition of control. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control  
is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which  
the Group ceases to control them. 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence 
but not control, generally accompanied by a share of between 20% 
and 50% of the voting rights. Joint ventures are entities over which 
the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. 
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using  
the equity method. The Group’s share of its associates’ and joint 
ventures’ post-tax profits or losses are recognised in the income 
statement, and its share of movement in reserves is recognised in 
reserves. The cumulative movements are adjusted against the carrying 
amount of the investment. The Group’s investment in associates 
and joint ventures includes any goodwill arising on acquisition. If the 
Group’s share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds 
its investment in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not 
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. 
All subsidiaries are accounted for by applying the purchase method.  
The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate  
of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group.  
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree 
are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective  
of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of  
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value  
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised 
as goodwill.
Acquisition related costs are expensed to the consolidated income 
statement in the year they are incurred.
The Group applies a policy of treating transactions with non-controlling 
interests as transactions with parties external to the Group.
EMPLOYEE SHARE TRUST
IFRS 10 requires that the Group consolidate a structured entity where 
the substance of the relationship between the parties indicates that 
the Group controls the entity. The employee share trust sponsored by 
the Group falls within this category of structured entity and has been 
accounted for as if it were, in substance, a subsidiary.
CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial statements for the Group’s subsidiaries, associates and joint 
ventures are prepared using their functional currency. The functional 
currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which an entity operates. The presentation currency of the Group and 
Company is Sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency 
using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions 
and from the translation, at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date, of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies  
other than the functional currency are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
The balance sheets of foreign operations are translated into sterling 
using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income 
statements are translated into sterling using the average exchange  
rate for the year. Where this average is not a reasonable approximation 
of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, 
the exchange rate on the transaction date is used. Exchange differences 
arising are recognised as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. 
On disposal of a foreign operation any cumulative exchange differences 
held in shareholders’ equity are transferred to the consolidated  
income statement. Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from the sale of goods or services is measured at the fair value 
of the consideration, net of rebates and excluding value added tax. 
Revenue from the sale of goods or services is recognised when the 
Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
the goods to the buyer, when the amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated 
with the transaction will flow to the Group. Inter segmental transactions 
are on an arm’s length basis. 
In respect of construction contracts, revenue is calculated on the basis  
of the stage of completion and the total sales value of each contract.
The stage of completion is determined as the proportion that contract 
costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the total estimated 
total contract costs. No profit is recognised until a contract is at least  
30% complete. Amounts invoiced for work completed are deducted 
from the selling price, while amounts invoiced in excess of work 
completed are recognised as current liabilities.
Where it is probable that contract costs will exceed total contract 
revenue the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense  
in the consolidated income statement.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT ASSET/OBLIGATIONS
The Group offers various pension schemes to employees  
including a defined benefit pension scheme and several defined 
contribution schemes.
The assets of the Group’s pension schemes are held separately  
from those of the Group and are invested with independent  
investment managers.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the 
consolidated income statement in the year to which they relate.
Carr’s Group Pension Scheme
The asset recognised in the consolidated and Company balance sheet at 
the year end is the fair value of scheme assets at the balance sheet date 
less the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Independent 
actuaries calculate the defined benefit asset annually using the projected 
unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation 
is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using 
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated  
in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms  
to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The service costs, including pension scheme administrative costs,  
are included in operating profit in the consolidated income statement.
A credit is made within interest which represents a net interest amount 
that is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the 
year to the net defined benefit asset at the beginning of the year.  
The net interest amount also takes into account changes to the net  
asset during the year. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the consolidated and 
Company statement of comprehensive income. The pension scheme 
deficit or surplus, to the extent that they are considered recoverable,  
are recognised in full on the consolidated balance sheet.
IFRIC 14 confirms that where a company has an unconditional right to a 
refund of surplus from a defined benefit pension plan during the lifetime 
of that plan or when it winds it up, and where there is expected to be 
surplus assets, there is no limit on the asset the Company can show 
on its balance sheet. At 2 September 2017 and 3 September 2016 the 
consolidated and Company balance sheet recognises the full surplus  
on the Carr’s Group defined benefit pension scheme.
Carrs Billington Agriculture Pension Scheme
One of the Group’s subsidiaries is a participating employer in the Carrs 
Billington Agriculture Pension Scheme, which is a multi-employer defined 
benefit pension scheme. Note 26 provides further information on this 
scheme and how it has been accounted for in the consolidated accounts.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured  
at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a valuation model. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimate of the  
number of options that are expected to vest. Changes to the fair value 
recognised as a result of this are charged or credited to the consolidated 
income statement with a corresponding adjustment to the equity 
compensation reserve.
INTEREST
Interest is recognised in the consolidated income statement on an 
accruals basis using the effective interest method. 
BORROWING COSTS
General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for 
their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such 
time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement in the year in which they are incurred.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of 
internal financial information about components of the Group that  
are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’)  
to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. 
The CODM has been identified as the Executive Directors.
The CODM considers the business from a product/services perspective. 
Operating segments have been identified as Agriculture and Engineering.
NON-RECURRING ITEMS
Non-recurring items that are material by size and/or by nature are 
presented within their relevant income statement category, but 
highlighted separately on the face of the income statement. Items that 
management consider fall into this category are also disclosed within  
a note to the financial statements. The separate disclosure of profit 
before non-recurring items helps provide a better indication of the 
Group’s underlying business performance. Events which may give rise to 
non-recurring items include, but are not limited to, gains or losses on the 
disposal of subsidiaries/businesses, derivative gains or losses in respect 
of capital expenditure, gains or losses on the disposal of properties, 
gains or losses on the disposal of material investments, the restructuring 
of businesses, the integration of new businesses, acquisition related 
costs, contingent consideration linked to continued employment of key 
personnel and asset impairments including impairment of goodwill.  Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements
GOODWILL
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the 
excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit  
or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest 
level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value 
less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an 
expense and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 31 August 1998 
has not been reinstated and would not form part of the gain or loss  
on the disposal of a business.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation commences when 
assets are available for use. The expected useful lives, over which the 
assets are amortised, are generally as follows:
Customer relationships 1 – 5 years
Brands 15 – 20 years or infinite life
Know-how 5 years
Proprietary technology 13 years
Development costs 5 – 15 years
Patents and trademarks contractual life
Contract backlog 3 years
Software 3 – 10 years
Customer relationships and brands are amortised in line with the profit 
and income streams they are respectively expected to generate over 
their expected useful life.
Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination  
is the fair value at the acquisition date. The cost of separately acquired 
intangible assets comprises the purchase price and any directly 
attributable costs of preparing the assets for use.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
All research costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement 
as incurred. Development costs are recognised as an asset only to the 
extent that specific recognition criteria, as set out in IAS38 ‘Intangible 
assets’, relevant to the proposed application are met and the amount 
recognised is recoverable through future economic benefits.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises 
purchase price and directly attributable costs. 
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not 
depreciated. For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation  
is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate cost less residual values  
of the assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings up to 50 years
Leasehold buildings shorter of 50 years or lease term
Plant and equipment 3 to 20 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted  
if appropriate, at each financial year-end.
Assets not fully constructed at the balance sheet date are classified  
as assets in the course of construction. When construction is complete 
these assets are reclassified to the appropriate heading within property, 
plant and equipment. Depreciation commences when the asset  
is ready for use.
The cost of maintenance, repairs and minor equipment is charged 
to the consolidated income statement as incurred; the cost of major 
renovations and improvements is capitalised.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the 
proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within the 
consolidated income statement.
INVESTMENT PROPERTY
Investment properties are properties held for long-term rental yields. 
Investment properties are carried in the balance sheet at cost less 
accumulated depreciation. Freehold land is not depreciated. For all other 
investment property, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to 
allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their estimated useful 
lives as follows:
Freehold buildings  up to 50 years
The cost of maintenance, repairs and minor equipment is charged 
to the consolidated income statement as incurred; the cost of major 
renovations and improvements is capitalised.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the 
proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within the 
consolidated income statement.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment where there are 
any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate potential 
impairment. In addition, at each reporting date, the Group assesses 
whether there is any indication that goodwill may be impaired.  
Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate 
of recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount the asset is written down to its recoverable 
amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use and is deemed for an individual asset. If the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash 
generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined. Discount rates 
reflecting the asset specific risks and the time value of money are used 
for the value in use calculation.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. Where appropriate, 
cost is calculated on a specific identification basis. Otherwise inventories 
are valued using the first-in first-out method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution. Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
64
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Provision has been made, where necessary, for slow moving, obsolete 
and defective inventories.
Contract work in progress is measured at the selling price of the work 
performed at the balance sheet date. The selling price is measured by 
reference to the stage of completion at the balance sheet date and total 
expected income from the contract work. 
Progress payments received are deducted from the value of work in 
progress except to the extent that payments on account exceed the 
value of work in progress on any contract where the excess is included  
in trade and other payables.
Directly attributable, and separately identifiable, costs of bidding for 
contracts are included in contract costs after the point in time at which  
it is considered probable that the contract will be obtained.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the consolidated and 
Company statement of cash flows comprise cash at bank and in hand, 
money market deposits and other short term highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. 
Bank overdrafts are presented in borrowings within current liabilities  
in the consolidated and Company balance sheet.
GRANTS
Grants received on capital expenditure are recorded as deferred income 
and taken to the consolidated income statement in equal annual 
instalments over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. 
Revenue grants and contributions are taken to the consolidated income 
statement in the year to which they apply.
LEASES
Leases are classified as finance leases at inception where substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group. 
Assets classified as finance leases are capitalised on the consolidated 
balance sheet and are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life  
of the asset and the term of the lease. The interest element of the rental 
obligations is charged to the consolidated income statement over the 
period of the lease using the actuarial method.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the consolidated 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Leasehold land is normally classified as an operating lease. Payments 
made to acquire leasehold land are included in prepayments at cost  
and are amortised over the life of the lease. Any incentives to enter  
into operating leases are recognised as a reduction of rental expense 
over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
TAX
The tax charge comprises current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax charge represents an estimate of the amounts payable  
to tax authorities in respect of the Group’s taxable profits.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated and Company financial 
statements. Deferred tax arising from initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the 
time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or 
loss, is not recognised. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and 
are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where 
the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, unless the  
tax relates to items recognised directly in shareholders’ equity, in which 
case the tax is recognised directly in shareholders’ equity through the 
consolidated and Company statement of comprehensive income.
DIVIDENDS
Final equity dividends to the shareholders of the Company are 
recognised in the year that they are approved by the shareholders. 
Interim equity dividends are recognised in the year that they are paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised in the period in which they  
are received.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the consolidated and 
Company balance sheet when the Group and Company becomes  
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables 
is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not 
be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that 
the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default 
or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade 
receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.  
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of  
a provision for impairment, and the amount of the loss is recognised  
in the consolidated income statement. The provision is utilised when  
a trade receivable is uncollectible.
Investments
Investments are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.  
Equity investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active 
market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured by other 
means are held at cost. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the 
substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest  
in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at fair value 
net of direct issue costs and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement  
or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an effective 
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument 
to the extent that they are not settled in the year in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Strategic Report / Corporate Governance / Financial Statements
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group primarily uses forward foreign currency contracts, options 
and currency swaps to manage its exposures to fluctuating foreign 
exchange rates. These instruments are initially recognised at fair value 
and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each balance 
sheet date. 
The Group’s policy is to hedge its international assets and it has 
designated foreign currency loans as a hedge against net investment in 
foreign operations. The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used 
to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined  
as an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity. The gain or loss  
on any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated income statement.

Amendments to ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ – clarifications

IFRS 17 ‘Insurance contracts’
It is considered that the above standards and amendments, with the 
exception of IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from 
contracts with customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, will not have a significant 
effect on the results or net assets of the Group or Company.
IFRS 9, “Financial instruments”, is effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and will therefore first apply to 
Carr’s in the year ending August 2019. IFRS 9 requires entities to provide 
for possible future credit losses on loans and receivables, including 
trade receivables, even if it is highly likely that the loan or receivable 
will be fully collectible. The standard introduces an “expected credit 
loss” model that focuses on the risk that a loan or receivable will default 
rather than whether a loss has been incurred. The Group’s Agriculture 
business in particular has material amounts of trade receivables past due 
and it is expected that IFRS 9 will impact the value of the provision for 
impairment of trade receivables. The assessment of the impact to the 
Group is ongoing.
IFRS 15, “Revenue from contracts with customers”, is effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and will 
therefore first apply to Carr’s in the year ending August 2019.  
The Group’s Agriculture business is not expected to be materially 
affected by this standard. The Group’s Engineering business, however, 
could be affected depending on the nature of contracts in place 
at implementation. The assessment of the impact is ongoing. If the 
performance of the contract does not create an asset with an alternative 
use and there is an enforceable right to payment for performance 
completed to date, then performance of the contract will continue  
to be recognised over time as it is currently.
IFRS 16, “Leases”, is effective for period beginning on or after 1 January 
2019, and will therefore first apply to Carr’s in the year ending August 
2020. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the accounting 
changes that will be required; in particular, leases currently treated as 
operating leases such as short term property leases, company cars  
and some IT equipment are likely to be recorded as an asset and  
a lease liability.
At the date of signing the financial statements the Directors are  
not yet in a sufficiently advanced stage of their reviews to be able  
to quantify any financial impact from these three standards.
SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS, KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES
Application of certain Group accounting policies requires management  
to make judgements, assumptions and estimates concerning the future  
as detailed below.
Valuation of pension obligations
The valuation of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is 
determined each year following advice from a qualified independent 
actuary and can fluctuate based on a number of external factors.  
Such factors include the major assumptions as shown in the table in note 
26 and actual returns on scheme assets compared to those predicted  
in the previous scheme valuation.
Impairment of goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill must be assessed for impairment 
annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill  
might be impaired. This requires an estimation of the value in use of 
the cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated. Value in use is 
dependent on estimations of future cash flows from the cash generating 
unit and the use of an appropriate discount rate to discount those cash 
flows to their present value.
An impairment has been identified in the year (note 11).
Provision for impairment of trade receivables
The financial statements include a provision for impairment of trade 
receivables (note 20) that is based on management’s estimation of 
recoverability. There is a risk that the provision will not match the trade 
receivables that ultimately prove to be irrecoverable.
Revenue recognition on construction contracts
Under long term contracts, the Group recognises revenue and 
profits based on the percentage completion method. This requires 
management to make an assessment of the overall profitability and  
the stage of completion of the entire contract in order to determine  
the level of revenue and profit to recognise. Carr’s Group plc

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 The Company has taken advantage of the exemption, under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, from presenting its own income statement.  
The profit after tax for the year dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £3,349,000 (2016: £26,362,000).
2 Segmental information
The chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) has been identified as the Executive Directors. Management has identified the operating  
segments based on internal financial information reviewed by the CODM. The CODM considers the business from a product/services perspective. 
Operating segments have been identified as Agriculture and Engineering. Operating segments have not been aggregated for the purpose  
of determining reportable segments.
Agriculture aims to provide for all farming requirements. It derives its revenue from the sale of animal feed and feed blocks together with retail sales  
of farm equipment, fuels and farm consumables.
Engineering derives its revenue from the provision of engineering services and the design and manufacture of bespoke equipment for use  
in the nuclear, oil and gas, and petrochemical industries. Products include manipulators, robotics, specialist fabrication and precision machining. 
Performance is assessed using operating profit. For internal purposes the CODM assesses operating profit before material non-recurring items 
consistent with the presentation in the financial statements.
Inter-segmental transactions are all undertaken on an arm’s length basis.
As segment liabilities are not reviewed by the CODM they are not required to be disclosed under IFRS 8.
The Group has operations in the UK and overseas. In accordance with IFRS 8, entity wide disclosures based on the geography of operations  
is also presented. The geographical analysis of revenue is presented by revenue origin.

The goodwill impairment of £1,700,000 is discussed further in note 11.
Business combination expenses of £1,349,000 relate to acquisition costs incurred in the year as well as contingent consideration in relation to the prior  
year acquisition of Phoenix Feeds Ltd which is explained further below.
Phoenix Feeds Ltd was acquired on 1 June 2016 for cash consideration of £1,744,000 including £490,000 of contingent consideration. The contingent  
consideration is linked to the continued employment of key personnel and therefore in accordance with IFRS 3 this was not recognised as consideration  
in the acquisition accounting in the year ended 3 September 2016 and is instead being recognised in the income statement over a two year period.  
Given the nature of the payment it has been recognised as a non-recurring item.
The release of contingent consideration of £2,090,000 relates to the acquisition of Chirton Engineering Ltd which was acquired in year ended 2014.  
This is discussed further in note 23.
Restructuring costs comprise redundancy costs.
A loss of £206,000 was incurred on the disposal of a property that was no longer required following the relocation of one of the Group’s Agriculture  
business stores.

(b) Factors affecting tax charge for the year

The tax effect of expenses that are not allowable in determining taxable profit includes the non-recurring items of goodwill impairment and business 
combination expenses (note 4). These have been treated as disallowable for tax purposes. The tax effect of non-taxable income includes the release  
of contingent consideration in respect of the Chirton Engineering acquisition in 2014 (note 4).
(c) Factors affecting future tax charges
The main rate of UK corporation tax has been reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. 
These rate reductions were substantively enacted before the year end and as the Directors consider the deferred tax balances are expected to reverse 
after 1 April 2020 the tax rate used for deferred tax at the year end is 17%.
8 Discontinued operations
In the prior year Carr’s Group plc disposed of its entire shareholding in Carr’s Flour Mills Ltd for a gross consideration of £36m on a cash and debt free  
basis, less costs to sell.

A special dividend of £15,996,351, being 17.54p per share, was paid in October 2016 following the disposal of Carr’s Flour Mills Ltd. 
Since the year end a second interim dividend of £868,258, being 0.95p per share, has been paid. The financial statements do not reflect the  
dividend payable.
The proposed final dividend for the year ended 2 September 2017 to be considered by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting is £1,919,455,  
being 2.1p per share, making a total for the year, excluding the special dividend, of 4.0p (2016: 3.8p). Shares held in treasury do not carry entitlement  
to a dividend. The financial statements do not reflect this proposed final dividend as payable. Carr’s Group plc

During the year goodwill of £14,182,000 arose on acquisitions (note 29). An impairment of £1,700,000 was recognised in the year which is discussed  
later in this note.
During the year cost and accumulated amortisation of £1,316,000 in respect of customer relationships and cost and accumulated amortisation  
of £240,000 in respect of know-how were disposed from the table above. These intangible assets have been fully amortised and have therefore  
been removed.
During the prior year there was a disposal of £195,000 in respect of the dissolution of dormant subsidiaries. This was partially offset by an adjustment  
to non-controlling interests of £104,000.
During the prior year goodwill totalling £783,000 arose on the acquisitions of Green (Agriculture) Co and Phoenix Feeds Ltd. Goodwill represented the 
excess of the consideration paid over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Carr’s Group plc

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of overseas subsidiaries has been retranslated at the balance sheet date.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill is tested for 
impairment by estimating future cash flows from the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated and discounting those cash flows  
to their present value. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill  
is monitored for internal management purposes. The key assumptions in this calculation are the levels of future cash flows, particularly in the perpetuity 
period, and the discount rate. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value  
of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units.
Cash flows are estimated using the most recent budget information for the year to August 2018, which has been approved by the Board and forecast 
information for the four years to August 2022 based on medium term business plans and an assumption for long term growth of between 1-3% excluding 
inflation. The pre-tax discount rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for all cash generating units is 4.86% – 10.32% (2016: 5.43% – 10.38%). 
The Directors consider the assumptions adopted in calculating the cash flows to be consistent with historical performance and to be reasonable given 
current market conditions.
Given the current state of the oil market the Directors placed particular attention to the impairment review on the carrying value of goodwill relating  
to the Chirton profit centre.
Although the performance of the Chirton profit centre has improved this year versus the previous year the sustained downturn in the oil and gas sector 
continues to work against Chirton in its major market. The oil price is viewed as a leading indicator of the health of the future market, and currently 
this has failed to recover to any extent from last year. There are no immediate signs of it recovering any further, so our business plan has been revised 
downwards to reflect this.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10.32% was used for the impairment testing of goodwill allocated to this cash generating unit. Details of other key 
assumptions are shown in the table below. An impairment of £1.7m has been recognised against the carrying value of goodwill.
Significant headroom exists in each of the other cash generating units and, based on the stress testing performed, reasonable possible changes in the 
assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of the cash generating units to equal or to exceed their recoverable amount.
Amortisation and impairment charges are recognised within administrative expenses and have been highlighted separately within amortisation and 
non-recurring items (note 4).
 There is no goodwill or intangible assets in the Company (2016: none).
Significant cash generating units 
The following key assumptions have been used in the impairment testing for goodwill with a significant carrying value:
   Goodwill carrying value Pre-tax Long term average annual Long term
    before impairment  discount rate change in cash flows growth rate
   £’000 % % %

Carr’s Engineering Ltd – Chirton profit centre  4,226 10.32 4 2
Carrs Agriculture Ltd – Scotmin profit centre  2,068 4.86 6 2
Stress testing of the future cash flows generated from these cash generating units shows that an impairment of goodwill would potentially arise  
should cash flows fall by 44% in NuVision Engineering GmbH, by 35% in Wälischmiller Engineering GmbH and by 94% in the Scotmin profit centre. 
Stress testing of the future cash flows generated from the Chirton profit centre show that an additional impairment of goodwill of £0.3m would have 
been recognised, in addition to the £1.7m actually recognised in the year, should cash flows fall by 5%. This rises to £0.6m and £1.1m should cash flows  
fall by 10% and 20% respectively. Carr’s Group plc

During the year a credit of £111,000 (2016: charge of £50,000) has been recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated income 
statement in respect of the movement in provision for impairment of trade receivables.
No impairment of other receivables has been recognised in the current or preceding year.
Interest bearing, non-trading amounts owed by Group undertakings within current trade and other receivables carry interest at Bank of England  
base rate + 2.50%, 4.50% or 5.95%. Such amounts are unsecured and repayable on demand.
Interest bearing, non-trading amounts owed by Group undertakings within non-current receivables carry interest at 4.88% and 6.25%. Such amounts  
are unsecured and have a term of 5 years.

The Company has no trade receivables (2016: none).  
In relation to trade receivables, the major source of estimation uncertainty is the recoverable value of those receivables. The judgements applied to this 
include the credit quality of customers, taking into account their financial positions, past experiences and other relevant factors. Individual customer 
credit limits are imposed based on these factors, and provisions for impairment are made using those judgements. Provisions for impairment are 
reviewed monthly by divisional management.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the year end is the carrying value, net of provision for impairment, of each receivable. The Group and Company 
do not hold any significant collateral as security (2016: none).

During the year contingent and deferred consideration arose on acquisitions (note 29). In addition there remained initial cash consideration unpaid  
at the balance sheet date. After retranslation at the balance sheet date of foreign currency denominated amounts, £2,223,000 of these outstanding  
payables are recognised within current liabilities and £4,160,000 are recognised within non-current liabilities.
The contingent consideration of £2,394,000 on the acquisition of Chirton Engineering Ltd in year ended 2014 was recognised as potentially payable in  
the prior year comparative above subject to certain earnings criteria being met. During the current year £304,000 of this liability was paid to the vendor  
with the remaining £2,090,000 being released to the income statement as it was no longer payable. Given the exceptional nature and size of this credit  
to the income statement it has been treated as a non-recurring item (note 4).
Included within accruals and deferred income is the following in respect of government grants:

Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short and medium term borrowings. Short-term flexibility is achieved by  
overdraft facilities. In addition it is the Group’s policy to maintain committed undrawn facilities in order to provide flexibility in the management  
of the Group’s liquidity.
The tables below analyse the Group and Company’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on

Borrowing facilities
The Group has various undrawn facilities. The undrawn facilities available at 2 September 2017, in respect of which all conditions precedent had  
been met, were as follows:

   Floating rate Floating rate

Expiring within two and five years inclusive   24,273 4,500
   30,230 23,014
The Company’s overdraft is within a Group facility and it is therefore not possible to determine the Company’s undrawn facilities at the balance  
sheet date.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to optimise the cost of capital. In order to maintain  
or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares  
or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt is calculated as total 
borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings) as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents. Total equity  
is as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
At 2 September 2017 the Group had net debt of £14.1m (2016: net cash of £8.1m). Gearing was 13.3% at the year end.
The Group monitors cash balances and net debt on a daily basis to ensure adequate headroom exists on banking facilities and that it is compliant  
with banking covenants. 
Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 13 requires financial instruments that are measured at fair value to be classified according to the valuation technique used:
Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 – inputs, other than Level 1 inputs, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices) 
Level 3 – unobservable inputs
All derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs. There were no transfers between levels in the above hierarchy  
in either the current or prior year.
The Group holds shares in several private limited companies. These have been classified as unquoted investments for which fair value cannot  
be reliably measured and are held at cost less accumulated impairment. Had fair value been applied this financial asset would have been Level 3. Carr’s Group plc

Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The fair value of Group and Company financial assets and liabilities are not materially different to book value.
Derivative financial instruments 
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries
The Group hedges foreign denominated loans against its investment in foreign subsidiaries. A foreign exchange pre-tax gain of £36,000  
(2016: £504,000) was recognised in equity during the year on translation of US dollar denominated loans with a fair value of $1,608,000  
(2016: $24,908,000) to sterling. A foreign exchange pre-tax loss of £106,000 (2016: pre-tax gain of £183,000) was recognised in equity during the year  
on translation of Euro denominated loans with a fair value of €5,330,000 (2016: €1,750,000) to sterling. The Group’s net investment hedge was fully  
effective in both the current and prior year and therefore no gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Currency derivatives 
The Group and Company use forward foreign currency contracts and options to manage exchange risk exposure. At the balance sheet date,

26 Retirement benefits
The Group participates in two defined benefit pension schemes, Carr’s Group Pension Scheme and Carrs Billington Agriculture Pension Scheme.
Carr’s Group Pension Scheme
The Company sponsors the Carr’s Group Pension Scheme and offered a defined contribution and a defined benefit section. The assets of the scheme 
are held separately from those of the Group and are invested with independent investment managers.
From 1 September 2015 the defined contribution section was closed. Members of that section were enrolled in a new defined contribution scheme, 
the Carr’s Group Retirement Savings Scheme (‘Carr’s Group RSS’), set up under a Master Trust arrangement.
The defined benefit section of the scheme was previously closed to new members, and has closed to future accrual with effect from 31 December 
2015. Members of this section became entitled to become members of the Carr’s Group RSS from 1 January 2016. The pension contribution made  
by the Group over the year to the defined benefit section was £nil (2016: £888,000). Contributions to the scheme for the year ending August 2017  
are expected to be £nil.
 The following disclosures relate to the defined benefit section of the Carr’s Group Pension Scheme. The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme  
was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 31 December 2014 and updated on an approximate basis to 2 September 2017 by a qualified 
independent actuary.

Characteristics and the risks associated with the Scheme
Information about the characteristics the Scheme:
The Scheme provides pensions in retirement and death benefits to members. Pension benefits are linked to a member’s final salary at  
31 December 2015 (or date of leaving, if earlier) and their length of service. Since 31 December 2015 the Scheme has been closed to future accrual.
The Scheme is a registered scheme under UK legislation.
The Scheme is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in UK legislation.
The Scheme was established under trust and is governed by the Scheme’s trust deed and rules dated June 2008. The Trustees are responsible for the 
operation and the governance of the Scheme, including making decisions regarding the Scheme’s funding and investment strategy in conjunction  
with the Company.
Information about the risks of the Scheme to the Company:
The Scheme exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as market (investment) risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency risk and longevity risk.
The Scheme does not expose the Company to any unusual Scheme-specific or Company-specific risks.
Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows
The Scheme’s investment strategy:
The Scheme’s investment strategy is to invest in return seeking assets and matching assets. This strategy reflects the Scheme’s liability profile and the 
Trustees’ attitude to risk. The Scheme’s investments include vehicles for interest rate and inflation hedging.
Expected future cash flows to and from the Scheme:
The last scheme funding valuation of the Scheme was as at 31 December 2014 and revealed a funding deficit of £278,000. In the most recent recovery 
plan the Company agreed to pay £195,000 per month with the view to eliminating the shortfall by 31 December 2015.
In accordance with the current schedule of contributions the Company is expected to pay no contributions over the next accounting period.
The liabilities of the Scheme are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members of the Scheme over the next 60 years. 
The average duration of the liabilities is approximately 15 years.  Carr’s Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017

26 Retirement benefits (continued)
Carr’s Group Retirement Savings Scheme
The Company offers membership in a Master Trust arrangement, Carr’s Group RSS, following the closure of both sections of the Carr’s Group  
Pension Scheme. The pension expense for this scheme for the year was £911,000 (2016: £902,000 including £189,000 in respect of Carr’s Flour Mills Ltd).
Carrs Billington Agriculture Pension Scheme
One of the Group’s subsidiaries, Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Ltd, is a participating employer in the Carrs Billington Agriculture  
Pension Scheme, which is a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme. For the reasons explained below this scheme is accounted for  
as a defined contribution scheme.
The scheme is closed to new entrants and has been closed to future accrual since 1 December 2007. There is currently a deficit, calculated in accordance 
with IAS 19, of £2.3m (2016: £5.1m). The sponsoring employer, Carrs Billington Agriculture (Operations) Ltd, is currently paying £0.8m per annum under 
the terms of the recovery plan agreed between them and the Trustees of the scheme.
Under the rules of the scheme, any employer wishing to exit the scheme would trigger a partial wind-up of the scheme and would therefore  
be responsible for their s75 debt. A full wind-up of the plan would also trigger s75 debts for each participating employer.
The history of the scheme is that it was brought together from many other pension schemes and employers following multiple acquisitions over 
several years. Many of those acquisitions had little or no records of employee histories. Because of this, approximately 85% of the scheme liabilities are 
‘Orphan Liabilities’. Under the rules of the scheme, on a wind-up the orphan liabilities would be split between the participating employers in the same 
proportion as their calculated share of non-orphan liabilities. At the last actuarial valuation, the buy-out deficit was £15.7m and the Group’s estimated 
liability on the wind up of the scheme was £7.6m.
Because of the scheme history described above, it is not possible to calculate the Group’s share of the assets and liabilities of the scheme, and 
consequently despite it being a defined benefit pension scheme the Group treats it as a defined contribution pension scheme for accounting purposes. 
The Group does not expect to pay any contributions to the scheme in the next reporting period (2016: £nil). Currently the deficit repair contributions are 
being funded solely by the sponsoring employer and this is expected to remain the case in the future. Those deficit repair contributions are based on 
the last triennial valuation of the scheme as at 31 December 2015, which showed that the scheme had a deficit of £4.4m on a technical provisions basis.
The Group’s level of participation in the scheme is estimated at 48.5%, which is based on its estimated share of the total buy-out liabilities. The Group  
has a 49% shareholding in its associate company which is the sponsoring company of the pension scheme. As a result of equity accounting for its share 
of the net assets of the associate the Group recognises 49% of the deficit calculated on an IAS 19 accounting basis within its ‘Investment in Associates’  
in its consolidated balance sheet.
Other pension schemes
Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Ltd offers a Group Personal Pension Plan to some of its employees and the pension expense for this plan in the year 
was £521,000 (2016: £508,000). 
The Group offered a Group Personal Pension plan to certain employees of Carr’s Flour Mills Ltd. The pension expense for this scheme for the year  
up to the date of disposal of the subsidiary was £nil (2016: £205,000). 
The pension expense in respect of defined contribution pension arrangements in foreign subsidiaries during the year was £308,000 (2016: £215,000). 
Pension contributions into NEST during the year amounted to £39,000 (2016: £45,000).
The Group also pays contributions into various defined contribution schemes acquired through business combinations. The pension expense during  
the year in respect of these schemes was £36,000 (2016: £101,000).

Group
The Group operates two active share based payment schemes at 2 September 2017.
Under the long term incentive plan shares will be awarded to eligible individuals subject to an earnings per share (EPS) target measured against  
average annual increases over a three year period. For the awards granted in November 2014, November 2015 and November 2016 an average  
annual growth of EPS must exceed 3.0% for 25% of the awards to vest and 100% vest at 10.0%, with a straight line calculation between 25% and  
100% of the award.
All employees, subject to eligibility criteria, may participate in the share save scheme. Under this scheme employees are offered savings contracts  
for both 3 year and 5 year vesting period plans. The exercise period is 6 months from the vesting date.

29 Acquisitions
NuVision Engineering, Inc
On 4 August 2017 Carr’s Group plc acquired the entire issued share capital of ESI Holding Company, Inc., the holding company of USA based 
engineering company NuVision Engineering, Inc. (“NuVision”) for a total cash consideration of up to $20m including continent consideration of up to 
$8.5m which represents the maximum earn out payable dependent on future financial performance.
NuVision is a leading technology and applications engineering company focused on providing value in commercial nuclear and power plant facilities, 
government waste remediation facilities and waste clean-up. Its customers include the USA Department of Energy, major nuclear energy suppliers, 
public utilities, and international governments.
The acquisition provides a strong foothold into the main nuclear markets in the USA and will enable revenue synergies with the Group’s existing 
nuclear engineering businesses, including the opportunity to market Wälischmiller’s products in the USA. It will also extend the Group’s service 
capability in the nuclear market due to the complementary nature of NuVision’s product range. NuVision will also act as a key supplier under a major 
nuclear contract signed on 20 July 2017 and being delivered by our UK Manufacturing business in the next financial year.
STABER GmbH
On 24 October 2016 Wälischmiller Engineering GmbH (“Wälischmiller”) acquired the entire issued share capital of STABER GmbH (“STABER”) for cash 
consideration of €7.85m including deferred consideration of €2.0m, which is payable by 30 June 2018 at the latest.
STABER and Wälischmiller have been working together closely for over 50 years and STABER has most recently been a key supplier of parts for  
the remote handling business. STABER has designed and developed specialised technology which will be strategically beneficial to Wälischmiller  
in both the near and long term. This technology will accelerate the ongoing strategic development work on the Telbot® and the Demo 2000 Telbot® 
by Wälischmiller. Carr’s Group plc

29 Acquisitions (continued)
Mortimer Feeds Ltd
On 5 June 2017 Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited acquired the business and certain assets of Mortimer Feeds Ltd for cash consideration  
of £579,000 including £125,000 of contingent consideration. £30,000 of the contingent consideration is linked to the continued employment of key 
personnel and therefore in accordance with IFRS 3 this has not been recognised as consideration in the acquisition accounting and is instead being 
recognised in the income statement over a one year period. Given the nature of the payment it is intended to recognise this as a non-recurring item.
The principal activity of the business acquired is that of a feed merchant.
The primary reason for the business combination was the expansion of the existing agriculture business.
Horse and Pet Warehouse Ltd
On 17 March 2017 Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited acquired the entire issued share capital of Horse and Pet Warehouse Ltd for cash 
consideration of £139,000.
The principal activity of Horse and Pet Warehouse Ltd is a retailer of animal products for the pet, equine and smallholding market.
The primary reason for the business combination was the expansion of the existing agriculture business.
All of the above purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions. Given the size and timing of the acquisitions no separate disclosure has been  
presented on the face of the consolidated income statement as the impact would not be material.  
Aggregate disclosures
The total goodwill arising from acquisitions in the year amounts to £14,182,000. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over  
the Group’s interests in the net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
  
The following amounts have been recognised within the consolidated income statement in respect of acquisitions made in the year:
      2017

Revenue   167 — 908 1,075
Profit before taxation  1 (23) 23 1
There were no other recognised gains and losses other than the profit shown above.
Acquisition related costs amounted to £993,000, which have been recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement 
and have been highlighted separately within non-recurring items (note 4).

Mortimer Feeds Ltd and the contract backlog, trade name, patents and proprietary technology acquired in NuVision Engineering, Inc.
The fair value exercise on the acquisition of Horse and Pet Warehouse Ltd in the year resulted in no significant intangible assets being identified other 
than the value of employees.

36 Post balance sheet event
On 31 October 2017, after the year end, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Pearson Farm Supplies Ltd, an agricultural retail business,  
for cash consideration of £1.3m. Of this cash consideration £0.1m is deferred until February 2018 and a further £0.1m is deferred until the third anniversary  
of completion.
The primary reason for the acquisition was the expansion of the existing agriculture business.
Given that this has been a recent acquisition the identifiable assets and liabilities at completion and goodwill have yet to be finalised. The Directors 
therefore consider it impracticable to be able to disclose this information in these financial statements. Carr’s Group plc
