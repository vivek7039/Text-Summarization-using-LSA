A pivotal year 
for TT
Neil Carson
Chairman
2017 has been a pivotal year for TT. The business has performed 
strongly, and the disposal of the Transportation Sensing and Control 
(Transportation) division has realised value for the benefit of TT and 
our shareholders. 
Strategic development
2017 has been a significant year for us, having disposed of the 
Transportation division for £123.2 million in October. Under strong 
leadership, the Transportation division has made significant progress, 
delivering good sales growth and positive operating margins in TT’s 
last year of ownership. The Board believes that this was the right 
time to realise the value for the division, following the turnaround 
in performance. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank the 
Transportation leadership team for their contribution to TT and wish 
them well in their new home with AVX Corporation. Our ability to 
execute major organisational and portfolio change together with 
improved financial capacity positions us well to invest and grow the 
remaining TT Group. 
I have been delighted to see the strong performance of the 
remaining business. TT is a profitable, growing business, with 
excellent cash conversion. Progress has been made on TT’s strategy 
to build leading positions in markets with structural growth drivers 
where there is increasing electronic content. By focusing on areas of 
the market where our industry expertise and focused R&D investment 
is creating differentiated capabilities, we will help our customers solve 
their most complex challenges. I have been particularly pleased 
to see our improved customer focus reflected in a number of new 
contract wins (see page 8 and pages 30–35). The Board believes 
that this, in turn, will create profit growth and will position TT to 
create long-term value for our shareholders. Our strategic focus on 
enhancing our business development, value-added product solutions 
and operational excellence, we believe, are the right areas to take TT 
to the next level.

04 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com Investment proposition
We have positioned TT for organic growth ahead of the 
market with opportunity to progress our operating margin. 
By prioritising strong cash performance, including targeting 
80%+ cash conversion, we are able to continue to invest in 
R&D to support growth while improving ROIC and maintaining 
a progressive dividend policy. We will continue to support our 
strategy with targeted, complementary acquisitions.
At the start of 2018, we took our first step in deploying our increased 
financial capacity to drive growth for the Group with the recommended 
cash offer for Stadium Group plc (Stadium). You can read more about 
the offer on page 9 and page 81. 
Our people
We are a people business, and the strong business 
performance achieved would not be possible without the hard 
work and commitment of our people across our global operations. 
We have made good progress launching more new products to 
market, enhancing our sales organisation and delivering continuous 
operational improvement. Importantly, we have had another year 
of progress in our safety performance. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank all of our employees who have contributed 
to another successful year in 2017. 
Shareholder returns and dividend
We have delivered a strong business performance across the 
Group. We are growing, our operating margin is up and our cash 
performance has been excellent. Our strategy is progressing well, 
and while there remains more to be done, the performance to date 
is reflected in the strengthened position of the Group. 
Given TT’s financial performance, strategic progress and growth 
prospects for the business, the Board is recommending increasing 
the final dividend to 4.05 pence per share. This, when combined 
with the interim dividend of 1.75 pence per share, gives an 
increased total dividend of 5.8 pence per share for the full year 
(2016: 5.6 pence per share).
Looking forward
TT is now a different business. Our strategic focus combined with 
our increased financial capacity to invest in our proven strategy will 
position TT well to capitalise on the proliferation of electronics in 
our markets. The Board is confident of strong progress in 2018.

A year of portfolio 
transformation and 
strong profitable 
growth
Richard Tyson
Chief Executive Officer
2017 was a significant year for TT with strong revenue and profit 
growth ahead of expectations. In October we transformed the 
portfolio with the disposal of the Transportation Sensing and 
Control (Transportation) division for £123.2 million, realising value 
for the turnaround of the business and return to profit. We now have 
increased financial capacity and management time to continue to 
invest in and grow the business. Our enhanced position will allow 
us to accelerate our strategy to build leading positions in areas 
of the market where there are structural growth drivers and the 
proliferation of electronics is driving demand for our products.
Strategic progress
In 2017 we successfully transformed the portfolio while delivering 
strong organic profitable growth:
• Portfolio transformation: With the disposal of the 
Transportation division, TT is becoming a higher margin, higher 
quality business, with increased financial capacity to accelerate 
growth through capital investments and acquisitions. 
• Strong organic profitable growth: Favourable market 
conditions combined with a strong sales performance have 
driven strong growth and margin improvement in the continuing 
business, with organic growth in all three divisions.
Portfolio transformation
In October we completed the disposal of the Transportation 
division, realising value for the turnaround of the business and 
return to profit. Under strong leadership, the Transportation 
division made significant progress:
• turned-around and returned to profit;
• re-focused R&D efforts on sensing and control for safety, 
fuel efficiency and emission control;
• achieved sales success in faster growing geographies; and
• broadened its customer base.
The strategic progress that we had achieved enabled us to realise 
the value for the business earlier than anticipated. The net proceeds 
on the disposal originally estimated in the circular at £100.7 million 
are now expected to total £111.0 million with the increase as a result 
of normal working capital adjustments, together with a substantially 
lower expected tax burden.
Following the disposal, we restructured our remaining divisions 
to improve our routes to market, and better serve our customers 
to support future growth. 
2017 performance
2017 was a pivotal year for TT. Following the disposal of the 
Transportation division, TT is becoming a higher margin, higher 
quality business with good cash conversion. Business performance 
was excellent and we delivered organic growth from all three 
divisions. Our strategy to focus on areas of the market where 
our industry expertise and R&D investment create strong and 
differentiated capabilities is delivering results, driving growth and 
margin improvement. 
06 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com “2017 was a pivotal year for TT. 
We are delighted with both the strong 
trading performance and the disposal 
of  the Transportation division.”
How would you describe the performance 
of the business in 2017?
I am delighted with the performance of the Group in 
2017. All three divisions delivered organic growth, 
underlying profit before tax grew by more than 25% 
and our cash conversion was excellent. Following on 
from a strong business performance in 2016, the 
excellent business performance in 2017 was 
delivered in a year when we also transformed 
our portfolio.
How significant was the disposal of the 
Transportation division to your strategy?
The disposal of the Transportation division has 
transformed TT. We were able to realise the value for 
the turnaround of the division ahead of expectations. 
We were pleased with the value achieved and as a 
result, have increased financial capacity to invest 
in the remaining business which will accelerate 
our progress. 
Why have you chosen to focus on three of 
your previous strategic priorities for 2018?
Given the progress and financial performance 
of the Group, we are taking an opportunity to put 
even more effort and resources behind new product 
development; business development; and continuing 
our good work with operational excellence. We intend 
to develop more value-added solutions, developing 
more custom assemblies and products, further up the 
value chain in response to customer demand. We will 
couple this with extra support for our customer facing 
teams including training and development for our 
business development function. In parallel, we 
will continue our efforts on BE Lean which is well 
embedded within our organisation and improving 
the efficiency of our operations.
Q&A
07 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TT Electronics plc www.ttelectronics.com
Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information Chief Executive’s strategic review continued
Group revenue for 2017 was £360.0 million (2016: £332.7 million) 
an increase of 8 per cent and 5 per cent excluding the £9.3 million 
benefit from foreign exchange. Our strong sales performance and 
improved market demand have contributed to good growth this 
year. The focus on operational excellence has enabled us to 
increase capacity and maintain lead times resulting in market 
share gains in our current sensing, circuit protection and signal 
conditioning product lines. The Group’s order book has improved 
compared to the same time last year in part because of customers 
placing orders further ahead than at this time last year.
Underlying operating profit
1
 increased by 18 per cent to £24.3 million 
(2016: £20.6 million), and by 12 per cent excluding a foreign exchange 
benefit of £1.1 million. Statutory operating profit was £20.0 million 
(2016: £18.8 million). The improvement was driven by the Sensors 
and Specialist Components and Power Electronics divisions. Foreign 
exchange headwinds in the second half were offset by early delivery 
of efficiency savings post the disposal of the Transportation division. 
Underlying operating profit margin for the Group has improved by 60 
basis points to 6.8 per cent (2016: 6.2 per cent) and return on invested 
capital increased by 140 basis points to 10.6 per cent (2016: 9.2 per 
cent). We delivered another year of excellent cash conversion of 98 per 
cent (2016: 79 per cent) and a free cash inflow of £4.7 million (2016: 
£13.8 million). Closing net funds at the end of the year were £47.0 
million (2016: net debt £55.4 million). 
Strong organic profitable growth
All three divisions
2
 delivered organic revenue growth resulting 
from a combination of market share gains, improved key customer 
relationships and a good sales performance.
Sensors and Specialist Components revenues were £142.3 million 
(2016: £129.5 million) an increase of 10 per cent and 6 per cent at 
constant currency (excluding a £5.0 million positive foreign exchange 
impact). The increase in revenues was a result of market share 
gains and positive market demand in Europe and Asia. Underlying 
operating profit improved to £18.8 million (2016: £15.6 million), an 
increase of 21 per cent or 15 per cent excluding a £0.7 million foreign 
exchange benefit. The profitability of the division improved as a result 
of operational leverage on the organic revenue growth (see page 30)
Power Electronics revenues increased by 14 per cent to £64.2 million 
(2016: £56.2 million), up 12 per cent on an organic basis including 
the now complete one-off last time buy activity associated with 
moving production from Fullerton in the US to our Bedlington facility 
in the UK. The growth was a result of continued platform growth in 
aerospace and defence and the ramp up of product lines that were 
outsourced to us from a global engine manufacturer. Underlying 
operating profit improved to £6.2 million (2016: £5.0 million), up 24 
per cent. The increase was due to operational leverage (see page 32).
Global Manufacturing Solutions revenues increased by 4 per cent 
to £153.5 million (2016: £147.0 million), with constant currency 
revenue growth of 2 per cent. Revenue growth was stronger in the 
second half. There was a favourable foreign exchange impact of 
£4.2 million. Revenue growth was strong in Asia driven by customers 
in medical and transportation sectors. Underlying operating profit 
increased from £6.3 million in 2016 to £6.5 million in 2017. There 
was a positive foreign exchange impact of £0.4 million. Underlying 
operating profit improved in the second half as a result of operational 
leverage on increased revenues. Underlying operating margins were 
4.2 per cent (2016: 4.3 per cent) (see page 34).
Realising benefits from management actions started in 2015 
We delivered strong revenue and profit growth, realising the benefit 
from management actions we started in 2015 around improving 
our customer focus, increasing our R&D activities and enhancing 
our operational efficiency.
Our increased customer focus has resulted in new customer wins 
and increased sales to existing customers. This includes multi-year 
contracts won with an aerospace and defence OEM customer in 
the US for printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) and design for 
manufacture and testing that will drive growth for the future. In 
addition, we have identified key customers where we have the 
potential to develop strategic relationships. We also further 
developed our strategic supplier relationship with Rolls-Royce 
for power and control microcircuits.
Our focus on R&D and increased R&D spend has resulted in 
16 new products launched in the year. These new product launches 
will position us for continued growth in years to come. Four of our new 
products launched were in the current sensing, circuit protection and 
signal conditioning product lines, an area where our operational 
efficiency actions have resulted in market share gains and we have 
benefited from a surge in market demand. We are continuing to see 
good benefits from our BE Lean programme. During the year, we 
trained the next cohort of Master Lean Practitioners, using our own 
BE Lean experts.
Safety is of paramount importance to us and we have seen good 
progress in our zero harm measures which continue their momentum. 
Safety performance improved 13 per cent in 2017. Since 2015, lost 
time accidents have more than halved. Our employees continue to 
manage and prioritise health and safety and we are now rolling out 
a behavioural based safety programme as we move into 2018 
(see page 25).
TT has seen good growth with 
customers in aerospace and defence

08 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com We continue to prioritise the engagement of our employees 
and making TT a great place to work. We are also conscious of the 
diversity position across our employee base. We pay our employees 
equally for equal roles, and employ a workforce that comprises 52 
per cent female employees and 48 per cent male employees. The 
gender diversity of our senior leadership is reflective of the industry 
and we are looking to proactively improve our diversity at this level 
in the organisation through our internal development plans, 
our recruitment processes, and encouraging new talent to 
join the industry. 
We remain committed to promoting apprentice schemes 
throughout the organisation, championing young talent and 
nurturing our leading experts of the future. Our progress is 
demonstrated by our employee engagement score of 4.73 
which has continued to improve since the launch of our TT 
Way behaviours in 2015 (see page 25).
Our markets
We focus our strategy on segments of our four end markets where 
there are structural growth drivers across industrial, aerospace and 
defence, medical and transportation markets. TT is well positioned 
in these markets, with long-standing customer relationships. By 
focusing on areas of the market where our industry expertise and 
focused R&D investment are creating differentiated capabilities, 
we will help our customers solve their most complex challenges. 
Across our end markets there are varying growth dynamics. 
Intermediate sub-systems for a range of our industries are forecast to 
grow at a 2.1 per cent CAGR from 2015 to 2019, reaching USD$1.61 
billion. As the world becomes ever more interconnected, electronics 
are proliferating as the level of automation and intelligence in and 
across devices is multiplying in virtually all spheres of industry, 
business, infrastructure and our homes with increasing pace. We 
are focused on end markets that are benefitting from increasing 
electronic content, ensuring exposure to long term favourable 
growth trends for the business. Read more on our four market 
areas on pages 12–13.
Our strategy
Our strategy remains unchanged. We are focused on building 
leading positions in areas of the market where there are structural 
growth drivers driving the proliferation of electronics and increased 
demand for our solutions. We concentrate our time and resources in 
market areas where our industry expertise and R&D investment 
creates strong and differentiated capabilities that are valued by 
our customers. 
Following the disposal of the Transportation division, we have 
increased financial capacity and management time to continue to 
invest in and grow the business. As a result of the progress we have 
delivered, we are increasing our investment to step up our existing 
activities in R&D and business development. These investments will 
support our ambition to deliver even more value-added solutions to 
our customers. We will continue our focus on operational excellence 
that has been delivering results. These priorities support our 
commitment to solve our customers’ toughest electronics 
challenges by engineering smarter solutions together.
Strategic priorities in 2018
 Value-added product solutions
As TT moves to be a higher margin, higher value, and product 
focused business, the requirement for value-added product solutions, 
innovation and R&D is increasing. By deploying additional resources 
in our research and development function, we will prioritise increasing 
the effectiveness of our R&D spend and accelerate our ability to move 
up the value-chain where our customers support us doing so to 
develop smarter solutions together. 
 Business development
We are focused on ensuring our business development function is 
fit for purpose as TT builds momentum with new product launches 
and developing strategic partnerships with our customers. We will 
increase our efforts around training and developing our people to 
promote a solutions-based sales approach and focus on continuing 
to develop strategic customer relationships.
 Operational excellence
We want our customers to recognise TT for our operational 
excellence. Alongside continuing our BE Lean activities, which 
have seen success in enabling us to win market share in our current 
sensing, circuit protection and signal conditioning product lines, we 
are focused on optimising our operations and taking sensible actions 
to improve our procurement effectiveness. (see pages 10–11)
Capital deployment
In February 2018, we announced the recommended cash offer for 
Stadium Group plc (Stadium) for a total consideration of approximately

Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information Market review
The industrial market is a diverse market covering 
manufacturing, energy and utilities, power, and oil 
and gas with a large degree of regional variation. 
The industrial market accounts for 46 per cent of 
our revenues. The market is benefiting from growth 
associated with the “smarter home”, “factory 4.0” 
and higher specification consumer products.
The industrial automation solutions market (including 
equipment, components and services) is projected to 
reach US$283.2 billion by 2018, with mid-single digit 
growth. Industrial machines and robotics are capable 
of handling input materials, work-in-progress goods 
and finished products with increasing precision, speed 
and flexibility with market demand growing for even 
more dextrous capabilities to adjust to situational 
variations. This requires sensors and controls to be ever 
more precise, as well as interconnected, capabilities 
that we have at TT. Read more about where we are 
focused on page 14.
Aerospace and defence accounts for 22 per cent 
of TT’s revenues. We are seeing market growth 
from “the more electric aircraft” alongside demand 
for “miniaturisation” of electrical components and 
assemblies with reduced size, weight and power 
consumption. This trend is gaining momentum as 
hydraulic systems are replaced or backed up with 
electrically-powered equivalents. Power and sensing 
electronics are playing a key part in enabling progress 
in the value chains of key applications including engine 
management, flight-surface actuation, landing gear 
actuation and flight control avionics.
The global market for electrical on-aircraft systems was 
estimated to be £10.4 billion in 2014, forecast to grow to 
£13.7 billion by 2020, a CAGR of 4.6 per cent. Electrical 
systems require advances in power electronics to handle 
the ever-increasing loads, and the need to dissipate, or 
put to use, excess heat between the electrical power 
chain. Growth in key segments of aircraft electronics, 
such as avionics systems, aircraft fuel management 
systems and flight management systems, for all of 
which TT engineers components, is expected to be 
mid-single digit over the next five years. Read more 
about where we are focused on page 15.

CAGR of 7.3 per cent from 2016 to 2021. Read more 
about where we are focused on page 16.
Electronics for the transportation industry covers 
automotive, rail, truck and two wheelers, and accounts 
for 12 per cent of TT’s revenues. The increasing growth 
of electric and hybrid electric vehicles, albeit from a low 
base, is a trend set to continue. For example in China, 
1.3 per cent of the automotive market share based on 
vehicles sold were electric or hybrid electric vehicles. 
Stricter city emissions regulations are seen as a key 
factor to innovative technologies becoming increasingly 
mainstream. In the UK and France, policymakers have 
announced a policy to remove diesel-powered vehicles 
from the roads by 2040. We are seeing market growth 
from increasing electronic content in rail, truck and 
passenger-car vehicles. 
The global automotive electronics market is large 
and competitive, and projected to be worth around 
USD$300 billion in 2020. It is estimated that Chinese 
OEMs will produce some 3.5 million electric vehicles 
throughout the period 2015–2019 in total. Deployment 
of in-vehicle electronics is increasing to make cars safer, 
cleaner and more comfortable through connectivity 
and built-in “intelligence”. Highly reliable sensors are

Risk management for the successful 
delivery of our strategy
Our risk management framework
Risk management
The Board of Directors is responsible for risk management and 
internal controls, supported by the Audit Committee and informed 
by the executive Risk Committee. The Board defines risk appetite 
and monitors the management of significant risks to ensure that 
the nature and extent of significant risks taken by the Company 
are aligned with overall goals and strategic objectives. The Risk 
Committee supports the Board and the Audit Committee in 
monitoring the exposure through regular reviews, including 
reviewing the effectiveness of risk management processes and 
controls. The Internal Audit function is operated under a directed 
outsource arrangement to enhance the levels of resource and 
expertise available to the Group in specific areas, with its activities 
under the direction of the Executive team. The Internal Audit 
function assists the Risk Committee by advising management on 
improvements to the overall risk management framework, facilitating 
the risk review process and providing independent experience and 
input to the process.
Risk management processes and internal control procedures 
are established within business practices across all levels of the 
organisation. Risk identification, assessment and mitigation are 
performed both “bottom-up” with more detailed assessment at 
operational level, as well as through “top-down” assessment of 
strategic and market risk at the executive management and 
Board level.
Risk management and internal controls provide reasonable but 
not absolute protection against risk. The Board acknowledges and 
recognises that in the normal course of business the Group is exposed 
to risk and that it is willing to accept a level of risk in managing the 
business to achieve its strategic priorities. Risk appetite is not static 
and as part of its risk management processes, the Board regularly 
considers its risk appetite in terms of the tolerance it is willing to 
accept in relation to each principal risk based on key risk indicators to 
ensure it continues to be aligned with the Group’s goals and strategy.

Risk profile
At the direction of the Board, Executive management has 
performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, taking into account those that would threaten our business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, as well as the 
Group’s strategic objectives. This process includes a “bottom-up” 
analysis of key risks at a divisional level. All principal risks identified 
by this process may have an impact on our strategic objectives 
within the next six to twelve months. Executive management and 
the Risk Committee perform further analysis to prioritise these risks, 
with a focus on those principal elements posing the highest current 
risk to the achievement of the Company’s objectives or the ongoing 
viability of the business. 
Risks assessed as higher priority are consolidated onto a Group Risk 
Register. Risks included on the register are monitored closely by the 
Board, in terms of both prioritisation and mitigation strategies. It is 
recognised that, whilst these “top risks” represent a significant 
proportion of the Group’s risk profile, Executive management and 
the Risk Committee continue to monitor the entire universe of 
potential risks to identify new or emerging threats as well as 
changes in risk exposure. 
The assessment of principal risks during the year has identified that 
these risks have remained relatively stable in the year. This is reflected 
in the table of principal risks. However, the sale of the Transportation 
division has had a favourable impact on the principal risks of the 
Group. One impact of this is the removal of the principal risk in 
respect of pricing and margin pressures, where the net impact 
has now reduced such that it no longer appears on the Group Risk 
Register. In addition, following agreement with the Board and Risk 
Committee, a risk in relation to IT systems and information has now 
been promoted to the Group Risk Register in light of the continued 
escalation of cyber attacks on industry in general.
While there is an acknowledgement of continued uncertainty 
around geopolitical risk during 2018, the Group continues to take 
appropriate mitigating activities to address this and hence this risk 
is considered to be unchanged. In addition, Executive management 
and the Board do not currently anticipate any significant impact on 
the Group’s trading following the UK referendum on Brexit.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over the 
period to December 2020, taking into account the Group’s 
current position and the potential impact of the principal risks 
and uncertainties set out on pages 28 and 29 of the Strategic 
report. Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period to December 2020. 
The Directors have determined that the period to December 
2020 represents an appropriate period over which to provide 
the viability statement as this aligns with the business cycle 
including product development and order intake trends. 
While the Directors have no reason to believe the Group 
will not be viable over a longer period, given the inherent 
uncertainty involved, the Directors believe that this presents 
investors and other key stakeholders with a reasonable degree 
of confidence while still providing a longer-term perspective. 
In making this statement, the Directors have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, 
the underlying mitigation planning, the assessment of future 
performance, solvency and liquidity, and the Group’s internal 
controls environment.
In making the assessment of the Group’s viability, the 
Directors have stress tested the Group’s financial projections 
for the period covered by the viability statement, testing it for 
“business as usual” risks (such as profit growth and working 
capital variances), and severe but plausible events (occurring 
both individually and in unison), as well as a “reverse” stress-test 
to understand the conditions which could jeopardise the future 
viability of the Group including assessing against covenant 
testing and facility headroom. The Group’s wide geographical 
and sector diversification helps minimise the risk of serious 
business interruption or catastrophic reputational damage. 
Furthermore, the business model is structured so that the 
Group is not overly reliant on any single customer, market 
or geography.
While this review does not consider all of the risks that the 
Group may face, the Directors consider that this stress-testing 
based assessment of the Group’s prospects is reasonable in 
the circumstances of the inherent uncertainty involved.

Sensors and Specialist Components revenues were £142.3 million 
(2016: £129.5 million) an increase of 10 per cent and 6 per cent on 
an organic basis (excluding a £5.0 million positive foreign exchange 
impact). The increase in revenues was a result of market share gains 
and positive market demand dynamics.
Underlying operating profit improved to £18.8 million (2016: 
£15.6 million), an increase of 21 per cent or 15 per cent excluding a 
£0.7 million foreign exchange benefit. The profitability of the division 
improved as a result of operational leverage on the organic revenue 
growth. Margin mix improved in the second half as expected. 
Underlying operating profit margin was 13.2 per cent, up 110 
basis points at constant currency.
We have identified three areas as our focus areas for growth 
and where we are concentrating our R&D spend: current sensing, 
circuit protection, and signal conditioning; optoelectronic assembly 
solutions; and automotive power inductors. These are product 
areas where we have particular differentiation and comparative 
advantage, and attractive market niches that our products address.
We delivered strong growth in current sensing, circuit protection 
and signal conditioning. This is as a result of strong demand coupled 
with market share gains, backed by our favourable lead times and 
increased capacity. We have increased sales to customers in industrial 
and consumer goods, with an existing aerospace and defence 
customer also ramping up an existing programme. 
Our optoelectronics assemblies have seen good growth, primarily 
driven by industrial and automotive customers in the US where market 
conditions have been favourable. Our magnetics business has focused 
on power inductors for automotive where one of our customers has 
won a new programme with a German OEM.
During the year, we invested 7 per cent more in R&D in the Sensors 
and Specialist Components division, launching ten new products. 
This includes four new products launched in the current sensing,

Power Electronics revenues increased by 14 per cent to £64.2 million 
(2016: £56.2 million), up 12 per cent on an organic basis including 
the one-off last time buy activity now complete, associated with 
moving production from Fullerton in the US to our Bedlington facility 
in the UK. The growth was a result of continued platform growth in 
aerospace and defence and the ramp up of product lines that were 
outsourced to us from a global engine manufacturer. 
Underlying operating profit improved to £6.2 million (2016: 
£5.0 million), up 24 per cent due to operational leverage. Underlying 
operating margins increased by 80 basis points to 9.7 per cent (2016: 
8.9 per cent).
In the first half, we acquired Cletronics, a small US based manufacturer 
of electromagnetic components for the aerospace industry, for £1.2 
million. The acquisition will help to accelerate the strategy for our 
power electronics capabilities in North America and adds product and 
technical breadth to the capabilities acquired in Aero Stanrew in 2015. 
Cletronics, contributed £1.4 million of revenue and £0.2 million of 
underlying operating profit in just over nine months of ownership. 
We have identified three areas as our focus areas for growth and 
where we are concentrating our R&D spend: electromagnetics; power 
assembly solutions; and power and control microcircuits. These are 
areas where we have strategic customer relationships that are driving 
increased demand for our product and engineering capabilities.
During the year, we have extended our strategic relationships with 
key customers. We have seen good growth from our partnership 
with Rolls-Royce to provide power and control microcircuits used in 
the engine control unit (FADEC) for the next generation of aerospace 
engines. We have also seen good growth from the ramp-up of product 
lines that were outsourced to us from a global engine manufacturer. 
In addition, we have also seen an increase in volumes associated with 
winning additional content on the Gulfstream business jets and the 
ramp up of the Airbus A350XWB.
During the year, we launched six new products in partnership with our 
customers, underpinning our future growth. New products launched 
include a magnetics component for aircraft power distribution 
for aerospace and defence applications; and power and control 
microcircuits including for our Application-Specific Integrated

Introduction
Group revenue for 2017 was £360.0 million (2016: £332.7 million) 
an increase of 8 per cent and 5 per cent excluding the £9.3 million 
benefit from foreign exchange. Our strong sales performance and 
improved market demand have contributed to good growth this 
year. The focus on operational excellence has enabled us to 
increase capacity and maintain lead times resulting in market 
share gains in our current sensing, circuit protection and signal 
conditioning product lines. The Group’s order book has improved 
compared to the same time last year in part because of customers 
placing orders further ahead than at this time last year.
Underlying operating profit increased by 18 per cent to £24.3 
million (2016: £20.6 million), and by 12 per cent excluding a foreign 
exchange benefit of £1.1 million. The improvement was driven by 
the Sensors and Specialist Components and Power Electronics 
divisions. Foreign exchange headwinds in the second half were

Financial review
“We delivered a strong financial 
performance in 2017 with organic 
growth from all three divisions, 
significant profit improvement and 
excellent cash conversion.”
36 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com Closing net funds at the end of the year were £47.0 million 
(2016: net debt £55.4 million). 
Please see the Chief Executive’s strategic review on page 6 for detail 
on the divisional performance.
Non-underlying items 
Statutory operating profit was £20.0 million (2016: £18.8 million), 
up by 6 per cent driven by the business performance in Sensors and 
Specialist Components and Power Electronics.
Non-underlying items are presented separately in the income 
statement where the Directors believe that they require separate 
disclosure by virtue of their nature, size or incidence in order to 
obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s underlying 
business performance. The total charge for items excluded from 
underlying profit is £4.3 million (2016: £1.8 million). Restructuring 
and other costs totalling £1.6 million related to footprint change 
projects including the closure of the Global Manufacturing Solutions 
facility in Romania which is scheduled to be completed in the first 
half of 2018. This was partially offset by gains related to a pensions 
increase exchange (“PIE”) exercise. Acquisition and disposal costs of 
£2.7 million (2016: £3.8 million) related mainly to the non-cash 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles.

Chinese 
RMB 8.73 8.81 9.02 8.59 9.60 9.57
Interest 
There was a £2.2 million reduction in the net interest expense to 
£2.3 million (2016: £4.5 million) as a result of receiving payment for 
the disposal of the Transportation division in October 2017 which 
paid down the net debt.
Tax and earnings per share 
The underlying effective tax rate was 20.0 per cent (2016: 21.1 
per cent) and basic underlying earnings per share increased by 
40 per cent to 10.9 pence (2016: 7.8 pence), and by 30 per cent at 
constant currency. In December 2017, new legislation was enacted 
fundamentally changing the basis of US tax. This resulted in a one 
off benefit arising on enacted changes in tax rate of £1.8 million. 
Discontinued operations
Profit from discontinued operations totalled £32.0 million (2016: 
£4.8 million) including a £26.3 million profit before tax on disposal 
of the Transportation division. Operating profit from discontinued 
operations increased to £12.4 million (2016: £8.8 million) as a result 
of operational leverage on increased revenue together with the 
impact of ceasing to charge depreciation from 30 June 2017 
when the business was classified as an asset held for sale. 
Cash performance
The cash performance was once again excellent with 
underlying operating profit turned into good operating cash flow 
with cash conversion of 98 per cent. We sought to balance capital 
discipline with supporting growth and net capital expenditure and 
development expenditure totalled £14.7 million (2016: £13.0 million), 
equivalent to 1.1 times depreciation and amortisation (2016: 1.1 
times). There was a working capital outflow of £1.9 million (2016: 
outflow £5.4 million) and net interest and taxation reduced to £7.4 
million (2016: £10.5 million). Discontinued operations generated an 
operating cash outflow of £3.4 million (2016: inflow £11.0 million). 
Total Group free cash flow was £4.7 million (2016: £13.8 million). 
There was a £6.2 million outflow in relation to purchases of shares 
into our employee benefit trust (2016: £nil) to satisfy future vesting 
of long term incentive plans.
Dividends 
Given TT’s strong performance, the Board’s confidence in the future 
prospects for the business, and reflecting the financial impact on 
the Group of the disposal of the Transportation division, the Board 
is proposing a final dividend of 4.05 pence per share. This will take 
the full year dividend to 5.8 pence per share (2016: 5.6 pence per 
share), an increase of 4 per cent. 
Pensions 
The Group operates one significant defined benefit scheme in the UK 
and overseas defined benefit schemes in the US. These schemes are 
closed to new members and are closed to future accrual.
Given the material nature of the UK scheme, the Group has 
developed a comprehensive strategy to manage the financial risk 
associated with it. The strategy consists of:
• maintaining a long-term working partnership with the Trustee to 
ensure strong governance of risks within the UK scheme. The UK 
scheme is a long-term undertaking and is managed accordingly, 
in order to provide security to members’ benefits and value for 
money to the Group;
• a prudent investment strategy is pursued by seeking risk-
rewarded long-term returns while removing the majority of 
liability mismatching unrewarded risks. As such, the Group has 
in place financial hedging that removes the majority of interest 
rate yield and inflation risk. At the current level there is no 
significant impact on the deficit of a 10bps fall in yields which 
would otherwise be circa £10 million increase if the hedge were 
not in place, thereby reducing volatility. This strategy has been in 
place for a number of years, protecting the UK scheme’s position 
since December 2013 when yields commenced a prolonged 
decline; and
• the Group recognises that seeking rewarded risk returns in its 
investment strategy could lead to short-term fluctuations in 
funding levels depending on market conditions. The Group 
considers that by maintaining a good relationship with the 
Trustee, it will be able to utilise flexibility in the funding regime 
to even out the impact of short-term market underperformance 
to enhance predictability of Group pension contributions. This 
creates a suitable balance between the needs of the UK scheme, 
the Group, and the Members.
The triennial valuation of the UK scheme as at April 2016 showed 
a deficit of £46.0 million against the Trustee’s funding objective 
compared with £19.1 million at April 2013. The Company will continue 
with the previously agreed schedule of deficit contributions. 
The Company made deficit contributions of £4.7 million in 2017. 
For the next three years, contributions of £4.9 million, £5.1 million 
and £3.9 million are planned.
38 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com In addition, the Company has set aside £2.6 million to be utilised in 
agreement with the Trustee for reducing the long-term liabilities of 
the scheme. During the year, the Company ran a pensions increase 
exchange exercise, which offered pensioners the ability to exchange 
inflationary pension increases in the future for a higher fixed level of 
pensions. As a result of this exercise, the funding deficit in the UK 
scheme was reduced by £2.3 million. 
The assets and liabilities of the Group’s UK defined benefit schemes 
are summarised below, alongside the total Group pension deficit:
£million 2017 2016
Fair value of assets 551.9 537.6
Liabilities (536.8) (539.8)
Surplus/(deficit) – UK scheme 15.1 (2.2)
Overseas schemes (3.2) (3.5)
Total Group surplus/(deficit) 11.9 (5.7)
Financial risk management and treasury policies 
The main financial risks of the Group relate to funding and liquidity, 
interest rate fluctuations and currency exposures. A central treasury 
department that operates according to objectives, policies and 
authorities approved by the Board, manages these risks. The overall 
policy objective is to use financial instruments to manage financial 
risks arising from the underlying business activities and therefore 
the Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which 
there is no underlying financial exposure. More details are set out in 
note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Funding and liquidity 
The Group’s operations are funded through a combination of 
retained profits, equity and borrowings. Borrowings are generally 
raised at Group level from a group of relationship banks and then 
lent to operating subsidiaries. The Group maintains sufficient 
available committed borrowing facilities to meet any forecasted 
funding requirements. 
Net funds at the end of the year were £47.0 million (2016: net debt 
£55.4 million), with available undrawn committed and uncommitted 
facilities of £204.2 million. 
The main financial covenants in the long-term bank facilities restrict 
net debt to below 3.0 times EBITDA before non-underlying items 
and EBITDA before non-underlying items is required to cover net 
finance charges by 4.0 times.

40 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com The “TT Way”
As a responsible global organisation with operations in many 
locations, TT Electronics is committed to making a sustainable, 
positive impact on the local communities in which we operate. 
We do the right thing
We strive to always act with integrity, transparency and 
professionalism. We look to do the right thing by our people, 
customers, suppliers, shareholders and for our local communities, 
where we work to ensure our actions have a positive impact on 
society and the environment. Each of our sites is engaged in 
activities to take steps to support the local communities in which we 
operate. As an organisation, we hold ourselves to high ethical and 
business standards.
Working with the communities in which we operate
TT has a global footprint comprising 17 manufacturing sites 
and four sales and engineering offices. At a number of our sites, we 
have been a local employer for many years, and we encourage our 
employees to play an active role in supporting the local community. 
In 2017, we engaged in a number of activities around the world to 
give something back to the communities we work in. TT and our 
employees raised over £50,000 to support charities globally in 
addition to giving hundreds of hours of support to those most in 
need in our communities. 
Our US sites have been supporting the hurricane relief effort after 
the devastation caused by Irma, Maria and Harvey across the 
Caribbean. This included sending relief supplies to Dominica, 
including personal care items, non-perishable food, water, clothing 
and baby food. 
In Kuantan, Malaysia, our employees supported a local school by 
repairing and refurbishing their computer laboratory which had 
been damaged in a flood. At the same time, the team ran a “TT lab” 
at the school to raise pupils’ interests in a career in electronics. In all, 
almost 400 children took part from nine local schools, with the 
initiative featured on national television. 
Richard Tyson, CEO, along with the head office team from 
Woking raised more than £11,600 taking on the Yorkshire Three 
Peaks Challenge in the UK for the Salters’ Institute, a 100-year old 
institution whose aim is to excite and encourage young people to 
take up a long-term interest in science, technology, engineering and 
maths (STEM); together with the Woking and Sam Beare Hospices. 
The gruelling walk stretched over 24.5 miles and a combined 5,200ft 
(1,585m) of ascent which the team completed in less than 12 hours. 
The money raised will support the local communities in which we 
operate and encourage young people to pursue STEM subjects and 
enter our industry.
We do the right thing
We bring out the best  
in each other
We achieve more together
We champion expertise
We get the job done… well
We promote the “TT Way”, the culture we 
aspire to, alongside our strategy, to develop 
and guide the way we behave. The principles

Inspiring the next generation of engineers
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) are 
vital to the economic future, and STEM skills are more in demand 
than ever in the workplace. TT supports the development of future 
generations of engineers. We focus on supporting local STEM 
partnerships to promote careers in electronics and related fields. 
We also support initiatives that encourage more girls to study STEM 
subjects at school, and more women to enter our industry. During 
the year, we established an Enterprise Adviser role with a school local 
to our Bedlington site in the UK to inspire future engineers in the 
community. Our employees have attended careers fairs and festivals, 
sponsored student projects, worked collaboratively with schools 
hosting student site visits and we have allowed employees to 
volunteer time supporting school projects.
We support and promote apprentice schemes across TT. We have 
apprentices in engineering, maintenance, operations, finance and 
business administration functions and the schemes are key to our 
talent management and succession planning.
Ethics
TT holds ethical standards in high regard, operating with integrity and 
to one standard worldwide. We do not tolerate corruption or bribery 
in any form, and are committed to maintaining the fundamental 
principles of fairness, honesty and common sense which lie at the 
heart of the Group’s philosophy, values and corporate standards. We 
operate effective systems and processes to counter corrupt practices, 
including an anonymous “whistleblower” reporting facility via which 
individuals can notify us of concerns. 
Whistleblowing issues are reported directly to management or 
through the Group’s multi-lingual, anonymous ethics and integrity 
portal. Significant issues are reported to the Audit Committee and, 
in each instance, cases are investigated in detail and appropriate 
action taken.
Strong business ethics form the basis of our relationships with all 
of our key stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners 
and suppliers. Our Statement of Values and Business Ethics Code 
sets out the operating principles to which we adhere, which cover 
a diverse range of issues including anti-bribery, information 
assurance, intellectual property protection, fair competition, the 
working environment (including standards of behaviour expected 
from our employees), hospitality/entertainment and avoiding 
conflicts of interest. 
Day-to-day oversight of ethics and compliance-related matters is 
undertaken by our Corporate and Social Responsibility Committee, 
which is supported by a dedicated Environmental, Health and Safety 
Committee, under the leadership of our EVP Operations and Supply 
Chain. For any matters of particular concern, an Ethics Committee is 
convened on an ‘as needed’ basis, constituted from members of the 
Executive Management Board.
42 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com Human rights
TT is committed to upholding the human rights of our workers 
and to treating them with dignity and respect as understood by 
the international community. Our Human Rights Code is contained 
within the Responsible Business Alliance (formally the Electronics 
Industry Citizenship Coalition) Code of Conduct (see below) and 
covers all workers including permanent, temporary, migrant, 
student, contract, direct and indirect. Our Code details expected 
labour standards and is supported by our Modern Slavery policy 
which can be found on our website: www.ttelectronics.com. 
We do not tolerate practices which contravene international 
standards. Regulatory demands upon us vary considerably around 
the world; however, we have established a core structure to ensure 
that Group companies fully comply with legislative and regulatory 
requirements while permitting them to tailor their approach to 
particular local needs.
Everyone in TT is responsible for having due regard for human 
rights. Managers and supervisors must provide leadership that 
promotes human rights as an equal priority to other business issues. 
All employees are responsible for ensuring that their own actions 
do not impair the human rights of others, and are encouraged to 
bring forward, in confidence, any concerns they may have about 
human rights.
Upholding high standards – Responsible Business 
Alliance (RBA)
We maintain an active involvement with the RBA
The RBA’s Code of Conduct provides guidelines for performance and 
compliance in five critical areas: Environment, Ethics, Health & Safety, 
Labour and Management Systems. In particular, the Code of Conduct 
establishes standards to ensure that working conditions are safe, 
that workers are treated with respect and dignity and that business 
operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. 
All of our manufacturing facilities complete an RBA survey on a 
periodic basis, which measures performance and social practices, as 
well as the performance of social and environmental management 
systems. The most recent evaluation exercise demonstrated high 
levels of adherence to the Code of Conduct for sites across the Group, 
leading to them all being assessed as either “low” or “medium” risk.
Mindful of our environment
We are mindful of the environment in which we operate and monitor 
greenhouse gas emissions so we are aware of the impact we have on 
the environment. During the year, we started a number of initiatives to 
reduce our environmental footprint, including the introduction of LED 
lighting at many of our sites where we saw an opportunity to improve 
the lighting quality in production areas alongside our energy 
efficiency. This has resulted in a notable reduction in our carbon 
dioxide footprint from electricity. For the year ended 31 December 
2017, the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions (detailed below) were 
calculated using the latest factors for converting energy usage to 
carbon dioxide equivalent emissions published by DEFRA and the 
International Energy Agency in 2017. The comparative figures for 
2016 have been re-stated for the continuing operations following 
the divestment of the Transportation division.

cent) of our emissions overall. 
(2) 2016 figures were calculated using the factors for converting energy usage 
to carbon dioxide equivalent emissions published by DEFRA in 2015.
The Group has chosen to adopt emissions per £1 million of revenue 
as its intensity ratio. For 2017, emissions were 79.4 tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent per £1 million of revenue (2016: 102.4 tonnes).

Compliance
TT places a strong emphasis on business integrity. We ensure that 
we operate in an environment in which innovation can flourish 
within a compliance and risk-focused culture. 
During 2017, we have continued to work hard to develop a 
more integrated approach to governance, risk and compliance. 
Compliance with laws and regulation has been identified as one of 
our principal Group-level risks, and is monitored on a regular basis 
by the Risk Committee, with appropriate mitigations being adopted 
as required. Given the Group’s focus on defence and aerospace, we 
have continued to develop and enhance our training programmes 
and policies in the areas of export controls. This programme of work 
complements an additional focus on enhancing cyber and 
information security policies and controls during 2017.
Treating our people with respect, equal opportunities 
and diversity
TT is committed to employment policies that provide and promote 
equal employment opportunities for all our employees and applicants, 
and to maintaining a workplace that ensures tolerance, respect and 
dignity for all staff. No employee, applicant, contractor or temporary 
worker should be treated less favourably, victimised or harassed on 
the grounds of disability, sex, marital or civil partnership status, 
race, nationality, colour, ethnicity, religion or similar philosophical 
belief, sexual orientation, age or any distinction other than merit. 
A copy of our Gender Pay Gap report can be found on our website 
www.ttelectronics.com. Consideration is always given to human 
rights principles as part of the Group’s working practices.
Modern slavery
TT is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all of our 
business dealings. As part of this commitment, TT has adopted a 
zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, whether in the form of 
servitude; forced, bonded, or indentured labour; slavery; human 
trafficking or any other activity that amounts to an unreasonable 
restriction on the free movement of workers. 
Our business model is based on providing our customers with 
engineered products, services and expertise for performance-critical 
applications. In meeting our customers’ requirements, we operate 
procurement programmes through global supply chains, involving 
a wide network of suppliers and distributors. It is recognised that 
within this structure (as with all other participants operating in 
our business sector), the potential exists for the human rights of 
individual workers to be violated. During 2017, new controls have 
been implemented to ensure that these factors are considered as 
part of the engagement and ongoing use of TT’s supplier base.
The Board has adopted a policy on modern slavery, setting out the 
standards we expect from all our employees, contractors, suppliers, 
distributors and other business partners. A copy of our modern slavery 
statement can be found on our website www.ttelectronics.com
Engaging our people
It is important to us that our employees, at all of our sites globally, 
feel part of our BE TT strategy, building expertise in TT. Engaged 
employees are critical to our success; our employees make TT the 
organisation it is today. 
We ask employees to participate in an employee engagement survey 
each year to gather feedback on their views. In 2017, our employee 
survey received an overall response rate of 87 per cent, up from 77 
per cent in 2016; our engagement score improved by 4 per cent. 
We communicate frequently and openly with our employees, and 
we received strong feedback from employees, telling us they know 
how their role contributes to the strategy. We continue to promote 
the “TT Way”, our aspired to culture that is open, transparent and 
collaborative. At all levels, we encourage and support a high degree 
of openness and equality which will continue to make TT a great 
place for our employees to work. We strive to maintain engagement 
with our employees at all stages, from application through to 
retirement. We approach interaction with openness, honesty and 
integrity, building strong relationships on trust. Collaboration across 
the Group helps us share our learnings and expertise, improving the 
way we operate and serve our customers.
We have a “BE Inspired” programme to recognise teams and 
individuals that excel in demonstrating the “TT Way” behaviour. 
In 2017, we received over 1,700 nominations for these awards, 
demonstrating high levels of engagement and the desire of our 
employees to recognise and support their colleagues.
44 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com Our employees
Our employees are our expertise. Through training and developing 
our employees and working together, we unlock the potential of TT.
We have 4,216 employees across TT, 52 per cent of whom are 
female, and 48 per cent of whom are male.

Creating a positive working environment at all of our sites is of 
paramount importance to us at TT. We strive to build a supportive, 
diverse and engaging place to work, while nurturing a high 
performance culture across the Group, built around the “TT Way”.
Training and developing our people
“Building expertise” is at the centre of our growth strategy 
and we are committed to growing the expertise of our people. 
Personal development is important to TT as well as furthering 
individual careers.
We continue to invest and prioritise the training and development 
of our people, equipping people with the right skills to do their jobs 
well, enabling them to unlock their potential and the potential of TT.
Alongside Group-wide training and development initiatives, we 
provide a range of specific and tailored training to meet business 
needs. Our master lean practitioner (MLP) training has ensured 
we promote our operational efficiency improvements and our 
operational excellence practices are now well embedded in our 
organisations. Our MLPs are now training a new cohort of MLPs, 
sharing skills and best practice among our organisation.
We also run a number of informal local initiatives relevant to local 
site requirements to update and refresh skills. For example, in Suzhou, 
40 employees from across departments took part in both group and 
individual competitions which tested 13 basic skills in areas covering 
manufacturing, warehouse, quality control and the office. 
We will continue to develop and engage our people, who have 
the expertise to put our customers ahead. With the continued 
commitment of our employees, we have increasingly worked 
as “One TT” and shaped a successful performance in the year.

A Board that is committed to 
maintaining the highest standards

Neil Carson
Chairman
In the past year, we have continued to build on our governance 
processes, with a view to promoting the long-term success of the 
Group, supporting the delivery of our strategic goals and unlocking 
the potential of the business. I am pleased to report that we have 
made significant progress on a number of fronts. 
The sale of the Transportation division to AVX represented the 
key strategic priority for TT in 2017. Before the announcement of 
the transaction in July, much of the Board’s attention was focused 
on reviewing the valuations of the competing bids, then approving 
the terms of the sale to AVX and the content of the Class 1 Circular 
to shareholders. I am delighted we were able to conclude this 
strategically important transaction in an efficient and timely 
manner, and welcomed the overwhelming support of our 
shareholders in approving the sale (with over 99.9% of the 
total proxy votes cast having been recorded in favour of 
the transaction).
I am pleased to report that, despite the extensive efforts 
involved in concluding the sale of the Transportation division, 
the Board has maintained a strong focus on its wider governance 
responsibilities, including the delivery of the Group’s operational 
plans, and monitoring performance in key areas of operations, such 
as health & safety, the BE Lean operational efficiency programme, 
talent management, R&D initiatives and M&A planning. Furthermore, 
the Board remains focused on ensuring the Group’s risk management 
procedures meet the long-term needs of the business and its wider 
strategic goals. This demonstrates the commitment of the Board to 
maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance, which 
we view as being a key factor in the future success of the Group. 
In addition, the Board confirms that in relation to its governance 
processes, the Group has complied fully with the requirements of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) throughout 2017.
In 2016, we refreshed our Board structure to ensure we had an 
appropriate balance of skills and experience to meet the future 
needs of the business. I am pleased to report that our new Non-
executives, Jack Boyer and Alison Wood, have made an immediate 
contribution to the Board, which was particularly important in a year 
of significant strategic change. Based on this experience, and the 
expected outcomes from the initiatives described below, the 
Board considers that it now has the right composition to move 
TT Electronics through the next phase of its development. As a 
result, we felt further changes to the Board were unnecessary in 
2017, and are not contemplating any in the immediate future. 
The Board has worked hard in the past year to create an environment 
designed to maximise the contribution of each individual Director. A 
key part of this process was to provide our new Non-executives with a 
thorough induction programme covering TT’s main operations. Just as 
important was the move we undertook in 2017 to enhance the data 
available to the Board on topics of strategic importance. As a result, we 
have now re-focused our reporting processes to ensure that the Board 
has a more detailed understanding of TT’s business dynamics in key 
areas of operations such as technology roadmaps and portfolio 
performance. We think this will be of enormous benefit to the 
Board as TT pursues targeted M&A opportunities.
46 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com Given TT’s position as a FTSE SmallCap company, there is no formal 
requirement to conduct periodic external Board evaluation, as would 
be the case for a listed company with a larger market capitalisation. 
Nevertheless, as part of our two-day Strategic Planning review in July, 
we arranged for a highly respected external facilitator (who works on 
Board development activities for a number of FTSE 100 and FTSE 
250 clients) to review the operational dynamics of the Board and 
comment on areas of potential improvement and opportunities for 
further collaboration. This was a highly productive exercise, which 
built upon one-on-one interviews conducted prior to the meeting. 
A key part of this process involved the Board undertaking a detailed 
assessment of the kind of business TT might aspire to be in the future, 
as well as the Board’s risk appetite in leading the substantial 
anticipated growth in TT’s business.
During 2017, we continued to structure our meetings so as to 
maximise the opportunity for Non-executives to interact with a 
range of employees across the business, which included attending 
the TT Leadership Conference in May, as well as an Executive 
Management Board dinner and one-off site visits. As Chairman, 
I remain committed to ensuring that Non-executive Directors are 
afforded every opportunity to develop their understanding of TT’s 
markets, products and customers as we prepare for the next phase 
in the Group’s development.
Diversity is considered to be a key business enabler across the 
Group, and the Board seeks to ensure that equal opportunity is 
afforded to all, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background or 
religious belief. As stated in last year’s report, we do not advocate 
a forced approach to diversity at any level of the organisation. 
Nevertheless, we believe the steps we took in 2016 to change the 
balance of the Board have resulted in a positive mix of skills and 
competencies necessary to meet the strategic and operational 
needs of the business in the future. 
In conclusion, I am encouraged by the continuing progress we have 
made in the past year in aligning the Board’s governance processes 
to the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives, by focusing on 
those strategic priorities where the Board considers it can add most 
value. I look forward to continuing this progression in the coming 
year, as TT moves into the next stage in its development.

51 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TT Electronics plc www.ttelectronics.com
Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information Leadership
UK Corporate Governance Code Compliance Statement
TT is committed to achieving and maintaining the highest standards 
of corporate governance. We have complied with the main and 
supporting principles of good corporate governance set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2016 (“the Code”) throughout the year 
ended 31 December 2017. Details and explanations of the 
application of the principles of corporate governance are set out in 
the following pages of this Governance section. 
Details of TT’s Board of Directors are set out on pages 48 and 
49 of this report. Pages 52 to 53 provide further information on 
how leadership at the Board level is discharged. Most importantly, 
the Board comprises a majority of independent Non-executive 
Directors, with the division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer having been clearly articulated. There 
were no changes in the composition of the Board during 2017.
The Board believes that its composition, the structure of its principal 
committees and the processes it has in place to discharge its 
primary areas of responsibility, meet the requirements of 
“Leadership” and “Effectiveness” under the Code. 
Relations with stakeholders 
With regard to shareholder engagement, the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer meet with institutional investors 
immediately after publication of the annual and interim results, 
and on an ongoing basis as required. In 2017, this included investor 
roadshows held over a total of 17 days in respect of the annual and 
interim results. Feedback on Investor Relations issues is reported to 
the Board so that all Directors develop an understanding of major 
shareholders’ views on the Company. We issue trading updates and 
press releases as appropriate, and the Company’s brokers provide 
briefings on shareholder opinion, and compile independent feedback 
from investor meetings. Information offered at analysts’ meetings, 
together with our financial press releases, is available on the Group’s 
website. The Directors also use the Annual General Meeting to 
communicate with both institutional and private investors, which 
was repeated in August 2017 at the General Meeting to approve 
the sale of the Transportation Sensing and Control division.
From a wider stakeholder perspective, the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chief Financial Officer visit the majority of the Group’s 
manufacturing sites during the course of each year, and this 
exercise was repeated in 2017 (other than the sites sold as part of 
the divestment of the Transportation division). During these visits, 
we schedule a “town-hall-style” meeting where employees are 
encouraged to ask questions of the Executive Management team. 
We supplemented this staff engagement process in 2017 with an 
increased focus on site-level “Corporate Social Responsibility” 
initiatives, as described on pages 40 to 45 of this report. These 
included dedicated Health & Safety, “Wellbeing” and “Community” 
based programmes. We also use the TT quarterly magazine, “BE TT 
News”, as a means of increasing employee engagement, as well as 
the annual Employee Engagement survey, which we run across all 
TT sites. The Non-executive Directors are encouraged to attend 
events such as the annual Leadership Conference and to visit 
manufacturing sites in order to meet a wider range of employees 
beyond the Executive Directors and members of the Executive 
Management Board (‘EMB’).
The key interactions with customers are primarily channelled 
through the Divisional Executive Vice Presidents (“EVPs”) and 
their management teams, supported by the CEO. However, we 
encourage the wider EMB team to support customer initiatives 
wherever possible, to maintain a current understanding of the 
challenges faced by the customer base and how TT is best placed 
to provide an effective response. The CEO reports key customer 
initiatives to the Board at each scheduled meeting.
The Board
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, UK legislation 
and any directions given by special resolution, the Board manages 
the Company’s business. The Board’s main roles are to provide 
leadership to the management of the Group, and to determine the 
Group’s strategy and ensure it is implemented. The Board has also 
reserved certain specific matters to itself for decision. These include 
financial policy and policy relating to acquisition and disposal. The 
Board appoints its members, and those of its principal Committees, 
having received the recommendations of the Nominations 
Committee. It also reviews recommendations of the Board 
Committees and the financial performance and operation of the 
Group’s businesses. It regularly reviews the identification, evaluation 
and management of the principal risks faced by the Group and the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control.
During 2017, the Board comprised two Executive Directors (Richard 
Tyson and Mark Hoad) and five Non-executive Directors (Neil Carson, 
Stephen King, Michael Baunton, Jack Boyer and Alison Wood), who all 
served throughout the year. Stephen King served as Senior 
Independent Non-executive Director throughout 2017.
Board and Committee meetings are scheduled in line with the 
Company’s financial calendar, thereby ensuring that the latest 
operating data is available for review and sufficient time and focus 
can be given to matters under consideration. During the year, there 
were seven principal Board meetings on scheduled dates, for which 
full notice was given.
We hold additional meetings as and when required, and during 
2017 three such meetings took place (principally to consider M&A 
opportunities, including the divestment of the Transportation division 
and to discuss the recommended offer for Stadium Group plc). Each 
Board meeting during 2017 discussed strategic issues, and there was a 
two-day Board event in July 2017 devoted to consideration of strategic 
issues. The Board has held two principal meetings to date during 2018, 
plus one additional meeting to discuss the recommended offer for 
Stadium Group plc. We provide full details of each Director’s Board 
and Committee meeting attendance on page 54 and in the relevant 
Committee report.
Directors
We show Directors’ biographies, including the Committees 
they serve on and chair, on pages 48 and 49. At the time of his 
appointment as Chairman, Neil Carson was considered to be 
independent in accordance with the provisions of the Code. All the 
remaining Non-executive Directors are also considered to be 
independent as defined by the Code.
52 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, Directors 
must offer themselves for re-election at the first Annual General 
Meeting held following their initial appointment, and every three 
years after that. However, continuing the best practice first 
adopted at the 2013 AGM, all Directors will retire and, if eligible, 
offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. Following 
formal performance evaluation, the Board has concluded that the 
performance of each Director continues to be effective and to 
demonstrate commitment to the role.

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer has been defined, formalised in writing, 
and approved by the Board:
The Chairman maintains responsibility for: the leadership and 
effectiveness of the Board, and for setting its agenda; ensuring all 
Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information on financial, 
business and corporate matters so they can participate in Board 
decisions effectively; facilitating the effective contribution of 
Non-executive Directors in particular; ensuring constructive relations 
between Executive and Non-executive Directors; and ensuring 
effective communication with shareholders. He is also responsible for 
ensuring the performance of individual Directors, the Board as a 
whole, and its Committees are evaluated at least once a year.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the operations of 
the Group. In particular, he is responsible for developing Group 
objectives and strategy, having regard to the Group’s responsibilities 
to its shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders 
and, following presentation to, and approval by, the Board, for the 
successful implementation and achievement of those strategies 
and objectives. His other areas of responsibility include: managing 
the Group’s risk profile, including its health and safety performance; 
ensuring the Group’s businesses are managed in line with strategy 
and approved business plans, and complying with applicable 
legislation and Group policy; ensuring effective communication 
with shareholders; and setting Group human resource policies, 
including management development and succession planning 
for the senior executive team.
Board procedures
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group 
General Counsel & Company Secretary and are offered training to 
fulfil their role as Directors, both on appointment and subsequently. 
There is an agreed procedure for any individual Director to take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense if they 
consider it necessary.
In accordance with the provisions on conflicts of interest in the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company has put in place procedures 
for the disclosure and review of any conflicts, or potential conflicts, 
of interest which the Directors may have, and for the authorisation 
of such conflicts by the Board. In deciding whether to authorise a 
conflict or potential conflict, the Directors must have regard to their 
general duties under the Companies Act 2006. 
The authorisation of any conflict, and the terms of authorisation, 
may be reviewed at any time and, in accordance with best practice, 
we conduct a review of Director conflicts of interest annually.
Each member of the Board, including the Senior Independent 
Director, has the right to include items on the Board agenda or 
the agenda of the Committees they sit on.
Board Committees
The Board has established a number of Committees, each with its 
own delegated authority defined in terms of reference. The Board 
reviews these terms periodically, and receives reports and copies 
of minutes of Committee meetings. The Board appoints the 
members of all principal Board Committees, having received 
the recommendations of the Nominations Committee.
Principal committees
The principal committees are the Nominations, Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. Details of the Nominations and Audit 
Committees, including brief descriptions of their terms of reference 
(full details of which are available for inspection by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting and on the Group’s website) and 
duties, together with a summary of significant events which have 
taken place during the year, can be found on pages 56 to 61. Details 
of the Remuneration Committee and its activities are contained 
within the Remuneration report on pages 62 to 80.

Michael Baunton 7 of 7
Stephen King 7 of 7
Jack Boyer 7 of 7
Alison Wood 7 of 7
Additional meetings of the Board and its principal committees take 
place as and when required throughout the year. During 2017, there 
were three such meetings. By necessity, these meetings are often 
convened at shorter notice than would be the case for principal 
meetings, although in 2017, each member of the Board recorded 
full attendance.
Beyond the principal meetings, the Board takes the opportunity to 
discuss important strategic and operational issues at Board dinners, 
which are scheduled to coincide with the principal meetings. The 
Non-executive Directors meet, without the Executive Directors 
present, at the end of each scheduled Board meeting, as a standing 
agenda item.
The Board very much focuses on organising its activities with a view to 
promoting the long-term success of the Group. This is demonstrated 
by the fact that a significant part of each scheduled Board meeting is 
now devoted to considering strategic priorities for TT, which (in 2017) 
included a two-day meeting devoted to strategic planning activities. 
This increased focus on strategic initiatives resulted in the successful 
completion of the sale of the Transportation division in October 2017, 
which received the overwhelming support of shareholders in General 
Meeting. Given that the transformation of the Group remains a key 
agenda item, the Board has taken steps to analyse how it can 
contribute most effectively to the further development of the Group 
(as described in further detail on page 47), with a view to positioning 
TT to meet its future growth aspirations by deploying the proceeds 
of the sale of the Transportation division in the most efficient 
manner possible. 
Directors’ attendance at meetings of the principal Committees 
on which they serve are detailed in the Nominations, Audit and 
Remuneration Committee reports on pages 56, 58 and 62.
Other committees
Corporate Responsibility Committee
The Corporate Responsibility Committee is chaired by the Chief 
Executive Officer and also comprises one independent Non-executive 
Director and four other senior executives from within the Group. The 
Committee met twice during 2017, with much of the deployment of 
CSR resource (in areas such as STEM and charitable giving) being 
managed at an individual site level. The Board receives regular 
reports on its activities. 
The Corporate Responsibility Committee typically focuses its 
attention on five principal work streams, namely health and safety, 
environmental, human resources (under the theme “developing 
tomorrow’s workforce”), supporting local communities and ethics. 
The operations of the Group’s Health and Safety Council (which 
consists of representatives from all divisions and is chaired by the EVP 
Operations, Michael Robinson) directly feed into the Committee and 
are also considered in detail by the EMB (as the first item on each 
agenda) and the Board. 
Further information on the activities of the Corporate Responsibility 
Committee is given in “The TT Way” corporate responsibility section 
on pages 40 to 45.
Risk Committee
The Risk Committee assists the Board and the Audit Committee in 
fulfilling their responsibilities by: providing a framework for managing 
risks throughout the Group; monitoring risk appetite and exposure 
through regular reviews of principal risks; reviewing the effectiveness of 
risk management processes and controls; and providing an appropriate 
level of reporting on the status of risk management within the Group.
The composition of the Risk Committee is the same as that of the 
Executive Management Board, and meetings are scheduled quarterly 
to align with meetings of the EMB. The Committee met three times in 
the past year. 
Further information on the Group’s risk management activities and 
framework is given in the Risk management section on pages 26 
and 27 and in the Review of internal controls on page 57.
Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee comprises the Executive Directors and has 
been established to review the potential existence of inside information 
across the Group, to manage the disclosure of such information, and to 
establish and maintain project insider lists, in accordance with UK 
securities law and regulation (including the Market Abuse Regulations).
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the budgets for 2018 and the projections 
for 2019 developed during the 2017 annual strategic planning cycle. 
They have assessed the future funding requirements of the Group and 
compared them with the level of available borrowing facilities. Based 
on this, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.

Board and Committee performance evaluation
In accordance with the Code, the Board conducted an evaluation 
of its performance and that of its principal committees during 
2017. The Company’s FTSE SmallCap classification means there 
is no formal requirement to conduct external Board evaluation. 
Nevertheless, as part of the Board’s Strategic Review exercise 
conducted in July 2017, the Company engaged an external 
facilitator (with expertise in the area of Board development) to 
review the operational dynamics of the Board and comment on 
areas of potential improvement and opportunities for further 
collaboration. This process was supported by one-on-one interviews 
conducted with members of the Board prior to the meeting. A key 
part of this exercise involved the Board undertaking a detailed 
assessment of the kind of business TT might aspire to be in the 
future, as well as the Board’s risk appetite in leading the 
substantial anticipated growth in the Group’s business.
In addition to the externally facilitated exercise described above, 
the Board also conducted an internal performance evaluation 
programme towards the end of 2017, led by the Chairman (as 
described below). The Board reflected on the positive developments 
made during 2017, particularly in the areas identified as points for 
improvement in the prior year’s evaluation exercise, which included 
increased focus on TT culture, employee engagement and product/
technology profiling. Overall, the Board concluded it had performed 
satisfactorily in 2017. 
Directors’ performance evaluation
In accordance with the Code, the performance of individual 
Directors was also evaluated during 2017.
For the Non-executive Directors, the output from a private meeting 
held between the Chairman and the Executive Directors formed 
the basis for individual appraisals held by the Chairman with each 
Non-executive Director. This also provided an opportunity to discuss 
any issues which had arisen from either their individual assessments or 
those of the Board and its principal committees. For the Chairman’s 
performance, the other Non-executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Non-executive Director, and with input from the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, met privately to discuss 
this, with the outcomes being fed back to the Chairman by the Senior 
Independent Director for discussion.
At the beginning of the year, we set each Executive Director 
challenging performance objectives, and reviewed progress 
against these as the year progressed. Both the Executive Directors 
take part in the Group’s performance management programme 
which, together with a review of progress against agreed goals and 
objectives, is used to assess performance and to set clear objectives 
and developmental plans for the following year (which are closely 
aligned with the Group’s strategic priorities and values). The Chief 
Executive Officer meets with the Chief Financial Officer at the 
beginning of each year to discuss and review performance against 
objectives. The Chairman conducted performance evaluation of 
the Chief Executive Officer, taking account of the output from 
the Group’s performance management programme together 
with feedback provided by the other Non-executive Directors 
at a private meeting held to discuss this and any other matters 
which the Non-executive Directors wished to raise.

Committee meetings in 2017
During 2017, the Committee held two formal meetings. 
The Committee has held no meetings to date during 2018.
2017 review
The Committee seeks to ensure that the Board of TT Electronics 
is balanced and effective, with diverse skills, knowledge and 
experience. Diversity and gender inclusiveness span the whole 
Group and are important and enduring considerations in the 
search for, and selection of, Board members.
In 2016, the Committee refreshed the Board structure to ensure 
it had an appropriate balance of skills and experience to meet 
the future needs of the business. This exercise resulted in the 
appointment of Jack Boyer and Alison Wood to the Board during 
2016. The Committee continued to review the composition of the 
Board during 2017, but concluded that no further changes were 
necessary in 2017. The Committee also considered succession 
planning at the CEO and CFO level during 2017, as well as for 
other members of the EMB.
The Committee continues to consider that diversity quotas at 
Board level are inappropriate, and is committed to recruiting the 
best talent available, based on merit and assessed against objective 
criteria of skills, knowledge, independence and experience. Its 
primary objective is to ensure TT Electronics maintains the 
strongest possible leadership.
Whilst there is no formal policy in place, the Board attaches a high 
degree of importance to diversity at all levels across the Group, 
which has been reinforced in each Annual Report over the past 
couple of years. Equally important is the need to ensure staff skills 
and competencies are matched to the strategic and operational 
needs of the business in its core markets. Details of the number of 
employees, senior managers and Directors of each gender are given 
in “The TT Way” corporate responsibility section on page 45.
Performance evaluation
The Committee assessed its performance in 2017 by reviewing its 
activities during the year against its terms of reference. It concluded 
that it had performed satisfactorily and is structured appropriately 
to provide effective support to the Board.

Review of internal controls
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, 
the Directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s systems 
of risk management and internal control, and for reviewing their 
effectiveness at least annually. These systems have been in place 
for the full financial year. The Group remains committed to a policy 
of maintaining appropriate internal control over all of its activities. 
Controls are designed to provide the Directors with reasonable 
assurance that assets are safeguarded, transactions are properly 
authorised, and that material errors and irregularities are prevented 
or, if controls are failing, are discovered and mitigated on a timely 
basis. The systems of control are reviewed regularly and improved 
where necessary, to meet the Group’s requirements, as described 
above. Business risk evaluation takes place at operating company, 
divisional and Group levels through regular performance reviews and 
as part of the annual budget preparation process. Having identified 
risks, operating companies and divisions then monitor, review and 
update the associated controls to mitigate the risks appropriately.
Further details of the Group’s exposure to risk and the processes 
in place to manage the same are set out on pages 26 to 29.
The risk management procedures and systems of internal control 
are designed to identify and assess the principal risks the Group 
faces, and to manage them appropriately. However, the systems 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute protection against 
material misstatement or loss.
Principal features of the system of internal control
The Directors meet as a Board at least every other month, to monitor 
financial performance, give direction on significant strategic and 
financial issues and review the principal risks of the Group.
The Chief Executive Officer chairs a Committee (the Executive 
Management Board) consisting of the Executive Directors, Divisional 
Executive Vice Presidents (i.e. heads of divisions) and other senior 
functional leaders (e.g. Operations/Supply Chain, Legal and HR). 
The Executive Management Board holds meetings on a monthly 
basis (i.e. face-to-face on six occasions a year, and by teleconference 
each intervening month), reviews business performance and the 
outlook for the Group as a whole, and agrees and implements any 
actions as necessary. In addition, it is responsible for monitoring and 
driving delivery of the Group’s key priorities, and acts as a forum to 
raise and debate significant operational issues.
Each operating company within the Group operates within the 
policies, rules and procedures determined by the Directors and 
communicated through an internet-based Group policies hub. 
The Directors exercise control over operating companies through 
divisional senior executives who monitor and oversee the activities, 
financial performance and controls of each operating company, and 
seek to ensure that these companies comply with Group accounting 
policies when preparing consolidated financial statements. The 
directors of operating companies and heads of business units are 
held accountable for the effectiveness of the implementation and 
maintenance of controls within their companies. This provides 
constant and consistent management.
The Group has appropriate financial planning and reporting 
systems. Management accounts are prepared monthly by each 
operating company comparing actual performance with budget, 
forecast and prior year. The financial performance of each business 
unit is subjected to in-depth formal review at monthly meetings. 
A key purpose of these reviews is to identify potential business risks 
early and agree on suitable and prompt courses of action. Operating 
companies prepare strategic plans and annual budgets and forecasts 
which are consolidated up to a divisional and Group level and are 
reviewed and approved by the divisional senior executives, Group 
management and the Board.
The Group has in place comprehensive control and approval 
procedures which include appropriate authorisation levels. Capital 
investment and other major items of expenditure are made only after 
compliance with appraisal procedures and, if above set levels, only 
with the approval of the Executive Directors and the Board.
Accounting and reporting policies and practices require the Group’s 
accounting records to be prepared accurately and in compliance 
with Group policy and relevant accounting standards.
The Risk and Assurance function reviews the internal control 
environment according to the annual internal audit plan agreed 
with the Audit Committee. In accordance with the decision made 
by the Audit Committee in 2015, the Internal Audit function continued 
to be outsourced to PwC throughout 2017. The reporting line for this 
directed outsource arrangement continues to be through the Chief 
Financial Officer. Responsibility for determining the priority areas 
to be covered by the Internal Audit work programme, as well as 
follow-on mitigation and remediation activities, remains with 
the Group (overseen by the Audit Committee), and includes 
monitoring the delivery of such services (and reporting back 
to the Audit Committee) periodically. 
During 2017, the Group continued to deploy its Financial Controls 
Framework which is to be applied by all entities in the Group. The 
updated Framework drives improvement and consistency in the 
Group’s financial control environment, in many cases deploying 
system based controls to achieve control objectives. We successfully 
deployed the new Framework across all Group sites by the end of 2017, 
meeting the target set at the beginning of the year, with the exception 
of the sites sold as part of the Transportation division divestment.
Certain key functions, including treasury, taxation, pensions, 
provision of legal advice, risk and insurance are controlled at the 
Group’s head office and are monitored by the Executive Directors.
The Directors have reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of risk 
management and internal control during the year to 31 December 
2017 and during the period since then to the date of this report. 
They have made, and will continue to make, improvements 
where necessary.

effectiveness, in line with the requirements of the Code
• the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by the 
Auditor to ensure that their independence and objectivity 
are maintained
• changes to accounting policies and procedures, decisions 
of judgement affecting financial reporting, compliance with 
accounting standards and with the Companies Act 2006

this requirement.
Committee meetings in 2017
During 2017, the Committee held four scheduled meetings.
The Committee met with the Group’s Auditor, KPMG LLP, on three 
occasions during 2017, without executives of the Company being 
present. During the year, the Committee also met representatives 
of the outsourced internal control function once, without other 
executives of the Company being present.
The Committee has held one meeting to date during 2018.
2017 review
To allow the Audit Committee to fulfil its duties regarding the 
integrity of the financial statements and other financial data, the 
Chief Financial Officer and the Group Director of Financial Control 
attend Committee meetings, presenting reports and providing 
analysis and explanations for queries raised. The external Auditor also 
attends, and presents reports on their audits. They address matters 
including an overview of the financial statements, key accounting 
judgements, accounting policies, audit differences and internal 
control matters. On occasion, at the request of the Committee, 
the Chairman and the CEO also attend for part of the scheduled 
Committee meetings.
The Group conducts its internal audit activities under a directed 
outsource arrangement, managed by PwC. Representatives of PwC 
also attend meetings to update the Audit Committee on: progress 
on the internal audit plan; findings and recommendations; and 
team and methodology improvements. The Committee also 
regularly receives updates on the Group’s risk management 
Stephen King
Chairman, Audit Committee
58 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com framework, to allow members to review principal risks and the 
effectiveness of risk management processes.
In addition to standing agenda items, during 2017 the Committee 
also reviewed and considered matters including:
• an assessment of the progress made in the implementation 
of the revised Controls Framework programme, in particular the 
development of the controls environment at individual facilities 
(e.g. standardisation of processes)
• a review of Group controls in the areas of IT and Cyber Security
• the linkage of the Viability statement to the Group risk 
management framework.
Taxation and Treasury policy and procedure were included for 
consideration by the Committee on the 2017 forward planner, but, 
in each case, it was decided these items should be included on the 
Board agenda and considered by the Board as a whole, with specific 
input from the Chairman of the Audit Committee to the Board on 
the principal areas covered.
Whistleblowing matters reported through the Group’s multi-lingual, 
anonymous Ethics and Integrity portal are reported to, and 
considered by, the Committee as and when they arise. 
As with the past year, the Audit Committee has reviewed the 
Financial Reporting Council’s letter of October 2017, addressed 
to FTSE 350 Audit Committee Chairs and CFOs, in the context of 
preparing the 2017 Annual Report. Although the Company was not 
a direct recipient of the FRC’s letter, the Committee considered the 
key recommendations proposed by the FRC in detail and, where 
relevant to the Company, reflected them in this report.
The Committee has reviewed and challenged the form and content 
of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts and Financial Statements 
for 2017. In conducting its review, the Committee considered reports 
prepared by management and the external Auditor. These reports 
covered analyses of the judgements and sources of estimation 
uncertainty involved in applying the accounting policies as 
described in note 1(h) to the financial statements.
The Committee considered and challenged the assumptions 
relating to goodwill, the carrying value of fixed assets, the level of 
provisions held on the balance sheet (as detailed below), the Going 
Concern statement on page 54 and the Viability statement on page 
27. The Committee also considered and challenged items excluded 
from underlying profit and whether these were consistent with the 
accounting policy of the Group.
Significant issues considered in relation to the 
financial statements 
The main areas of judgement and estimation are set out in the 
accounting policies on pages 97 to 104.
The Committee received and reviewed reports from management 
and the external Auditor setting out the significant issues in relation 
to the 2017 financial statements, which related to:
• Underlying profit and restructuring provisions
• Provisions (including taxation, divestment and product warranties)
• Carrying value of goodwill and fixed assets
• Going concern and viability.
They discussed these issues (which are considered in more detail 
below) with management during the year and with the external 
Auditor at the time the Committee reviewed and agreed the external 
Auditor’s Group audit plan; when the external Auditor reviewed the 
half-year results in August 2017; and also at the conclusion of the 
audit of the financial statements. The Committee is also satisfied 
that the significant assumptions used for determining the value of 
assets and liabilities have been appropriately scrutinised and 
challenged, and are sufficiently robust.
Underlying profit
As further explained in note 8 to the financial statements, the Group 
reports non-trading income or expenditure outside of underlying 
profit when the size, nature or function of an item or aggregation of 
similar items is such that separate presentation is relevant to an 
understanding of its financial position. The Committee challenged 
the items that were excluded from underlying profit, but noted that 
Income Statement charges as well as credits had been recorded as 
non-underlying items. They concluded that they were satisfied that 
these were in accordance with the Group’s disclosed accounting 
policy and gave a true and fair view of the Group’s underlying 
financial position.
The Auditor explained to the Committee the work they had 
conducted and the results of their audit procedures on significant 
items recorded outside underlying profit. On the basis of their audit 
work, the Auditor reported no inconsistencies or misstatements to 
the Group’s disclosed accounting policy that were material in the 
context of the financial statements as a whole.
Provisions
(i) Taxation
Current tax provisions held in respect of tax risks are included within 
current tax liabilities depending on the underlying circumstances of 
the provision. Management confirmed to the Committee that the 
provisions recorded at 31 December 2017 represent their best 
estimate of the potential financial exposure faced by the Group. 
The Committee reviewed each significant provision and challenged 
the basis of management’s judgement and concurred with the 
estimates. 
The Auditor explained to the Committee the work they had 
conducted during the year, including how their audit procedures 
were focused on those provisions with the highest level of 
judgement on recognition criteria and/or measurement. On the 
basis of its audit work, the Auditor reported no inconsistencies or 
misstatements that were material in the context of the financial 
statements as a whole.
(ii) Warranty provisions
As further explained in note 2 to the financial statements, a 
provision is recognised in the financial statements when the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be 
reliably measured, will be required to meet the obligation.
Provisions are recognised at an amount equal to management’s 
best estimate of the expenditure required to meet the Group’s 
liability taking into account the time value of money, where this is 
considered material. 
59 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TT Electronics plc www.ttelectronics.com
Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information Audit Committee continued
The Auditor explained to the Committee the work they had 
conducted during the year in this area. On the basis of their audit 
work, the Auditor reported no inconsistencies or misstatements that 
were material in the context of the financial statements as a whole. 
Further information about the specific categories of provisions held 
by the Group is set out in note 19.
Going concern and viability statement
The Committee considered the reports provided by management 
setting out the basis upon which the Directors provided the going 
concern and viability statements, including appropriate 
sensitivity analysis.
Misstatements
Management has confirmed to the Committee that they were not 
aware of any material misstatements or immaterial misstatements 
made intentionally to achieve a particular presentation. The external 
Auditor reported to the Committee the misstatements that they had 
found during their work and that no material amounts remain 
unadjusted. The Committee confirms that it is satisfied that the 
external Auditor has fulfilled their responsibilities with diligence 
and professional scepticism.
After reviewing the presentations and reports from management 
and consulting where necessary with the Auditor, the Audit 
Committee is satisfied the financial statements appropriately 
address the critical judgements and key estimates (both for the 
amounts reported and the disclosures). 
Fair, balanced and understandable
In accordance with the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Board requested the Committee to advise them on whether 
it believed the Group’s Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategic plan. Procedures 
are in place to facilitate the appropriate and timely review of the 
drafts of the Annual Report and specifically to highlight evidence 
of a fair and balanced representation, which supports input and 
challenge from all independent Non-executive Directors, the 
external Auditor and other external advisers. On careful review of 
the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017, and the 
basis for the statement made by the Board on “Fair, balanced and 
understandable” on page 85, the Audit Committee recommended 
to the Board that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategic plan.
Auditor’s independence, objectivity and effectiveness
The Audit Committee assesses the independence of the Auditor 
annually to ensure suitable policies and procedures are in place to 
safeguard the Auditor’s independence and objectivity, having regard 
to length of tenure, provision of non-audit services and the existence 
of any conflicts of interest. KPMG LLP (KPMG) was appointed in July 
2010, at which time their independence had been considered. At the 
time of the latest annual assessment, we reviewed the provision of 
non-audit services, together with KPMG’s Transparency Report, and 
KPMG confirmed there were no conflicts of interest the Audit 
Committee should be aware of. 
Management has confirmed to the Committee that the 
provisions recorded at 31 December 2017 represent their best 
estimate of the potential financial exposure faced by the Group. 
The Committee reviewed each significant provision and challenged 
the basis of management’s judgement and concurred with 
management’s estimates.
The Auditor explained to the Committee the work they had 
conducted during the year, including how their audit procedures were 
focused on those provisions with the highest level of judgement on 
recognition criteria and/or measurement. On the basis of their audit 
work, the Auditor reported no inconsistencies or misstatements that 
were material in the context of the financial statements as a whole.
Further information about the specific categories of provisions held 
by the Group is set out in note 19.
Carrying value of goodwill
As more fully explained in note 14, the total carrying amount 
of goodwill is £100.3 million at 31 December 2017.
Management has assessed the carrying value of goodwill 
using detailed calculations of value in use for each significant 
cash generating unit where impairment indicators existed to 
ensure that the carrying values are supported by forecast future 
discounted cash flows. The Committee reviewed and challenged 
management’s assessment of value in use, the basis of key 
assumptions and sensitivities as outlined in note 14 and concurred 
with management’s assessment. The Auditor explained to the 
Committee the results of their review of the estimate of value in 
use including their challenge of management’s underlying cash 
flow projections, the key growth assumptions, discount rates and 
sensitivity analysis. On the basis of their audit work, no additional 
impairments that were material in the context of the financial 
statements as a whole were identified by the Auditor.
Other items
Legal, divestment and restructuring provisions
As further explained in note 2 to the financial statements, a 
provision is recognised in the financial statements when the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be 
reliably measured, will be required to meet the obligation.
Provisions are recognised at an amount equal to management’s 
best estimate of the expenditure required to meet the Group’s 
liability taking into account the time value of money, where this is 
considered material. On legal and contractual exposures, the 
Committee received periodic reports from the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary outlining the open legal and 
contractual disputes and best estimates of the expected costs 
associated with such matters. As part of this exercise in 2017 
account was taken of legal and contractual exposures associated 
with the divestment of the Transportation division in October 2017.
Management has confirmed to the Committee that the 
provisions recorded at 31 December 2017 represent their best 
estimate of the potential financial exposure faced by the Group. 
The Committee reviewed each significant provision and challenged 
the basis of management’s judgement and concurred with 
management’s estimates.
60 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com The Committee has formally reviewed the independence of the 
Auditor as part of the 2017 review. KPMG has provided a letter to 
the Committee confirming they remain independent within the 
meaning of the relevant regulations and in accordance with their 
professional standards.
The Committee also reviewed the quality and effectiveness of 
the audit programme during the year, including the performance 
of the Auditor. The use of an evaluation questionnaire and an 
auditor assessment survey (completed by heads of finance across 
the Group’s operations), together with information provided by the 
Auditor, assisted in ensuring that a comprehensive assessment was 
undertaken. We identified areas for improvement and 
communicated them to the Auditor for action.
The Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that KPMG 
continues in office as Auditor, and the Directors will be proposing 
the reappointment of KPMG at the Annual General Meeting in 
May 2018.
Policy on non-audit services
The Company has an established policy regarding the provision 
of non-audit services by external auditors. This states that we may 
obtain non-audit services from the most appropriate source, having 
regard to expertise, availability, knowledge and cost. Non-audit 
services where fees are expected to exceed £25,000 should be 
approved, in advance, by the Chairman of the Audit Committee or, 
in his absence, by another member of the Audit Committee. There is 
also a restriction such that fees for non-audit services will not exceed 
those for audit services, paid to the same service provider, for more 
than two consecutive years, unless specifically recommended by 
the Audit Committee and agreed by the Board. The overriding 
preference of the Committee is not to engage the Auditor for 
additional non-assurance services, unless there are compelling 
reasons to the contrary, such as capability, time or cost.
In 2017, audit service fees paid to KPMG were £0.8 million, while non-
audit service fees paid to KPMG totalled £0.2 million. This comprised 
non-audit service fees relating to advisory services relating to Class 1 
transaction work, assistance relating to historical tax issues and UK 
grant claim reviews of £0.2 million. During 2017, non-audit service 
fees paid to KPMG represented 25 per cent of audit service fees paid 
to them during the same period, a decrease compared to 2016. 
The Committee believes that, for these particular areas, KPMG 
was best placed to provide a comprehensive and effective service 
to the Company. 
Performance evaluation
The Committee carried out an assessment of its performance in 
2017 based on a review of its activities during the year against its 
terms of reference. It concluded that it had performed effectively, 
and is structured appropriately to provide effective support to the 
Board. The Committee agreed that as the Group pursued its growth 
agenda pursuant to the strategy set by the Board, it would be 
important to ensure it focused continued attention on the Group’s 
key risks (and the risk management strategies put in place across 
the business units to address them). In addition, it was agreed that 
the outsourced Internal Audit arrangement was working positively.

Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ 
Remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
Executive Directors’ remuneration continues to be evaluated 
in accordance with the Remuneration Policy approved by 
shareholders at the 2017 Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
The full Policy can be found on the Company’s website,  
www.ttelectronics.com, or in the Directors’ Remuneration 
report of the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
TT Electronics’ over-arching reward framework underpins the 
business’ core purpose and strategic priorities and enables it to 
attract, retain and motivate talented people by applying consistent 
yet locally driven reward principles across the Group.
Context and business performance
2017 has been a significant year for TT. The business has had a 
year of strong progress, delivering against the strategic priorities 
set in 2015. We have been focused with our resources and clear in 
our strategy. We have demonstrated our ability to execute major 
organisational and portfolio change following the sale of the 
Transportation division for £123.2m after customary working 
capital and net debt adjustments, net of cash disposed of with the 
business. As a result of the disposal, TT has increased its financial 
capacity and is in a stronger position to accelerate its strategy of 
investing in structural growth markets where there is increasing 
electronic content. The Group has recorded positive organic 
revenue growth from continuing operations of 5 per cent.
Our achievement against our key financial performance indicators 
is as follows:
• Profit Before Tax was £22.0m, up by 28 per cent at constant 
currency in continuing operations
• Free Cash Flow from continuing operations remained strong 
at £4.7m 
• Underlying EPS on a continuing operations basis was 10.9p, 
up by 40 per cent. 
As well as a strong financial performance, good progress has 
been made on TT’s strategy to build leading positions in markets 
with structural growth drivers where there is increasing electronic 
content. We have focused our resources and R&D investment 
in areas where we can develop differentiated capabilities. We 
successfully launched 16 new products this year. Furthermore, we 
continue to build strategic relationships with our customers to help 
them solve their most complex challenges. Our improved customer 
focus is reflected in a number of new contract wins (see page 8 
and pages 30 to 35). We remain focused on continued operational 
excellence including simplifying our supply chain (see pages 10 to 11). 
Finally, we have maintained our commitment to our people, culture 
and engagement. Our employees continue to manage and prioritise 
health and safety, resulting in another year of improved safety 
performance (see page 8 and page 25). 
Alison Wood
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
62 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com Key remuneration outcomes for 2017
The Group continued to grow and perform during the year, 
exceeding our financial targets. The Group also delivered strong 
strategic progress and the Remuneration Committee agreed the 
following outcomes:
• Base salaries for the CEO and CFO were increased by 2.5 
per cent on 1 January 2018, slightly below the average for 
UK employees.
• The 2017 short-term incentive was based on Profit Before 
Tax (50 per cent), Group Free Cash Flow (25 per cent) and 
personal Strategic objectives (25 per cent). For the year 
ended 31 December 2017, Profit Before Tax grew 28 per cent 
to £22.0m which continues the growth trend of the business, 
Free Cash Flow performance was again strong at £4.7m with 
an underlying cash conversion of 98 per cent and the Executive 
Directors achieved their Strategic objectives, which led to 100 
per cent of the maximum incentive payment for the CEO and 
CFO being payable. More detail on the short-term incentive 
outcome is set out on page 73. 
• The Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) award granted in 2014 to the 
CEO was based on two measures, Earnings Per Share (EPS) and 
relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance, measured 
over three years. Performance conditions were not met and the 
award lapsed on the third anniversary of the award. The joining 
LTIP award in 2014 for the CFO was based on relative TSR 
performance measured over a separate three-year period to 
31 December 2017 and vested at 100 per cent of the maximum 
on 1 January 2018. Further details are set out on page 74.
Remuneration Policy and key decisions made 
during the year
In May 2017, we asked shareholders to approve our new 
Remuneration Policy as well as changes to the LTIP. We were 
pleased to receive votes in support from over 96 per cent of our 
shareholders for both of these resolutions. We believe the new 
Policy gives the Committee the right level of scope to ensure that 
remuneration is appropriate and to ensure future arrangements 
continue to align closely with TT’s long-term strategy and deliver 
value to shareholders and other key stakeholders. As ever, the 
Remuneration Committee carefully considers every decision around 
executive remuneration.
During the year, the principal areas covered by the Committee 
included the: 
• assessment of the annual short-term incentive levels 
for Executive Directors for 2016, payable in 2017; 
• evaluation of vesting of the 2014 award under the LTIP for 
the CEO, neither the EPS nor the TSR performance conditions 
were achieved; 
• increasing Executive Directors’ minimum shareholding 
requirement from 100 per cent of salary to 200 per cent of 
salary to reflect current “best practice” governance guidelines;
• grant of the 2017 award under the LTIP, including a review 
of performance targets; 
• review of total remuneration levels for the Chairman, Executive 
Directors and the next level of senior executives; 
• review of the linkage between risk and reward in relation to 
remuneration structure; 
• review of the UK gender pay reporting and the link to our 
Corporate and Social Responsibility;
• review and evaluation of performance conditions under the 
2015, 2016 and 2017 LTIP as part of the portfolio development, 
including external advice;
• review and evaluation of performance conditions under the 
Executive Directors’ 2017 annual short-term incentive plan as 
part of the portfolio development; and
• evaluation of performance conditions for the Executive 
Directors’ 2018 annual short-term incentive plan, based on 
current and stretch performance targets for the business 
together with broker consensus forecasts.
Looking forward to 2018
The LTIP awards in 2018 will be made to reflect the EPS of 
the Group’s continuing operations. Following the sale of the 
Transportation division on 2 October 2017, the Committee worked 
to assess the continued appropriateness of the EPS and TSR 
performance conditions in the 2015, 2016 and 2017 LTIP awards to 
ensure that the incentive arrangements remain fit for purpose. The 
TSR performance conditions remain unchanged across all award 
years. The EPS performance condition in the 2015 awards also 
remains unchanged and performance will be assessed on EPS 
including the underlying earnings of the Transportation division prior 
to the sale on 2 October 2017. We have adjusted the 2016 and 2017 
EPS performance conditions to reflect the dilution and maintain the 
Executive Directors’ focus on delivering the Company strategy for the 
remainder of the performance periods, recognising the improvements 
made in the business culminating in the sale of the Transportation 
division ahead of expectations. The Committee believes that the 
adjusted performance conditions retain an appropriate level of 
stretch in line with the original performance conditions and are fair, 
reasonable and are materially neither easier nor more difficult to 
achieve. More information is set out on pages 76 to 77.
In the year ahead, the Remuneration Committee will continue 
to monitor general trends in the remuneration of the TT workforce 
to review alignment and consistency with executive rewards. As the 
Company proceeds through a period of change, the Committee, 
working with management, will continue to align incentive 
arrangements with TT’s strategy, business results and 
market demands. 
As always, we value your views as shareholders as part of this 
process. If you would like to discuss any further aspect of our 
remuneration strategy I would welcome your views. I can be 
contacted at alison.wood@ttelectronics.com.

Remuneration principles
• Transparency: in order to engender a fair and collaborative 
culture, total remuneration frameworks should be clear and 
openly communicated.
• Competitive: through a combination of base salaries and 
competitive performance-related incentive schemes, the 
Committee aims to provide competitive total remuneration in 
return for superior performance. Base salaries are designed to 
reflect the requirements of the role and responsibility, together 
with the overall level of individual performance. In ascertaining 
the appropriate level of base salary, account is also taken of 
prevailing market and economic conditions together with salary 
levels across the Group.
• Performance-related: the majority of the Executive and 
senior manager remuneration packages should be determined 
based on the performance of the Group. A significant proportion 
of this is aligned with shareholder interests, based on EPS and 
TSR. Failure to reach set performance thresholds leads to 
no pay-out under the Group’s short-term or long-term 
incentive arrangements.
The Remuneration Policy supports and rewards the achievement 
of the Group’s strategy to delivery profitable and sustainable 
growth. This is driven and evaluated by how the Group performs 
against a variety of KPI’s both financial and non-financial. Our 
remuneration KPI’s below complement the strategic KPI’s on 
pages 24 to 25. The proportion of fixed remuneration and the 
variable components, coupled with the respective KPI is laid 
out below. The short-term and long-term components reflect 
the maximum potential opportunity. The long-term component 
is the intended face value of the 2018 LTIP awards.
Set out over the following pages is a summary of the Remuneration 
Policy that was approved by over 99 per cent of our shareholders at 
the AGM held on 12 May 2017. The full Remuneration Policy can be 
found in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts which can be found 
at www.ttelectronics.com.
Executive Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration 
arrangements should be aligned with the Executives’ underlying 
commitment to act in the best interests of maximising sustainable 
long-term shareholder value creation, whilst ensuring that behaviours 
remain consistent with the governance and values of the business.
Key objectives
The key objectives of the Committee are to deliver 
a remuneration package:
• to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives in a 
challenging and competitive business environment;
• that delivers an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
compensation for each executive;
• that places a strong emphasis on performance, both short-term 
and long-term;
• strongly aligned to the achievement of strategic objectives and 
the delivery of sustainable value to shareholders; and
• that seeks to avoid creating excessive risks in the achievement 
of performance targets.

Consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback 
received in connection with the AGM each year at a meeting 
immediately following the AGM and at other times of the year. This 
feedback is considered as part of the Company’s annual review of the 
Remuneration report and Remuneration Policy. In addition, the 
Remuneration Committee engages directly with major shareholders 
and their representative bodies on the proposals for material changes 
to the Remuneration Policy. During 2017, the Committee engaged 
our major institutional investors and ISS and IVIS on the proposed 
adjustments to the EPS performance conditions in the LTIP following 
the sale of the Transportation division. The Committee received 
limited feedback from institutional investors and feedback received 
was supportive. Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to 
approve last year’s Remuneration report and any matters discussed 
with shareholders during the year are set out in the Directors’ Annual 
Remuneration report.

the Policy remains unchanged.
Element of remuneration Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum Performance targets
Salary
Core element of remuneration. 
Competitive salaries should 
attract and retain the 
best talent.
The Committee considers a number of factors 
in setting salaries, including but not limited to: 
• broader Company policy applied to 
all employees;
• scope of the individual and their 
performance;
• competitiveness compared to companies of 
similar complexity, sector and size;
• ensuring it provides an appropriate level of 
basic fixed income and avoids excessive risk 
arising from over reliance on variable income;
• general external factors such as inflation.
Paid in cash.
Normally reviewed annually, effective 1 January.
There is no prescribed maximum annual increase. 
The Committee is guided by the general increase for the 
broader employee population although larger increases may 
be considered appropriate in certain circumstances (including, 
but not limited to, a change in an individual’s responsibilities 
or in the scale of their role or in the size and complexity of 
the Group).
Larger increases may also be considered appropriate 
if a Director has been initially appointed to the Board 
at a lower than typical salary.
Current base salary levels are set out in the Directors’ Annual 
Remuneration report.
Not applicable, although overall performance is taken into account during 
the salary review.
Pension
Provides a market competitive 
level of provision for 
post-retirement.
The Company contributions may be made into 
a pension scheme or as a salary supplement.
Contributions are set as a percentage of base 
salary only.
Company contributes up to 15% of base salary. Not applicable.
Benefits
Provides market competitive 
benefits at an appropriate cost.
To aid retention and recruitment the Company 
offers a range of cash and benefits in kind to 
Executive Directors.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive benefits, 
which typically may include (but are not limited to):
• cash allowance in lieu of company 
car allowance;
• the provision of private health and 
medical insurance;
• health screening;
• life assurance;
• income protection and critical illness cover.
Where Executive Directors are required to 
relocate, the Committee may offer relocation and, 
if appropriate, additional expatriate benefits. These 
may include but are not limited to, removal and 
other relocation costs, housing or temporary 
accommodation, education, home leave, 
repatriation and tax equalisation.
There is no overall maximum as the level of benefits depends 
on the annual cost of providing individual items in the 
relevant local market and the individual’s specific role:
• the provision of benefits is reviewed on an annual basis 
to ensure appropriateness in terms of type and level;
• the Committee retains flexibility to add or remove 
benefits from the stated list if it considers it appropriate 
and reasonable;
• benefit provision will not exceed what the Committee 
reasonably considers to be a market competitive level.
Not applicable.
Short-term Incentive Plan
To incentivise the delivery of 
annual targets aligned to 
corporate strategy and reward 
delivery of stretch performance.
Incentivises annual delivery of financial and 
strategic goals.
Maximum short-term incentive only payable for 
achieving stretch performance targets.
Paid in cash, not pensionable.
Short-term incentive payments may be 
partially repaid or fully clawed back to the 
Company if any material profit, cash flow, or 
accounting irregularities are identified after 
payment has been made to the extent that such 
errors or irregularities would have affected the 
short-term incentive payable.
The maximum potential is 100 per cent of base salary in 
respect of any financial year.
The Committee considers annual performance targets taking into 
account the Group strategy and corporate plan.
Targets will provide a balance between profit, cash and other strategic 
goals to drive long-term sustainable returns.
The specific measures and weighting are reviewed on an annual basis 
to ensure alignment with strategy and budgets. Specific performance 
measures will be included in the relevant year’s Annual Report.
At least 75 per cent of the short-term incentive will be based on the 
achievement of Group Financial targets.
Target ranges and payout schedules are determined annually by the 
Committee within the maximum short-term incentive potential.
The Committee exercises its judgement on the level of incentive payable 
for outcomes short of maximum to ensure alignment of pay with 
performance and with shareholder interests.

69 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TT Electronics plc www.ttelectronics.com
Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information Notes to Remuneration Policy table:
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising 
any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out 
above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before AGM 
2017 (the date the Company’s shareholders approved the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy); (ii) before the Policy set out above came into 
effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with 
the shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy in force 
at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion 
of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the 
individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes 
“payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms 
of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted.
Performance measures and targets
The Committee believes the choice of performance measures 
for the short-term and long-term incentive plans represent an 
appropriate balance between the short-term and long-term focus of 
the Group’s strategic aims and key performance indicators, as well as 
an appropriate balance between internal and external assessment of 
performance. Performance measures for the short-term incentive are 
tied to the Company’s delivery of key financial metrics and strategic 
objectives. The measures applicable to the LTIP reward the delivery of 
long-term returns to shareholders and the Group’s financial growth 
being consistent with the Company’s objective of delivering superior 
levels of long-term value to shareholders. When setting targets, the 
Committee takes into account a variety of factors, including but not 
limited to market practice, market expectations and internal business 
plans and forecasts. In setting the targets, the Committee ensures 
that they are sufficiently stretching and that there is an appropriate 
balance between incentivising Executive Directors to meet targets for 
the year, whilst ensuring that they do not drive unacceptable levels of 
risk and encourage inappropriate behaviours.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in a number of areas of the 
Policy as set out in the report. The Committee may also exercise 
administrative and operational discretion under plan rules, including 
relevant LTIP rules approved by shareholders. The Committee may 
make minor amendments to the Policy set out in this Policy report 
(for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or 
to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining 
shareholder approval for that amendment.
The Committee may vary or waive any performance condition(s) 
if an event occurs which causes it to determine that the original 
condition(s) have ceased to be appropriate, provided that any such 
variation or waiver is fair, reasonable and not materially less difficult 
to satisfy than the original condition would have been but for the 
event in question (in its opinion). The Committee may also adjust 
the calculation of performance targets and vesting outcomes (for 
instance, for material acquisitions, investments or disposals and 
events not foreseen at the time the targets were set) to ensure they 
remain a fair reflection of performance over the relevant period. In 
the event that the Committee were to make an adjustment of this 
sort, a full explanation would be provided in the next Directors’ 
Annual Remuneration report.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group
The Remuneration Policy described above provides an overview 
of the structure that operates for the most senior executives in 
the Group. Remuneration arrangements for the wider employee 
population are based on the principle that reward should help 
deliver the business strategy and should be sufficient to attract 
and retain talent. To the extent practicable, reward practices for 
Executive Directors are cascaded down the organisation, such that 
employees are aligned towards common goals. 
The Group operates in a number of different geographic territories 
and has many employees who carry out a range of diverse roles. The 
remuneration of all employees, including executives, is set by market 
comparatives and the impact of the role. The ratio between fixed and 
variable pay for employees differs by level, geographic location and 
Division. A number of performance-related pay schemes operate 
across the Group which can differ in structure and metrics from those 
applying to executives. These schemes include a consistent approach 
to site-based profit share schemes which support the delivery 
of our strategic priorities to improve both customer and 
operational performance.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
70 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for the year 
ending 31 December 2018
A summary of how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be 
applied during the year ending 31 December 2018 is set out below.
Basic salary and benefits
The Remuneration Committee agreed to increase Executive 
Director base salary levels by 2.5% with effect from 1 January 
2018, the increase is broadly in line with the general workforce. 
Current base salary levels and those applied during the year ended 
31 December 2017 are as follows:
Executive 2018 2017
Richard Tyson £455,446 £444,338
Mark Hoad £348,283 £339,788
The Group’s UK employees, in general, are receiving pay rises 
averaging 3 per cent depending on location, promotional increases 
and individual performance.
Pension arrangements
The Company contributed 15 per cent of salary either to a defined 
contribution arrangement and/or as a salary supplement for each 
Executive Director. The Committee believes that the pension 
arrangements are acceptable and appropriate, being broadly 
market competitive.
Short-term Incentive Plan
The maximum incentive potential for the year ending 31 December 
2018 will remain at 100 per cent of salary for Executive Directors. 
The split of targets continues to be based on the Group’s financial 
results, being Group Underlying Profit Before Tax (up to 50 per cent of 
salary), Group Underlying Free Cash Flow (up to 25 per cent of salary) 
and Strategic objectives (up to 25 per cent of salary) as set at the 
beginning of the 2018 financial year. 
The Committee believes it is important for Executive Directors that a 
significant proportion of their remuneration is performance-related 
and the performance conditions applying to incentive arrangements 
support the delivery of the Company’s strategy. The Committee does 
not believe that it would be in shareholders’ interests to prospectively 
disclose the actual targets in advance due to issues of commercial 
sensitivity. However, retrospective disclosure will be provided of both 
financial and Strategic objectives used in the prior year in each 
Directors’ Remuneration report, with an explanation as to how the 
Company performed against the targets and resulting payments.
The targets have been set taking account of internal and external 
forecasts relating to the Company’s performance and reflecting the 
Board’s expectation of year-on-year development of the Group. The 
Strategic objectives element has been set to reflect the creation of 
sustainable value for all our stakeholders with a focus on delivery of 
critical operational and strategic goals of the business for the year. 
No award will be payable in respect of the Strategic objectives 
unless specific underlying performance measures are reached.
Long-term Incentive Plan
It is intended that LTIP awards will be made in March 2018, whereby 
the Executive Directors will be granted awards in line with the existing 
Remuneration Policy. Awards will be of shares worth 150 per cent of 
salary for the CEO and 135 per cent of salary for the CFO at the date 
of grant. The awards will vest on the third anniversary of grant to the 
extent the performance targets have been satisfied, followed by a 
two-year holding period. 
As in 2017, the performance targets will be based on EPS and TSR. 
50 per cent of the award will be based on targets for growth in the 
Group’s continuing operations EPS over the three-year period to year 
ending 31 December 2020. 25 per cent of the shares subject to this 
part of the award will vest for EPS growth of 5 per cent compound per 
annum, increasing on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting for 
EPS growth for the year ending 31 December 2020 of 12.5 per cent 
compound per annum. 
50 per cent of the award will be based on the Company’s TSR 
performance targets against the FTSE SmallCap (excluding 
Investment Trusts). The three-year TSR performance period ceases 
on the third anniversary of the award date. 25 per cent of the shares 
subject to this part of the award will vest at median performance 
increasing on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting at the 
upper quartile of the comparator group.
The performance measures chosen ensure the alignment of senior 
management’s and shareholders’ interests. The target ranges for 
the 2018 awards have been set taking into account the latest internal 
and external forecast for the business, including both economic and 
political uncertainty and TT’s principal risks. The Committee is 
satisfied that the proposed target range is suitably challenging. 
In line with previous LTIP awards granted in 2018 will be subject 
to potential withholding (malus) or recovery (clawback) if specified 
events occur prior to the third anniversary of the release date of 
an award. Relevant events in respect of LTIP awards will comprise a 
material misstatement of the audited results, error in the calculation 
of the extent of LTIP vesting or gross misconduct which could have 
warranted an individual’s summary dismissal.
In light of the current circumstances, the Committee will 
consider the impact of any significant future portfolio development 
on the outstanding performance targets at the time of the capital 
deployment. The impact will be considered where the capital 
deployment is in excess of the planned portfolio development at the 
time the targets were set. Any further changes to the performance 
targets in these circumstances will be communicated to shareholders.

Directors’ Annual Remuneration report continued
72 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 1. Base salary/fees
Base salaries for Executive Directors were reviewed in December 2016 and were increased by 2.5 per cent with effect from 1 January 2017.
Base fees for Non-executives were reviewed in January 2017 and were increased by 2.5 per cent with effect from 1 January 2017. A fee of 
£5,000 was introduced in respect of the Senior Independent Director; no other changes were made to the fees for the Chairman or the 
Chairmanship of Board Committees. 
2. Taxable benefits
The Executive Directors’ taxable benefits consist of a car allowance and insurance benefits.
3. Pensions
Employer contributions are paid at 15% of base salary, as defined contribution pension and/or a cash supplement.
4. Short-term incentive 
The short-term incentive payments represented in the table above were based on performance against Group Profit Before Tax (up to 50 per 
cent of salary), Group Free Cash Flow (up to 25 per cent of salary) and strategic objectives (up to 25 per cent of salary) as measured over the 
2017 financial year.
On 2 October 2017 the Company completed the sale of its Transportation division. In line with common market practice and to reduce 
complexity in the short-term incentive calculations, both the financial targets of Group Profit Before Tax and Group Free Cash Flow were 
restated to remove the 2017 financial plan budgeted performance of the disposed Transportation division for the entire performance year. 
Full-year financial targets are therefore based on continuing operations only.
The 2017 strategic objectives centred on the strategic development of the Group. The CEO and CFO had shared strategic objectives in 2017 
focused on: realising value from the Transportation division to enable the acceleration of the Group strategy; and developing and defining 
the Group portfolio strategy to create strategically aligned optionality for organic and inorganic capital redeployment to accelerate growth. 
To accelerate the Group strategy the CEO led the Board review of the Group’s strategic plan including the risks and opportunities associated 
with the further development of the Divisions, with particular focus on the Transportation division and further value creation. The review 
considered the option of moving the Transportation division to scale, operating the Division as a joint venture with strategic partners or 
disposing of the business to realise the value generated through the turnaround of the Division. Following the review the Transportation 
division was sold to AVX Corporation for a cash consideration of £123.2m after customary working capital and net debt adjustments, 
net of cash disposed of with the business. The sale allows TT to accelerate its strategy of investing in structural growth markets where 
there is increasing electronic content.
The Remuneration Committee carried out a thorough review of the achievement of the strategic objectives, in particular considering the 
significant focus and effort required to accelerate the Group portfolio strategy through the sale of the Transportation division which realised 
value in excess of expectations. Concurrently, the focus on the continuing operations delivered organic revenue growth of 5 per cent coupled 
with strong in year Profit Before Tax and Cash Flow performance together with an improved order book going into 2018. A full portfolio review 
of the continuing operations has been concluded, enacting a strategic plan for capital deployment to enhance organic growth and strategically 
aligned inorganic capital redeployment. The Committee also recognises the continued cultural progress in HSE, working toward delivering a 
zero harm environment, and the progress toward a highly engaged workforce in line with the TT Way (see pages 40 to 45).
The Remuneration Committee considered whether the overall outturn performance reflected the performance of the Group and believes the 
awards are appropriate. Based on the Committee’s assessment of achievement for both the financial and strategic objectives, the short-term 
incentive was calculated as follows:

73 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TT Electronics plc www.ttelectronics.com
Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information Performance for the financial elements of the plan (PBT and Free Cash Flow) has been strong. The Committee assessed each discrete element of 
the short-term incentive scheme separately, to form a rounded assessment of performance of the Executive Directors at the end of the financial 
year. In determining the final level of bonus payable, the Committee considered the wider performance of the Group and noted that management 
was continuing to make fundamental improvements to the Group. On the basis of the above, the short-term incentive pay out of 100% of 
maximum for the CEO and CFO reflects the strong underlying performance of the Group.
5. Long-term incentive 
LTIP awards vest depending on performance against two equally weighted measures over separate three-year performance periods. The EPS 
performance condition is over the three-year period aligned with the Group’s financial year. The TSR performance condition is over a separate 
three-year performance period, typically ending on the third anniversary of the award date. Accordingly, the performance periods of the two 
performance conditions end in separate reporting years. Both the 2014 and 2015 LTIP awards had performance periods that ended on or by 
31 December 2017 which are therefore included in the single figure for total remuneration for 2017. LTIP values shown in the single figure 
include dividend equivalents:

The long-term incentive award granted to Richard Tyson on 22 August 2014 was subject to two performance conditions, each measured 
over three-year periods. 50 per cent of the award is based on EPS growth in excess of the Retail Price Index (RPI) for the three-years up to 
31 December 2016. 50 per cent of the award is based on TSR performance against the FTSE SmallCap (excluding Investment Trusts) for the 
three-year period ending 9 May 2017. The award did not reach either the EPS or TSR performance condition and the award lapsed on the third 
anniversary of the grant date. The performance period for the EPS element ended in 2016 and the vested value (zero) is included in the 2016 
single figure for total remuneration. The performance period for the TSR element ended in 2017 and the vested value (zero) is included in the 
2017 single figure for total remuneration.

The long-term incentive amounts shown in 2017 for both Executive Directors include the EPS performance condition of the awards on 
18 March 2015. The EPS performance period ended on 31 December 2017 and an estimate of the vested value of the EPS element of this 
award is included in the 2017 single figure. The estimated value takes into account the average share price in the final quarter of 2017 and the 
expected value of the dividend equivalents for the EPS element of the award. The value of the TSR element of this award will be included in the 
2018 single figure in line with the TSR performance period ending in 2018.
In accordance with the setting of the EPS performance condition and the sale of the Transportation division three months from the end of the 
36-month performance period, EPS performance has been assessed on the actual full year EPS plus actual year to disposal underlying earnings 
of the Transportation division. This provides consistency with the basis on which the EPS targets were originally set. The following table outlines 
the audited calculation of the 14.6p EPS for actual full year EPS plus actual year to disposal underlying earnings of the Transportation division.

vested on 27 April 2015. The award, in accordance with Listing Rule 9.4.2 (2), was made in recognition of the loss of forfeited awards from his 
former employer. The award was subject to continuing employment with the Company on the relevant vesting dates, and typical good leaver/
change of control provisions. On 27 April 2016, a proportion of the share award granted on 22 August 2014 to Richard Tyson vested. The value 
of the proportion vesting in 2016 was £198,487 and included dividend equivalents.

(1) The share price used to determine the number of shares granted was the average share price over the last four trading days prior to grant
Awards to Executive Directors during 2017 will be subject to performance measures on the following basis:
EPS
The performance condition attached to 50 per cent of the award is based on the Group’s EPS performance for the year ending 31 December 
2019. 25 per cent of the shares subject to this part of the award will vest for EPS growth of 5 per cent compound per annum, increasing on a 
straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting for EPS growth for the year ending 31 December 2019 of 12 per cent compound per annum. 
In assessing the performance of the 2017 award following the sale of the Transportation division, the Committee has determined that the 
most appropriate basis for assessing performance against EPS growth is to use earnings reflecting continuing operations. Following review, 
the Committee has elected to use a significantly higher, and more stretching, 2016 base year EPS of 8.9 pence than the actual 2016 
underlying EPS of 7.8 pence for continuing operations. This upward adjustment ensures that there is a fair and consistent approach to 
interest charges and tax rates that are expected to be experienced by the continuing operations of the Company. The Committee believe 
that the adjusted performance conditions retain an appropriate level of stretch in line with the original performance conditions and are fair, 
reasonable and are materially neither easier nor more difficult to achieve.
TSR
The performance condition attached to 50 per cent of the award is based on the Company’s TSR performance against the FTSE SmallCap 
(excluding Investment Trusts). The three-year TSR performance period ceases on the third anniversary of the award date. 25 per cent of the 
shares subject to this part of the award will vest at median performance increasing on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting at the upper 
quartile of the comparator group.
Malus provisions apply during the three-year performance period and clawback provisions apply.

(1) The market value at 31 December 2017 represents the total number of shares awarded multiplied by 223.75 pence, being the share price on 29 December 
2017. The calculation does not take into account the likelihood of vesting.
(2) In 2014, as previously disclosed, Richard Tyson received an LTIP allocation. The award did not reach either the EPS or TSR performance condition and the 
award lapsed on the third anniversary of the grant date.
(3) This award vested on 1 January 2018 and was subject to achievement of a three-year performance condition ending 31 December 2017, based on TSR 
performance against the FTSE SmallCap (excluding Investment Trusts). 25 per cent of the shares subject to this award vest at median performance increasing

vested at 100 per cent.
(4)  The performance condition attached to 50 per cent of the award is based on EPS. 16.7 per cent of the shares subject to this part of the award will vest for the 
Company’s EPS for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 of 10.0 pence, increasing on a straight-line basis to 66.7 per cent vesting for EPS of 11.5 pence, 
increasing on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting for EPS of 12.4 pence. The performance condition attached to the other 50 per cent of the award is 
based on TSR performance against the FTSE SmallCap (excluding Investment Trusts). 16.7 per cent of the shares subject to this part of the award will vest at 
median performance increasing on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting at the upper quartile of the comparator group.

over the three-year performance period. Further detail of the EPS performance condition can be found below. The performance condition attached to the 
other 50 per cent of the award is based on TSR performance against the FTSE SmallCap (excluding Investment Trusts) during the three-year performance 
period from the date of award. 25 per cent of the shares subject to this part of the award will vest at median performance increasing on a straight-line basis to 
100 percent vesting at the upper quartile of the comparator group.
(6) The performance condition attached to 50 per cent of the award is based on EPS. 25 per cent of the shares subject to this part of the award will vest for EPS 
growth of 5 per cent compound per annum, increasing on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting for EPS growth for the year ending 31 December 2019 of 
12 per cent compound per annum. The performance condition attached to the other 50 per cent of the award is based on TSR performance against the FTSE 
SmallCap (excluding Investment Trusts) during the three-year performance period from the date of award. 25 per cent of the shares subject to this part of the 
award will vest at median performance increasing on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting at the upper quartile of the comparator group.
Adjustments to the performance conditions of the 2016 and 2017 LTIP awards 
Following the sale of the Transportation division on 2 October 2017, the Committee has adjusted the EPS performance conditions in the 2016 
and 2017 LTIP awards to ensure that the incentive arrangements remain “fit for purpose”. The Committee believes that the adjusted performance 
conditions retain an appropriate level of stretch in line with the original performance conditions and are fair, reasonable and are materially neither 
easier nor more difficult to achieve.
The changes seek to maintain the Executive Directors’ alignment on delivering the Company strategy for the remainder of the performance 
periods, recognising the improvements made in the business culminating in the sale of the Transportation division ahead of expectations. 
The TSR performance conditions remain unchanged across all award years.
Directors’ Annual Remuneration report continued
76 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com For LTIP awards made in 2016, the existing EPS compound growth performance conditions, detailed in the above notes to the outstanding 
share awards table, remain appropriate and unchanged. The sale completed toward the middle of the 36-month performance period and the 
Company’s EPS growth over the performance period will be calculated as a combination of the following two elements:
i. EPS growth for the 12 months to 31 December 2016 including Transportation division performance in both the 2015 base year and 2016 
performance EPS figures; and
ii. EPS growth for the 24 months to 31 December 2018 will be assessed on continuing operations only. Following review, the Committee will 
use a significantly higher and more stretching 2016 base year EPS of 8.9 pence than the actual 2016 underlying EPS of 7.8 pence. This upward 
adjustment ensures that there is a fair and consistent approach to interest charges and tax rates that are expected to be experienced by the 
continuing operations of the Company.
For LTIP awards made in 2017, the existing EPS compound growth performance conditions, detailed in the above notes to the outstanding share

Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information External advisers
In order to enable the Committee to make informed decisions on executive remuneration, the Committee retained independent external 
consultants, to advise on senior executive remuneration matters. Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) was appointed by the Committee in November 2016. 
Deloitte provided advice on the positioning of Non-executive, Executive and senior manager remuneration and the proposed adjustments to 
the performance conditions under the existing incentive arrangements during 2016. A separate part of Deloitte provided advice relating to 
divestment opportunities during 2017. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and has voluntarily signed up to its Code 
of Conduct.
The Committee takes into account the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct when dealing with its advisers. The Committee is 
satisfied that the advice it received during the year was objective and independent and that the provision of other services by Deloitte in no 
way compromised their independence.
The fees paid to Deloitte for providing advice in relation to executive remuneration over the financial year under review amounted to £34,290.
Shareholder voting at AGM
As shown by the approach to changes to the Remuneration Policy and the review of the performance targets from the portfolio development,

shareholders ahead of any significant changes to the Remuneration Policy.

of the Annual Report and Financial Statements
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
The coordination and review of Group-wide input into the Annual 
Report is a key element of the control process upon which the 
Directors rely and is an exercise which spans a period wider than the 
timetable for compiling the Annual Report itself. This control process 
incorporates the controls the Group operates throughout the year to 
identify key financial and operational issues and includes:
• Strategy meetings, held as part of most Board meetings, at 
which the entire Board is present, resulting in a clear agreement 
of the Group’s strategy. 
• The identification of the key milestones and the related key 
performance indicators to be monitored and measured 
throughout the period.
• Monthly reviews of business performance conducted by 
executive management (in consultation with divisional 
management), supplemented by reports highlighting key issues 
and analysis of the main variances from budget and prior year.
• Preparation of a detailed budget, reviewed and agreed by 
management and then the Board, which is used to calibrate 
strategy implementation and against which actual performance 
is measured.
• A timetabled process coordinating input from each division, 
identifying significant market issues and key elements of 
performance for each business area, and appropriately 
incorporating them into the structure of the Annual Report.
• The identification of key risks from the risk management 
process, for inclusion within the Annual Report, ensuring a 
consistency of approach with regard to the risks and the 
ongoing review programme.
• A planned Audit Committee sign-off process which incorporates 
meetings of the Chairman of the Audit Committee with the 
Executive Directors, the Risk and Assurance function and 
external Auditor to identify and timetable potential issues of 
significance to be addressed.
• A process for internal distribution and comment on the 
Annual Report, including those of the members of the 
Board, the Executive Management Board, key advisers 
and external Auditor.

Group General Counsel & Company Secretary
7 March 2018
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU (IFRSs) and applicable law, and have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant 
and reliable
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU
• assess the Group and parent company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ report, 
Directors’ Remuneration report and Corporate Governance 
statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the 
Annual Report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and

Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information Independent auditor’s report to the members of TT Electronics plc
1 Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of TT Electronics plc 
(“the Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which 
comprise the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, consolidated cash flow statement and 
the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 2. 
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our 
audit opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee.
We were appointed as auditor by the directors on 1 July 2010. 
The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 7 financial 
years ended 31 December 2017. We have fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in 
accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit 
services prohibited by that standard were provided.
2 Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall 
audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key 
audit matters (unchanged from 2016), in decreasing order of audit 
significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with 
our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required 
for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These 
matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures 
undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
The presentation of ‘underlying’ operating profit from 
continuing operations (£24.3 million, 2016: £20.6 million) 
Risk versus 2016  
Refer to page 58 (Audit committee section of the Directors’ Report 
and Notes 1c, 1d and 8 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)).
The risk – Presentation appropriateness
The Group discloses its earnings in accordance with the requirements 
of Adopted IFRS. It also presents a measure of underlying profit and 
earnings as defined in note 8, which excludes a number of separately 
disclosed items of income and expenditure. In 2017 this mainly related 
to restructuring of the Group’s operations, amortisation of acquired 
intangibles as well as certain credit items that were non-recurring 
in nature. The identification of non-underlying items and the 
presentation of underlying profit and earnings measures that show 
a consistent and balanced view of the underlying performance of the 
Group involves judgement. Judgement is also involved in ensuring that 
undue prominence is not given to underlying financial information, 
which could be misleading to the readers of the financial statements.
 
Our response:
Our procedures included:
Tests of details – Comparing a sample of the items identified as 
non-underlying to supporting documentation to assess the nature 
of the items and therefore, if they have been appropriately excluded 
from underlying profit based on the Group’s accounting policy;
Assessing application – Considering whether the policy for 
non-underlying items has been applied consistently between 
periods by comparing both the policy and the nature of these items 
in the two years ended 31 December 2017 and on the basis of our 
understanding of the results gained throughout the audit process;
Assessing balance – Evaluating the extent to which the relative 
prominence given to underlying financial information, related 
commentary and adopted IFRS financial information could be 
misleading and whether the underlying financial information is 
otherwise misleading in the form and context in which it appears.
Our results
We found the Group’s treatment of non-underlying transactions to 
be acceptable (2016: acceptable).
Warranty and other product provisions (included within 
provisions of £7 .3 million, 2016: £7 .5 million). 
Risk versus 2016

and Notes 1h, 2u and 19 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)).
86 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com The risk – Dispute Outcome
The Group’s products are used in a variety of complex applications 
and if they do not perform in the manner specified, the Group may 
be exposed to claims from customers. Assessing if such claims are 
valid and, if so, estimating the likely outflow of economic benefit, 
which could be material to the financial statements, requires 
judgement and involves making estimates and assumptions.
Our response:
Our procedures included:
• Correspondence – Corresponding with the Group’s internal 
legal counsel and discussions with the Group’s and business 
units’ management to identify actual and potential customer 
claims;
• Test of details – Considering relevant available information 
used by the Directors to assess the validity of claims and 
challenging the basis of the estimates using our understanding 
of the status of ongoing claims and disputes gained throughout 
the audit process;
• Historical comparisons – Evaluating the historical track record 
of warranty and other product claims against the Group in order 
to help assess the appropriateness of provisions held at the 
period end;
• Assessing transparency – Assessing whether the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of these provisions and the movements in 
the year are appropriate.
Our results:
We considered the warranty and other product provisions 
recognised to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).
Tax provisioning (included within income tax payable 
of £19.0 million, 2016: £9.7 million). 
Risk versus 2016  
Refer to page 59 (Audit Committee section of the Directors’ Report 
and Notes 1h, 2t and 9 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)).
The risk – Dispute outcome
Accruals for tax contingencies require the directors to make 
judgements and estimates in relation to tax issues and exposures 
given that the Group operates in a number of tax jurisdictions, 
the complexities of transfer pricing and other international tax 
legislation and the time taken for tax matters to be agreed with 
the tax authorities.
Our response:
Our procedures included:
• Our tax expertise – Use of our own international and local 
tax specialists to assess the Group’s tax positions, inspect its 
correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and analyse 
and challenge the assumptions used to determine tax provisions 
based on our know ledge and experiences of the application of 
the international and local legislation by the relevant authorities 
and courts;
• Assessing transparency – Assessing the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures in respect of tax and uncertain tax positions.
Our results:
We found the level of tax provisioning to be acceptable 
(2016: acceptable).
Carrying value of goodwill (£100.3 million, 2016: 
£106.5 million). 
Risk versus 2016  
Refer to page 60 (Audit Committee section of the Directors’ Report 
and Notes 1h, 2k and 14 (accounting policy and financial disclosures)).
The risk – Forecast-based valuation
The Group has generated significant goodwill on acquisitions whose 
recoverability is dependent on the ability of the businesses to which it 
relates to generate sufficient future economic benefits. Historically 
there has been an associated significant risk over the recoverability of 
goodwill due to past underperformance in certain operations due to 
various wider economic factors. There is a risk that further reductions 
in profitability due to competitive forces or a decline in customer 
demand for products using components supplied by the Group may 
result in an impairment or further impairment.
Impairment reviews are based on discounted cash flow projections 
reflecting a number of assumptions and estimates which require 
judgement and are inherently uncertain. Due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash 
flows, this is one of the key judgemental areas upon which our 
audit is focused.
The overall risk rating has reduced in the year as a result of improved 
current year performance and future outlook of the cash generating 
units that have historically had minimal headroom.
Our response:
Our procedures included:
• Our sector experience – Challenging the Group’s assumptions 
by evaluating the likely achievability of the growth forecasts 
used in the cash flow models;
• Historical comparisons – Evaluating the track record of 
historical forecasts compared to actual results achieved;
• Benchmarking assumptions – Comparing the Group’s 
assumptions to externally derived data in relation to key inputs 
such as projected economic growth and (using our valuation 
specialists) discount rates;
• Sensitivity analysis – Performing breakeven analysis on the 
discount rate, revenue and total pre-tax cash flow assumptions;
• Comparing valuations – Comparing the sum of the discounted 
cash flows to the Group’s market capitalisation to assess the 
reasonableness of those cashflows;
• Assessing transparency – Assessing the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures in respect of goodwill.

Our results:
We found the resulting estimate of the recoverable amount 
of goodwill to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).
Recoverability of parent company’s investment in and 
amounts due from subsidiaries (investment in subsidiaries 
– £164.6 million, 2016: £96.5 million. Amounts owed 
by subsidiary undertakings - £106.3 million, 2016: 
£126.8 million)
Risk versus 2016  
Refer to Notes 1d, 3 and 4 (accounting policy and financial 
disclosures) of the Company financial statements.
The Risk – Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of the parent company’s investments in, and 
amounts due from, subsidiaries represents 54.0% (2016: 39.8%) and 
34.9% (2016: 52.3%) of the company’s total assets respectively. 
Their recoverability is not at a high risk of significant misstatement 
or subject to significant judgement. However, due to their materiality 
in the context of the parent company financial statements, this is 
considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on our 
overall parent company audit.
Our response:
Our procedures included:
• Tests of detail – Comparing the carrying amount of 100% of 
investments and a sample of the highest value amounts owed by 
subsidiary undertakings representing 94% of the total amounts 
due from subsidiaries, with the relevant subsidiaries’ draft balance 
sheet to identify whether their net assets, being an approximation 
of the minimum recoverable amount of the related investments 
and amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings, were in excess of 
their carrying amount, and assessing whether those subsidiaries 
have historically been profit-making; 
• Assessing subsidiary audits – Assessing the work performed by 
the subsidiary audit teams on those subsidiaries and considering 
the results of that work on those subsidiaries’ profits and 
net assets.
• Our sector experience – For those subsidiaries where the 
carrying amount exceeded the net asset value, comparing the 
carrying amount of the investment with the expected value of 
the business.
• Benchmarking assumptions – Comparing the relevant 
subsidiary investment’s forecast cash flow assumptions 
to externally derived data in relation to key inputs such as 
projected economic growth and (using our valuation specialists) 
discount rates;
Our results:
We found the Group’s assessment of the recoverability of the 
investment in subsidiaries and amounts due from subsidiaries 
to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).
 
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statement as a whole was set at 
£1.2 million at the planning stage of the audit (2016: £1.2 million). 
Following the sale of the TS&C business materiality was reviewed 
but no change was considered necessary. The reconsideration 
had regard to the levels of component materiality being used and 
normalised profit before tax from continuing operations of £20.3 
million and normalised Group profit before tax (which includes 
discontinued operations) of £33.0 million of which it represents 
5.9% and 3.6% respectively. Profit before tax from continuing 
operations was normalised to exclude restructuring and other 
costs of £2.6 million and Group profit before tax was additionally 
normalised to exclude the gain arising on disposal of the TS&C 
business. 2016 materiality of £1.2 million represented 4.7% of 
Group profit before tax normalised on a consistent basis. 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a 
whole was set at £1.2 million (2016: £1.2 million), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of company total assets, of which it 
represents 0.4% (2016: 0.5%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.06 million 
(2016: £0.06 million) for items impacting the income statement 
and £0.12 million (2016: £0.06 million) for items in respect of the 
balance sheet misclassification, in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s 98 (2016: 95) reporting components, we subjected 
42 (2016: 47) to full scope audits for Group purposes and 6 (2016: 
7) to specified risk-focused audit procedures. The latter were not 
individually financially significant enough to require a full scope 
audit for Group purposes, but did present specific individual risks 
that needed to be addressed. 
88 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com The remaining 44% (2016: 1 %) of Group revenue from discontinued 
operations and 66% (2016: 8%) of Group profit before tax from 
discontinued operations is represented by 9 (2016: 4) reporting 
components, none of which individually represented more than 
21 % of any of Group revenue from discontinued operations and 
Group profit before tax from discontinued operations. For these 
residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated 
Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement within these. 
The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant 
areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and 
the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the 
component materialities, which ranged from £0.01 million to £1.2 
million, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components. The work on 27 of the 48 components 
(2016: 36 of the 54 components) was performed by component 
auditors and the rest, including the audit of the parent company, 
was performed by the Group team. The Group team performed 
procedures on the items excluded from normalised Group profit 
before tax on continuing operations. 
The Group team visited 3 (2016: 4) component locations in the UK, 
USA and Mexico (2016: USA, Mexico, China and the UK) to assess 
the audit risk and strategy. Telephone conference meetings were 
also held with the significant component auditors. At these visits 
and meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the 
Group team was then performed by the component auditor. 
4 We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if:
• we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to the directors’ statement in note 1 to the financial 
statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting 
with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
over the Group and Company’s use of that basis for a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements; or 
• the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 54 
is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.

Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to: 
• the directors’ confirmation within the Viability Statement on 
page 27 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity; 
• the principal risks and uncertainties disclosures describing 
these risks and explaining how they are being managed and 
mitigated; and 
• the directors’ explanation in the Viability Statement of how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they considered that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Viability 
Statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit and 
the directors’ statement that they consider that the annual report 
and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or 
• the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance 
Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the eleven 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the 
Listing Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
6 We have nothing to report on the other matters on 
which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7 Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 85, 
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group 
and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
90 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see 
below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s 
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
Irregularities – ability to detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably 
be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements 
from our sector experience, through discussion with the directors 
and other management (as required by auditing standards).
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly affect 
the financial statements including financial reporting (including 
related company legislation) and taxation legislation. We considered 
the extent of compliance with those laws and regulations as part of 
our procedures on the related annual accounts items. 
In addition we considered the impact of laws and regulations in the 
specific areas of health and safety, anti-bribery and employment 
law recognising the nature of the Group’s activities. With the 
exception of any known or possible non-compliance, and as 
required by auditing standards, our work in respect of these was 
limited to enquiry of the directors and other management. 
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our 
team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance 
throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group 
to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations 
identified at Group level, with a request to report on any indications 
of potential existence of non-compliance with relevant laws and 
regulations (irregularities) in these areas, or other areas directly 
identified by the component team.
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of 
non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations (irregularities), 
as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

96 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 1 Basis of preparation
a) Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis modified by derivatives held at fair value and by the 
revaluation of certain property, plant and equipment at the transition date to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee of the IASB, as adopted by the European Union, and in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements set out on pages 92 to 134 have been prepared using consistent accounting policies. 
Adoption of new and amendments to published standards and interpretations effective for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 
did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group. 
In accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, comparative information for the year ended 31 
December 2016 has been re-presented for businesses treated as discontinued. During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Transportation 
division has been re-presented as a discontinued operation (see note 5). 
b) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2017 and the Group’s financial performance 
for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Subsidiaries are those enterprises controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Subsidiaries are consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
c) Alternative performance measures
These financial statements include alternative performance measures that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS. These alternative 
performance measures have been selected by management to assist them in making operating decisions because they represent the 
underlying operating performance of the Group and facilitate internal comparisons of performance over time.
Alternative performance measures are presented in these financial statements as management believes they provide investors with a means 
of evaluating performance of the Group on a consistent basis, similar to the way in which management evaluates performance, that is not 
otherwise apparent on an IFRS basis, given that certain non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items that management does not believe are 
indicative of the underlying operating performance of the Group are included when preparing financial measures under IFRS.
The Directors consider there to be four main alternative performance measures: underlying operating profit, free cash flow, underlying EPS and 
underlying effective tax rate.
d) Underlying operating profit
This has been defined as operating profit from continuing operations excluding the impacts of significant restructuring programmes, 
significant one-off asset impairments and business acquisition and divestment related activity. Business acquisition and divestment related 
items include the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on acquisition, the writing off of the pre-acquisition profit element of inventory 
written up on acquisition, other direct costs associated with business combinations and adjustments to contingent consideration related to 
acquired businesses. Items related to significant restructuring programmes include the impact of the Operational Improvement Plan initiated 
in 2014, other significant changes in footprint (including movement of production facilities and sale of properties) and significant costs of 
management changes.
Other alternative performance measures are defined in note 8.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
97 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TT Electronics plc www.ttelectronics.com
Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information 1 Basis of preparation continued
e) Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out within 
the Strategic report on pages 2 to 45. The Strategic report analyses the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities. In addition, note 21 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
The Group had net funds of £47.0 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: £55.4 million net debt), with available undrawn committed and 
uncommitted facilities of £204.2 million. Given the considerable financial resources available, together with long-term partnerships with a 
number of key customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources and financial headroom to continue in operational 
existence for at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. Further details are contained in the Governance and Directors’ Report on page 54.
f) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The Group continues to assess the impact of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers and the revised issuance of IFRS 9 Financial 
instruments which will be effective for periods beginning 1 January 2018. The Group does not expect a material impact from the adoption 
of IFRS9. The Group continues to access the impact of IFRS 16 Leases which will be effective for periods beginning 1 January 2019.
There were no revisions to adopted IFRSs which have become applicable in 2017 that have had a significant impact on the Group’s financial 
statements. Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU. The following will be applicable in the 
future and will have an impact on the Group:
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue in accordance with 
principles set out in a five-step model to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Had IFRS 15 been adopted during the year ended 31 December 2017, continuing revenue would have increased by between £0.5 million and 
£2.0 million and continuing operating profit would have increased by up to £0.3 million. Similarly, discontinued revenue would have increased 
by between £4.0 million and £6.0 million and discontinued operating profit would have increased by up to £0.5 million. Group net assets would 
have decreased by between £nil and £2.0 million.
g) Change in accounting policies
There have been no changes to accounting policies during the year. Adoption of new and amendments to published standards and 
interpretations effective for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 did not have any impact on the financial position or performance 
of the Group. 
h) Significant accounting judgements and estimates
Judgements
Determining many of the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements involves the use of judgements. These judgements are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances having regard to prior experience, but actual results may 
differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. In addition to the key sources of estimation uncertainty shown 
below, in applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors have exercised judgement in adopting alternative performance measures 
(as described in note 8). The determination of items of income and expense excluded from operating profit to arrive at underlying operating 
profit requires critical judgement. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
98 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 1 Basis of preparation continued
Estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates. In particular, information about 
significant areas of estimation uncertainty made by the Directors in preparing the consolidated financial statements is shown below:
• Note 9 – Taxation. Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax audit issues 
and exposures. Amounts accrued are based on management’s interpretation of country-specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement. 
Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions are probable of being sustained. Once considered to be probable, management 
reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of 
potential settlement through negotiation and/or litigation. These amounts are expected to reverse as the statute of limitations is reached 
or tax audits occur in the respective countries concerned. All such provisions are included in current liabilities. The recognition of deferred 
tax assets is dependent on assessments of future taxable income in the relevant countries concerned
• Note 13 – Property, plant and equipment. Where indicators of impairment exist the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment has 
been tested by comparing the value in use to the net book value of the asset.
• Note 14 – Goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill has been tested for impairment by estimating the value in use of the cash generating 
units to which it has been allocated. Note 14 outlines the significant assumptions made in performing the impairment tests;
• Note 15 – Other intangible assets. The recoverability of capitalised development costs is dependent on assessments of the future 
commercial viability of the relevant products and processes; 
• Note 19 – Provisions. The Group makes appropriate provision on a consistent basis for risks of product liability, litigation, restructuring, credit 
risk and other normal trading exposures with estimates being made regarding the timing of future payments; and
• Note 22 – Defined benefit pension obligations. The defined benefit pension obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions, 
including future inflation, salary increases and mortality and the obligation is then discounted to its present value using an assumed 
discount rate. Note 22 outlines the significant assumptions and associated sensitivities.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
The following significant accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 
These accounting policies have been consistently applied across the Group.
a) Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration, usually the invoiced value, for the provision of goods and services to external 
customers excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes and is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have 
transferred to the customer. In most cases this coincides with the transfer of legal title of the goods. Revenue for services is recognised as the 
services are rendered.
b) Finance income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign exchange gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues.
c) Finance costs
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings which are not capitalised under the borrowing costs policy, the calculated interest 
income on pension assets net of the calculated interest expense on pension liabilities and foreign exchange losses.
d) Discontinued operations and assets held for sale
The Group reports a business as a discontinued operation when it has been disposed of in a period, or its future sale is considered to be highly 
probable at the balance sheet date, and results in the cessation of a major line of business or geographical area of operation. 
An asset is classified as held for sale if it is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and 
customary for sales of such assets and that it is highly probable the asset will be sold within one year from the date of classification.
99 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TT Electronics plc www.ttelectronics.com
Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
e) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders. Dividends receivable are recognised when the 
Group’s right to receive payment is established.
f) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Goodwill on business combinations is recognised as the fair value of the 
consideration transferred less the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and is recognised as an asset in the consolidated 
Balance Sheet. Costs relating to the acquisition are recognised as expenses in the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in 
their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests 
are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by 
which non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
g) Property, plant and equipment 
Initial measurement
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of a tangible fixed asset 
comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self 
constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Depreciation
The cost of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Depreciation is charged to the income statement so as to 
write-off the cost less estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation commences on the 
date the assets are ready for use within the business and the asset carrying values are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that 
they may be impaired. Freehold land is not depreciated.
The depreciation rates of assets are as follows
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold buildings 50 years (or over the period of the lease, if shorter) 
Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets that take a substantial period of time to 
get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset.
h) Investment property
Property held to earn rental income rather than for the purpose of the Group’s principal activities is classified as investment property. 
Investment property is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. The depreciation policy is 
consistent with that described for other Group properties. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted, if appropriate, 
at each balance sheet date.
Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn 
from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset is recognised in the income statement in the period of derecognition.
i) Leases 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased items, are capitalised at the 
commencement of the lease. Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The 
capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. Lease payments 
are apportioned between the finance charge and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. Capitalised lease assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. All other leases are treated as operating leases and the cost is expensed to the income 
statement as incurred.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
100 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
j) Government grants 
Government grants relating to non-current assets are treated as deferred income and credited to the income statement by equal instalments 
over the anticipated useful lives of the assets to which the grants relate. Other grants are credited to the income statement over the period of 
the project to which they relate. 
k) Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the 
identifiable net assets acquired, is capitalised and is tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is not amortised, and any impairment losses are 
not subsequently reversed. The net book value of goodwill at the date of transition to IFRS has been treated as deemed cost. On the subsequent 
disposal or discontinuance of a previously acquired business, the relevant goodwill is dealt with in the Consolidated income statement except for 
the goodwill already charged to reserves. 
Negative goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business is credited to the Consolidated income statement on acquisition as part of acquisition 
costs reported outside underlying profit.
l) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition less 
accumulated amortisation. 
Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is 
recognised in the income statement as incurred. Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan 
or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically 
and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of 
materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as 
incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The carrying values of 
intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. 
Acquired computer software licences for use within the Group are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire 
and bring to use the specific software. Costs that are directly associated with the implementation of identifiable and unique software products 
controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible 
assets. Capitalised software development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
The amortisation rates for intangible assets are:
Acquired patents and licences up to 10 years 
Product development costs 5 years 
Customer relationships 3 to 15 years 
Order backlog up to 2 years
Software 3 to 5 years
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis. 
m) Deferred taxation 
Deferred taxation is provided on taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and their corresponding tax bases. No provision is made for deferred tax which would become payable on the distribution of 
retained profits by overseas subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates expected to apply when the asset 
is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. However, deferred tax is not 
provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business 
combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised or that they will reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

n) Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, including related overheads, and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where 
applicable, direct labour costs and the overheads incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated on 
a weighted average cost basis. 
o) Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice price (which is the fair value of the consideration receivable) less provision made for impairment 
of these receivables. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the 
original carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the present value of expected cash flows receivable. The amount of the provision 
is recognised in the income statement.
p) Financial instruments
Recognition
The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Measurement
When financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value being the consideration given or received plus 
directly attributable transaction costs. 
In determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted bid prices on the trade date. 
Loans and receivables comprise loans and advances other than purchased loans. Originated loans and receivables are initially recognised in 
accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Allowance for 
impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate derivatives to hedge risks 
associated with foreign exchange fluctuations and interest rate risk. These are designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 
relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management 
objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, 
the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash 
flows of the hedged item.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, 
in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity 
and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Derecognition
A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights that comprise that asset. This occurs when the rights 
are realised, expire or are surrendered. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished. Originated loans and receivables are 
derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Group.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
102 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is 
impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a 
result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred “loss event”) and that loss event has an 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
q) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits held on call or with maturities of less than three months at 
inception and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes 
in value, and bank overdrafts. 
r) Borrowings 
Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
s) Trade payables 
Trade payables are carried at the amounts expected to be paid to counterparties. 
t) Income tax
Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax expense is the expected tax payable 
on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
u) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. If the effect of the time value 
of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
v) Employee benefits
The Group operates defined benefit post-retirement benefit schemes and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined benefit plans
The liability recognised in the balance sheet for defined benefit schemes is the present value of the schemes’ liabilities less the fair value of the 
schemes’ assets. The operating and financing costs of defined benefit schemes are recognised separately in the income statement. Operating 
costs comprise the current service cost, any gains or losses on settlement or curtailments, and past service costs. Net interest income and expense 
on net defined benefit assets and liabilities is determined by applying discount rates used to measure defined benefit obligations at the beginning 
of the year to net defined benefit assets and liabilities at the beginning of the year and is included in finance income and costs. Remeasurements 
arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset 
ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Group recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income and all other expenses related to 
defined benefit plans in employee benefit expenses in profit or loss. Surpluses are recognised where, on ultimate wind-up when there are no longer 
any remaining members, any surplus will be returned to the Group.
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will 
have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are 
recognised in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. 
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is committed demonstrably, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a 
formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer 
made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Group has made 
an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably. 
103 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TT Electronics plc www.ttelectronics.com
Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is 
recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share-based payments 
Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees 
render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions). The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is 
measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions is determined 
by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the 
vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual outcome of awards which have vested. No adjustment is made to the fair 
value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
w) Own shares
Own equity instruments which are re-acquired (own shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in 
the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying 
amount and the consideration paid to acquire such equity instruments is recognised within equity.
x) Foreign currency translation
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined with reference to the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions translated at the rate prevailing 
at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, are taken to the income 
statement. Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the 
functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
On consolidation, income statements of subsidiaries are translated into sterling, at average rates of exchange. Balance sheet items are 
translated into sterling at period end exchange rates. Exchange differences on the retranslation are taken to equity. Exchange differences on 
foreign currency borrowings financing those net investments are also dealt with in equity and are reported in the statement of comprehensive 
income. All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise. On disposal of an 
overseas subsidiary any cumulative exchange movements relating to that subsidiary held in the translation reserve are transferred to the 
consolidated income statement. 
 
3 Segmental reporting
Following the announcement on 1 August 2017, the Group is now organised into three divisions, as shown below, according to the nature of the 
products and services provided. Each of these divisions represents an operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments and 
there is no aggregation of segments. The chief operating decision maker is the Board of Directors. The operating segments are:
• Sensors and Specialist Components – The Sensors and Specialist Components division collaborates with customers to develop both 
standard and custom solutions that improve the precision, speed and reliability of performance-critical applications in the industrial, 
medical, transportation and aerospace and defence sectors. We design and manufacture highly engineered parts that solve customer 
challenges. Product offerings include optoelectronics and sensors for torque, position, pressure, flow and temperature, and specialist circuit 
protection and circuit conditioning components;
• Power Electronics – The Power Electronics division creates specialist, high performance, ultra-reliable, highly engineered electronic components 
and sub-assemblies for power management, signal conditioning and connectivity applications in harsh environments. It serves customers in 
the industrial, automotive and aerospace and defence markets and focuses on creating value by developing innovative electronic solutions to 
challenging problems for our customers’ electronic systems; and
• Global Manufacturing Solutions – The Global Manufacturing Solutions division draws on its manufacturing design engineering capabilities, 
global facilities and world-class quality standards to provide highly complex electronic manufacturing solutions to customers in the aerospace 
and defence, medical, and high technology industrial sectors. The business has broad capabilities ranging from printed circuit board assembly 
to environmental test and full systems integration. This global suite of end-to-end solutions is focused exclusively on low volume, high 
mix business.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
104 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 3 Segmental reporting continued
The key performance measure of the operating segments is underlying operating profit. Refer to note 8 for a definition of underlying 
operating profit. 
Corporate costs - in 2016 and prior years central corporate costs were allocated to each of the divisions on the basis of revenue to determine 
underlying operating profit. For 2017 reporting those costs of the head office which are not related to the operating activities of the trading 
units are no longer allocated to divisions. Resources and costs managed centrally but deployed in support of the operating units will continue to 
be allocated to the divisional segments based on a combination of revenue and operating profit. Corporate costs are separately disclosed, 
equivalent to the segment disclosure information, so that reporting is consistent with the format that is now used for review by the chief 
operating decision maker. This gives greater transparency of the underlying operating profits for each segment. As required by IFRS 8, 
comparative amounts have been restated to reflect this change.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies as shown in note 2.
Group financing (including finance costs and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to 
operating segments.
Goodwill is allocated to the individual cash generating units which may be smaller than the segment which they are part of.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
108 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 8 Alternative performance measures
These financial statements include alternative performance measures that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS. These alternative 
performance measures have been selected by management to assist them in making operating decisions because they represent the 
underlying operating performance of the Group and facilitate internal comparisons of performance over time. 
Alternative performance measures are presented in these financial statements as management believes they provide investors with a means of 
evaluating performance of the Group on a consistent basis, similar to the way in which management evaluates performance, that is not otherwise 
apparent on an IFRS basis, given that certain non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items that management does not believe are indicative of the 
underlying operating performance of the Group are included when preparing financial measures under IFRS.
The Directors consider there to be four main alternative performance measures: underlying operating profit, free cash flow, underlying EPS 
(see note 11) and underlying effective tax rate. Free cash flow includes cash flow from discontinued operations as this better reflects the overall 
funding position of the Group. 
Underlying operating profit 
This has been defined as operating profit from continuing operations excluding the impacts of significant restructuring programmes, significant 
one-off items and business acquisition and divestment related activity. Business acquisition and divestment related items include the amortisation 
of intangible assets recognised on acquisition, the writing off of the pre-acquisition profit element of inventory written up on acquisition, other 
direct costs associated with business combinations and adjustments to contingent consideration related to acquired businesses. Items related to 
significant restructuring programmes include the impact of the Operational Improvement Plan initiated in 2014, other significant changes in 
footprint (including movement of production facilities and sale of properties) and significant costs of management changes.

increases for an additional amount of initial pension (£1.9 million net of £0.4 million costs) and a profit arising on the sale of certain 
properties (£0.2 million). 
In December 2017, new legislation was enacted fundamentally changing the basis of US tax. This resulted in a one-off benefit of £1.8 million 
arising due to enacted changes in tax rate.
In the year ended 31 December 2016, restructuring costs related to further costs incurred on the Operational Improvement Plan initiated 
in a previous year, costs associated with other site restructuring (net of a release for certain sites) and a credit of £4.3 million arising on sale 
of properties (net of a write down of certain properties).

UK tax is calculated at 19.25% (2016: 20.0%) of taxable profits. Overseas tax is calculated at the tax rates prevailing in the relevant countries. 
The Group’s effective tax rate for the year from continuing operations was 11.3% (the underlying tax rate was 20.0%) (see note 8). 
Included within the total tax charge above is a £2.4 million credit relating to items reported outside underlying profit (2016: £1.0 million).

The enacted UK corporation tax rate applicable from 1 April 2015 is 20%, from 1 April 2017 is 19% and from 1 April 2020 is 17%.
In December 2017, the US Federal Government enacted substantial changes to the basis of US Federal corporate income tax and the tax rate was 
reduced from 35% to a rate of 21 % applicable from 1 January 2018. The change in tax rate has resulted in a change to the level of deferred tax 
held in respect of the Group’s US operations. The Group has not identified any other significant tax charges or credits arising from the newly 
enacted legislation.

investment property with a carrying value of £0.3m was disposed of during the year. The fair value of the remaining properties is £3.7 million 
(2016: £3.9 million).
The Group identified indicators of impairment due to the planned closure of our GMS facilities in Timisoara, Romania and as a result an 
impairment of £0.7 million was recognised within items excluded from underlying profit. In addition, indicators of impairment with IT assets 
associated with the Transportation division were identified and an impairment of £0.1 million was recognised within items excluded from 
underlying profit. 
In 2016 the Group identified indicators of impairment at two sites. For one site the net book value of £2.0 million exceeded an 
external valuation of £1.2 million and as a result an impairment of £0.8 million was recognised. A further vacant site with a net book 
value of £0.2 million was due for demolition and was impaired as a result. The impairments were recognised within items excluded from 
underlying profit.
Capitalised software with a cost of £4.2 million (2016: £2.3 million) and accumulated depreciation of £3.1 million (2016: £1.5 million) has been 
transferred to intangible assets.

The Group tests goodwill impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 
amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations using conservative assumptions. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and operating cash projections during the period for which management has 
detailed plans. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the Group’s time value of 
money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
116 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 14 Goodwill continued
As part of the annual budgeting and strategic planning processes, the Group prepares cash flow forecasts for the following five years. In 2017, 
the growth rate assumed after this five-year period is based on long-term GDP projections capped at long-term inflation rates of the primary 
market for the CGU, in perpetuity. The long-term inflation rate used was 1.9% for the UK businesses, 1.7% for the US businesses and 3.0% for 
the Chinese businesses (2016: 2% for the UK and US businesses and 2.3% for the Chinese businesses).
The growth rates assume that demand for our products remains broadly in line with the underlying economic environment in the long-term 
future. Taking into account our expectation of future market conditions, we believe that the evolution of selling prices and cost measures put 
into place will lead to a sustained improvement in profitability.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the pre-tax discount rates used to discount the forecast cash flows are shown below:
 2017
Variable Components 15.3%
Optoelectronics 13.1%
Roxspur 10.7%
Resistors 12.9%
Power Electronics 10.8%
Global Manufacturing Solutions 12.2%
For the year ended 31 December 2016, and under the previous organisational structure the pre-tax discount rates used to discount the forecast 
cash flows were as follows:
 2016
Variable Components 11.9%
Optoelectronics 11.8%
Roxspur 10.1%
Resistors 11.9%
Aero Stanrew 10.5%
Power and Hybrid 11.0%
TT electronics integrated manufacturing services, USA 11.9%
TT electronics integrated manufacturing services, Suzhou 12.6%
New Chapel Electronics, UK 10.5%
Recoverable amounts exceed the total carrying value of assets for all of the CGUs and consequently no impairment losses have been 
recognised in the current or prior year.
A key assumption in the value in use test is the projected performance of the CGUs based on cash flow forecasts. The recoverable amounts 
associated with the goodwill balances are based on these performance projections, and based on current forecast information do not indicate 
that any goodwill balance is impaired. If a company’s actual performance does not meet these projections, this could lead to an impairment of 
the goodwill in future periods.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in significant assumptions that would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill 
to exceed its recoverable amount.

The Operational Improvement Plan provision relates to fundamental restructuring of the manufacturing footprint and sales organisation of 
the Transportation and the Sensors and Specialist Components divisions. £1.1 million was utilised in the year and the remaining liabilities were 
transferred as part of the disposal of the Transportation division in October 2017. 
The reorganisation provision primarily relates to the restructuring programme associated with the closure of the Boone, North Carolina operations, 
the transfers of lines in Sensors and Specialist Components to low cost manufacturing sites and the planned closure of our GMS facilities in 
Timisoara, Romania. The charge in the year relates to the planned closure of our GMS facilities in Timisoara, Romania. The utilisation in the year 
relates to site consolidation in the UK now substantially complete, and costs associated with the closure of the Boone. The release in the year 
relates to the transfers of lines in Sensors and Specialist Components to low cost manufacturing sites.
Legal, warranty and other claims represent the best estimate for the cost of settling outstanding product and other claims, and warranty 
provisions created on the disposal of businesses. The charge relates to costs, including warranties, associated with the Transportation division 
disposal. The release relates to excess provisions established for industrial claims.
The Group has, on occasion, been required to enforce commercial contracts and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other 
parties. Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known 
factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. The timing of 
utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain, reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and 
negotiations. Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors’ best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations although there 
is a higher degree of judgement involved. Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these provisions are shown as current. 
No provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless management, 
taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful. Contingent 
liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified, but the Directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be 
brought can be resisted successfully, and therefore the possibility of any material outflow in settlement in excess of amounts provided is 
assessed as remote. 
The timing of the utilisation of these amounts is uncertain as they are subject to commercial negotiation and legal process in different jurisdictions.

accordion facility of £30 million with a syndicate of seven banks comprising HSBC, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, Fifth Third Bank, 
Comerica Bank, Lloyds Bank and Bank of Ireland. As at 31 December 2017, £nil of the facility was drawn down. Arrangement fees with a gross 
cost before amortisation of £1.7 million, and amortised cost of £1.1 million, have been reported within current assets.
The interest margin payable on the facility is based on the Group’s compliance with financial covenants (net debt/EBITDA adjusted to exclude 
the items not included within underlying operating profit) and is payable on a floating basis above £LIBOR, €LIBOR or $LIBOR depending on 
the currency of denomination of the loan. 
Undrawn facilities
At 31 December 2017, the total borrowing facilities available to the Group amounted to £204.8 million (2016: £228.5 million). At 31 December

£150.0 million (2016: £45.8 million), China £4.6 million (2016: £16.3 million) and Austria £nil (2016: £3.1 million)) and £49.6 million (2016: £57.6 
million) of undrawn uncommitted borrowing facilities, representing overdraft lines and the accordion facility.
 
21 Financial risk management 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks 
arise from exposures that occur in the normal course of business and are managed by the Group’s Treasury department in close co-operation 
with the Group’s business divisions and operating companies, under the oversight of a Treasury Committee which is chaired by the Chief 
Financial Officer. The responsibilities of the Group’s Treasury department include the monitoring of financial risks, management of cash 
resources, debt and capital structure management, approval of counterparties and relevant transaction limits, and oversight of all significant 
treasury activities undertaken by the Group. The Group Treasury department operates as a service centre to the business divisions of the Group 
and not as a profit centre.
A Group Treasury policy has been approved by the Board of Directors and is periodically updated to reflect developments in the financial 
markets and the financial exposure facing the Group. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives used for risk management 
purposes. The Group’s borrowings, surplus liquidity and derivative financial instruments are monitored and managed centrally by the Group’s 
Treasury department. 
The Group’s accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 2(p).

a) Derivatives, financial instruments and risk management
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates. The Group 
does not hold any speculative financial instruments.
The Group is exposed to transactional and translation foreign exchange risk. Transactional foreign exchange risk arises from sales or purchases 
by a Group company in a currency other than that company’s functional currency. Translational foreign exchange risk arises on the translation 
of profits earned in overseas currencies into GBP and the translation of net assets denominated in overseas currencies into GBP, the Group’s 
functional currency. 
To mitigate transactional foreign exchange risk, wherever possible, Group companies enter into transactions in their functional currencies with 
customers and suppliers. When this is not possible, hedging strategies are undertaken through the use of forward currency contracts for up to 
one year ahead.
The Group’s interest rate management policy is to maintain a balance between fixed and floating rates of interest on borrowings and deposits, 
and to use interest rate derivatives when appropriate and pre-approved by the Treasury Committee. 
The forward currency contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and the mark to market valuation of these derivatives at 
31 December 2017 is taken to the hedging reserve within equity. At 31 December 2017, the Group had a net derivative financial asset 
of £1.0 million (2016: £1.8 million liability).

A 10% strengthening of GBP against the following currencies at 31 December would have decreased equity and profit after tax by the 
amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.

A 10% weakening of GBP against the above currencies at 31 December would have had an equal but opposite effect on the above currencies 
to the amount shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
The Group finances operations by obtaining funding through external borrowings and, where they are in foreign currencies, these borrowings 
may be designated as net investment hedges. This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of these foreign currency borrowings to be 
charged to other comprehensive income, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets 
of foreign operations.

c) Interest rate risk
The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates primarily impact 
borrowings by changing their future cash flows (floating rate debt) or their fair value (fixed rate debt) and deposits. The Group’s objective is to 
manage this interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate derivatives.
The exposure of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows:

at floating rate).

Derivative financial instruments – – (2.4) (2.4)
Total financial liabilities (80.0) (25.2) (100.1) (205.3)
The interest charged on floating rate financial liabilities is based on the relevant benchmark rate (such as LIBOR). Interest on financial 
instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Given the net funds position of the Group at 31 December 2017, any change in interest rates would have no significant impact on the 
consolidated income statement. The effect on profit after tax of a 1 % movement in £LIBOR, based on the year end floating rate net cash 
and with all other variables held constant, is estimated to be £nil (2016: £0.7 million).
d) Credit risk
Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Group’s ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets. 
Investments in cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are with approved counterparty banks and other financial 
institutions. Counterparties are assessed prior to, during, and after the conclusion of transactions to ensure exposure to credit risk is limited to 
an acceptable level. The maximum exposure with respect to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the 
balance sheet.

Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information 21 Financial risk management continued
Credit risk relating to trade receivables 
The Group’s major exposure to credit risk is in respect of trade receivables. Given the number and geographical spread of the Group’s ultimate 
customers and the solvency of major trade debtors, credit risk is believed to be limited. The Group is not reliant on any particular customer in 
the markets in which it operates and there is no significant concentration of credit risk. The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts 
in order to minimise this exposure.
The Group has strict procedures in place to manage the credit risk on trade receivables. Customer credit risk is managed by each operating 
company within a division but is subject to Group oversight to ensure that each division’s customer credit risk management system operates 
in a prudent and responsible manner. Credit evaluations are performed for all customers and credit limits are established based on internal 
or external rating criteria. The credit quality of the Group’s significant customers is monitored on an ongoing basis, and receivables that are 
neither past due nor impaired are considered of good credit quality. Letters of credit or payments in advance are obtained where customer 
credit quality is not considered strong enough for open credit.
Trade receivables are denominated in the currencies in which the Group trades. The Group’s policy is that receivables and payables not in the 
functional currency of the subsidiary concerned are, in the main, hedged through forward foreign currency exchange contracts. 
There were no material impairments of trade receivables as at 31 December 2017 or 2016. The solvency of the debtor and their ability to repay 
the receivables were considered in assessing the impairment of such assets.
 
(i) Risk for trade receivables by geographical regions

(iii) Credit risk related to other financial assets and cash deposits
Credit risk relating to the Group’s other financial assets, principally comprising cash and cash equivalents, other receivables and derivative 
financial instruments, arises from the potential default of counterparties. Credit risk arising from balances with banks and financial institutions 
is monitored by the Group’s Treasury department. Investment of cash and deposits is made only with approved counterparties of high credit 
worthiness and are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of developments in financial markets.
No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non-performance of the counterparties to derivative financial instruments 
and other receivables.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December was:
£million 2017 2016
Other receivables 10.4 4.9
Cash and cash equivalents 46.5 49.8
Derivative financial instruments (current assets) 1.6 0.6
 
e) Liquidity risk
The Group maintains a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on cash balances through the use 
of short-term cash deposits, credit facilities and longer-term debt instruments. Management regularly reviews the funding requirements 
of the Group.
The Group’s policy is to centrally manage debt and surplus cash balances.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had £154.6 million of undrawn committed borrowing facilities (2016: £65.2 million) and £49.6 million 
(2016: £57.6 million) of undrawn uncommitted borrowing facilities.

f) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” requires an analysis of those financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of the year in a 
fair value hierarchy. In addition, IFRS 13 requires financial instruments not measured at fair value, but for which fair value is disclosed, to be 
analysed in the same fair value hierarchy:
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).
 
Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Group’s financial instruments that are carried in the 
financial statements.
 2017 2016

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate 
the fair values:
• cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables approximate to their carrying amounts largely due to the 
short-term maturities of these instruments;
• the fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt and remaining maturities.
• the fair value of derivative financial instrument assets (£1.6 million) and liabilities (£0.6 million) are estimated by discounting expected 
future cash flows using current market indices such as yield curves and forward exchange rates over the remaining term of the instrument 
(level 2); and
• the fair value of investment properties are based on market valuations obtained through third party valuations (level 2).
g) Capital management
The overriding objectives of the Group’s capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern through 
the business cycle and to maintain an optimal capital structure by reducing the Group’s overall cost of capital. The Board considers equity 
shareholders’ funds as capital.
The Group maintains a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on cash balances through the use of 
short-term cash deposits, credit facilities and longer-term debt instruments, and management regularly reviews the funding requirements 
of the Group.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
126 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 21 Financial risk management continued
Dividends are paid when the Board considers it appropriate to do so, taking into account the availability of funding. The Group has a 
progressive dividend policy.
The Group has net funds of £47.0 million (2016: £55.4 million net debt). Included within the debt facilities are certain financial covenants related 
to net debt/EBITDA adjusted to exclude the items not included within underlying operating profit and EBITDA adjusted to exclude the items not 
included within underlying operating profit/net finance charges for which compliance certificates are produced on a 12-month rolling basis every 
half year. All financial covenants were fully complied with during the year and up to the date of approval of the financial statements. 
 
22 Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes 
The Group operates 401(k) plans in North America and defined contribution arrangements in the rest of the world. The assets of these 
schemes are held independently of the Group. The total contributions charged by continuing operations in respect of defined contribution 
schemes were £2.4 million (2016: £2.4 million).
Defined benefit schemes 
During the year the Group operated a significant defined benefit scheme in the UK and schemes in the USA (which includes a post retirement 
medical benefit element). The Group’s main scheme is the UK plan which commenced in 1993 and increased in size in 2006 and 2007 through 
the merger of the UK former schemes. The parent company is the sponsoring employer in the UK plan. The UK plan is governed by TTG Pension 
Trustees Limited (the “Trustee”) that has control over the operation, funding and investment strategy in consultation with the Group.
The scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, currency risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and market (investment) risk. 
The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks, but given the material nature of the UK scheme, the Group has 
developed a comprehensive strategy to manage the financial risk associated with it:
• Maintaining a long-term working partnership with the Trustee to ensure strong governance of risks within the UK scheme. The UK scheme is 
a long-term undertaking and is managed accordingly, in order to provide security to members’ benefits and value for money to the Group.
• A prudent investment strategy is pursued by seeking risk-rewarded long-term returns whilst removing the majority of liability mismatching 
unrewarded risks. As such, the Group has in place financial hedging that removes the majority of interest rate yield and inflation risk. At the 
current level there is no significant impact on the deficit of a 10bps fall in yields (which would be otherwise a circa £10 million increase if the 
hedge were not in place) thereby reducing volatility. This strategy has been in place for a number of years protecting the UK scheme’s 
position since December 2013 when yields commenced a prolonged decline.
• The Group recognises that seeking rewarded risk returns in its investment strategy could lead to short-term fluctuations in funding levels 
depending on market conditions. The Group considers that by maintaining a good relationship with the Trustee, it will be able to utilise 
flexibility in the funding regime to even out the impact of short-term market underperformance to enhance predictability of Group pension 
contributions. This creates a suitable balance between the needs of the UK scheme, the Group, and the members.
The Trustee’s investment strategy mitigates the majority of these risks. Market (investment) risk is addressed by diversification across asset 
classes and managers within those asset classes. During the year, some amendments were made to the investment strategy to reduce this risk 
further. With regard to currency risk, the Trustees hedge around 50% of developed market equities, 100% of alternatives and 100% of bonds 
(excluding local currency emerging market debt). The Company and Trustee undertook a pension increase exchange exercise in 2017 to reduce 
the scheme’s inflation risk exposure.
In addition, the Trustee has a framework in place to hedge a proportion of the scheme’s interest rate and inflation exposures. This framework is 
managed by investing in both physical and, for efficiency, derivative investments; and has a target to hedge 80% of the interest rate and 85% 
of the inflation linked liabilities. The target hedge level is kept under review and any change would be in consultation with the Group. 
The Trustee does not currently hedge the longevity risk, although prudent assumptions are made regarding anticipated longevity for the 
purposes of the actuarial valuation and Recovery Plan.
The Trustee, in conjunction with the Group, has a duty to ensure that the UK plan has an appropriate funding strategy in place that meets any 
local statutory requirements. The objective, which has been negotiated and agreed between the Group and the Trustee, is that the UK plan 
should target 100% funding on a basis that should ensure benefits can be paid as they fall due. Any shortfall in the assets relative to the 
funding target will be financed over a period that ensures the contributions are reasonably affordable to the Group.
The weighted average duration of the UK defined benefit obligation is 18 years.
127 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TT Electronics plc www.ttelectronics.com
Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information 22 Retirement benefit schemes continued
UK legislation requires the Trustee to carry out funding valuations at least every three years and to target full funding against a basis that 
prudently reflects the UK plan’s risk exposure. 
The Trustee allocates the UK plan’s assets across a range of investments to help diversify and manage risks. In particular a significant portion 
of the assets are in investments that aim to broadly match the term and nature of the liabilities.
The triennial valuation of the UK scheme as at April 2016 showed a deficit of £46.0 million against the Trustee’s funding objective compared 
with £19.1 million at April 2013. The Company has agreed additional fixed contributions extending to 2020 with the UK scheme, based on the 
actuarial deficit at April 2016. Given the nature of the Company’s control of the plan under the Scheme’s rules, a pension surplus may be 
accounted for under IFRIC 14.
These planned contributions amount to £4.9 million, £5.1 million and £3.9 million to be paid over the next three years.
In addition, the Company has set aside £2.6 million to be utilised in agreement with the Trustee for reducing the long-term liabilities 
of the scheme. 
Both the UK and USA schemes are closed to new members and the UK scheme was closed to future accrual in 2010. 
An actuarial valuation of the USA defined benefit scheme was carried out by independent qualified actuaries in 2017 using the projected unit 
credit method. Pension scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2017.
 
An analysis of the pension (surplus)/deficit by country is shown below:
£million 2017 2016
UK (15.1) 2.2
USA 3.2 3.5
Net (surplus)/deficit (11.9) 5.7
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations for the Group’s primary defined benefit scheme, the UK scheme, 
were as follows:
% 2017 2016
Discount rate 2.5 2.7
Inflation rate (RPI) 3.3 3.4
Increases to pensions in payment (LPI 5% pension increases) 3.1 3.3
Increases to deferred pensions (CPI) 2.3 2.4
The mortality tables applied by the actuaries at 31 December 2017 were S2 tables with 106% (male)/99% (female) weighting for pensioners 
and 109% (male)/100% (female) weighting for non-pensioners with a 1.25% long-term rate of improvement in conjunction with the CMI 2015 
projections. The assumptions are equivalent to life expectancies as follows:
Current pensioner aged 65: 87 years (male), 89 years (female).
Future retiree currently aged 40: 89 years (male), 92 years (female).
The mortality tables applied by the actuaries at 31 December 2016 were S2 tables with 106% (male)/99% (female) weighting for pensioners 
and 109% (male)/100% (female) weighting for non-pensioners with a 1.25% long-term rate of improvement in conjunction with the 
CMI 2015 projections.
A decrease in the discount rate by 0.1 % per annum increases the liabilities by approximately £9.7 million. An increase by 0.1 % per annum in 
the inflation rate increases the liabilities by approximately £3.8 million; by £1.1 million for pensions in payment and £2.7 million for deferred 
pensions. An increase in the life expectancy of one year increases the liabilities by approximately £20.8 million.

The sensitivities above consider the impact of the single change shown, with the other assumptions unchanged. The inflation sensitivities allow 
for the consequential impact on the relevant pension increase assumptions. The sensitivity analyses have been determined based on a method 
that extrapolates the impact on the defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of 
the reporting period.

Exercisable at 31 December – –
During 2016 and 2017, grants of awards were made under the LTIP for the issue of shares in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The award is 
a contingent right to receive shares in the future, subject to continued employment and the achievement of predetermined performance 
criteria. The performance targets attached to awards require the achievement of earnings per share (“EPS”) and total shareholder return 
(“TSR”) targets as detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 75. 
On 15 March, 17 August and 8 December 2017, grants of awards were made under the LTIP for the issue of up to 2,130,370 shares, 86,500 
shares and 15,447 shares respectively in 2020. On 16 March and 30 December 2016, grants of awards were made under the LTIP for the issue 
of up to 2,334,839 shares and 190,077 shares in 2019. 
 
The fair value of the shares was estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the shares were granted. This model simulates the TSR and compares it against the group of comparator companies. 
It takes into account historic dividends and share price fluctuations to predict the distribution of relative share price performance.

The award of shares is not affected by the risk free rate of interest since no investment is required by the recipient, and therefore no interest 
could be earned elsewhere. Expected volatility is based on historical share price movements.
On 15 March 2017, 58,275 (16 March 2016: 74,779) notional share awards were granted to senior executives which will ultimately be settled 
in cash. These awards are subject to the same vesting criteria as the 15 March, 17 August and 8 December 2017 (16 March and 30 December 
2016) LTIP grants. 
The performance conditions for the LTIP grants made on 9 May and 22 August 2014 were not met and, accordingly, no ordinary shares were 
issued during 2017 in connection with these awards.
A separate LTIP award made on 29 December 2014 vested on 1 January 2018.

b) Restricted Share Plan
On 25 March 2014, the Group granted 153,800 shares under the Restricted Share Plan. The award is a contingent right to receive shares with 
40% vesting on the third anniversary of the date of the grant and the remaining 60% vesting in April 2017 subject to continued employment 
with the Group and the achievement of predetermined performance criteria. The performance targets attached to the awards require the 
achievement of three equally weighted performance criteria: Revenue Growth Targets, Profit Margin Targets and Return on Capital Employed. 
The fair value of the shares at the grant date was 202.0p. The performance conditions associated with the vesting on the third anniversary 
were not met and, accordingly, no ordinary shares were issued during 2017 in connection with the award.
On 18 March 2015, the Group granted 1,015,000 shares under the Restricted Share Plan. The award is a contingent right to receive shares with 
50% vesting on the third anniversary of the date of the grant and the remaining 50% vesting in April 2018 subject to continued employment 
with the Group and the achievement of predetermined performance criteria. Half of the award is subject to a performance condition based 
on the absolute earnings per share figure for the financial year ending 31 December 2017. The remaining half of the award is subject to a 
performance condition comparing the Company’s total shareholder return performance against the constituent companies of the FTSE Small 
Cap Index (excluding investment trusts) over a period of three years commencing on the award date.
On 18 March 2015 50,000 shares were granted to a senior executive which will ultimately be settled in cash. This award is subject to the same 
criteria as the 18 March RSP grant.
On 30 December 2016 44,465 shares were also granted to a senior executive. The award is a contingent right to receive shares with 50% 
vesting on completion of a 0.21 year period and the remaining 50% vesting one year later subject to continued employment with the Group. 
The fair value of the shares at the grant date was 156.0p. Following completion of the initial vesting period, 22,232 shares vested.

Company statement of changes in equity
for year ended 31 December 2017
136 TT Electronics plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.ttelectronics.com 1 Significant accounting policies
a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements of TT Electronics plc (the “Company”) were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”). The amendments to FRS 101 (2013/14 Cycle) issued in July 2014 and effective immediately have been applied. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. 
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: 
• a Cash Flow Statement and related notes; 
• disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries; 
• disclosures in respect of capital management; 
• the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;
• disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel; and
• comparative movement tables for tangible and intangible fixed assets. 
The accounting policies set out in note 2 of the Consolidated financial statements have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to 
all years presented in the Company financial statements. 
b) Estimation uncertainty
Judgements made by the Directors, in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are as follows:
• Note 10 – Defined benefit pension obligations. The defined benefit pension obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions, 
including future inflation, salary increases and mortality and the obligation is then discounted to its present value using an assumed 
discount rate. The pension deficit has been calculated using the assumptions set out in note 22 of the Consolidated financial statements 
and; 
• Note 5 – Accruals. The Company makes appropriate provision on a consistent basis for restructuring and other normal trading exposures 
with estimates being made regarding the timing of future payments.
c) Going concern
Details of the Directors’ assessment of the Company’s ability to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of 
signing these financial statements are shown in note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements and in the Governance and Directors’ Report 
on page 54.
d) Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provision for impairment.
e) Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust
Transactions of the Company-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the 
Company’s financial statements. In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.

debts and the Company has therefore recorded an additional investment.

143 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TT Electronics plc www.ttelectronics.com
Strategic report Financial statements Governance and Directors’ report Additional information Alternative performance measure definitions 
These financial statements include alternative performance 
measures that are not prepared in accordance with IFRS. These 
alternative performance measures have been selected by 
management to assist them in making operating decisions because 
they represent the underlying operating performance of the Group 
and facilitate internal comparisons of performance over time.
Alternative performance measures are presented in these financial 
statements as management believe they provide investors with a 
means of evaluating performance of the Group on a consistent basis, 
similar to the way in which management evaluates performance, 
that is not otherwise apparent on an IFRS basis, given that certain 
non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items that management does 
not believe are indicative of the underlying operating performance 
of the Group are included when preparing financial measures under 
IFRS. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation 
from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared in 
accordance with IFRS.
The Group uses the following alternative performance measures:
Underlying operating profit 
Definition: Operating profit from continuing operations excluding 
the impacts of significant restructuring programmes, significant 
one-off asset impairments and business acquisition and divestment 
related activity. 
Free cash flow 
Definition: Total net cash flow from operating activities less total 
net cash flow from investing activities (excluding acquisitions and 
disposal proceeds) less interest paid. 
Underlying earnings per share 
Definition: Profit for the year attributable to the owners 
of the Company adjusted to exclude the items not included 
within underlying operating profit divided by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the period. We have chosen EPS as 
a KPI as it is a standard metric to determine corporate profitability 
for shareholders. In addition, it is a measure used as one of the 
performance conditions in the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan – 
see further details on page 71.
Underlying effective tax rate
Definition: The tax charge adjusted to exclude items not included 
within underlying operating profit divided by underlying profit 
before tax, which is also adjusted to exclude the items not included 
within underlying operating profit.
 
Other definitions 
Cash conversion percentage 
Definition: Underlying operating cash flow post capex (underlying 
EBITDA less net capital expenditure, capitalised development 
expenditure, working capital and non-cash movements) divided 
by underlying operating profit. Cash conversion measures how 
effectively we convert profit into cash and tracks the management 
of our working capital and capital expenditure.
Return on invested capital percentage 
Definition: Underlying operating profit for the preceding 12 month 
rolling period divided by monthly average invested capital for the 
preceding year. Invested capital is net assets excluding provisions, 
tax balances and financial assets and liabilities, including cash and 
borrowings. This measures how efficiently assets are utilised to 
generate returns with the target of exceeding the cost to hold 
the assets.
Operating margin percentage 
Definition: Underlying operating profit divided by revenue. 
R&D spend
Definition: R&D is defined as the cash spent on research and 
development activities expressed as a percentage of revenue for 
those divisions incurring R&D spend.
Employee engagement
Definition: We use our employee survey to measure how our 
employees feel about working in TT using a scale of 1 (low) to 7 
(high) against eight factors (as surveyed by Best Companies Ltd).
Safety performance
Definition: Safety performance is defined as the number 
of occupational injuries resulting in three or more days’ absence per 
1,000 employees. This KPI allows us to compare our performance 
with that of our peers. We use a UK benchmark published by the 
Health and Safety Executive and apply this to all of our facilities 
worldwide, reflecting our commitment to raising standards globally.
Organic revenue/operating profit growth
Definition: The percentage change in revenue/operating profit from 
continuing Group operations in the current year from the prior year. 
The effects of currency movements, divestments and acquisitions 
made during the current or prior financial year have been removed. 
This KPI measures the underlying growth of the business.
Earnings per share (EPS) 
Definition: EPS is calculated as the profit for the year attributable 
to the owners of the Company adjusted to exclude the items not 
included within underlying operating profit divided by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year. We have chosen 
EPS as a KPI as it is a standard metric to determine corporate 
profitability for shareholders. In addition, it is a measure used as 
one of the performance conditions in the Group’s Long Term 
Incentive Plan – see further details on page 71.
Return on invested capital
Definition: Return on Invested Capital is defined as underlying 
operating profit for the year divided by average invested capital for 
the year. Average invested capital excludes provisions, tax balances 
and financial assets and liabilities, including cash and borrowings. 
This measures how efficiently assets are utilised to generate returns 
with the target of exceeding the cost to hold the assets.
