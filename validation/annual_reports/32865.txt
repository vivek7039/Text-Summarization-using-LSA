Sanne Group plc Annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017
Chairman’s Statement
“ SANNE has 
continued to evolve 
as an organisation, 
integrating 
acquisitions and 
emerging with a 
regional and global 
business model.”
Rupert Robson 
C h airm an
Overview
I am pleased to present the Sanne Group plc’s 
Annual Report and Accounts for the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017.
Performance
SANNE has delivered a strong set of financial 
results in 2017. Total revenues increased by 77% 
overall, with organic revenue growth of 14%. The 
Group’s underlying operating profit increased by 
76% to £38.8 million.  Operating profit was £23.1 
million. Underlying profit before tax increased by 
79% to £38.1 million. Profit before tax was £22.4 
million. The Group’s underlying operating profit 
margin was 34.3%. 
The underlying diluted EPS was 23.7 pence (2016: 
16.9 pence). 
Increased dividend
The Board continues to adopt a progressive 
dividend policy, subject always to maintaining a 
sufficient level of dividend cover. It still expects to 
retain sufficient capital to fund ongoing operating 
requirements and to invest in the Group’s long-
term growth. 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 8.4 
pence per ordinary share (2016: 6.4 pence). The 
final dividend will be payable on 15 May 2018 to 
Shareholders on the register at close of business 
on 3 April 2018.
Together with the previously paid 2017 interim 
dividend of 4.2 pence per share, this gives a total 
dividend for the year of 12.6 pence per share 
(2016: 9.6 pence in total).
Business development
SANNE has continued to evolve as an organisation, 
integrating acquisitions and emerging with 
a regional and global business model. This 
places the Group in a strong position to address 
worldwide opportunities as it builds a sustainable 
global business. Further, the business continues 
to invest significantly in staff training and group 
services functions, strengthening its procedures.
The alternative fund administration market 
continues to expand, offering good prospects for 
the Group. Increasing and changing regulations 
are difficult to deal with in-house and outsourcing 
the administration of this to a specialist provider 
with a global footprint such as SANNE becomes an 
ever more attractive proposition.
2017 was a year of group-wide consolidation, 
and significant work has been undertaken to 
strengthen procedures and controls. SANNE’s 
2016 acquisitions have been largely integrated 
into the business, offering an expanded global 
reach. The Company re-invested in 2017 and 
into 2018, in internal support, within the control 
functions and in bolstering the first and second 
lines of defence. Additional investment has also 
been made in staff training and in standardising 
our processes and procedures. This underpins our 
strategy of a compliance culture.
SANNE completed the acquisition of the Mauritian 
business, International Financial Services Limited 
and IFS Trustees (together IFS) on 1 January 2017, 
and increased its Luxembourg presence with the 
acquisitions of Luxembourg Investment Solutions 
S.A. (LIS) and Compliance Partners S.A. (CP) on 6 
February 2018.
Corporate governance
During the year the Board has further developed 
its corporate governance. The Nomination 
Committee was evolved into the Nomination 
and Governance Committee, and it was decided 
to split the Audit and Risk Committee into two 
separate committees. The corporate governance 
framework needs to support processes and create 
a strong tone from the top. The strengthening 
of our framework will help the Company build 
its business and support sustainable growth. 
More information is provided on our corporate 
governance in the Director’s Report on pages 
47 to 49. In addition, on pages 42 to 47 there is 
a report on how SANNE complies with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code).
In 2017, the Board and the Committees 
had an external effectiveness review. The 
conclusions from the review were useful and its 
recommendations have been accepted.

Our people
I would like to thank everyone, on behalf of the 
Board, for their hard work and contribution to 
the Group’s 2017 performance. There is more 
information on our people, diversity and inclusion 
on pages 27 and 51.
Our role in society
In this year’s report there is included for the first 
time a section on Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR). SANNE supports the charitable efforts of 
staff around the Group and its strategy focusses 
on three core CSR themes; benefiting children, 
fighting poverty and supporting education. 
The Committees and the Board have discussed 
gender pay, diversity and inclusion.  The Board 
has reviewed gender pay and is looking to ensure 
internal procedures are enhanced to ensure all 
staff are treated equally. 
The Company is keen to ensure that its 
environmental impact is minimised and takes 
a number of steps to seek to reduce its carbon 
footprint, by encouraging the use of conference 
calls to reduce travel, recycling materials and 
selecting new offices that are built with the 
environment in mind.
Our culture
SANNE has a strong collegiate culture, which 
encourages entrepreneurial drive. In 2017 (and 
early 2018) the Company introduced further 
training to optimise its compliance and control 
processes at the centre of our business. SANNE 
has also built its assurance capability further in 
2017 and early 2018 to maintain focus in this area. 
Board membership
Spencer Daley, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), is to 
take on the role of Head of M&A and Strategy, 
with responsibility for helping the Group explore 
and maximise strategic opportunities, both 
organic and inorganic. Spencer will be succeeded 
as CFO by James Ireland.
I am delighted that James is joining SANNE as CFO 
as Spencer’s successor. He has worked very closely 
with both Dean Godwin, SANNE’s Chief Executive 
Officer, and Spencer for a number of years, and 
engaged well with the broader management team 
and Board at SANNE. His background will be a 
great asset in helping the business to deliver its 
future development and global growth plans.
James joins SANNE from Investec, where he has 
been for over 10 years, advising public and private 
companies on mergers and acquisitions and 
equity capital markets transactions. James has 
acted as a board-level adviser to a broad range of 
businesses including internationally diverse groups 
with a significant emphasis on human capital for 
their service delivery. Most recently he has been 
the head of Investec’s Support Services sector 
team which includes the fund and corporate 
administration services sector. He is expected to 
join the Board as CFO in June 2018, at which point 
Spencer will step down from the Board.
Mel Carvill was welcomed to the Board on 1 
January 2018. Currently based in Guernsey, 
Mel brings global financial services and risk 
management experience accumulated from his 
time at Generali and more recently at PPF Group. 
He will serve as Chairman of the newly constituted 
Risk Committee.
Phil Godley stepped down from the Board on 
1 January 2018. Phil's business leadership and 
valuable contribution to the Board have hugely 
supported SANNE through its launch on the stock 
market and in the period since.
Outlook
SANNE has had a year of progress with strong 
financial results. Our longer-term prospects 
are driven by the strong growth in the global 
alternatives market. The increase in workloads of 
asset managers creates additional administration 
that SANNE can manage as an outsourced 
solution with our international footprint. Looking 
forward we are building on our success as a high 
growth sustainable business whilst investing in 
our infrastructure. Against this background, the 
outlook for 2018 continues to look promising.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
“Strategic 
recruitment of 
talent and increased 
jurisdictional 
presence have helped 
us to deliver high 
quality professional 
services.”
Dean Godwin 
  r
Our vision
SANNE’s vision is to be one of the world’s leading 
providers of alternative asset and corporate 
administrative services. We have been driving to 
achieve this through building a sustainable global 
business based on best practice, professionalism, 
ambition, integrity and engagement. Strategic 
recruitment of talent and increased jurisdictional 
presence have helped us to deliver high quality 
professional services. 
The aim is to deliver services to a range of 
international, institutional and private client 
customers. SANNE seeks to ensure excellent client 
service, based on our organisational values of 
professionalism and integrity.
Our markets
Our focus is to continue to build scale in 
established and emerging markets in order that 
we can deliver global solutions to new and existing 
clients. We continue to see the trend towards the 
outsourcing of corporate and fund administration 
activity from institutions and asset managers to 
ease administration and to have independent 
oversight. We provide administration services for 
alternatives and due to greater outsourcing, partly 
as a result of a changing regulatory environment, 
demand is increasing. There is more detail on 
our business model on pages 8 to 9 and on our 
segmental reporting on pages 16 to 20.
Brexit
The impact of Brexit in the market is unlikely to 
damage global demand for services, however we 
anticipate that our offices in Dublin, Luxembourg, 
Malta and the Netherlands are likely to benefit 
from any potential increase in demand. Our recent 
acquisition of Luxembourg Investment Solutions 
S.A. and Compliance Partners S.A. has further 
strengthened our EU footprint.
2017
During the year we have focused on ensuring our 
business model is built for expansion. We have 
recruited new talent in client and group services 
and invested in infrastructure. At the same time 
we have consolidated our processes and boosted 
our back office functions.
We have further developed the three lines of 
defence, ensuring we have specialist compliance 
personnel working with the business in 
conjunction with the checks and balances from 
the second line of defence in Risk and Compliance 
and Internal Audit (the third line). In addition, we 
have internal financial controls in place to protect 
SANNE and our clients. Details of our approach 
to controls can be found in the Risk Management 
Report on pages 22 to 26 and in the Report of the 
Audit and Risk Committee on pages 52 to 56.
SANNE has had a successful year and highlights 
include the acquisition of our new Mauritian 
business, IFS. After the year-end we also finalised 
the acquisition of Luxembourg Investment 
Solutions S.A. and Compliance Partners S.A. on 6 
February 2018. These businesses have expanded 
our expertise and jurisdictional coverage.
Senior Management
Further to the CFO announcement today, I am 
pleased to welcome James Ireland, who will join 
us in June, as the new CFO. It is recognised that 
Spencer is an important part of the SANNE’s 
success story. He has been instrumental in helping 
IPO the Group in 2015 and has played a key role 
in the strong growth of the business over the 
past five years. His entrepreneurial spirit is ideally 
suited to his new role, Head of M&A and Strategy, 
as the business looks forward to capturing the 
opportunities that lie ahead.
On 1 January 2018 Phil Godley stepped down from 
the Board. I wish to thank Phil for his contribution 
to the Board. 
There were a number of key internal promotions 
over the past year that strengthened the SANNE 
management team:
• Martin Schnaier was promoted into the role 
of Chief Commercial Officer.
• Sean Murray was appointed as the Managing 
Director for EMEA Alternatives, previously 
held by Martin Schnaier. 
• Mark Law joined on 14 August 2017 to lead 
our Asia-Pacific & Mauritius business. He is 
based in Hong Kong.

Our organisation

and its geographies. This enables clients to benefit 
from our knowledge and in-depth understanding 
of local jurisdictions. SANNE is investing in people 
and processes to continue to provide our clients 
with a quality service.
The business strategy adopted by the Board has 
allowed SANNE to enhance its value to clients 
and stakeholders. We will look to continue to 
capture the increased demand for our services, 
and maintain our position as a trusted and valued 
partner by our clients.
T raining
As an organisation of professionals, we continue 
to promote a culture of learning and development 
of our staff. I am proud that there is continued 
investment in training with support for staff to 
complete professional qualifications.
Our culture
SANNE's culture is collegiate. Our values and 
behaviours are professionalism, integrity, 
ambition, enthusiasm and engagement. These 
behaviours support our vision to build a 
sustainable global business based on best practice. 
I am committed to driving the communication of 
our values, and will be ensuring that these are 
embedded in our business.

Strategic Report
Market
The diversified nature of the business provides 
a degree of hedging against macroeconomic 
volatility; for instance, the emergence of 
specialist asset classes such as private debt offer 
new investment opportunities for institutional 
investors.
The global alternatives market has continued to 
show strong growth in recent years as investor 
bases have evolved, reacting to more choice, 
diversification and sustainable, longer-term 
returns. According to a recent report by PwC
1
, 
growth is set to continue, with global alternative 
assets under management expected to reach 
US$18.1 trillion by 2020, compared to US$10 
trillion in 2015. PwC, in a separate report
2
, 
attributes the expected growth in the industry 
to a government-incentivised shift to individual 
retirement plans, the increase of high-net-worth 
individuals from emerging markets, and new 
market entrants in the form of sovereign and 
public pension funds.
Against this backdrop, a material factor driving 
the increasing demand for the Group’s services is 
the growing level of regulation being applied by 
authorities to the alternatives industry. Legislation 
and regulation such as AIFMD, CRS, FATCA and 
GDPR for example, create a considerable increase 
in workload for funds and asset managers that 
is complicated and costly to deal with in-house. 
Factoring in the evolving nature of the regulatory 
landscape, the rate of technological change, the 
substantial penalties for failing to comply, the 
added complexity brought about by different 
approaches and obligations across jurisdictions, 
and the option of outsourcing to specialist, 
regulated administrators with an international 
footprint and expertise, such as SANNE, becomes 
increasingly compelling. This is supported by the 
results of a 2016 Preqin survey
3
, which suggests 
that, from relatively low levels, there is a growing 
number of fund managers seeking to establish 
new relationships with third party service 
providers to outsource various administrative 
functions of their business.
SANNE is a global 
business that operates 
in a highly fragmented 
industry and serves 
a number of end 
markets with signiﬁcant 
opportunities for growth, 
including alternatives 
(debt, real estate, private 
equity and hedge), 
corporates and private 
clients.

Taking each geographic region in turn, SANNE 
continues to win business from new and existing 
clients in EMEA, supported by its increased 
operational capacity across Belgrade, Mauritius 
and Cape Town.
The North American region continues to grow 
in importance to the business following the 
2016 acquisition of FLSV Fund Administration 
Services LLC. The region is the world’s largest 
market for alternative asset management with 
private capital assets under management (AUM) 
of US$2.4 trillion and it is forecast to grow at a 
compound annual growth rate of around 13% 
over the next three to four years. At present, 
only circa 30% of North American private capital 
(AUM) is outsourced to third party administrators. 
This is estimated to reach circa 50% by 2020, 
driven by regulatory change, evolving reporting 
requirements and the need for increased 
investment in technology infrastructure, providing 
a significant growth opportunity for SANNE. 
The Group’s acquisition of IFS in Mauritius at the 
beginning of 2017 has enabled SANNE to take 
advantage of the significant growth opportunity 
across the wider Asia-Pacific and Mauritius 
region. Emerging markets have seen strong 
growth in allocations to alternative assets under 
management in recent years and the scale that 
SANNE now has in these markets will ensure 
that increasing market share is a key focus in this 
region. Taking the private equity asset class as 
an example, the share of global private equity 
and venture capital investment being made 
in emerging markets was up from 6% to 22% 
between 2003 and 2013. This increase has been 
driven by economic reform, increased freedom of 
trade and GDP growth in emerging markets.
Research suggests that trends within the general 
corporate and private client markets will also 
continue to move in the Group’s favour. A 2017 
report by Bain & Company
4
 found that the global 
trust and corporate service market is likely to 
grow at 3-5% per year through 2020 on the back 
of rising household wealth and greater corporate 
and tax regulation. With these markets subject 
to many of the same regulatory and legislative 
drivers as the alternatives industry, demand for 
the outsourcing of administration services in the 
general corporate and private client markets looks 
set to remain healthy.

Strategic Report
Strategy
The strategic focus of the Group is to be 
recognised as one of the world’s leading providers 
of alternative asset and corporate administration 
services by continuing to build scale in established 
and emerging markets. The Group will continue to 
focus on developing its client base of alternative 
asset managers, family offices, financial 
institutions and corporates.
Organic growth
The key drivers of the Group’s organic growth 
strategy include:
• Building out SANNE’s presence in existing 
asset classes, with a particular focus on the 
alternatives space;
• Development of core asset led offerings to 
drive increased revenue opportunities;
• Market share development through the 
deepening of existing client relationships by 
offering the most comprehensive product 
and jurisdictional range;
• Cross-selling to existing clients between 
divisions and geographies and delivering 
new client wins through direct referrals, 
intermediary referrals and direct targeting. 
This includes inter-divisional initiatives to sell 
ancillary corporate products and services to 
existing fund clients;
• Expansion of global network and platforms 
by building scale in key jurisdictions 
to support operational growth and 
diversification and to capitalise on high 
growth markets; and
• Expansion of existing services available to 
clients to ensure that the Group can continue 
to provide a one-stop shop solution to clients 
in each asset class, as well as differentiating 
SANNE from its competitors. Examples 
include the further development of AIFMD 
depositary and third party AIFM services.
Acquisition growth
The Group’s acquisition strategy is demonstrated 
by management’s post-listing track record in 
sourcing, executing and integrating acquisitions. 
The Group has a highly selective and disciplined 
approach to acquisitions, seeking to add capital 
value to SANNE without an adverse impact on the 
existing business.
Assessments are made as to the long-term 
strategic rationale of acquisition opportunities 
based on a number of factors, including the ability 
to:
• Build operational scale in existing and/or 
complementary jurisdictions;
• Strengthen SANNE’s existing service delivery 
platform and to deliver operational capability 
to support SANNE’s growth story;
• Acquire a skilled workforce to support 
SANNE’s people-led approach;
• Make synergies (rationalisation of systems 
and central functions) and cross-selling 
opportunities within the combined business;
• Deliver an alternative, lower cost outsourced 
platform; and
• Further strengthen client relationships in 
cases where there are common clients.
The Group has been active in the acquisition 
space, completing on IFS on 1 January 2017 and 
LIS and CP on 6 February 2018. These acquisitions 
have delivered greater geographic diversity and 
a more comprehensive product offering in the 
Group’s more established markets.
Further details of these acquisitions are  
provided overleaf.
 
The Group has successfully grown in recent years both organically and 
inorganically. New business is sourced both from cross-selling to existing clients 
and from developing new client relationships.

Segmental Business Review  
North America Alternatives business
Overview
SANNE’s North American Alternatives business 
consists solely of the acquired business of FLSV 
Fund Administration Services LLC (FAS) for the 
reporting year. The acquisition completed on 
1 November 2016 and the business moved to 
the SANNE brand in May 2017 after a period of 
integration. The SANNE North American operation 
is a New York headquartered provider of fund 
administration services to a range of close-
ended alternative investment funds including 
private equity, venture capital, distressed debt, 
infrastructure, real estate and fund-of-funds.
Services include assistance with fund, partner 
and portfolio accounting, cash management and 
operations support including general partner 
carried interest plans and investor services. 
Capabilities also include bespoke investor 
reporting, customised on individual client 
requirements.
SANNE’s North American Alternatives business 
has approximately 75 professionals in New York 
with additional support from dedicated client 
services and technology teams based in Belgrade, 
Serbia - where more than 70 professionals support 
the North America operation and other regional 
businesses.
Performance summary
Revenues for the year ended 31 December 2017 
were £19.1 million with a gross profit of  
£9.7 million.
During the year results were delivered from a 
number of new funds established by existing 
clients, and through the on-boarding of new 
clients in the region. The business has also 
contributed additional business to SANNE EMEA 
through cross-selling existing client needs for 
offshore (non US) services. 
The business has a well-established fund 
administration technology platform which 
continues to be core to the services provided  
to clients. The Group has added senior 
management capacity in the New York office to 
support expansion both locally, and in the wider 
North American market.
Underlying market conditions for alternative 
asset management continues to be positive with 
an increased trend toward outsourcing back and 
middle office functions by investment managers 
driven by demand for increasingly sophisticated 
reporting requirements and demand amongst 
institutional investors for independent oversight.

Strategic Report
Segmental Business Review   
EMEA Alternatives business
Overview
SANNE’s EMEA Alternatives business includes four 
key alternative asset strategies (Debt, Real Estate, 
Private Equity and Hedge). 
Debt
The Debt business provides fund, corporate 
administration and loan agency services in 
respect of private debt and capital markets 
to broadly two types of client: leading global 
financial institutions and debt asset managers. The 
business’s debt capital markets offering provides 
corporate services to a range of SPVs for many of 
Europe’s major banks and other global financial 
institutions. Internal asset class experience covers 
a complete range of capital markets transaction 
structures including European medium-term note 
programmes, collateral loan obligations, asset 
backed securities and repackaging transactions. 
The business’s private debt team covers the main 
private debt asset classes including real estate 
finance, leveraged loans, non-performing loans, 
structured finance and infrastructure debt. The 
business offers debt specific financial reporting 
and transaction management expertise and 
specialist debt related services including loan 
administration and facility agent services.
Real Estate
The Real Estate business provides corporate 
and fund administration services to real estate 
managers, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds 
and institutions across a range of real estate 
structures and their underlying vehicles. These 
underlying vehicles hold a range of property 
classes including offices, hotels, logistics, 
residential, student accommodation, industrial, 
retail and development. The business’s clients 
are generally broken down into two key types: 
real estate corporate structures and real estate 
investment funds. The business’s corporate team 
provides administration services to real estate 
clients comprising regulated and unregulated 
vehicles for both direct and indirect investment in 
real estate. Services cover the complete life cycle 
of commercial and residential portfolios through 
their acquisition, sale, leasing, development, 
management and operation. The business’s real 
estate funds team provides fund administration 
and related services to regulated and unregulated 
funds investing both directly and indirectly into 
real estate assets with a portfolio comprising 
open-ended and closed-ended public funds, 
private funds and joint ventures.
Private Equity
The Private Equity business provides specialist 
fund and corporate administration services to 
private equity managers, financial institutions 
and family offices with private equity style 
investment vehicles. The business operates 
across the majority of the Group’s jurisdictional 
centres whilst also providing certain services 
to funds established in other jurisdictions 
including the Cayman Islands, BVI and Delaware. 
Services are delivered across a single platform 
supported by industry recognised IT systems. 
Multifunctional service teams include professional 
fund administrators, company secretaries and 
qualified accountants, with an understanding of 
specific niche assets and the regulatory framework 
in place in each jurisdiction. The strategies of 
funds being administrated include leveraged 
buyout, venture, growth and fund-of-funds. The 
business has specific expertise and experience 
in energy, infrastructure, bio-ventures, emerging 
markets and secondaries. Services include the 
provision of directors, transaction management, 
administration, financial reporting and compliance 
services involving regulatory and tax reporting to 
alternative investment funds, their managers and 
special purpose vehicles.
Hedge
The Hedge business offers middle and back-
office services for a broad range of fund types 
and standalone structures. Services include fund 
accounting, investor services, cash custody and 
a variety of middle office activites. Based in Cape 
Town, the business has seen the domestic industry 
become increasingly institutionalised following 
the introduction of new regulations and is the 
market leading administrator in South Africa. As 
an immediate result of the regulatory changes, the 
business now offers independent management 
company services to regulated collective investor 
schemes.
Performance summary
Revenues for the year ended 31 December 2017 
were £46.8 million with a gross profit of 
 £29 million.
EMEA Alternatives saw positive growth in business 
wins from new clients, as well as from existing 
clients. Fund related work contributed to the 
majority of that growth. 
We are one of the leading providers of debt 
administration services in the EMEA market and 
have seen some good traction within the capital 
markets space for structured finance. 
The Real Estate business division continues to 
grow across the range of core international 
jurisdictions with a good mix of new and existing 
clients. 
The Hedge business division had a challenging 
year given the backdrop of a relatively depressed 
local market in South Africa and local funds’ 
performance. The division successfully completed 
a highly intensive, long running project to migrate 
a large portfolio of clients on to a new regulated 
management company platform, in accordance 
with regulatory changes in South Africa.
During the first half of 2017, the Private Equity 
business division continued to grow its offering to 
institutional private equity houses. In particular, 
the division has seen a number of opportunities 
arising through relationships introduced by the 
Americas Alternative business.

Segmental Business Review   
Asia-Pacific & Mauritius Alternatives business
Overview
SANNE’s Asia-Pacific & Mauritius Alternatives 
business predominantly services real estate, 
private equity and a smaller proportion of 
debt funds.  In the period, SANNE’s existing 
business operations in Hong Kong, Singapore and 
Shanghai were bolstered following the completed 
acquisition of IFS a Mauritian-based provider of 
fiduciary management services, specifically the 
incorporation of companies and trusts, general 
management administration, accounting and 
corporate services. The acquisition provides 
SANNE with access to more markets in the region, 
especially India.
Performance summary
Revenues for the year ended 31 December 2017 
were £27.9 million with a gross profit of  
£21.5 million.
During the period, strong growth has been 
delivered within the real estate and private 
equity asset classes in Hong Kong, Shanghai 
and Singapore, with advantage being taken of 
good cross-selling opportunities from EMEA 
Alternatives' and North American Alternatives' 
clients. 
Within the business, operational capability has 
been expanded in Shanghai, Hong Kong and 
Singapore in line with client requirements and 
Mark Law has been appointed to head up the 
regional business. 
In Mauritius the integration of IFS has provided 
additional flow of work into the pipeline which 
continues to be healthy. The Group is also seeing 
an increase in cross-selling opportunities to and 
from the region, expanding the client offering 
across the whole Asia-Pacific & Mauritius region. 
The region displays good growth potential within 
the existing jurisdictional offering.

Strategic Report
Segmental Business Review 
Corporate & Private Client (CPC) business
Overview
CPC comprises four businesses, all focused 
primarily on two client segments namely 
corporates and private clients around the world. 
Corporate & Institutional 
(C&I)
SANNE’s C&I business offers a comprehensive 
range of administration and accounting services 
to international corporates and institutions. 
The business assists clients and their advisers in 
establishing and providing ongoing administration 
services for a diverse range of structures, including 
group restructuring, asset holding vehicles, 
joint ventures, corporate funds and group 
financing vehicles. Services include governance, 
fiduciary, company secretarial support, financial 
reporting, regulatory reporting (FATCA and CRS), 
acting as listing sponsor for the Channel Islands 
Securities Exchange (rebranded in March 2017 
to the International Stock Exchange) and AIFMD 
depositary services. The C&I business often works 
in conjunction with the Group’s other business 
areas to provide complementary and ancillary 
corporate services to specialist asset structures 
to extend the scope of services available to the 
client base.
Executive Incentives
SANNE’s Executive Incentives business provides 
specialist trustee services and associated 
administration to support the operation of a 
range of employee and executive incentive plans. 
These services are provided to LSE Main Market, 
AIM and internationally listed companies, private 
companies, private equity backed businesses 
and fund managers. Services include trustee 
services to employee share trusts, incentive 
plan management, corporate nominee account 
administration, transaction management and the 
administration of corporate actions and associated 
transactions. A range of specialist services are 
also offered to fund managers. These include deal 
executive and partner incentive and retention 
plans, co-investment and carried interest plans, 
and key-man incentive and retention plans for 
private equity investee/portfolio companies. A 
private equity incubator service has also been 
developed specifically to offer a cost-effective 
solution for the swift implementation and efficient 
administration of employee trusts commonly 
required to hold key managers’ interests during 
the incubation phase of a company, following 
private equity investment.
Private Client
SANNE’s Private Client business provides 
independent fiduciary, administration and 
accounting services primarily to institutionally 
minded ultra-high-net-worth individuals and 
families, often working with their respective 
family offices. The business administers structures 
which enable clients to preserve and enhance 
family wealth and establish a legacy for future 
generations within a well-regulated environment. 
This includes the provision of services to single 
and multi-family offices tailored to ensure the 
optimum use of the family offices’ own in-house 
capabilities consistent with client objectives and 
planning requirements. The teams’ expertise 
includes transaction management capabilities 
across a variety of asset classes including (but 
not limited to) private equity and real estate. 
The Private Client business also establishes 
investment vehicles for private clients either 
investing individually or on a collective basis (with 
other family members, family offices or business 
associates) through the use of companies, limited 
partnerships and unit trusts. 
T reasury
SANNE continues to invest in its Treasury division 
which works closely and collaborates with the 
Group's other divisions and business areas to 
deliver competitive foreign exchange and treasury 
management services to client structures. 
Services are focused on improving management 
of risk through diversification of deposits across 
a number of banks enhancing returns through 
active treasury management asset pooling as 
well as providing foreign exchange and escrow 
services. Services are delivered by experienced 
treasury specialists with a deep understanding 
of money markets and an ability to balance risk 
management and yield enhancement objectives.
Performance summary
Revenues for the year ended 31 December 2017 
were £19.4 million with a gross profit of  
£12.3 million.
The C&I division showed revenue and gross 
profit growth resulting from a good level of new 
business wins and execution of cross selling 
opportunities (including CRS/FATCA regulatory 
reporting services across most divisions), along 
with disciplined cost management. Global 
trends around increased corporate outsourcing, 
particularly in the regulatory and compliance 
space, position C&I well for continued longer term 
growth. 
The Executive Incentives division showed growth 
in revenue despite some new larger engagements 
won in late 2016/early 2017 taking longer to 
implement.  Disciplined cost management 
enabled improvement in gross profit. Global 
trends in regard to executive compensation, 
including toward equity based plans, deferred 
compensation and carried interest structures, 
bode well for the sustained growth of the 
Executive Incentives division over the longer term.  
C&I and Executive Incentives share a very similar 
(corporate) client base and we plan for increased 
collaboration with anticipated synergies.
The Private Client division showed growth and 
continues its strategic focus on institutionally 
minded ultra-high-net-worth families and 
their family offices, with a continued focus on 
outsourcing of their fiduciary and administrative 
needs.
The Treasury division, whilst the smallest of 
the CPC divisions, showed very good revenue 
growth resulting from cash management and 
foreign exchange transactions wins and a strong 
pipeline has been developed through cross 
selling initiatives across the global business.  The 
potentially global and scalable nature of this 
division positions it well for further strong growth.

administration services, risk management is at 
the core of the Group’s day-to-day activities. 
It recognises that uncertain events (risks) can 
occur which may have an adverse effect upon 
the achievement of these strategic objectives. 
Nonetheless the Group recognises it must 
be willing to take risks, in a considered and 
controlled manner, if its strategic objectives are 
to be accomplished. This section of the report 
explains the objectives, responsibility and recent 
improvements to the risk management approach, 
which is designed to identify, assess and manage 
these risks.
Objectives of risk 
management
The prime objectives of risk management in the 
Group are to ensure that there is:
• A strong risk awareness culture, with a strong 
tone from the top, so that the Group is able 
to identify, assess and manage the key risks 
to the business and, by doing so, support  
the execution of business strategy;
• clearly defined risk responsibilities promoting 
appropriate risk-taking behaviour;
• an appropriate balance between cost of 
control and risk management, whilst also 
operating within the defined risk appetite; 
and
• a suitable basis upon which the Board can 
reach its conclusions on the effectiveness  
of the Group’s risk management and  
internal controls.
Responsibility
The Board has overall accountability for ensuring 
any risks that could impact the success of 
delivering the Group’s long-term strategic 
objectives are effectively managed. The Board 
has delegated oversight of the risk and control 
environment to the Risk Committee. 
The Board decided to split the Audit and Risk 
Committee into two Committees.  The Risk 
Committee now consists of three independent 
Non-executive Directors (NEDs) and the Chairman 
and is responsible for recommending the risk 
appetite to the Board and for seeking sufficient 
assurance that the risk and control environment is 
operating effectively throughout the Group.
The Group has followed industry standards for risk 
management governance and adopted the ‘three 
lines of defence’ framework, namely First Line risk 
management, Second Line risk assurance, and 
Internal Audit.
The First Line, owned by the Chief Commercial 
Officer (CCO) and the Chief Operating Officer 
(COO), is responsible for the risk and control 
environment across all divisions, functions and 
jurisdictions of the Group. 
The Second Line, owned by the Chief Risk Officer 
(CRO) and Group Compliance Officer (GCO), is 
responsible for challenging the First Line in its 
management of risk and for providing assurance 
to the Risk Committee on the effectiveness of the 
risk and control environment. 
The Head of Internal Audit is responsible 
for providing independent assurance on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s governance, risk 
management and the control environment. 
Notwithstanding the above framework, all 
employees have responsibility for quality control 
and general risk management activities, including 
the need to understand and adhere to policies 
and procedures.
Improvements to the risk 
management approach
During 2017 Sanne launched a programme to 
further strengthen the three lines of defence 
governance model, including the Compliance 
framework. This project was instigated following 
a period of rapid organic and inorganic growth, 
with a recognition of the benefits that would be 
obtained from a period of consolidation for the 
Group’s governance and the control framework. 
This project will continue in 2018 and seeks to 
achieve the following outcomes:
• Harmonising standards across business lines 
and geographies; 
• investment in risk and compliance capability 
across the three lines of defence, expanding 
control assurance activities; and 
• enhanced reporting of qualitative and 
quantitative metrics. 
Risk assessment
The Group reviews and monitors risk exposures 
closely, considering the potential impact and 
any management actions required to mitigate 
the impact of emerging issues and potential 
future events. The Group Risk Register is the 
principal tool for monitoring risks which are 
classified in a strict hierarchy (see table on the 
next page). The highest level (Level 1) identifies 
five risk categories: Business Model & Strategy, 
Operational, People, Regulatory and Financial. The 
next level (Level 2) contains 27 risk categories and 
the final level (Level 3) carries the detailed risks 
themselves which are captured and maintained 
across the Group.
Each Level 3 risk is rated by assessing the 
likelihood of its occurrence over the next three 
years and the associated impact. A scoring of 1 
to 4 is given to each risk which is then used in 
conjunction with an assessment of the internal 
control environment or other mitigations to derive 
a residual risk score.
Risk appetite
In determining its risk appetite, the Group has 
defined the levels of risk it is willing to take in the 
pursuit of its strategic objectives. 
This has been articulated as a Risk Appetite 
Statement with appetite set for each of the Level 
2 categories within the Group Risk Register. For 
each Level 2 risk category, the risk appetite is 
compared against the associated residual risk to 
identify areas of focus.
Principal risks
The risks from the Group Risk Register are 
discussed, debated and challenged, firstly by 
senior management and Executive Directors, 
and then by the Risk Committee, with a view to 
presenting the key risks to the Board. The Board 
has agreed that the top risks will be presented in 
the Annual Report and Accounts as the Principal 
Risks. 
Assessment of principal risks
Using the described approach, the Board is able 
to confirm that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group 
including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
Included on page 56 is the viability statement, 
which has been prepared with the assessment of 
these principal risks in mind.

Risk Description Key Mitigants
Business Model & Strategy 
Direction of change: 
During the period the Group has seen steady progress with the integration of more recent acquisitions. Recognising that SANNE has 
experienced a number of years of strong growth, both organically and inorganically, a number of projects (including strengthening 
the three lines of defence as mentioned on page 22) were initiated to enhance the business model and build stronger foundations 
for future sustainable growth. 
Acquisition Risk 
The risk that inadequate due diligence of future acquisitions made  
by the Group give rise to unidentified liabilities or unintended 
consequences and/or acquisitions made by the Group are poorly 
integrated, due to inadequate planning, lack of management 
oversight or lack of resources.
• Robust due diligence process including 3rd party assessments 
by top accounting and law firms, prior to recommendations to 
the Board
• Governance and challenge from independent Non-executive 
Directors
• Integration strategy in place prior to acquisition
• Integration Committees set up to manage integration processes
Competitor Risk
Failure to innovate and invest in appropriate systems increases 
the risk that we fall behind key competitors and do not meet the 
expectations of clients and other stakeholders.
Digital developments are rapidly evolving meaning that we must 
keep pace with the expectations of clients, especially with our 
strategic objective of delivering services to institutional clients.
• Divisional responsibility for identifying  
forthcoming requirements in respect of digital / business 
systems investment
• COO responsible for prioritising and monitoring investment in 
digital / business systems
• Board oversight of current and planned digital /  
business systems
Strategic Risk
The risk that the business model responds inadequately to changing 
market conditions or that strategic objectives are incorrectly 
set, such that sustainable growth, market share or profitability is 
affected.
This is particularly the case due to ongoing changes within the 
outsourced administration industry, whereby asset classes are 
evolving and new asset classes are being created
• Strategy regularly reviewed and challenged by  Executive 
Committee and Board respectively
• Strategy drives annual business planning process and 
performance based targets
• Operations Committee ensures matters escalated are aligned 
with strategy and risk appetite

Risk Description Key Mitigants
Operational
Direction of change: 
Continued acquisitions and strong growth in customer numbers and staffing has led to increases in inherent operational risk 
exposures for the Group, as anticipated in the 2016 Annual Report. These risks have been mitigated accordingly, and a number of 
operational projects have been instigated to further strengthen the control environment in this respect.  
Business Change Risk
The risk that the planning and implementation of change is 
ineffective or fails to deliver desired outcomes or results in 
resources being stretched to the detriment of business as usual 
activities.
• Documented business plans and IT strategy to mitigate risk
• Monitoring adherence to IT and non IT business plans and 
assurance on its delivery
• Over-arching governance of business critical change 
programmes provided by the Executive Committee and  
the Board 
Data Security Risk
The risk of a security breach (including cyber-attacks) leading to loss 
of confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of data.
• Defined IT security procedures
• Penetration testing
• System access controls and encryption
• Physical security at all locations
• Training and employee awareness
• Review of selected data security procedures and controls as 
part of the annual ISAE 3402 Type II report
Process Risk
The risk that general policies, procedures and processes are 
ineffective and/or inefficient leading to operational losses, poor 
client service and employee frustration.
• Continual development of procedures and controls with 
ongoing training
• Allocated responsibility for continual maintenance and 
enhancement of policies and procedures
• Three lines of defence assurance and controls testing
People
Direction of change: 
In key jurisdictions in which the Group operates, the fund and corporate administration employment market is increasingly 
competitive, which, along with the Group’s continuing organic growth, leads to difficulties in attracting and retaining the best 
resources. A centres of excellence initiative has commenced to centralise relevant processes in certain jurisdictions, which will help 
to mitigate this risk over the medium term. The continued growth of the Group has also provided the opportunity to introduce new 
members into the senior leadership team.    
Staff Resourcing Risk
Failure to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best people with 
the right capabilities across all levels and jurisdictions.
• Recruitment strategy to bolster teams, succession planning in 
place and employee value proposition
• Established Remuneration Committee for Executive Directors
• Set objectives over talent management and people 
development
• Regular remuneration benchmarking
• Established ACCA, ICAEW and ICSA training schemes
• Management and monitoring of capacity and work loads.

Risk Management 
continued
Risk Description Key Mitigants
Regulatory
Direction of change: 
The Group remains exposed to the political/regulatory risks arising from Brexit and will continue to monitor the political negotiations 
as they progress, along with the possible implications arising. Regulatory Compliance risk is in part correlated to business model, 
operational and staff risk, recognising that as the Group becomes larger and more diverse, the risk of an omission or error increases 
leading to possible regulatory sanction. This increasing risk is being mitigated by various projects, in particular the strengthening of 
the three lines of defence model.
Political / Regulatory Change Risk
The risk that SANNE’s business model is materially impacted by 
legal, political or regulatory changes which restrict access to markets 
or services.
• Brexit committee in place to consider specific risks arising 
• Product / jurisdictional diversification strategy reduces impact
• Jurisdictional oversight by Compliance
• Horizon scanning by the Second Line Committee for  
potential changes
• Strategy to ensure the business model remains flexible and 
responsive to change and is regularly reviewed
• Active dialogue with regulators, governmental and  
industry bodies
Regulatory Licence (Compliance) Risk
The risk that Sanne is exposed to regulatory sanction and 
subsequent reputational damage given a failure to follow regulatory 
laws, orders and codes of practice requirements.
• Promoting a strong risk and compliance culture across all staff
• Continued strengthening of the three lines of defence
• Appropriate compliance resources in each jurisdiction reporting 
to the Group Compliance Officer
• Defined and updated regulatory policies and procedures
• Compliance Monitoring programme
Financial
Direction of change: 
Given a significant number of acquisitions made by the Group in the last two years, there are significant intangible assets (including 
goodwill) on the balance sheet and the Group is further exposed to volatility arising from movements in currency exchange rates. 
Intangible Asset Risk
The risk that events arise, foreseen or unforeseen, which result in an 
impairment of the intangible assets, including goodwill, held on the 
balance sheet.
• Robust due diligence process including 3rd party assessments by 
Top 4 accountancy firms, prior to acquisitions being completed
• Regular impairment testing as per accounting rules
• Ongoing management and monitoring against performance 
assumptions
Foreign Exchange Risk
The risk that the Group’s earnings are volatile as a result of 
movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Group’s 
exposure comes primarily from the Group’s operating activities 
outside of its reporting currency. 
• Cash management procedures are in place to reduce the impact 
of foreign exchange gains and losses through profit and loss as 
a result of short-term fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
rates
• Matching of cash flows where possible
• Permanent changes to foreign currency exchange rates will have 
an impact on the future earnings of the Group and whilst this is 
not mitigated further it is monitored and reported

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Our communities
We believe in helping and influencing the 
communities where we operate. In 2017, we 
continued to engage with the communities in 
which we have offices. 
Our CSR strategy is orientated around three core 
themes:
• Supporting initiatives that help to benefit and 
improve the lives of children;
• Supporting initiatives that help in the fight 
against poverty; and
• Supporting initiatives that give people a 
better education and start in life.
These themes were agreed by staff across the 
SANNE business following a dedicated staff survey.
Modern slavery
SANNE is committed to preventing modern 
slavery and human trafficking. We have an annual 
statement on our website at www.sannegroup.
com and we will review that approach annually 
and put in additional safeguards with our suppliers 
to reduce this risk.
Anti-bribery and corruption
There is a zero tolerance approach to bribery and 
corruption. SANNE has a group anti-corruption 
policy in place as part of our compliance 
programme.
Governance and risk 
management of corporate 
responsibility
We remain committed to corporate responsibility 
at all levels in our business. As part of our business 
and our culture we consider our stakeholders, 
clients and the communities where we operate. 
We consider that our strategy provides our people 
an opportunity to grow and develop their careers.  
We are looking to build a sustainable long-term 
business. 
Our people want to be engaged with their 
communities and for us to be a socially 
responsible business. We are proud that our staff 
want to be involved in activities and to support 
our communities and have a positive impact on 
the environment. As our stakeholders cover a 
wide range of interests and whilst considering our 
social responsibility, we are focusing on how we 
can progress and fulfil more of our environmental, 
social and governance responsibilities.
Our colleagues share in  
our success
Sharing our success is something we value highly. 
We have implemented a number of specific 
initiatives that help to reward and recognise 
personal contribution, to deepen engagement 
with the Company and brand.
Employee survey 2017
The results of our 2017 employee engagement 
survey helped us focus our attention to matters 
that our people have mentioned. In particular 
we were asked to increase our level of internal 
communications. As a result, there has been a 
focus on more communications with staff via our 
Intranet, a dedicated communications channel, 
and series of Town Hall meetings held in all our 
offices. Feedback on the results of the survey have 
been presented to staff.

Local communities
Throughout 2017, SANNE’s people have actively 
engaged in their local communities. Examples in 
the year of initiatives undertaken are included 
below.
SANNE in Mauritius
Driven by the staff’s desire to give back to the local 
Mauritian community, SANNE’s Mauritius business 
founders (previously known as IFS) and staff have 
always had a strong sense of community. The core 
of all Mauritian CSR activities has been purposely 
centred on “Giving Back”, which closely aligns to 
SANNE’s core themes of supporting education and 
the relief of poverty. 
What was achieved?
Following 13 months of planning, negotiations 
and construction, SANNE's charity, IFS Community 
Care Foundation, successfully opened its latest 
CSR initiative, San’ Angels  - Centre d’Eveil. The 
centre accommodates 25 children, irrespective 
of race, gender, language, or religion. The school 
also hosts a state of the art multi-purpose 
training centre which will be used for facilitating 
empowerment, entrepreneurship and skills 
development programmes for the families of the 
children at Centre d’Eveil and the wider Beau-
Bassin community. The land on which the school 
was built was donated by IFS Founder Couldip 
Basanta Lala to IFS Community Care Foundation, 
which makes the building available to the school 
and covers reasonable running expenses.
What SANNE has committed  
to provide:
• Specialised education programmes 
tailored for children from underprivileged 
communities;
• Counselling with the children’s parents and 
family members;
• Daily healthy breakfasts and lunches;
• Funding for extracurricular activities and 
school outings; and
• Medical well-being checks

Strategic Report – Financial Report
Financial Overview —  
Chief Financial Officer’s Report
“Underlying operating 
profit was £38.8 
million, up 76% 
(2016: £22 million) 
during the year, with a 
margin of 34% (2016: 
34%). Operating 
profit was £23.1 
million (2016: £14.7 
million). ”
The Group delivered another strong year of 
growth, with revenues rising 77% to £113.2 million 
(2016: £63.8 million). Organic revenue growth 
remained strong at 14%.
Group results
Underlying operating profit was £38.8 million, up 
76% (2016: £22.0 million) during the year, with a 
margin of 34% (2016: 34%). Operating profit was 
£23.1 million (2016: £14.7 million).
Non-underlying items within operating profit 
include share based payments, acquisition and 
integrations costs and amortisation of intangible 
assets totalling £15.7 million. Share based 
payments relating to acquisitions are identified as 
non-underlying whilst share based payments used 
as part of ongoing remuneration of employees 
are now recognised as underlying and reported 
in operating expenses. For further detail on non-
underlying items see note 8 in the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net finance expense
Even with the acquisition activity undertaken 
over the last two years the Group maintains a 
low gearing ratio. In conjunction with ongoing 
low interest rates this enables the Group to keep 
finance costs low at £1.0 million for the year 
(2016: £0.6 million).
Other Comprehensive 
Income
The non-sterling acquisitions made during the 
prior year and at the start of the current year have 
seen a significant increase to the Group’s exposure 
to unrealised exchange differences on translation 
of foreign operations. An unrealised loss in Other 
Comprehensive Income of £14.4 million for the 
year relates mostly to a 10% strengthening of 
sterling against the US dollar.
T axation
The Group’s effective tax rate for the year was 
19.1% (2016: 13.5%). As with prior years there 
has been significant non-underlying expenditure 
impacting on the effective tax rate and when 
adjusted for non-underlying items the effective 
rate for the year was 16.0% (2016: 16.5%). The 
Group is pending a tax ruling from the Mauritian 
tax authorities with regards to the tax deductibility 
of the intangible assets acquired in the IFS 
acquisition. The outcome of which may see an 
increase in deferred tax liabilities of £7.4 million.
Earnings per share
Underlying diluted earnings per share were 23.7 
pence (2016: 16.9 pence) and diluted earnings per 
share were 12.7 pence (2016: 11.3 pence).
Statement of financial 
position and net funds
The IFS acquisition that completed on 1 January 
2017 has seen the carrying value of goodwill and 
other intangible assets increase to £160.4 million 
(2016: £82.7 million). This value represents the 
assets of the acquired companies that are not 
separately identifiable and the value attributed 
to the acquired customer relationships and 
underlying contracts. The Board have established 
key controls for monitoring the carrying value of 
these assets.
The cash position of the Group remains strong 
with cash generated by operations of £37.6 
million (2016: £18.7 million), enabling the Board 
to continue with its progressive dividend policy 
as the Group continues to grow. The IFS Group 
acquisition was funded in part by a £34.2 million 
share issue and in part by £74.6 million of cash 
which was raised at the end of the prior financial 
year.  Ahead of the year end the Group drew an 
additional £19.0 million on the existing financing 
facility in preparation for the completion of the 
LIS acquisition on 6 February 2018. The financing 
activity in conjunction with the operations has 
resulted in net debt at the year-end of £20.4 
million (2016: net cash of £46.1 million). It should 
be noted that the year-end position is inclusive of 
£21.5 million held in readiness and paid for the 
completion of the acquisition of the LIS Group 
effective on 6 February 2018.

Working capital relating to customer invoicing 
continues to be well managed. Working capital 
as a percentage of annualised revenue sits at 
14% (2016: 17%). Trade and other payables were 
£8.5 million (2016: £13.7 million), the decrease 
relates in large to the payment of the deferred 
consideration during the year relating to the FAS 
acquisition. 
Dividend 
The Board continues to adopt a progressive 
dividend policy, subject always to maintaining a 
sufficient level of dividend cover. It still expects to 
retain sufficient capital to fund ongoing operating 
requirements and to invest in the Group’s long-
term growth. 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 8.4 
pence per ordinary share (2016: 6.4 pence). The 
final dividend will be payable on 15 May 2018 to 
Shareholders on the register at close of business 
on 3 April 2018.
Together with the previously paid 2017 interim 
dividend of 4.2 pence per share, this gives a total 
dividend for the year of 12.6 pence per share 
(2016: 9.6 pence in total).

Corporate Governance
Chairman’s Introduction
“The Board places 
considerable 
emphasis on 
corporate governance 
as it believes 
it will provide 
the sustainable 
foundations for the 
continued success 
and growth of  
the Group.”
Rupert Robson

Dear Shareholder
In my capacity as Chairman, I am pleased to 
present the Corporate Governance Report.
The Board places considerable emphasis on 
corporate governance as it believes it will provide 
the sustainable foundations for the continued  
success and growth of the Group. The Board is 
committed to building the Group’s corporate 
governance framework to deliver the Group’s 
strategic aims and performance.
As we advised last year, a search was commenced 
for an additional independent Channel Islands 
based Director to Chair our new Risk Committee. 
Details of how this search was carried out are in 
the report of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee on page 50.
I am delighted that we were able to announce the 
appointment of Mel Carvill in December 2017. 
Mel joined the Board on 1 January 2018.
UK Corporate  
Governance Code
SANNE as a premium listed company on the 
London Stock Exchange is subject to the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code published 
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in April 
2016 (the Code). The Code is publicly available 
at h ttp s://frc.org.uk/ge t att achmen t/ c a7e94c4-
b9a9-49e2-a824-ad76a322873c/UK -Corporat e-
Go vernanc e-Code-April-2016.pdf .
With one exception, SANNE complied with the 
Code throughout 2017. Between 1 January 2017 
and 31 December 2017 the Group did not comply 
with the provision that required at least half 
of the Board to be independent Non-executive 
Directors, excluding the Chairman. However, 
following an extensive search Mel Carvill was 
selected. Mel brings substantial financial services 
experience and will provide great insight as we 
strive to establish the Group as one of the leading 
providers of alternative asset and corporate 
administration services.
Phil Godley also stepped down from the Board 
on 1 January 2018 as an Executive Director and I 
wish to thank Phil for his huge contribution to the 
Board.  
Following these changes, from 1 January 2018 
SANNE has been compliant with the Code, with a 
majority of independent Non-executive Directors 
on the Board.
Culture
Good governance is at the heart of our business. 
Our culture is one of transparency and openness 
and we constantly seek to develop our governance 
framework to take into account the Group’s 
changing circumstances and developments in the 
wider governance environment. Communications 
have been delivered to the organisation 
to reinforce the required standards and 
professionalism throughout the business. 
Diversity
SANNE’s people are from wide and diverse 
backgrounds, nationalities and ethnic and religious 
groups. With continued global expansion, diversity 
amongst our colleagues has and will continue 
to increase as we foster international talent. We 
respect cultural differences, and learn about and 
embrace these differences in each territory in 
which we operate. Details of our Board Diversity 
policy can be found on our website at www.
sannegroup.com.
Our committees
The Committees have an important role in 
supporting the Board’s work. They are provided 
with the resources they need to discharge their 
role, including administration support and access 
to professional advisers. Information about the 
Committees can be found in this report on  
pages 50 to 74.
The Board has, as part of its role, focused on 
our corporate governance and after discussions 
agreed that the Nomination Committee extend its 
brief to cover governance matters. Accordingly, 
it was renamed the Nomination and Governance 
Committee, and has new Terms of Reference, 
which are available on our website. This 
committee will keep a close watching brief on 
governance developments and external guidance 
and report to, and advise, the Board on all 
relevant changes.
In addition, it was agreed to have separate 
Audit and Risk committees following our Board 
evaluation last year. The new Risk Committee will 
report to the Board through Mel. It will allow the 
Group to have an enhanced focus on risk reporting 
and monitoring. The Audit Committee, chaired 
by Andy Pomfret, will continue to review SANNE’s 
internal controls and risk management systems 
and to manage our audit plans.
We continually review our corporate governance 
and the following report covers our approach and 
provides insight into discussions held at the Board 
and its Committees.

Board effectiveness
At the end of 2017 we undertook our annual 
review of Board effectiveness working with 
Prism Communications & Management Ltd, who 
interviewed all the Directors and observed our 
Board meeting on 30 January 2018. Overall the 
evaluation was positive and we have introduced 
some changes to the way we operate together as 
a Board. Further details on the external evaluation 
are on page 46.
Remuneration
Nicola Palios, the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, presents the Committee’s report on 
pages 57 to 74. The Remuneration Committee 
and the Board have monitored the effectiveness 
of the remuneration structure and practices to 
accommodate the needs and characteristics of a 
high growth successful business. In particular, they 
have considered gender pay and share retention 
guidelines.
Shareholder communications
Our communication and engagement with 
Shareholders over the last 12 months included 
investor roadshows. All Shareholders had the 
opportunity to engage with senior management 
either at these events, directly or at our Annual 
General Meeting.
The Non-executive Directors are available to 
discuss any matter Shareholders might wish to 
raise, and the Chairman and independent Non-
executive Directors attend meetings with investors 
and analysts as required. On an annual basis, I 
approach all our larger Shareholders to provide an 
opportunity for direct interaction.
I am grateful to all of our Shareholders for  
their support.
It has been another successful year for the 
business. We have further developed our 
governance framework and built on our structure 
to suit the needs of our business. We will continue 
to build a sustainable successful high growth 
business.

Corporate Governance
Leadership 
Directors
The Board of Directors have their profiles on pages 
40 and 41. The Board comprises the Chairman, 
two Executive Directors and three independent 
Non-executive Directors.
Board changes
After 2017 there were a number of changes made 
to the composition of the Board. Phil Godley 
stepped down from the Board with effect from 
1 January 2018. Mel Carvill was appointed as a 
Non-executive Director with effect from 1 January 
2018, and chairs the new Risk Committee and has 
joined the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
and Governance Committees.  
The Board acknowledged that during the year it 
was not in compliance with the Code regarding 
its composition, as noted on page 47. Following 
an extensive search, the appointment of a Non-
executive Director has brought the Company into 
full compliance with the Code with effect from 1 
January 2018.
Chairman
The Chairman, Rupert Robson, leads the Board, 
provides direction and ensures that there is a clear 
structure in place for the effective operation of 
the Board and its Committees. He sets the agenda 
for Board meetings, and promotes effective 
and constructive discussion at meetings. He is 
responsible for ensuring that the Directors receive 
timely and accurate information.
In addition, the Chairman works with the Chief 
Executive Officer to ensure strategies agreed by 
the Board are implemented. He is a support for 
the CEO whilst respecting the CEO's responsibility 
for managing the Group. There is a clear division 
of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer, and this has been defined 
and was established when SANNE was listed.
The Board considered the time commitment 
of the Chairman, in light of his other time 
commitments, as noted in his biography on 
page 40 and concluded that he fully satisfied 
his obligations to the Group. There has been no 
change in his other time commitments since last 
year.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors bring a strong 
independent element and a breadth of skills 
and experience to the Board. The Non-executive 
Directors bring constructive challenge and 
are responsible for the effective running of 
the Board’s Committees. They need to satisfy 
themselves that the Group’s financial controls and 
risk management are robust and effective.
Senior Independent Director
Andy Pomfret is the Senior Independent Director 
(SID). The SID’s role is to act as a sounding board 
for the Chairman, and to serve as an intermediary 
for the other Directors when necessary. He leads 
the Chairman’s annual performance evaluation 
and brings independent judgement to the Board.
The SID is also available to Shareholders if 
they have issues or concerns that have not 
been resolved through the normal channels 
of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief 
Financial Officer, or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. No matters of concern were raised 
by the Shareholders during the year and up to 23 
February 2018,  being the latest practicable date 
prior to the publication of this Report. 
Group Company Secretary
The Group Company Secretary supports the 
Chairman in the delivery of Board and governance 
procedures. In particular she assists with the 
induction of new Directors and the annual cycle 
of Board and committee meetings. She supports 
the smooth operation of governance by working 
with the Chairman, and the Chairmen of the 
Committees. She additionally provides support 
to the Chairman in ensuring compliance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements. She 
arranges for the Directors to meet with executives, 
visit offices in the Group and provides information 
on corporate governance.
The Group Company Secretary helps by providing 
advice and services and keeps accurate records of 
all meetings.
Independent advice
There is a process in place, facilitated by the 
Group Company Secretary to enable any Director 
to take independent professional advice at 
SANNE’s expense. This advice would be in relation 
to the performance of any aspect of their duties.
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991, as amended, all Directors disclose to the 
Company the nature and extent of any interest of 
the Director (whether direct or indirect) of which 
the Director is aware in any transaction entered 
into, or proposed to be entered into, by the Group 
or any of its subsidiaries which conflicts, or may 
conflict, to a material extent with the interests 
of the Group. The Directors’ Register of Conflicts 
of Interest is maintained by the Group Company 
Secretary and is reviewed by the Directors as a 
standing agenda item at every board meeting.
Directors’ election  
and re-election
In accordance with the requirements of the Code 
(B.7.1), newly appointed Directors and all existing 
Directors will submit themselves for election 
and re-election respectively, at the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting (AGM). The Board recommends 
the election or re-election (as appropriate) of 
each member of the Board based upon their skills, 
experience and contribution to the Board, and its 
Committees and their ability to bring long-term 
Shareholder value.
Board Induction
Mel Carvill joined the Board on 1 January 
2018 and was provided with:
• Access to the Group's portal for Board 
and Committee Papers;
• Access to the Group Company 
Secretary;
• A list of key contacts, and

The Directors attendance at Committee meetings is disclosed in the separate 
reports of each Committee on pages 50 to 74.
The Board has met 7 times during the year under review, see table above. 
Non-executive Directors communicate directly, and have had informal 
meetings with Executive Directors and senior management between formal 
Board meetings. Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board, 
and the Committees on which they sit, and to devote sufficient time to 
the Group to enable them to fulfil their duties as Directors. Non-executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment confirm the minimum number of days 
each should be prepared to devote to the Group. The time commitments 
required by the Non-executive Directors were discussed by the Nomination 
and Governance Committee during the year and, taking into account external 
commitments, it was felt that the Non-executive Directors committed 
sufficient time to SANNE and were not unduly stretched by their commitments 
to other organisations.

Board diversity
The Board supports the recommendations in the Code and ensures that 
diversity and gender are considered when making director appointments. The 
Board seeks to ensure it has the right balance of independence, skills, and 
knowledge to enable it to meet its responsibilities. Candidates are selected 
irrespective of background. SANNE seeks to promote diversity.
Succession planning
Talent development and succession planning has been discussed by the 
Board, and in more detail at the Nomination and Governance Committee 
during the year. Progress has been made in establishing training to promote 
and develop talent within the business.
Directors’ training
Members of the Board are provided with regular updates and training  
in order to keep them up to date with industry and regulatory developments. 
In order to assist the Directors regulatory updates are provided at each 
meeting and professional advisers also provide technical updates. All 
Directors are free to attend seminars and briefings, at SANNE’s expense, in 
areas considered to be appropriate for their own professional development 
including governance and issues relevant to the Committees on which they sit.
Evaluation of Chairman and Directors
The SID led the Non-executive Directors and conducted a performance review 
of the Chairman. The review covered leadership, performance and overall 
contribution, all these factors were of a high standard, and the Chairman has 
their full support.
The Chairman met with each Director to discuss their contributions to Board 
and Committees. Following the Chairman's review the Board confirmed, 
that in line with the Code, the Directors have sufficient time to discharge 
their responsibilities and that any external appointments they hold do not 
distract from the time available to the Company. The Board recommends 
the Shareholders support the election or re-election of the Board at the 
forthcoming AGM in May 2018.

Shareholders
The Group continues to maintain an active 
dialogue with its key stakeholders, including 
institutional investors, to discuss issues relating 
to the performance of the Group including 
strategy and new developments. The Non-
executive Directors are available to discuss any 
matter stakeholders might wish to raise, and 
the Chairman and independent Non-executive 
Directors will attend meetings with investors and 
analysts as required.
Our investors are kept up to date with regulatory 
news releases through our regulatory news 
service (RNS) and press releases. Copies of the 
past regulatory news releases can be found on the 
Group’s website www.sannegroup.com
Board visit
The Board visited SANNE's office in South Africa, 
and had the opportunity to formally meet the 
management team. The Directors were able to: 
• Receive presentations about the local 
operations;
• Meet office staff informally; and
• Get an in -depth view of the  
regional opportunities.
Information and support
The Chairman, aided by the Group Company 
Secretary, is responsible for ensuring that the 
Directors receive accurate and timely information. 
The Group Company Secretary compiles the 
Board and Committee papers which are circulated 
to Directors in advance of the meeting via a 
secure web portal. Board papers are distributed 
in time to allow sufficient time for review. The 
Group Company Secretary also ensures that 
any feedback or suggestions for improvement 
on Board papers is fed back to management 
and standard reporting evolves to incorporate 
suggested amendments and enhancements. 
During the year the Board and Committees 
had specific governance discussions. There was 
focus on the Modern Slavery Act, Market Abuse 
Regulations and gender pay gap reporting.
Accountability 
Risk management and  
internal controls
The Board is responsible for the review and 
assurance over the Group’s systems of internal 
controls and for reviewing their effectiveness. The 
Executive Directors and senior management are 
responsible for implementation and maintenance 
of an effective system of internal controls. The 
Board is also responsible for risk assessment and 
management. 
The Board makes an assessment of the 
maintenance of the systems of management and 
control. The Board during the year delegated part 
of the responsibility for the review of this to the 
Audit and Risk Committee, that then reported 
back to the Board. Further information can be 
found in the Strategic Report on pages 8 to 33  
and in the Report of the Audit and Risk Committee 
on pages 52 to 56.
The Board is responsible for presenting a fair, 
balanced and understandable position of the 
Group in the Annual Report and Accounts and the 
half-year results. A statement about this is made 
in the report of the Audit and Risk Committee on 
pages 52 to 56.
Board committees
As part of the governance framework the Board 
has authorised Committees to ensure there is a 
focus on accountability. The Committees meet 
separately and regularly throughout the year. 
The Board has delegated the Group’s strategic 
direction (which is considered and approved by 
the Board) to Dean Godwin, the Chief Executive 
Officer. 
Audit and Risk Committee 
The Board has delegated a number of 
responsibilities to the Audit and Risk Committee, 
that was responsible during the financial year 
for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting 
processes. With effect from 1 January 2018,  
separate Audit and Risk Committees have 
been established.  Terms of Reference for both 
Committees can be found on our website at   
www.sannegroup.com.
Nomination and  
Governance Committee

recommendation of executive appointments is 
provided by the Nomination and Governance 
Committee. The Committee is also responsible

reviewed and aligned to match the Group’s 
strategic aims by the Remuneration Committee.

reference approved by the Board. The Board has 
sight of the minutes of the Committee. It operates 
to support the Chief Executive Officer in the 
running of the Group.

The Administration Committee comprises any 
two Directors and deals with matters of a routine 
nature on behalf of the Board. The decisions 
of the Committee are tabled at each Board

culture and integrity. Culture and integrity is 
promoted in the staff handbook and reinforced 
through regular communication.

Matters Considered Observations  Actions taken
Meeting T opics  
and discussions
Additional time could be dedicated to the discussion of 
strategy. The papers and the discussion were observed and 
commented as being of a high quality at the Strategy  
Board Meeting. 
More time could be given to the further consideration of 
culture.
Action was already being taken. The Group 
Company Secretary will provide a rolling agenda 
to ensure sufficient time would be allotted. 
Some matters were already in progress and the 
subject of stakeholder voice had already been 
considered by the Nomination and Governance 
Committee and will be tabled again in 2018.
Committees Recommendations were made for more horizon scanning  
of governance matters.
Stakeholder issues should be further discussed once the 
new FRC guidance has been finalised.
A plan has been created for all Committees to 
ensure that any feedback/topics are considered 
in the year.
Committee Papers Opportunity to reduce the length of papers in a few 
instances. 
Overall papers were of a good quality, providing the  
right information. 
General advice would be provided to those 
submitting papers on the intranet and feedback 
provided, if needed, following initial submission.
Board Effectiveness There was a good score overall and no issues to highlight. 
Some minor opportunities for improvement were highlighted 
and the board would adopt the suggestions.  
The Company has already taken action to 
implement the suggestions. All items raised 
will be tracked and monitored by the CEO and 
Group Company Secretary.
Key outcomes are listed in the table below. In addition the evaluation observed that the Board dynamics were good, the Board is led by a skilled Chairman, who 
is appreciated by the Directors and he has a good working relationship with the CEO. 
Board Evaluation Process
The Board appointed Prism Boardroom part of Prism CoSec (Prism), to conduct its first external evaluation and this was carried out in accordance with B.6. of 
the Code. Prism Boardroom, also provides regulatory updates and ad hoc advice on Company Secretarial matters to SANNE.  
The evaluation reviewed the Board, and its Committees. The methodology of the evaluation and its scope were discussed and agreed with the Chairman.  
The participants were the Board members and the Group Company Secretary. Questionnaires were used to explore the Board and Committee relationships, 
composition, effectiveness, leadership, roles and development. One to one interviews explored these issues in more detail and also considered culture, 
technology and the board processes for developing strategy, dealing with acquisitions and managing risk.
The evaluation followed a number of stages as outlined below.
The questionnaire was sent to each participant accompanied by a note confirming the process to be followed for the 
external evaluation.
Each Board member and the Group Company Secretary met with the evaluator and discussed key themes.  
The evaluator met with each participant to discuss the issues listed and any points from the questionnaire requiring 
clarification, and reviewed with the Chairman. 
A report was prepared by Prism and discussed with the Chairman. A final report was sent to all participants.
The report and its recommendations were considered at the Board meeting in January 2018.

the Company in a general meeting. The Directors’ powers are conferred on them by Jersey Company law and by the Articles of Association.
Shares are admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange and may be traded through the CREST system.
Allotment of shares
At the AGM held in 2017 the Shareholders generally and unconditionally authorised the Directors to allot relevant securities up to two-thirds of the of the 
nominal authorised share capital.
It is the Directors’ intention to seek the renewal of this authority in line with the guidance issued by the Investment Association. The resolution will be set out 
in the notice of the AGM.
At the AGM in 2017 the Directors were also empowered by the Shareholders to allot equity securities of up to 5% of the Company’s issued share capital for 
a transaction which the Board determines to be an acquisition or other capital investment as defined by the Pre-emption Group’s Statement of Principles. In 
2017 SANNE agreed to acquire Luxembourg Investment Solutions S.A. and Compliance Partners S.A. and as part of the transaction it agreed to pay part of the 
consideration in shares.  The transaction completed on 6 February 2018.
In line with the guidance of the Pre-emption Group it is the Board's intention to propose that an additional special resolution be passed at the AGM to

Corporate Governance
Nomination and Governance Committee Report  
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Nomination and 
Governance Committee Report for the year ended 
31 December 2017. Our focus was to appoint an 
additional Non-executive Director to ensure a 
majority of Independent Directors, and to widen 
the Committee’s remit specifically to include 
Governance.
During the year the Committee commenced a 
search for an additional Non-executive Director.
The Board decided to recruit an additional 
Non-executive Director with Channel Islands 
residency, as reported in the 2016 accounts. 
It was also decided that the Audit and Risk 
Committee would be separated and that the 
appointee would become Chairman of the newly 
formed Risk Committee. It was agreed that the 
appointee should have financial services, risk and 
international experience. The Board concluded 
that SANNE’s knowledge of the Channel Islands 
employment market was significantly greater 
than that possessed by search firms traditionally 
used for FTSE250 board-level appointments. The 
Board, therefore, decided to use internal search 
resources to identify suitable candidates. It was 
agreed that there was no conflict of interest in 
using internal resources.
A shortlist of candidates was prepared, which 
included a number of women. The candidates 
were considered and a shortlist presented. 
Following a series of interviews, Mel Carvill 
was identified as having the requisite financial 
services, international and risk experience to be 
a full contributor at the Board and to chair the 
Risk Committee. As part of the selection process, 
Mel attended interviews with all the members of 
the Board and was appointed with effect from 1 
January 2018.  His biography is set out on page 41. 
A resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming 
AGM for his election.
Phil Godley, an Executive Director, stepped down 
from the Board with effect from 1 January 2018 
and the Board has decided that his position will 
not be replaced for the time being. I would like to 
thank Phil for his significant contribution to Board 
discussions in the years since the IPO.
With effect from 1 January 2018, SANNE has a 
majority of Non-executive Directors, excluding 
the Chairman. Following the appointment of 
Mel Carvill, the Committee believes the current 
composition represents a strong and well-
balanced Board with the necessary skills and 
experience to manage and develop the Company, 
and recommends that each of the Directors be 
elected or re-elected at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting (AGM).
Succession planning was considered by the 
Committee and it has put in place a talent 
programme for senior management development.
The Committee also decided that it should 
widen its role to cover the Company’s 
corporate governance. As the Group has grown 
this additional area of focus will provide an 
opportunity to consider regulatory changes 
and the application of SANNE’s corporate 
governance systems and processes. During the 
year the Committee also reviewed its Diversity 
Policy and this is available on our website 
(www.sannegroup.com).
I would like to thank the other members of the 
Committee for their contribution and support 
during the year. As Chairman of the Committee I 
will be available at the AGM to answer questions 
about the work of the Committee during the year.

The role of the Committee
The Committee’s role and responsibilities include:
• Reviewing and nominating candidates for 
both Executive and Non-executive roles;
• Managing the size, structure, knowledge, 
skills and diversity, including gender diversity, 
of the Board when considering suitable 
candidates;
• Considering the Corporate Governance Code 
and regulatory change;
• Evaluating the Company’s policy and 
practices for executive talent management 
development and diversity; 
• Understanding the role and leadership needs 
that are required by the business and to 
review talent to ensure that the Company 
maintains the ability to compete and win 
further market share;
• Considering Director performance and 
upon consideration recommending to 
Shareholders the election or re-election at 
the AGM; 
• Succession planning; and
• Reviewing the balance and composition of 
the Board.
Following a review of the Terms of Reference in 
November 2017, the role of the Committee was 
expanded to cover the company’s governance. 
The Committee will therefore also focus on 
changes in corporate governance and changes 
that need to be recommended to the Board.
The expanded Terms of Reference of the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
are available on the Company’s website 
(www.sannegroup.com).
Succession planning  
on the Board
The Committee annually reviews its effectiveness 
and composition and its long-term succession 
planning. The Committee considers the balance 
of skills, experience and independence. One of 
the Committee’s key roles is to discuss succession 
planning to ensure that a pipeline of talent 
is developed within the business. Ultimate 
responsibility for making senior management 
appointments rests with the Chief Executive 
Officer.
Committee activities  
during the year
• Considered the candidates for the role of 
Non-executive Director;
• Members of the Committee were involved in 
the selection process of the Non-executive 
Director;
• Recommended to the Board that Mel Carvill 
be appointed as a Non-executive Director 
and Chairman of the Risk Committee and to 
also serve on the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination and Governance Committees;
• Discussed senior appointments and 
succession;
• Considered the annual effectiveness review 
and that the Directors and the Chairman had 
sufficient time to discharge their roles; 
• Discussed mentoring and the development 
of talent; and
• Considered regulatory changes.
Diversity and inclusion
It is the Company’s policy to ensure that proposed 
appointments and succession to the Board as 
outlined by the Code, are based on merit and 
judged against objective criteria. In addition 
the Company seeks to ensure that it reflects 
differences in culture, gender, skills, background, 
regional and financial services experience and 
other qualities. With this in mind, the Committee 
reviewed its Diversity Policy. A copy of the 
Board’s Diversity Statement is available on the 
company’s website at www.sannegroup.com. At 
31 December 2017, SANNE had one female Board 
member out of a Board of six Directors. Shortlists 
will contain male and female candidates and the 
Board is focused on seeking to increase diversity.
Committee effectiveness 
review
The review was externally conducted and it 
reported that the Nomination and Governance 
Committee runs effectively. The Committee 
received a very positive evaluation. As with the 
other Committees a rolling agenda will be in place 
going forward. The existing Board portal would 
include a range of governance publications for all 
the Committee members, which would also be 
helpful for the existing members of the Committee 
and when new Non-executive Directors join in the 
future.
Director induction
An induction programme for the new Non-
executive Director was based upon the ICSA 
guidelines and tailored to SANNE. Further 
information on this is included in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 42.
Mentoring and knowledge 
sharing
The Committee wants to help develop the future 
leaders of the business and is involved in providing 
guidance and expertise where appropriate. There 
have been a number of mentoring meetings 
between the Non-executive Directors and senior 
management.

Audit and Risk Committee Report  
Dear Shareholder
The report outlines the activities and responsibility 
of the Audit and Risk Committee (the Committee), 
on behalf of the Board and I am pleased to 
present my report for the year ended 31 
December 2017. 
During the year the Committee and the Board 
devoted time to assess the approach to the 
Group’s controls framework, in order that the 
Group was well placed to respond to changing 
risks and our business environment. It was 
decided that the Committee’s responsibilities 
should be separated. The separate duties with 
regard to Risk will be carried out by a separate Risk 
Committee. The Risk Committee took ownership 
of this activity with effect from 1 January 2018. 
The Audit Committee will continue to monitor 
and review financial internal controls and risk 
management systems.
At the request of the Board, the Committee 
reviewed the contents of the Annual Report 
and  Accounts and confirmed to the Board that 
in its opinion the Report taken as a whole is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
information for Shareholders and investors to be 
able to review the Groups financial performance, 
business model and strategy.
During the year the Committee’s Terms of 
Reference were reviewed and updated. The 
new Audit Committee’s Terms of Reference are 
available on the Company’s website at www.
sannegroup.com. 
The work of the Committee in 2017 is described 
in detail in the table opposite. It included advising 
the Board on the half year results, the Annual 
Report and Accounts, risk management and 
compliance.
On 1 January 2018 Mel Carvill was appointed as 
an additional Non-executive Director and he will 
chair the new Risk Committee. I am delighted to 
welcome Mel Carvill to the new Audit Committee 
with effect from 1 January 2018.
The addition of Mel will allow the Audit 
Committee to be composed of entirely 
independent Non-executive Directors with effect 
from 1 January 2018 and this ensures that going 
forward the Committee is in compliance with the 
Code.
I would like to thank the other Committee 
members for their support during the year and I 
look forward to chairing the new Audit Committee 
in 2018.

Sanne Group plc Annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017
Audit and Risk Committee Report 
continued 
Fair, balanced and understandable 
Assessment
As requested by the Board, the Committee has reviewed the Annual 
Report and Accounts in order to provide advice to the Board (as required 
by the Code) that the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the necessary information for Shareholders 
and other users of the Annual Report and Accounts to enable them to assess 
the Group’s position, performance for 2017 and its strategy and business. In 
order to make this assessment the Committee considered:
• Guidance provided to each contributor to the Annual Report 
and Accounts;
• Any changes required as a consequence of regulatory changes;
• Input provided from pre year-end discussions with the auditors;
• Input provided pre year-end from senior management and corporate 
functions;
• A review by senior management to ensure consistency and balance;
• Review conducted by the external advisers and the auditors based on 
consistency and best practice;
• Review and consideration by the Committee and final sign-off  
by the Board.
This process enabled the Committee and then the Board to confirm that the 
2017 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable.
Risk management framework & governance
The Board is responsible for ensuring the maintenance of SANNE’s risk 
management and internal control systems with regards to the principal risks 
facing SANNE in achieving its strategic objectives. The Board has delegated 
responsibility for monitoring the Company’s risk management and internal 
controls systems to the Audit and Risk Committee including the annual review 
and reporting to the Board. 
To assist with the assessment of risk management and internal controls, the 
Committee received regular reporting on the principal risks from the Chief 
Risk Officer and the internal audit reports on the adequacy of the control 
framework of the areas under review from the Head of Internal Audit.
Throughout the year and up to the date of this report, SANNE has operated 
a system of internal controls that provides reasonable assurance of effective 
operations covering all material controls including financial, operational 
and compliance controls. A review of the effectiveness of SANNE’s risk 
management and internal control systems has been carried out through the 
work and operations of the Audit and Risk Committee and the effectiveness 
of the operation of the material controls has been reported to the Board.
Significant financial statement issues considered by the Committee 
Significant financial and reporting issue How the issue has been addressed
Revenue recognition, accrued income and trade receivables Management maintains key controls over the largely quarterly billing cycles. 
The timings of the billing cycle are arranged to minimise accrued income 
balances at key reporting dates and thus give greater certainty over income 
which is still to be converted into cash. 
Management assesses the recoverability of all receivables at the year end 
and attest to the quality of assets considering past experience of the client, 
client type and liquidity issues of the client. We agreed with management’s 
assessment that no additional provision for losses or impairment either to 
accrued income or trade receivables was needed.
Evaluation of impairment of intangible assets including goodwill and useful 
life of intangible assets
We considered the results of management’s impairment assessment 
which reviews triggers for impairment around asset lives, valuation and 
verification of assets. We considered the judgements taken in relation to 
asset lives and the methodology applied to consider asset verification and 
we were satisfied that no changes in treatment were needed.
With regards to Goodwill, we consider the judgements taken in relation 
to short and long term growth rates and discount rates used and we were 
again satisfied that no changes in treatment were needed.
Share based payments We have reviewed the methodology used for the accounting of share based 
payments and are comfortable with the assessment by management as to 
the number of shares expected to vest under the terms of the Performance 
Share Plan and Restricted Stock Awards. In doing so we have reviewed and 
are satisfied with management judgments and expectations around the 
achievement of performance targets.
Accounting for acquisitions We have reviewed the judgements made and used by management in the 
allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition completed during the 
year. We are satisfied that the overall allocations between goodwill and 
identifiable intangible assets are reasonable and also the estimated useful 
lives of customer and contract intangibles.

Corporate Governance
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company are set out in the 
risk management report section of the Strategic report on pages 22 to 26. 
External Audit
Independence is vital for the integrity of the audit. The Committee is satisfied 
that Deloitte are fully independent from the Company’s management and 
have no conflicts of interest. The review of any non-audit fees ensures that 
continued independence is maintained. All non-audit spend is reviewed by 
the Committee in accordance with the SANNE guidelines.
The appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group's external auditor (incumbents 
prior to IPO in 2015) is kept under review. The Company is required to 
undertake a competitive tender for the role of external auditor every ten 
years. The present audit partner Andy Isham has been the audit partner 
since listing. Considerations on the length of Deloitte's tenure and the 
requirements for a future tender process were considered by the Audit 
Committee.
Effectiveness of external audit
A review was held by the Audit and Risk Committee on the effectiveness of 
the external audit. Consideration was given to: 
• The quality of planning;
• Communication between the audit team and management;
• The quality and knowledge of the audit team;
• Regulatory insights;
• The holding of regular meetings with the Chair of the Committee, CFO 
and Head of Finance; and 
• The overall performance and the delivery of the audit.
Following the Committee's review it was concluded that Deloitte provided 
a quality audit and it was agreed to recommend to the Board the 
reappointment of Deloitte as auditor and a resolution proposing this has 
been included in the Notice of the AGM.
Audit and non-audit fees
The Committee provides approval for non-audit fee spend in accordance 
with the FRC Ethical Standard. Assurance is provided to ensure that there 
is no threat to the auditor's independence and objectivity. The Policy 
governing non-audit spend was reviewed by the Committee during the 
year and it applies additional restrictions on the use of Deloitte's services. 
The Committee monitors expenditure on non-audit services and each item 
requires approval in advance. 
The Group Audit Fee was £493,000. The fees paid for non-audit services to 
Deloitte were £306,000.  The ratio of non-audit fee to audit fee is 62%. The 
level of non-audit fees is expected to reduce following the revision of the 
non-audit fees policy. During the year the Group incurred non-audit fees were 
incurred for work on: Solvas Asset Management relating to client services 
business systems software; services in relation to FATCA and CRS; ISE 3401 
type 1 reporting;  ISRS44400 (in relation to capital to South Africa); capital 
adequacy work in South Africa for IDS Manco; and an interim opinion under 
ISRE 2410. It was considered by the Committee that there was no perceived 
threat to auditor independence as there was no relationship to the financial 
reports and that these items would not impact auditor independence. The 
external auditors were considered the most suitable supplier for these 
services taking into account the alignment of these services to the work 
undertaken by external audit and Deloitte's skill sets.
Internal Audit function
During the year the Group operated its own internal audit function supported 
by a co-source arrangement with PwC to supplement resources and provide 
capability in specialist areas. The Head of Internal Audit is invited to attend 
the Audit and Risk Committee. A new Head of Internal Audit was appointed 
during the year to lead the internal audit function and the Committee 
oversaw the selection and transition processes. 
The internal audit plan was discussed and approved by the Committee 
including subsequent changes. The Audit and Risk Committee monitors 
the internal audit plan to ensure the audit scope continues to focus on all 
relevant areas of activity. The internal audit reports detailing issues identified 
and management action taken to improve the control environment were 
presented to the Committee for their consideration.
Internal control and risk management
As part of its ongoing monitoring the Committee received written reports 
from Internal Audit, Compliance and Risk at its meetings. SANNE's Risk 
function is led by the Chief Risk Officer who monitors risk across the business. 
The Committee oversees the global risk matters for the business, in particular 
it has responsibility for identifying and assessing all risks across the Group. It 
ensures these risks are appropriately managed and controlled.
Controls were embedded within the business processes, forming part 
of the culture with emphasis on clear management accountabilities and 
responsibilities. The Audit and Risk Committee responded quickly to emerging 
risks, both within the Group and the external business environment. The 
Committee introduced procedures for reporting any control failings, or 
weaknesses, together with the details of corrective action taken to improve 
the internal controls.
Whistleblowing
During the year the Whistleblowing Policy was reviewed by the Committee to 
ensure that it was effective. The Group has a Whistleblower system enabling 
employees who are aware of, or suspect, misconduct, illegal activities, fraud, 
and abuse of assets or violations of any Company policy, to report these 
confidentially.
T raining
As part of the Group training programme, courses are provided in person and 
as computer based training. Courses on data security, anti-money laundering 
and compliance are provided Group-wide. 
GDPR and cyber security
Information has been provided to the Committee on IT data security and data 
protection. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) has advised the Committee 
on information security and this is monitored by IT and the Chief Operating  
Officer (COO). Our data protection and GDPR implementation programme is 
managed by the COO.

Audit and Risk Committee Report 
continued 
Regulatory change and compliance 
The Committee and the Board are provided with technical updates  on 
regulatory and legislative changes at each meeting. The Committee monitors 
regulatory changes along with the Board.
Committee Effectiveness review
The Committee in 2017 had an external evaluation and information about the 
proceedings, the minutes and advisers and their roles were reviewed. The 
evaluation was positive and covered the operation and administration of the 
Committee.
Following the evaluation, the Committee was reported as being run 
professionally and effectively under the Chairman's guidance. The creation of 
a separate Risk Committee was considered to be a positive development. It 
was agreed that there were opportunities to have more regulatory updates. 
More use of the auditors and other advisers would be considered for training 
and technical updates going forward.
Priorities for 2018
The priorities for the new Audit Committee over the next 12 months are as 
follows:
• To monitor the external auditor and to assist with their understanding of 
the business;
• To ensure the audit is aligned with the business and its strategic 
objectives;
• To liaise with the newly established Risk Committee to ensure that any 
linked matters are fully understood;
• To monitor regulatory changes and the impact of external factors on the 
Group; and
• To monitor changes in corporate governance and assess their impact on 
the Group.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the 
Annual Report and Accounts and have assessed that the going concern basis 
of accounting is appropriate in preparing the financial statements and that 
there are no material uncertainties to disclose.
After making diligent enquiries the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
based upon the current financial projections and the bank facilities available 
that the Group had adequate resources to continue in operation. Accordingly 
the Company continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Group’s financial statements.
Viability statement 
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three year 
period, taking account of the Group's current position and the potential 
impact of the principal risks documented in the strategic report. Based on this 
assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the three year period.
In making this statement the Directors have considered the current financial 
position of the Group and the resilience of the Group in the event of severe 
but reasonable scenarios. The modelling of these scenarios has taken into 
account the principal risks and their impact on the business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity over the period.
On the basis that the Group has limited exposure to long-term financial 
commitments the Directors have determined that the three year period is an 
appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, 
the report of the Remuneration Committee in 
respect of the year ended 31 December 2017. At 
this year’s AGM, there will be a single advisory 
vote on this annual statement and the annual 
report on remuneration as the remuneration 
policy that was approved at the 2016 AGM will 
continue to apply in 2018. 
I set out below a reminder of the objectives of the 
remuneration policy, the performance outcomes 
in respect of the 2017 financial year and, following 
a consultation with investor bodies in early 2017, 
how we intend to operate the policy in 2018, the 
final year of the three year policy.
Objectives of the 
remuneration policy  
and link to strategy
The Company’s remuneration report was well 
received and obtained 98.55% support at the 2017 
AGM. Underpinning the Company’s policy, the 
Committee’s objective is to ensure remuneration 
encourages, reinforces and rewards the growth 
of Shareholder value and promotes the long-term 
success of the Company. The Committee agreed 
that executive remuneration should have the 
following aims:
• Be set with regard to pay levels and personal 
tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which 
the Company operates, whilst complying 
with UK plc structural norms and good 
practice; 
• Attract, retain and motivate high calibre 
senior management through a significant 
weighting on performance-related pay;
• Be simple and understandable, both 
externally and to colleagues;
• Achieve consistency of approach across the 
senior management population to the extent 
appropriate, informed by relevant local 
market benchmarks; 
• Encourage widespread share ownership 
across the executive team to ensure a long-
term focus and alignment of interest with 
Shareholders;
• Be consistent with regulatory and corporate 
governance requirements; and
• Not reward behaviour that inappropriately 
increases the Company’s exposure to risks 
outside of the Company’s risk appetite.
In determining remuneration levels, the 
Committee takes into account typical market 
practice for a company of this size and complexity, 
the performance of the Company, the Executive 
Directors’ Jersey location (and its lower personal 
tax rate), their current significant equity holdings 
and experience and the Committee’s responsibility 
to Shareholders. 
Performance and  
reward for 2017
SANNE delivered strong performance in 2017 in 
terms of revenue, earnings and cash generation. 
It also completed a material strategic acquisition 
in Mauritius and made significant progress on the 
integration of that and of prior acquisitions. 
This performance resulted in the Remuneration 
Committee approving payments under the bonus 
plan of between 36% and 40% of base salary, 
which may appear low in light of the strong 
performance. However this reflects the fact 
that SANNE is part way through a transition of 
remuneration packages and therefore the financial 
and non-financial bonus targets had been set at 
a very challenging level. It is anticipated, as part 
of the planned 3 year transition explained at the 
time of the 2016 policy vote, that 2018 targets will 
be set closer to normal market levels. We expect 
payments to be higher if targets are met and by 
2019 we expect to be inline with market norms.  
The transition of the remuneration packages will 
then be complete.
During the year, awards were made to the 
Directors under the Performance Share Plan. 
These will vest after 3 years subject to achieving 
challenging underlying diluted EPS targets for 
the 2019 financial year. Full details of the awards 
granted are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.

Corporate Governance
Application of policy in 2018
Base salaries
As set out in last year’s remuneration report 
the Committee consulted with Shareholders 
and agreed to adopt a phased approach to 
salary increases. The Committee considered 
both Company and personal performance to 
be strong during 2017 and therefore saw no 
reason to deviate from the proposed salary 
trajectory. Accordingly, the CEO’s salary increased 
to £292,000 and the CFO’s salary increased to 
£210,000 with effect from 1 January 2018.
While the Committee acknowledges that the 
percentage salary increases are high, the 2018 
salaries set out above are still significantly below 
typical FTSE levels for a company of this size. 
Recognising the lower tax rates in Jersey, the 
2018 salaries will give, net of tax, total target 
remuneration values closer in line with, but still 
below that of a UK taxpayer. The Company is 
conscious that the business is significantly larger 
and more complex than when it went to market 
in 2015. In light of this and the need to renew our 
policy in 2019 the Committee will consider salary 
positioning to attract, retain and recruit executives 
in our market.
2018 incentives
The annual bonus opportunity for Executive 
Directors for 2018 shall be unchanged at 100% 
of salary. For 2018, 75% of the overall bonus 
will continue to be based on a sliding scale of 
challenging underlying profit before tax targets 
and the remaining 25% will be based on non-
financial targets. The underlying profit before 
tax targets and the non-financial targets are 
considered to be commercially sensitive and so 
are not disclosed in this report, but the Committee 
will disclose both in next year’s remuneration 
report. Half of any bonus will be paid in cash and 
the other half will be deferred in shares for three 
years.
The grant level under the Performance Share Plan 
for Executive Directors will also be unchanged at 
100% of salary. The awards will vest after three 
years subject to achievement against a sliding 
scale of underlying diluted EPS targets. A two 
year post-vest holding period will apply creating a 
five year gap between grant and the ability to sell 
vested awards (save for any share sale to cover 
personal tax liabilities on vesting/exercise). 
Board and management 
changes
At the end of 2017, there were senior 
management changes at the Board that were 
effective from 1 January 2018.
• Phil Godley stepped down from the Board on 
1 January 2018. The arrangements for Phil 
as a former Director are disclosed on  our 
website at www.sannegroup.com.
• Mel Carvill joined the Board on 1 January 
2018 as an additional Non-executive Director. 
Mel Chairs the Risk Committee, and has 
joined the Audit and Nomination and 
Governance Committees.
Other key decisions
The Chairman's fee has increased from £140,000 
to £160,000 with effect from 1 January 2018. 
This reflects the substantial increase both in time 
required and also in the size and scope of the 
business since listing. The Non-executive Director 
fees are set out in the table on page 68.
Conclusion
The Company has significantly outperformed the 
FTSE and has become more complex through a 
combination of organic growth in targeted markets 
and successfully integrated acquisitions. Later 
this year, the Committee will carry out a review of 
executive remuneration in advance of a binding 
remuneration policy vote in 2019. Any substantive 
changes to the current policy will be subject to 
prior consultation with leading investors. 
We will keep our approach under review to ensure 
the Committee considers evolving best practice, 
regulatory developments and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The Committee welcomes any feedback on this 
report and the current policy. If you would like to 
get in touch, then please do so through the Group 
Company Secretary.
I would like to thank my colleagues on the 
Committee for their time and support during the 
year.
On behalf of the Board, I look forward to your 
support at the 2018 AGM.

Sanne-AR2017 Front-proof13.indd   58 23/03/2018   16:24:22 Regulatory regime for 
disclosure and voting on 
Directors’ remuneration
The UK remuneration reporting regulations 
contain provisions which make Shareholder 
approval of the policy of UK-incorporated 
companies binding. As the Company is not UK-
incorporated those provisions have no legal effect. 
However, the Company has taken steps to limit 
the power of the Remuneration Committee so 
that, with effect from the date on which the policy 
on remuneration was approved by Shareholders, 
the Committee can only authorise payments 
to Directors that are consistent with the policy 
as approved by Shareholders. In that way the 
Company considers the vote of Shareholders on 
the policy to be binding in its application.
The Remuneration Policy set out below was 
approved at the AGM on 5 May 2016 and became 
effective from that date. All remuneration and 
loss of office payments will only be made if they 
are consistent with the approved policy. Specific 
details on how the Company will implement the 
Policy in 2018 are provided in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Advisers
As part of the Committee's role it obtains external 
advice to ensure that its remuneration practices 
support and are linked to the business strategy 
and are market competitive. During 2017 the 
Committee had advice from New Bridge Street 
(NBS) (a trading name of Aon plc). NBS did not 
provide any further services to the Group in the 
year under review.
NBS are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and adhere to the Code of 
Conduct in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting in the UK.
In 2017 the fees paid to NBS amounted to 
£35,300. Charges were based upon time spent on 
the services and the seniority of staff performing 
the work.
Director Reviews 
As part of our year-end review processes the 
Executive Directors met with the Chairman or in 
the case of the CFO, with the CEO, and underwent 
a formal performance evaluation. The reviews 
covered their performance and effectiveness.
Approach to recruitment
When recruiting new Executive Directors, base 
salary, benefits, annual bonus and long-term 
incentives would be set in accordance with the 
Remuneration Policy in place at the time of 
appointment. Base salaries are set to take into 
account the experience of the candidate subject 
to the Committee's judgement that the level of 
remuneration is in the Company's best interests. 
The Committee can use its authority to match 
previous benefits or remuneration arrangements.
If a new Chairman or Non-executive Director is 
appointed remuneration arrangements will be in 
line with the Remuneration Policy and the current 
rates set for Non-executive Directors.
Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors 
and senior management is designed to support 
the business needs of the Group, to ensure it has 
the ability to attract and retain senior leaders of a 
high calibre, and to align the long-term interests of 
Executive Directors and senior management with 
those of our Shareholders.
Remuneration for Executive 
Directors
The main component parts of the remuneration 
policy in respect of Executive Directors are 
summarised in the following table, explaining how 
each element operates and how each part links to 
the corporate strategy.

Salary Essential to

Reflects an 
individual’s 
experience, role, 
competency and 
performance.
Salaries are paid monthly. They are 
normally reviewed annually with 
changes effective from 1 January 
but may be reviewed more 
frequently.
Decisions on changes to salaries are 
influenced by a variety of factors 
including:
• the commercial need to do so;
• the role, experience, 
responsibility and performance 
(of both the individual and 
Company);
• increases applied to the 
broader workforce; and
• periodic benchmarking of 
similar roles in broadly similar 
UK-listed companies of a 
similar size and in the Channel 
Islands.
The Committee is conscious that 
salary levels, at the time of setting 
this policy, are positioned below 
mid-market levels and this policy 
contains flexibility to increase salary 
levels as the Company matures and 
the pre-IPO share awards unwind. 
Potentially material increases may 
be made during this policy period 
and, ultimately, the intention is to 
pay around mid-market levels with 
annual increases thereafter typically 
in line with the wider workforce.
Increases beyond those granted to 
the workforce may be awarded in 
certain circumstances. For example, 
where:
• an Executive Director’s starting 
salary has been set at lower 
than typical market salary to 
allow for growth in the role 
and further experience to be 
gained, then larger increases 
may be awarded to move 
salary positioning closer to an 
appropriate benchmark for the 
role;
• the Committee considers it 
appropriate and necessary (such 
as when an individual assumes 
more responsibility or his or her 
performance warrants such an 
increase);
• there has been a change in 
market practice or as a result of 
new regulations; or
• the size, value or complexity of 
the Group warrants a higher 
salary positioning.
The Committee will also take into 
account SANNE-specific factors such 
as its recent listing and the transition 
from private to public company, pay 
levels in Jersey and its lower personal 
tax rate compared with the UK.
Individual 
and Company 
performance is taken 
into account when 
determining the 
annual increase.

Operation Maximum opportunity
Framework 
used to assess 
performance
Annual bonus To motivate 
Executive Directors 
and incentivise 
the achievement 
of annual financial 
and/or strategic 
targets. 
Bonus deferral in 
shares provides 
a retention 
element and extra 
alignment with 
Shareholders.
Bonus payment is determined by 
the Committee after the year end, 
based on performance against the 
targets set. Targets are reviewed 
annually at the start of the financial 
year.
Bonus is payable in a mix of cash 
and deferred shares (usually 
structured as conditional awards or 
as nil or nominal cost options) which 
vest after a deferred period. 
Recovery and withholding provisions 
would apply if, within three years 
of the payment of a bonus and/or 
grant of a deferred bonus award, 
it is discovered that the bonus or 
award was granted to a greater 
extent than warranted as a result of 
a material misstatement of financial 
results, a miscalculation in the grant 
or assessment of performance 
conditions or where serious 
misconduct has been discovered.
An additional payment (in the form 
of cash or shares) may be made in 
respect of shares that vest to reflect 
the value of dividends that would 
have been paid on deferred shares 
during the deferral period.
The maximum opportunity under 
this policy is 150% of base salary. The 
current annual bonus opportunity is 
100% of base salary.
The bonus may 
be based on the 
achievement of an 
appropriate mix of 
challenging financial, 
strategic or individual 
targets. 
Financial measures, 
which will typically 
account for the 
majority of the bonus 
opportunity, may 
include measures such 
as (Group or business 
unit) profit taking into 
account the strategic 
objectives of the 
business from time to 
time. 
For financial metrics, 
a range of targets is 
set by the Committee, 
taking into account 
factors such as the 
business outlook for 
the year. 
If non-financial or 
individual measures 
are included, 
where possible a 
performance range 
will be set, although 
this will depend on 
the measure chosen. 
The detail of the 
measures, targets 
and weightings may 
be varied by the 
Committee year on 
year based on the 
Company’s strategic 
goals.

Awards are normally granted 
annually in the form of either

after three years. 
Stretching performance conditions 
normally measured over a period of 
three years determine the extent to 
which awards vest. 
Award levels are reviewed annually 
taking into account matters 
such as market practice, overall 
remuneration, the performance of 
the Company and the recipients of 
the award. 
Recovery and withholding provisions 
would apply if within three years 
of vesting it is discovered that the 
award vested to a greater extent 
than warranted as a result of a 
material misstatement of financial 
results, a miscalculation in the grant

conditions or where serious 
misconduct has been discovered. 
A payment (either in cash or

There will be a two-year holding 
period on shares acquired from 
vested awards.
The maximum annual award under 
the PSP that may be granted to an 
individual in any financial year is 
150% of base salary. Current award 
levels are 100% of base salary.
The exercise 
of awards is 
conditional upon the 
achievement of one 
or more challenging 
performance 
targets set by the 
Remuneration 
Committee at the 
time of grant and 
measured over a 
three-year period. 
In determining the 
target range for any 
financial measures 
that may apply, the 
Committee ensures 
they are challenging 
by taking into 
account current and 
anticipated trading 
conditions, the 
long-term business 
plan and external 
expectations. 
Performance periods 
will usually commence 
from the start of the 
financial year in which 
the award is made. 
No more than 25% 
of the relevant part 
of the award would 
vest for achieving 
the threshold level of 
performance. 
The Committee 
retains the flexibility 
to vary the mix of 
metrics for each 
year’s award in light 
of the business 
priorities at the 
time or to introduce 
new measures to 
support the long-term 
business strategy.

Directors’ 
fees
To attract and 
retain high quality 
and experienced 
Non-executive 
Directors.
The fees of the Non-executive 
Directors are set by the Board and 
the Chairman’s fee is set by the 
Committee (the Chairman and the 
Non-executive Directors do not take 
part in any discussion of their own 
fees). Fees are reviewed periodically 
by reference to market levels and 
likely time commitment. 
The Chairman receives a basic fee 
covering all his responsibilities. 
Non-executive Directors receive a 
fee for carrying out their duties, 
together with additional fees 
for those who chair the primary 
Board committees and the Senior 
Independent Director. 
The level of fees of the Chairman 
and other Non-executive Directors 
reflect the time commitment and 
responsibility of their respective 
roles. Their fees are reviewed from 
time to time against broadly similar 
UK-listed companies and companies 
of a similar size.
The Chairman and other Non- 
executive Directors do not 
participate in any incentive 
arrangements and they do not 
receive a pension contribution. They 
do not receive any benefits but they 
may be reimbursed for the cost of 
travel or overnight accommodation 
and related expenses incurred in 
carrying out their duties which are 
deemed taxable by the relevant tax 
authority (including any personal tax 
due on such expenses).
Details of current fees are set out in

policy
To align interests of 
management and 
Shareholders and 
promote a long-
term approach to 
performance and 
risk management.
Executive Directors are required 
to build up and maintain a 
shareholding in the Company equal 
to at least 200% of salary. 
Only shares owned outright by 
Executive Directors are included in 
the guideline. The Committee will 
review progress annually with an 
expectation that Executive Directors 
will make progress towards the 
achievement of the shareholding 
policy guideline each year. 
At least half of vested PSP and 
deferred share bonus awards 
(after the sale of shares to cover 
associated personal tax liabilities) 
are expected be retained until the 
guideline is met.
Not applicable. No performance 
metrics apply.
Remuneration Committee scope for discretion
The policy may be adjusted to take account of external legal, tax or regulatory changes in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, to ensure that it 
may operate as intended.
The Committee will operate the Annual Bonus Plan and the Performance Share Plan according to their respective rules (the terms of which were summarised 
for Shareholders in the Company’s IPO Prospectus) and the policy set out above. The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a 
number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these plans. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Who participates in the plan;
• the timing of grant and/or payment;
• the size of an award and/or a payment;
• the choice of performance measures and targets for each incentive plan in accordance with the policy set out above and the rules of each plan;
• the ability to vary any performance conditions if circumstances occur which cause the Remuneration Committee to determine that the original conditions 
have ceased to be appropriate provided that any change is fair and reasonable and in the Committee’s opinion, not materially less difficult to satisfy than 
the original condition;
• discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction;
• determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate 
treatment under the plan rules; and
• recovery and withholding of any award within a three year period of the later of the grant date or vesting date.
Any use of discretion would be in exceptional circumstances, would (where relevant) be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may be the 
subject of consultation with the Company’s major Shareholders.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, any remuneration or payments for loss of office that are not in line with this policy may be made if the terms were agreed before 
the approval of this policy including the release of ordinary shares subject to an extended restricted sale period as set out in the IPO Prospectus. In addition, 
authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into at a time when the relevant employee was not a Director of the Company.

Executive Directors’ service contracts
The Committee’s policy is for Executive Directors’ service agreements contracts to be terminable on no more than six months’ notice. The details of existing 
Executive Directors’ service contracts are summarised in the table 
Executive Director Date of service contract Notice Period
Dean Godwin
09/03/2015 Six months’ notice from either party
Spencer Daley
Executive Directors’ contracts contain provisions for payment in lieu of notice. The Committee will take into consideration the circumstances and reasons for 
departure, including the individual’s performance, in every case.
In the event of an Executive Director’s departure the Company may, at its discretion, pay base salary in lieu of any unexpired part of an Executive Director’s 
notice period, either in equal monthly instalments until the end of the notice period or as a lump sum. 
Service contracts may be terminated without notice and without any payment in lieu of notice in certain circumstances, such as gross misconduct or  
gross negligence.
If the Executive Director is put on garden leave, then he remains in employment and may continue to receive base salary and benefits during that period.
In addition, the Committee may agree to payment of outplacement counselling costs and disbursements (such as legal costs) if considered to be appropriate and 
dependent on the circumstances of departure.

Sanne-AR2017 Front-proof13.indd   66 23/03/2018   16:24:23 T reatment of incentives  
on loss of office
As a general rule, the opportunity to receive 
a bonus in respect of the relevant bonus year 
will lapse upon a participant ceasing to hold 
employment or to be an Executive Director.
However, where the individual is considered 
a ‘good leaver’ (in the event of death, injury, 
disability, retirement with the agreement of his or 
her employer, redundancy, or sale of employing 
company or business out of the Group or for any 
other reason at the discretion of the Committee) 
the Committee may determine that such individual 
shall remain eligible for consideration for the 
payment of a prorated bonus on the normal 
payment date (or such earlier date the Committee 
determines). No bonus will be payable for any 
period of notice not worked.
Any outstanding share awards held by a departing 
Executive Director will be treated in accordance 
with the relevant plan rules. The default treatment 
under the deferred element of the Annual Bonus 
Plan and Performance Share Plan is that any 
outstanding awards will lapse on cessation of 
employment.
However, in certain prescribed ‘good leaver’ 
circumstances (as set out earlier) and in any other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Committee:
• Deferred annual bonus plan awards will 
vest at cessation (or such later date as 
the Committee determines) and to such 
extent (which may include the full extent of 
the award) as the Committee determines 
appropriate; and
• PSP awards will vest at the normal vesting 
date unless the Committee determines 
that they may vest earlier, from the date 
of cessation. In either case, the number of 
awards capable of being exercised will be 
determined by reference to the satisfaction 
of performance criteria and reduced pro rata 
for time (unless the Committee determines 
that prorating should apply to a lesser extent 
or not at all in the particular circumstances).
Non-executive Directors
All Non-executive Directors have letters of 
appointment with the Company for an initial 
period of three years, subject to annual 
reappointment at the AGM. Appointments are 
terminable by either party on three months’ 
written notice. The appointment letters for 
the Non-executive Directors provide that no 
compensation is payable on termination, other 
than accrued fees and expenses.
All Executive Directors’ service agreements and 
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment 
are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office at 13 Castle Street, St Helier, 
Jersey, JE4 5UT.
Recruitment policy
The Company may agree, on the appointment of 
a new Executive Director, that any notice given 
by the Company will not expire prior to the first 
anniversary of the commencement date of the 
Executive Director’s appointment.
In setting the remuneration for a new Executive 
Director, the Remuneration Committee will take 
into account the calibre of the individual, market 
data and the remuneration arrangements for 
current Executive Directors. The remuneration 
package for a new Executive Director will be set in 
accordance with the Company’s approved policy as 
set out in the remuneration policy table.
Fixed pay
Salary levels for Executive Directors will be set 
in accordance with the Company’s policy, taking 
into account the experience and calibre of the 
individual and existing remuneration package. 
Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary 
initially (for either an internal promotion or 
external recruit) a series of increases to the desired 
salary positioning may be made over subsequent 
years subject to individual performance and 
development in the role. Benefits will generally 
be provided in line with those offered to other 
Executive Directors but will also take into account 
local practice. Relocation assistance or other 
related expenses, including tax equalisation 
benefits, may be provided if necessary.
Variable pay
The Annual Bonus Plan and Performance Share 
Plan participation will be in accordance with 
the Company’s approved policy detailed above. 
Different performance measures may be set 
initially, taking into account the responsibilities of 
the individual, and the point in the financial year 
that he or she joined the Board.
Buy-out awards
In the case of an external hire, if it is necessary 
to buy out incentive pay or benefit arrangements 
which would be forfeited on leaving the previous 
employer, this would be provided for taking into 
account the form (cash or shares), timing and 
expected value (i.e. likelihood of meeting any 
existing performance criteria) of the remuneration 
being forfeited. The principle will be that any 
replacement awards will be of broadly comparable 
value to what the Executive Director has left 
behind. Replacement share awards, if used, may 
be granted using the Company’s existing share 
plans to the extent possible, although awards may 
also be granted outside of these schemes.
In the case of an internal hire, any legacy variable 
pay award in relation to the previous role will be 
allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant 
even if not awarded under the terms of this policy. 
Similarly, if an Executive Director is appointed 
following a merger or acquisition of another 
company, any legacy pay arrangements may be 
honoured.
Fees for newly appointed Non-executive Directors 
will be set in line with the approved policy.
Consideration of  
Shareholder views
The Committee considers an open and 
constructive dialogue with investors to 
be important to establishing a successful 
remuneration policy which is considered fair 
and transparent by both Executive Directors and 
Shareholders. Therefore, the Committee will seek 
to engage proactively with major Shareholders 
and Shareholder bodies whenever any material 
changes are being proposed to the remuneration 
policy or to how the current policy will be 
operated.
The Committee Chair will inform major 
Shareholders of such changes in advance and will 
offer a meeting to discuss details as required. The 
Committee also welcomes investor feedback and 
will consider views raised at the AGM and at other 
times throughout the year.
Consideration of 
employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group
The Committee does not consult with employees 
directly on matters of Executive Director 
remuneration. However, the Committee is aware 
of the disconnect which can be created if Executive 
Director remuneration is set in isolation and 
therefore is updated during the year with details 
of the pay and employment conditions in the 
wider workforce. In particular, the Committee is 
made aware of general salary increases, general 
benefit provision and the proposed level of annual 
bonuses. The Committee is also responsible for 
reviewing the proposed participants of the PSP .

2017 Annual Bonus out-turn
As I have indicated in my 2016 Annual Statement, the Committee has decided to phase in the move towards an appropriate level of total remuneration for 
the Executive Directors over a small number of years. This approach applied in 2017 and was reflected in an extremely tough set of financial and non-financial 
targets. The out-turns, therefore, are not what the Committee expects to award in future years and instead arise as a result of 2017 being a transition year.
Bonuses paid in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 were based 75% on underlying profit before tax (PBT) targets and 25% on non-financial targets.

Performance against non-financial targets 
The Committee spent time evaluating the performance of the Executive Directors.
Details of Dean Godwin’s achievements against key objectives set are as follows:
• Delivering the Group’s strategy and in particular, integrating acquisitions;
• Ensuring the appropriate management and resources are in place to strengthen the management team and ensure delivery across the regions and in 
head-office;
• Preparing SANNE for its next stage of development and preparing strategic plans; and 
• Driving inorganic growth.
Details of Spencer Daley’s achievements against objectives set are as follows:
• Driving the use of Finance’s IT roadmap and leading the integrations of acquisitions in terms of financial reporting infrastructure;
• Integrating acquisitions and delivery of growth targets;
• Delivering the organisation’s restructuring into the Group's segmental financial and management reporting; and 
• Carrying out fund raising exercises for acquisitions.

Performance Share Plan awards with performance period ending during the year
There were no PSP awards with performance periods ending during the year or shortly after the year end. The first award under the PSP was granted in 2016

Awards vest on a straight line basis for performance between 32.5 pence and 36.5 pence. 
During the year, the adjustments used to derive underlying profit and earnings were amended.  Specifically, share based payment charges relating to share 
awards granted as part of management’s normal remuneration are no longer adjusted for when deriving underlying profit and earnings. The unvested 2016 
and 2017 PSP awards are subject to EPS targets that were set on the basis that all share based payment charges were non underlying. When determining the 
vesting outcomes of these awards in 2018 and 2019, the Committee will seek to ensure that the profit assessment is on a like-for-like basis with the original 
targets.
Directors’ interests in shares
Following the move from a private to a listed company in April 2015, the Executive Directors have significant shareholdings in the Company, very significantly in

Sanne-AR2017 Front-proof13.indd   69 23/03/2018   16:24:23 As part of the terms of the IPO, the Executive Directors agreed to a restricted sale agreement which permitted a maximum sale of 30% of the shareholding, 
with an extended restricted sale period that only allows 25% of the remaining shareholding to be sold on each anniversary of the listing over four years (ending 
2019). In addition, there is further provision whereby should the Executive Director cease employment during this period all unreleased remaining shares, 
at the time of exit, will be restricted from sale until 72 months have elapsed from the listing date. Unreleased shares can be recovered in part or in full in the 
event of the Executive Director failing the ‘capability’ process or if he commits an act of gross misconduct.
During the period 31 December 2017 to 23 February 2018, being the latest possible date, there have been no changes in the Directors’ share interests.
Loss of office payment and payments to past Directors
No Directors departed during 2017 and there were no payments to past Directors of the Company in the year under review. Phil Godley stepped down from 
the Board but remained in employment with SANNE and accordingly no payment has been made.

During the year the increase in staff costs reflects the increased headcount primarily due to acquisitions made by the Group.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee (unaudited)
The Company’s Remuneration Committee is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Committee is 
a committee of the Board which determines the Group’s policy on the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and other relevant members of 
senior management. The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the Company’s website, www.sannegroup.com.
The table below shows the Committee members during the year and their attendance:

None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as a Shareholder), conflicts of interest from cross-directorships or day-to-day 
involvement in the running of the business. Mel Carvill joined the Board as an independent Non-executive Director on 1 January 2018 and joined the 
Remuneration Committee from that date. Rupert Robson is no longer a member of the Remuneration Committee but will be invited to attend meetings, as 
appropriate.
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Group Company Secretary and Head of Human Resources are invited to attend selected meetings although 
they are not present when matters affecting their own remuneration are being discussed. The Group Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. In 
addition NBS can be invited to attend as advisers.
The role of the committee (unaudited)
The key responsibilities of the Committee are:
• to determine and agree with the Board the framework and policy for remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman, the Executive Directors and 
senior management;
• review and have regard to pay and employment conditions across the Company or Group, especially when determining annual salary increases; 
• review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy;
• to determine the total individual remuneration package of each Executive Director, the Company Chairman and other designated senior executives 
including bonuses, incentive payments and share options or other share awards; 
• obtain information about remuneration in other companies of comparable scale;
• to appoint remuneration consultants and to commission reports;
• approve the design of, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Company and approve the total annual payments made under such 
schemes (in accordance with the provisions in Schedule A of the Code);
• ensure that contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, are fair to the individual and the Company;
• oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures throughout the Company or Group;
• agree the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the Directors; and
• work and liaise as necessary with all other Board committees.
Effectiveness review (unaudited)
During the year the Committee had an external evaluation and members of the Committee were interviewed and questionnaires completed. The results of the 
evaluation were generally positive, the Committee has operated and functioned well. The remit of the Committee will need to be expanded to deliver future 
requirements and an action plan will be prepared on all matters raised. Additional governance information will be shared via the Committee portal.

Sanne-AR2017 Front-proof13.indd   72 23/03/2018   16:24:24 Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for 2018
Basic annual salary
In 2015 we stated that current base salaries (and therefore Directors’ total packages) were significantly below market levels and that this would need to be 
addressed over time. A failure to do so poses a material risk to the Company with regard to succession planning, particularly as the equity lock-in period 
applying to the current Executive Directors approaches.
Last year the Committee consulted with leading Shareholders and Shareholder bodies on how it intends to transition remuneration over a period of time so 
that remuneration packages become appropriate for a FTSE-listed company whilst also recognising the Company’s Jersey origins.
As set out in last year's report, it is proposed that the Executive Directors' base salaries will be increased by 8% p.a. for the CEO and 5% p.a. for the CFO in 
2019, reflecting strong individual and company performance.
CURRENT 2019
CEO £292,000 £315,000
CFO £210,000 £220,000
Pension arrangements
No pension contribution will be provided in 2018 for the current Executive Directors. This will be kept under review and a contribution may be introduced in 
the future taking into account the level of provision to all employees.
Benefits
Executive Directors will be provided benefits as outlined in the policy.
Annual Bonus Plan
The annual bonus measures are reviewed annually and reflect the key financial, strategic and operational priorities of the Group.
The annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors for 2018 shall be 100% of salary and bonuses will be based on a sliding scale of very challenging 
underlying profit before tax targets for 75% of the bonus and strategic targets for 25%. 
The 2018 bonus profit component will be based on underlying profit before tax. Underlying profit before tax is one of the key financial metrics at SANNE and 
the targets have been set by the Committee after taking account of the Company’s business plan and external expectations, with full payment being made only 
in the case of exceptionally strong performance.
Non-financial objectives will be based on the short-term priorities of the business.
The Committee considers that the profit and non-financial targets are commercially sensitive, which means that they cannot be disclosed in advance. However, 
we will disclose the underlying profit targets, the non-financial objectives and performance against these targets in next year’s remuneration report.
Half of any bonus will be payable in cash and the other half will be deferred in shares for a period of three years.
Performance Share Plan Awards
PSP awards with a face value of 100% of salary will be granted to Executive Directors in 2018.
The Committee reviewed the choice of measures and in light of the Company’s strategic outlook has set a stretching range of underlying diluted EPS growth 
targets required to be achieved in the year ending 31 December 2020 as set out below:
Underlying Basic EPS for FY 2020 Proportion of award vesting
Less than 29.85 pence Zero
29.85 pence 25%
37.85 pence or more 100%
Awards vest on a straight line basis for performance between 29.85 pence and 37.85 pence.
A two year post-vest holding period will apply, creating a five year period between the grant of an award and the first opportunity to sell (the net of tax) vested 
shares.

responsible for 
keeping proper 
accounting records 
that disclose, with 
reasonable accuracy, 
at any time, the 
ﬁnancial position of 
the Company.”
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the Directors have elected to prepare the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. The financial statements are required by 
law to give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the group and of the profit or loss of the 
group for that period. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that financial statements present fairly for each 
financial year the group's financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows. This 
requires the faithful representation of the effects 
of transactions, other events and conditions in 
accordance with the definitions and recognition 
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting Standards 
Board's 'Framework for the preparation and 
presentation of financial statements'.  In virtually 
all circumstances, a fair presentation will be 
achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. 
However, directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on 
the entity's financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the company's ability 
to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities
The Annual Report and Consolidated Financial 
Statements, taken as a whole, are fair and 
balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for Shareholders to assess 
the performance, strategy and business model of 
the Company.
The Directors confirm that they have complied 
with the above in preparing these financial 
statements. The Directors prepared an unaudited 
interim report covering the six month period 
ended 30 June 2017.
Statement as a result of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority:
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• The financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the parent Company 
and its undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• The Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
include a fair view of the development 
and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the Members of Sanne Group plc
Opinion 
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);
• have been properly prepared in accordance with Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991.
We have audited the financial statements of Sanne Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
• the Consolidated Income Statement;
• the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
• the Consolidated Balance Sheet;
• the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement; and
• the related notes 1 to 31.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including 
the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s) Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit 
matters
The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
• revenue recognition – valuation of accrued income in Mauritius;
• impairment of intangible assets, specifically goodwill; and
• accounting for acquisitions.
Within this report, any new risks are identified with  and any risks which are the same as the prior year identified with  .
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £1.1m which was determined on the basis of Group profit 
before tax.
Scoping Included within the scope of the audit were twelve components across eight jurisdictions – Jersey, Guernsey, the United Kingdom, 
Ireland, Luxembourg, South Africa, the United States and Mauritius.
Significant 
changes 
in our 
approach
Since the acquisition of the Mauritian business with effect from 1 January 2017, the scope of our audit changed to also include 
this reporting component as a significant component of the Group. There were no other significant changes in our audit 
approach, from the prior year.

Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in note 3 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to 
that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to 
report, add or draw attention to in respect of 
these matters. 
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent 
with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the 
evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are 
required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 23-26 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
• the directors' confirmation on page 22 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 56 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the Group 
required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to 
report, add or draw attention to in respect of 
these matters.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which 
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
In the prior year we referred to key audit matters related to the valuation of trade receivables and share based payments. We have not referred to these in the 
current year because in the overall context of the audit of the Group as a whole, these areas did not take up the most significant efforts or resources of the 
engagement team.
Revenue recognition – valuation of accrued income in Mauritius  
Key audit 
matter 
description
At the year-end there is £3.1m (2016: £1.5m) of time which has been spent working on client matters which has not been 
billed or which has been accrued, of which £2.0m pertains to Sanne Mauritius Limited (“SML”). The valuation of accrued 
income was included in the prior year audit report however in the current year this key audit matter is focused specifically on 
SML. The accrued income is required to be stated at the amount which is recoverable and because SML is on a different billing 
cycle to the rest of the Group and the accrued income is aged, there is a risk of material misstatement that is not recoverable.
There is a high level of judgement applied by management in assessing and determining the value of the accrued income. The 
accounting policy is detailed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The judgements are set out in the Audit and 
Risk Committee Report on page 54.

How the 
scope of 
our audit 
responded to 
the key audit 
matter
We have evaluated the design and implementation of controls around the quarterly billing and accrued income evaluation 
process specific to the valuation of accrued income in SML.
For a sample of clients for which accrued income has been recognised, we have reviewed the level of bills raised and recovered 
post year end. For those amounts not billed or recovered post year end, we have challenged management’s judgement and 
rationale around the recoverability of the amounts through reviewing fee agreements and communications with clients to 
verify the amounts which are able to be charged and through reviewing historical billing and payment patterns in respect of 
those clients to support judgments to the extent required.
Key 
observations
We consider management’s judgements around the recoverability of the accrued income amounts in SML to be reasonable.
Impairment of intangible assets, specifically goodwill  
Key audit 
matter 
description
In previous years and during the current year there have been a number of acquisitions by entities within the Group resulting 
in a goodwill balance of £100.4m (2016: £55.1m) as at the year end. Acquisitions were made in Ireland, South Africa, North 
America, and the Netherlands in prior year and a further acquisition was made in Mauritius at the start of the current year. 
The initial valuation of the intangible assets, including the allocation of goodwill, was determined in the year of acquisition, 
however continual judgement is applied by management in performing impairment reviews in respect of the carrying value of 
goodwill. The impairment of intangible assets was included in the prior year audit report and this year there is a specific focus 
on goodwill due to the increased balance. 
Accounting policy detailed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The assumptions and judgements which are 
made in respect of these areas are set out in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 54 and in note 13.
How the 
scope of 
our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We have evaluated the design and implementation of controls around the preparation and review of impairment models.
We evaluated and challenged management’s future cash flow forecasts and the process by which they were drawn up through 
assessing the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions applied based our understanding of the business. We tested the 
underlying value in use calculations. We compared management’s forecast with the latest approved budgets and found them 
to be materially consistent.
We challenged the key assumptions for short and long-term growth rates in the forecasts by comparing them with historical 
results and we also challenged the discount rate used in the calculations by assessing the cost of capital for the Group and 
comparable organisations and assessed the specific risk premium applied to each cash generating unit (“CGU”) in question. 
We performed sensitivity analysis to identify the key assumption of growth rate as being important to the valuation and then 
evaluated management’s rationale for the applied rates.
We ascertained the extent to which a reduction in these assumptions, both individually or in aggregate, would result in 
goodwill impairment, and considered the likelihood of such events occurring. 
Key 
observations
Given the level of headroom identified as a result of the above procedures we were satisfied that the carrying value of goodwill 
is reasonable. We identified that the CGU with the least headroom is Sorato which has £0.4m headroom in the calculations 
performed by management.

Mauritius, which is subject to this accounting as set out in note 26. Furthermore there is a significant amount of judgement 
involved in the determination of the fair value of the acquired assets and the allocation of the purchase price, resulting in a risk 
that the associated valuations may not be accurate. The judgement arises from the fact there are a number of assumptions 
which are included in the model used to determine the fair value and allocation of the value between goodwill and intangible 
assets such as estimation of useful economic lives of the assets, growth rates, attrition rates and the discount rate. The 
accounting policy is detailed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The initial recognition of intangible assets 
related to this acquisition is disclosed as a critical judgement in note 4 of the annual report. The judgements are also set out in 
the Audit and Risk Committee report on page 54.
How the 
scope of 
our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We have evaluated the design and implementation of controls around the accounting for acquisitions.
We have challenged the judgements applied in the valuation models and purchase price allocation through reviewing 
comparable data and the most significant challenges were around attrition rates, overhead and direct cost allocations and 
contributory asset charges included within the model.
We performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions within the model. This included sensitising the discount rates and 
attrition rates.
In addition we challenged management around certain methodology matters relating to the models including the exclusion of 
brand value. Our challenges were made with reference to cumulatively acquired knowledge of the Group, the acquired entity 
and other market and industry factors.
Key 
observations
We considered management’s overall estimate in respect of the purchase price allocation to be reasonable.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our 
work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £1.1m (2016: £0.7m)
Basis for determining 
materiality
5% of Group profit before tax (2016: 5% of Group profit before tax)
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality by applying a benchmark of 5% of Group profit 
before tax. We believe that Group profit before tax is the most appropriate benchmark as it is a key statutory 
measure.

differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into 
account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group’s accounting process is structured around a local finance function in each of the territories in which the Group operates which maintain their own 
accounting records and controls and report to a Head Office finance team in Jersey, supported by South Africa, through submission of management reporting 
packs. 
At a Group level, the head office finance team consolidates the reporting of all reporting components. In our view, due to their financial significance and/or 
risk characteristics, those businesses in Luxembourg, Mauritius, the United States and certain entities in Jersey required an audit of their complete financial 
information. Component auditors from Deloitte network firms in Luxembourg and Mauritius who are familiar with the local laws and regulations in those 
territories supported this audit work. The component materialities used were betwenn 45% and 55% of Group materiality based on the percentage of the 
Group benchmark represented by each component. Specific risk-based audit procedures were performed by the local team in South Africa.
The work on the valuation of accrued income was performed by Deloitte Mauritius as the component auditor and senior members of the Group engagement 
team performed a detail review of the component’s working papers as well as having detailed discussions with local client management and staff to obtain a 
thorough understanding of the accounting treatment applied.
Based upon Group materiality, we did not carry out detailed audit procedures on all components within the Group. Local audit teams perform statutory audits 
of subsidiary companies where required by local legislation. In order to direct and supervise the Group audit, the Group engagement team sent detailed 
instructions to significant component audit teams. This included communication of the areas of focus above and other required communications. The Group 
engagement team held regular meetings with component auditors throughout the year and visited the audit teams located in South Africa at the planning 
stage of the audit and Mauritius for both the planning and final phases of the audit. This ensured that we had a comprehensive understanding of the results of 
their work, particularly insofar as it related to the identified areas of focus. The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and certain complex items 
were audited by the Group engagement team in Jersey. These included share based payments which are not covered by the work performed by component 
auditors.
Taken together, these procedures gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.

Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the 
annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is 
a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that 
fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other 
information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and 
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit and Risk committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement 
required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report 
in respect of these matters.

Corporate Governance
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s  ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.
uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and/or those matters 
we have expressly agreed to report to them on in our engagement letter and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinion on other matter prescribed by our engagement letter
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions of the UK 
Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied to the company.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report 
in respect of these matters.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Stock code: SNN www.sannegroup.com
Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General information
Sanne Group plc (the “Company”), incorporated in Jersey on 26 January 2015, is a registered public company limited by shares with a Listing on the London 
Stock Exchange. The registered office and principal place of business is 13 Castle Street, St Helier, Jersey. The principal activity of the Company and its 
subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) is fund, company and trust administration.
In the opinion of the Directors, there is no ultimate controlling party.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently in the current and prior year, other than as set out below.
2. Adoption of new and revised standards
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are relevant to the Group, but were not yet effective. These standards have not been early adopted 
by the Group.
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). This is a new standard which enhances the ability of investors 
and other users of financial information to understand the accounting for financial assets and reduces complexity. IFRS 9 changes the classification 
and measurement of financial assets and the timing and extent of credit provisioning. The Group has not adopted the standard early. The Group 
has performed a preliminary assessment of the impact on the current reporting of financial instruments, although the possible impact has not been 
quantified yet.
Under IFRS 9, the financial assets will be categorised as amortised cost, fair value through profit and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. 
The held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale categories per IAS 39 have been removed.
The new categories per IFRS 9 are not expected to have a material impact on the financial assets as trade receivables will continue to be carried at 
amortised cost.
An expected credit loss model replaces the incurred loss model; under IFRS 9 a provision must be recorded for the amount of any loss expected to arise over 
the life of the financial asset where under IAS 39 credit losses were recognised when they were incurred.
A dual measurement approach applies under the new expected credit loss model, where a financial asset will attract a loss allowance to either 12 month 
expected credit losses or lifetime expected losses. This requires an assessment of the likelihood of default and any potential loss that may arise in the event of 
default.
The Group does not believe that the new standard would cause a material change in the provision for bad debts on trade receivables or any other financial 
assets because of the short-term nature of the trade receivables and the specific provisions currently being raised for them.
• IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018). This standard establishes principles for 
reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an 
entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use 
and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. 
The Group performed an analysis of the new five-step approach to recognise revenue and the impact on the reporting of revenue for the Group. Based on 
the analysis performed, the Group found that IFRS 15 will have no significant impact on the recognition and reporting of revenue.
• IFRS 16 Leases (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019). This is a new standard which sets out the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract. The standard eliminates the classification of leases as either operating 
or finance leases as required by IAS 17 and instead introduces a single lessee accounting model. A lessee will be required to recognise assets and liabilities 
for all leases with a term of more than 12 months and depreciated lease assets separately from interest in the income statement. The standard replaces 
IAS 17 Leases. The Group currently recognises operating lease payments as an expense on the straight-line basis with a corresponding asset or liability in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the straight-line effect. The asset or liability is released over the lifetime of the lease and this will change with the new 
standard grossing up the Group's assets and liabilities. The Group has not performed a full assessment of the impact of the new standard on the reported 
results from 1 January 2019.
In the current year, the Group applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and new interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
("IASB") that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2017. Their adoption has not had any material impact on the 
disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.

Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2017
Sanne Group plc Annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017
3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as adopted by the European 
Union. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB").
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis with fair value being applied to derivative financial instruments. Historical cost is 
generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) during 
each year. Control is achieved where the Company:
• Has the power over the investee;
• Is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and 
• Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when the Company 
obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control over the subsidiary. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
results of the subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Under Article 105(11) of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, the directors of a holding company need not prepare separate financial statements (i.e. company 
only financial statements). Standalone financial statements for the Company are not prepared unless required by the members of the Company by ordinary 
resolution. The members of the Company had not passed a resolution requiring separate financial statements and, in the Directors' opinion, the Company 
meets the definition of a holding company. As permitted by law, the Directors have elected not to prepare separate financial statements.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence at least for the next 12 months. The 
Directors have reviewed the Group’s financial projections and cash flow forecasts and believe, based on those projections and forecasts, that it is appropriate 
to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the Group on the going concern basis. The Group has healthy cash flow and a good pipeline of existing and 
new customers.  Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Further detail is 
contained in the viability statement included in the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 56.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is 
measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by the Group and liabilities incurred by the 
Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in profit or loss as non-underlying items within operating expenses.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and the fair value 
of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business 
combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with 
corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the 
"measurement period" (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on 
how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its 
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting 
dates at fair value with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s 
cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is 
less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to 
the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in 
a subsequent period.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). 
Subsequent to initial recognition, separately intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any 
impairment losses.
Contract intangibles 
Contract intangibles consist of the recognition of the legal relationships gained through acquisition. On initial recognition the values are determined by relevant 
factors such as business product life cycles, length of notice, ease of movement and general attrition. This class of intangibles are amortised over their useful 
lives using the straight-line method, which is estimated at six to eight years, based on management’s expectations and client experience. The amortisation 
charge for the year is included in the Consolidated Income Statement under "operating expenses" and further identified as non-underlying.
Customer intangibles
Customer intangibles consist of the recognition of value attributed to the customer lists through acquisition. On initial recognition, the values are determined 
by relevant factors such as the Company’s growth pattern and ability to cross-sell to existing clients. Subsequently, this class of intangibles is amortised over the 
intangibles' useful lives using the straight-line method, which is estimated at six to ten years, based on management’s expectations and client experience. The 
amortisation charge for the year is included in the Consolidated Income Statement under "operating expenses" and further identified as non-underlying.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the 
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Rendering of services
Revenue is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income at the point in time when the Group has the right to receive payment for its 
services, on an accruals basis.
Accrued income
Accrued income represents the billable provision of services to clients which has not been invoiced at the reporting date. 
Accrued income is recorded based on agreed fees billed in arrears and time-based charges at the agreed charge-out rates in force at the work date, less any 
specific provisions against the value of accrued income where recovery will not be made in full. 
Deferred revenue
Fees in advance and up front fees in respect of services due under contract are time apportioned to the respective accounting periods, and those billed but not 
yet earned are included in deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. 
In the event that lease incentives are received on entering into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of 
incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time 
pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contractual rental increases are straight-lined over the lease term.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (its 
functional currency). For the purpose of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in 
pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) 
are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. 
For the purpose of presenting Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s operations with a functional currency other than 
pounds sterling are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at  the exchange rates at the 
date of the transactions. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in the translation 
reserve.
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a 
subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign operation, or loss of significant influence 
over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are 
reclassified to profit or loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the 
closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to 
contributions.
The Group has a defined benefit retirement obligation in Mauritius due to a regulatory requirement. The defined benefit obligation is recognised in line with 
IAS 19.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit retirement obligation is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The Group has no plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated at half year and year end by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate 
bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related 
pension obligation. 
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:
• Service cost
• Net interest expense or income; and
• Remeasurement
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share. In calculating the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, any share 
restructuring is adjusted by a factor to make it comparable with the other periods. For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted 
to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Both basic and diluted EPS measures are shown for statutory profit position; the Group has also presented an alternative version with profit adjusted for non-
underlying items to provide better understanding of the financial performance of the Group (note 8).

T axation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. 
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement as it excludes items 
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available, against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates 
to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the 
end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current tax and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or 
deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.
Equipment
Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on 
the following bases:
Computer equipment 3 to 5 years
Fixtures and equipment 5 to 16 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting period with the effect of any changes in 
estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets (excluding goodwill)
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of 
the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are 
also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and 
consistent allocation basis can be identified.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

Sanne Group plc Annual report for the year ended 31 December 2017
3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that 
the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require 
delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value.
All financial assets, other than cash and cash equivalents and derivatives, are classified as "loans and receivables". 
Loans and receivables
Trade and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as "loans and receivables". Loans 
and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the 
effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks. 
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as 
a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been 
affected.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the 
carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance 
account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance 
account are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by 
the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Repurchase of the Company's own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss ("FVTPL") or "other financial liabilities". The Group does not 
hold any financial liabilities at FVTPL.
Other financial liabilities 
Borrowings are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective 
yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant year. The 
effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, 
a shorter year, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. 
Accrued interest is recorded separately from the associated borrowings within current liabilities.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments and embedded derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each 
balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of 
the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL. An embedded derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the 
remaining maturity of the hybrid instrument to which the embedded derivative relates is more than 12 months and is not expected to be realised or settled 
within 12 months.
Employee share trust/own shares
Own shares represent the shares of the Company that are held in treasury and by employee share ownership trusts (which is consolidated in the Group 
financial statements). Own shares are recorded at cost and deducted from equity. When shares  vest unconditionally, are cancelled or are reissued they are 
transferred from the own shares reserve at their weighted average cost. Any consideration paid or received by the employee share trust for the purchase or 
sale of the Company’s own shares is shown as a movement in shareholders’ equity.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are determined by the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the  risks specific to the liability. Onerous lease provisions are measured at the lower of the net cost to fulfil, or to 
exit the contract, discounted as appropriate. 
Fiduciary activities
The assets and liabilities of trusts and companies under administration and held in a fiduciary capacity are not included in these Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Share-based payments
Employees of the Group receive bonus allocations in the form of share-based payments under Performance Share Plan, Restrictive Stock Awards and Annual 
Performance Bonuses, whereby eligible employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (shares).
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant 
date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-
based transactions are set out in note 27.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are disclosed and described separately in the Consolidated Financial Statements where it is necessary to do so to provide a better 
understanding of the financial performance of the Group. 
The Group's core business is the administration, reporting and fiduciary services it provides in various jurisdictions. All acquisition and integration-related costs 
are disclosed as non-underlying as these fall outside the core business of the Group. Restricted Share Awards form part of the non-underlying items as they are 
used as a tool to retain key personnel relating to the acquisitions and recruit senior management to support the acquisitions. Amortisation of intangible assets 
recognised through the acquisitions is also included as non-underlying due to their direct link with the acquisitions. All the non-underlying items are regarded 
as expense items outside the normal course of business and disclosed seperately to assist users of the financial statements to better analyse the performance 
of the core business. In the 2016 year all share-based payments were deemed to be non-underlying. This was changed in the current year as the PSP and 
Annual Bonus Plan were deemed to be part of management's normal remuneration and do not form part of non-underlying costs. The 2016 numbers have 
been adjusted for this approach.
Further details of the nature of non-underlying items are given in note 8.
Direct costs
Direct costs are defined by management as the costs of the income generating divisions including staff payroll, marketing and travel attributable to the division 
in relation to the delivery of services and supporting growth.

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the 
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements at the balance sheet date that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
Interpretation of tax legislation
The Group has to comply with tax laws and legislation in all jurisdictions in which it operates. Various tax laws are open for interpretation and management use 
their best judgement to interpret the tax legislation of the various jurisdictions to comply with the regulations. The Group consults with tax authorities to clarify 
the interpretation of tax law, as required. Where uncertainty exists, the Directors will seek the opinion of professional advisers and apply judgement.
Initial recognition of intangible assets
On 1 January 2017, the Group acquired IFS Group. The business combination gave rise to the recognition of customer and contract intangibles. The valuation of 
these intangible assets requires various judgements of which the most significant is the number of years the customer base acquired would generate revenue 
for the Group. The valuation was performed using six years which is based on management's best judgement and historical evidence. The intangible assets 
recognised through the business acquisition amounts to £50.3 million.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Probability of vesting of equity instruments granted in terms of share-based schemes
The cumulative expense recognised in terms of the Group's share-based payment schemes reflects, in the opinion of the Directors, the number of equity 
instruments granted that will ultimately vest. At each reporting date, management adjusts the unvested equity instruments with the forfeited instruments. 
Management is of the opinion that this number, adjusted for future attrition rates, represents the most accurate estimate of the number of instruments that 
will ultimately vest. Based on current performance, management estimates the future performance of the Group will have an annual growth rate of 12%. The 
current year share-based payment charge for the performance share plan is £912k; should the performance of the Group exceed the 12% growth assumption 
and have 20% growth, then the 2018 financial statements will have an additional charge of £420k in respect of share-based payment catch-up with regards 
to 2017.
5. Segmental reporting
The reporting units engage in corporate, fund and private client administration, reporting and fiduciary services. Declared revenue is generated from external 
customers.
The Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 had nine reportable segments under IFRS 8: Debt, Real Estate, Private 
Equity, Corporate and Institutional, Executive Incentives, Private Client, Treasury, Hedge and North American Alternatives. Given the continuing growth of 
the Group, these nine segments have been reorganised into four segments from 1 January 2017. The four new segments are EMEA Alternatives (EMEA), Asia 
- Pacific & Mauritius Alternatives (APM), North American Alternatives (NA) and Corporate & Private Client (CPC).  No customer represents more than 10% of 
2017 revenue.
The comparative numbers for the segmental reporting have been restated to reflect the four new segments created in the current reporting period.
The chief operating decision-maker is considered to be the Board of Directors of Sanne Group plc. Each segment is defined as a set of business activities 
generating a revenue stream determined by segmental responsibility and the management information reviewed by the Board of Directors. The Board 
evaluates segmental performance on the basis of gross profit, after the deduction of the direct costs of staff, marketing and travel.
No inter-segment sales are made.

The above reflects expenses which are not representative of underlying performance.
(i) Share-based payments are detailed in note 27. All acquisition related share-based payments ("RSA" plan) are disclosed as non-underlying as these are not part of the normal 
cost of business; these are awarded to employees as part of the acquisitions to retain key workforce and to recruit key management to support the acquisitions. These costs 
are recorded as non-underlying to enable Shareholders to assess the core performance of the business. In the 2016 year all share-based payments were deemed to be non-
underlying. This was changed in the current year as the PSP and Annual Bonus Plan ("ABP") were deemed to be part of management's normal remuneration and do not form part 
of non-underlying costs. The 2016 numbers have been adjusted for this approach.
(ii) During the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of the IFS Group as detailed in note 26 and signed a share purchase agreement with LIS Group 
which completed on 6 February 2018. The Group also completed four acquisitions during the year ending 31 December 2016. The Group expensed £1.4 million of acquisition and 
integration expenditure during the current year and £3.9 million in the prior year. With acquisitions not being the core ongoing business of the Group, these costs are disclosed as 
non-underlying to enable Shareholders to assess the core performance of the business.
(iii) The amortisation charges relates to the amortisation of intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. As with the acquisition costs, the amortisation of intangibles is directly 
linked to the acquisitions which do not form part of the core ongoing business of the Group. These costs are disclosed as non-underlying to enable Shareholders to assess the 
core performance of the business.
(iv) During the prior year, as part of the loan restructuring, accelerated amortisation on issuance costs of £245k was expensed, see note 22.
(v) During the prior year, FX forward contracts were taken out to purchase United States dollars at a fixed price at a fixed date to fund the FAS and IFS Group acquisitions. A net gain 
of £1.2 million was recognised on these contracts.

1. Deferred tax not recognised for the tax deductions received in the US on goodwill; during 2016 the US business had only been part of the Group for two months.
2.  With the Jersey tax rate at 10%, the impact of the 2016 and 2017 acquisitions is significant on the tax expense as all the acquired jurisdictions have higher tax rates than 10%.
3.   Deferred tax not recognised refers to jurisdictions where there is doubt that future deferred tax assets would be able to be utilised.
Income tax expense computations are based on the jurisdictions in which profits were earned at prevailing rates in the respective jurisdictions.
The Jersey standard income tax rate is 10%. With the Company being a Jersey registered entity and the majority of revenue generated in Jersey we reconciled 
the effective tax rate to 10%.

The effective tax rate of 19.1% (2016: 13.5%) is higher due to a larger percentage of taxable profits being earned in higher tax jurisdictions, this being the first 
full year with all the acquisitions reflecting in the results which pushed the effective tax rate up. The normalised effective tax rate of 16.0% (2016: 16.5%) is in 
line with prior year due to adjustments being £184k where it was £624k for 2016.

10. Earnings per share (continued)
Diluted EPS takes into consideration the Company's dilutive contingently issuable shares as disclosed above. These arrangements have no impact on the 
earnings or underlying earnings figures used to calculate diluted EPS. The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the diluted calculation is 
inclusive of the number of shares which are expected to be issued to satisfy the awards when they become due and where the performance criteria, if any, 
have been deemed to have been met as at 31 December 2017.
Underlying basic EPS and Underlying diluted EPS are calculated on the same basis as Basic EPS and Diluted EPS with the only difference being that the earnings 
used are the underlying earnings which is the profit for the year adjusted for non-underlying items as detailed in note 8.  No adjustment has been made for the 
tax impact of the non-underlying items.
1,786,173 ordinary shares were issued on 7 February 2018 as part of the LIS Group acquisition (note 31).

13. Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the 
date of acquisition.

 IDS acquisition 6,727 
 FLSV acquisition 44,868 
 Sorato acquisition 1,649 
 Exchange differences 1,850

  IFS Group acquisition 53,797 
  Exchange differences (8,504) 
At 31 December 2017 100,387 
In accordance with the Group's accounting policy, the carrying value of goodwill is not subject to systematic amortisation but is reviewed annually for 
impairment. The review assesses whether the carrying value of goodwill could be supported by the recoverable amount which is determined through value in 
use calculations of each cash-generating unit (CGU). The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations are the discount rates and the projected cash 
flows.
The goodwill has been allocated to the CGUs as follows:
 
Carrying  
value  
£’000
Sanne South Africa 9,049 
Sanne Netherlands 1,649 
Sanne Americas 40,601 
Sanne Mauritius 49,088 
 100,387
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs are based on the same key assumptions.
Discount rates
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money. In assessing the discount rate 
applicable to the Group the following factors have been considered:
(i) Long-term treasury bond rate for the relevant jurisdiction.
(ii) The cost of equity based on an adjusted Beta for the relevant jurisdiction.
(iii) The risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities.
Using the above assumptions has resulted in weighted average cost of capital of 17.7% for Sanne South Africa, 13.9% for Sanne Netherlands, 13.0% for Sanne 
Americas and 15.7% for Sanne Mauritius.
Projected cash flows
Projected cash flows are calculated with reference to each CGU's latest budget and business plan which are subject to a rigorous review and challenge process. 
Management prepares the budgets through an assessment of historic revenues from existing clients, the pipeline of new projects, historic pricing, and the 
required resource base needed to service new and existing clients, coupled with their knowledge of wider industry trends and the economic environment.
Projected cash flows are calculated using the prior period actual result and compounding these results by the budgeted numbers. Sanne Netherlands has a 
specific growth strategy and revenue growth is based on up to 12.0% and replacement of previous client losses, driven by specific business plans, for all other 
CGUs we used 7.0%-10.2%. The terminal value growth rate used is 2.58% and is applied after five years.
Based on the value in use calculations, none of the CGUs show indications of impairment.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate 
carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount on CGUs.

The method of valuation and subsequent review of the carrying value of intangible assets is outlined in note 3. As part of that subsequent review, triggers for 
impairment were detected and value in use calculations were performed for the intangible assets relating to the Sorato acquisition. The trigger related to the 
Group choosing to terminate a client relationship where the client's risk profile had increased significantly. A £20k impairment was recognised in operating 
expenses.
The Group has a contractual commitment for the purchase of LIS Group the purchase accounting for which will include the acquisition of intangible assets. See 
note 31 for further details.

Trade receivables
Trade receivables disclosed above are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost.
The Group considers all receivables over 60 days to be past due.
Allowances against doubtful debts are recognised against receivables with reference to these indicators:
• Insolvency or closure of the customer's business;
• Customer liquidity issues; and
• General creditworthiness, including past default experience of the customer.
Receivables as disclosed above include amounts which are past due at the reporting date but against which the Group has not recognised an allowance for 
doubtful receivables because there are no significant indicators of their irrecoverability.
One customer across multiple contracting entities represents more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
 Institutional Client A   -   7.6% (2016: 6%)
The Directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value.

On 30 September 2016, the Group entered into a new loan facility totalling £100 million with HSBC, to replace the previous HSBC facility, all balances to be 
repayable by 30 September 2021. This new facility consists of a £46 million term loan, a £14 million revolving credit facility and a £40 million accordion facility. 
On 28 September 2017, the loan facility was renegotiated to provide a £46 million term loan, a £44 million revolving credit facility and a £10 million accordion 
facility.
As a result of the settlement of the previous term loan of £18 million, accelerated amortisation of capitalised loan costs of £245k was recognised during the 
prior year.
On 1 November 2016, the £46 million loan was drawn to repay the previous £18 million term loan as well as part-fund the acquisition of FLSV and this loan 
remains outstanding at the date of these accounts. Also on 1 November 2016, the £14 million revolving credit facility was drawn to part-fund the acquisition 
of FLSV – this was repaid on 6 January 2017. On 17 May 2017, £5 million was drawn down from the revolving credit facility and this was repaid on 30 August 
2017. On 27 December 2017, £19 million was drawn down against the revolving credit facility to part-fund the acquisition of Luxembourg Investment Solutions 
SA and Compliance Partners SA in Luxembourg, an acquisition that completed on 6 February 2018.
Covenants, attached to the loan, monitor interest cover and leverage. Undrawn funds in the revolving credit facility are charged at 40% of the interest margin 
whilst the accordion facility attracts no interest. £524k of capitalised loan costs are being amortised over the term from 1 November 2016 until the repayment 
date of 30 September 2021, whilst £283k of capitalised loan costs are being amortised from 28 September 2017 to the same repayment date. Under the terms 
of the facility, HSBC holds a charge against the shares of Sanne Fiduciary Services Limited and Sanne Group (Luxembourg) SA and in the event of default, may 
place charges against specific assets of other Group subsidiaries that are party to the facility by virtue of being deemed a material company.

IFS
On 1 January 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of International Financial Services Limited and IFS Trustees. These entities are 
incorporated in Mauritius and together trade as IFS.
This acquisition provides the Group with a significant platform to both support clients in attractive regions and grow the Group's emerging markets presence. 
IFS forms the core of the Asia-Pacific & Mauritius Alternatives segment.
The consideration for the acquisition was satisfied through a payment of approximately £74.6 million (US$92 million) in cash, and the issuance of 5,844,507 
consideration shares.

Fair value of consideration
The shares were valued based on the closing share price the day before issuance with this amount appropriately allocated between share capital and share 
premium.
Transaction costs
The Group incurred £319k (net of FX gain of £1.5 million) of acquisition and integration expense in 2016. During 2017 the Group incurred integration costs of 
£152k. These costs have been expensed within operating expenses in this financial period and have further been identified as non-underlying as detailed in 
note 8.
Goodwill
Goodwill is represented by assets that do not qualify for separate recognition or other factors. These include the opportunities for new business wins from new 
customers, the effects of an assembled workforce and synergies from combining operations of the acquiree and the acquirer.
Effect on the results
IFS contributed £21.5 million revenue and a profit of £3.17 million to the Group’s profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet 
date. The date of acquisition was 1 January 2017 and therefore there are no differences in the revenue and profit which would have been contributed on a pro 
rata basis from the start of the period.

During 2016, 61,576 shares were gifted to employees of the newly acquired businesses to welcome them to the Group. As such they had no vesting 
period. The market value on grant date was charged in full to operating expenses and further identified as non-underlying.  All awards were granted for nil 
consideration.
Performance Share Plan
During the current and prior years, the Group granted awards over its ordinary shares under the terms of its Performance Share Plan ("PSP"). The exercise of 
awards under the PSP is conditional upon the achievement of one or more challenging performance targets set at the time of the grant and measured over a 
three-year performance period from grant date. All the awards were granted for a nil consideration. Further awards were made through the year.
The Group estimates the number of shares to be vested based on the performance targets set to be achieved and the current performance of the Group, and 
this is then grown by 12% as per market expectation to determine the probable performance at vesting date. The leavers assumption set by the Group is nil for 
PSPs as only senior management receive share grants and historical data have shown that senior management do not leave in such a short period. The vesting 
periods of the grants are not more than three years.
A summary of the rules for this scheme and the related performance conditions are set out in the remuneration report.

Restricted Stock Awards
During the current and prior years, the Group granted awards over its ordinary shares in the form of Restrictive Stock Awards (“RSA”).   The awards are granted 
as part of the mechanics of an acquisition to act as retentions for staff. The vesting of the awards is subject to continued employment over an agreed period. 
All the awards were granted for a nil consideration. The Group makes use of a leavers assumption for specific jurisdictions where these awards were granted to 
all staff and not only senior management. The assumptions are based on historical data. With these grants also relating to acquisitions or senior management 
to support the acquisitions they are disclosed as non-underlying.

28. Long-term employee benefits
Defined contribution plan
The Group participates in a defined contribution pension plan to which it makes monthly contributions in specific jurisdictions. The total contributions during 
the year were £240k.
Retirement benefit obligation
The Group has a retirement benefit obligation in respect of the Mauritius Employment Rights Act 2008 which arose through the IFS acquisition (note 26). In 
terms of the act in Mauritius, an employer is obligated to pay a lump sum to the employee upon retirement in proportion to the years of service employed at 
the company.
The Group recognised a net retirement benefit liability of £718k (2016: £nil) on the balance sheet in respect of amounts that are expected to be paid out to 
employees under the retirement gratuities Employment Rights Act 2008. The Group has no specific assets to cover the obligation as it is all self -funded by the 
Group.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the retirement benefit liability was carried out at 31 December 2017 by the State Insurance Company of Mauritius.

The plan is exposed to actuarial risks such as interest rate risk and salary risk.

as follows:
2017
Discount rate
1
5.5%
Future salary increases 3%
Future pension increases 3%
Withdrawal rate 15%
Retirement age 60 years

Significant actuarial assumptions for determination of the retirement benefit obligation are discount rate and expected salary increase. The sensitivity analyses 
below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.

The fair value measurement of the Group's financial and non-financial assets and liabilities utilises market observable inputs and data as far as possible. Inputs 
used in determining fair value measurements are categorised into different levels based on how observable the inputs used in the valuation technique utilised 
are (the "fair value hierarchy"):
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical items;
Level 2: Observable direct or indirect inputs other than Level 1 inputs; and
Level 3: Unobservable inputs, thus not derived from market data.
The classification of an item into the above levels is based on the lowest level of the inputs used that has a significant effect on the fair value measurement of 
the item. Transfers of items between levels are recognised in the period they occur.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to Shareholders 
through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
As disclosed in note 22, in 2016 the Group took a loan which requires it to meet cash flow, leverage and interest cover covenants. In order to achieve the 
Group’s capital risk management objective, the Group aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to borrowings. Breaches in meeting the 
financial covenants would permit the lender to immediately call the loan.
In line with the loan agreement, the Group tests compliance with the financial covenants on a quarterly basis and considers the results in making decisions 
affecting dividend payments to Shareholders or issue of new shares. 
Individual regulated entities within the Group are subject to regulatory requirements to ensure adequate capital and liquidity to meet local requirements in 
Jersey, UK, Guernsey, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxembourg and South Africa, which are monitored monthly to ensure compliance. There have been no breaches of 
applicable regulatory requirements during the year.
Financial risk management objectives
The financial risk management policies are discussed by the management of the Group on a regular basis to ensure that these are in line with the overall 
business strategies and its risk management philosophy. Management sets policies which seek to minimise the potential adverse effects affecting the financial 
performance of the Group. Management provides necessary guidance and instructions to the employees covering specific areas, such as market risk (foreign 
exchange and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk, and in investing excess cash. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings 
of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while 
optimising the return.

29. Financial instruments (continued)
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates. The interest rates are directly linked to the LIBOR 
plus a margin based on the leverage ratio of the Group; the higher the leverage ratio the higher the margin on the LIBOR. The risk is managed by the Group 
maintaining an appropriate leverage ratio and through this the interest rate is kept as low as possible.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the floating rate liabilities. 
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in LIBOR to be 25 basis points based on historical changes to interest rates. If interest rates had been 
higher/lower by 25 basis points and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31 December 2017 would decrease/increase 
by £172k (2016: £63k). 
Foreign currency risk management
The Group manages exposure to foreign exchange rates by carrying out the majority of its transactions in the functional currency of the Group company in 
the jurisdiction in which it operates.  The Group entities maintain assets in foreign currencies sufficient for regulatory capital purposes in each jurisdiction. The 
Group continues to appraise the potential impacts of the United Kingdom's referendum on EU membership ("Brexit"). The volatility of the sterling is due to the 
uncertainties around the effect it might have but the Group's strong momentum and diverse geographic presence, as well as the favourable underlying trends 
in the markets in which we operate, give the Directors confidence in the continued management of the possible Brexit effect. The carrying amounts of the 
Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities are as follows:

 Included in the Euro exposure at 31 December 2017 is £21.2 million cash for the LIS Group acquisition which completed on 6 February 2018 (note 31).
 Included in the United States dollar exposure during the prior year was £73.8 million cash for the Kestrel acquisition which completed on 1 January 2017.
Where considered necessary, the Group will manage its foreign currency risk through hedging arrangements. A foreign currency contract was entered into 
during the current year to buy euro for the LIS acquisition, and this contract was closed by year end. Foreign currency contracts were also entered into during 
the prior year to sell sterling and buy United States dollars; these contracts related to the FLSV and IFS Group acquisitions and both these contracts were closed 
before the 2016 year-end.
Foreign currency risk management sensitivity analysis
The principal currency of the Group's financial assets and liabilities is pounds sterling. The Group, however, does own trading subsidiaries based in the United 
States of America, South Africa, Mauritius, Asia and Europe which are denominated in a currency other than the principal currency. The Group therefore faces 
currency exposures.
The following table illustrates management's assessment on the foreign currency impact on the year-end balance sheet and presents the possible impact on 
the Group's total comprehensive income for the year and net assets arising from potential changes in the euro, United States dollar or South African rand 
exchange rates, with all other variables remaining constant. A strengthening or weakening of sterling by 20% is considered an appropriate variable for the 
sensitivity analysis given the scale of foreign exchange fluctuations over the last two years.

Consolidated Financial Statements
29. Financial instruments (continued)
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s principal exposure 
to credit risk arises from the Group’s receivables from clients. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and borrowings is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. The carrying amount of financial assets 
recorded in the historical financial information, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or 
other credit enhancements are held.
The Group manages credit risk by review at take-on around:
• Risk of insolvency or closure of the customer's business;
• Customer liquidity issues; and
• General creditworthiness, including past default experience of the customer, and customer types.                                                                                                             
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages liquidity risk to maintain adequate 
reserves by regular review around the working capital cycle using information on forecast and actual cash flows.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management 
framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. Regulation in most jurisdictions 
also requires the Group to maintain a level of liquidity so the Group does not become exposed.
The Group manages liquidity risk to maintain adequate reserves by regular reporting around the working capital cycle using information on forecast and 
actual cash. 
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment years. The tables have been drawn 
up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both 
interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rates at the balance sheet 
date. The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

Fair value of financial instruments
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities in the historical financial information approximate their fair values.
