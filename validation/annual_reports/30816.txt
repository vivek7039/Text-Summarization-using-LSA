Group overview 
Cloudcall Group plc (“CloudCall” or the “Company”) is a UK registered company, quoted on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange (LSE: CALL).  The principal activity of the Company is to act as 
the holding company. 
CloudCall and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) operate as a software and unified communications business 
that has developed and provides a suite of cloud-based integrated software and telephony products 
and services under the name “CloudCall”. The Group’s principal activity is to provide products and 
services designed to improve business performance by enabling client communications to be driven by 
the data held within Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) software.  
The CloudCall suite of products allows companies to fully integrate their telephony systems into their 
existing CRM software, enabling calls to be made, recorded, logged and categorised from within the 
CRM system from which detailed activity reports can be easily generated. 
The Group’s software and telephony platform is currently enabling over 23,500 users across 875 
customers to drive more effective communications directly from the intelligence that exists within their 
CRM system. 
The Group has approximately 120 staff based predominantly in Leicester (UK), Boston (US) and Minsk 
(Belarus).  
The Group’s Head Office and Registered Office address is 1 Colton Square, Leicester, LE1 1QH, 
UK. 
 
Further information can be found on our website www.cloudcall.com. 
 
Our business model 
CloudCall is a software company that designs, develops and operates integrated communications 
services for CRM systems. Due to the unique way that the CloudCall system is built with its own 
Application Programming Interface (“API”), it has the capability to readily integrate with multiple CRM 
systems. 
CloudCall software, in combination with its two core telephony platforms sited in the UK and US, delivers 
data driven, intelligent, cost effective telecoms services directly to the end-users of its customers via 
their CRM systems. Telecoms services can be delivered either by using a customer’s existing 
infrastructure “overlay”, or “full VoIP”, whereby the customer deploys CloudCall’s infrastructure. 
CloudCall is a full-service communications provider licensed to operate as a telecoms provider in multiple 
countries. CloudCall provides a robust and effective service built on its own cloud-based technology 
stack.  Cloudcall Group plc

CloudCall works closely with key CRM partners through which it reaches most of its end customers and 
their users. CloudCall’s current geographic reach extends from North America, through the UK and 
mainland Europe.  Contracts are directly with the end-customers (typically minimum period of 2 years), 
with a small percentage of recurring revenues being paid to the relevant CRM partner as long as their 
customer remains a CloudCall customer. 
CloudCall services are invoiced monthly on a per user, per month basis. Telephony services are either 
charged out via all-inclusive call packages, or on a ‘pay as you go’ (PAYG) per minute basis. 87% of 
the Group’s revenues are therefore either recurring or repeating in nature. 
Professional services are delivered as network discovery, configuration and training fees, charged to 
new customers and for existing customers adding additional users or functionality. These service fees 
facilitate effective on-boarding, which in turn leads to higher levels of user adoption and a demonstrably 
faster return on investment for customers. 
All new customers are regularly contacted throughout the on-boarding process to ensure they remain 
satisfied and engaged. Following delivery, they are also routinely contacted for post-implementation 
feedback, looking to identify and resolve any ongoing issues. Existing customers are treated and 
followed up in a similar way. CloudCall provides strong and effective customer support, working to 
reduce issues which may cause customers to churn. 
CloudCall’s software development and engineering function is mostly located in Leicester (UK), but it 
also operates offshore software development offices in Karachi (Pakistan) and Minsk (Belarus).  
Our market 
The overall market size for CRM software is estimated to be more than $36bn per annum. It is estimated 
that the market for CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) software is as much as 40-50% of the overall 
CRM market in terms of its potential size.  
CloudCall operates directly in North America through its office in Boston, MA, and in Europe through its 
UK head office in Leicester.  Currently the Group primarily focuses its products and services on two 
core CRM partners: Salesforce and Bullhorn.  From the beginning of 2018, following the launch of its 
new Microsoft Dynamics integration, focus will additionally be applied to Microsoft Dynamics alongside 
these two.  
In addition to the focus on the three core partners identified above, CloudCall also considers its products 
and services to be extremely relevant for companies within the staffing and recruitment sector, and 
consequently has partnerships with several smaller staffing and recruitment CRMs.  
To date, other than Salesforce, there remains little direct competition offering deeply integrated 
communications services as an end to end offering for many CRM systems.

Our strategy 
The Group’s core objectives remain to deliver strong top-line growth, to continue to drive the business 
toward EBITDA break-even, to deliver a high-quality product and customer experience and to 
encourage a strong and ethical corporate culture. To achieve these objectives, it focuses its resources 
as follows: 
 Deeper focus and stronger relationships with its three core CRM partners – Salesforce, Bullhorn 
and Microsoft Dynamics 
 Focus on larger mid-market customers to drive up average revenues per customer, and to 
reduce average customer costs by continuing to improve onboarding processes, lowering 
ongoing costs of support per customer and reducing churn rates 
 Focus on strengthening relationships and growing revenues from existing and future enterprise 
level customers by expanding CloudCall penetration across their organisations 
 Focus on developing deep understanding and expertise within key industry verticals such as 
staffing and recruitment, to ensure CloudCall products and services not only meet, but exceed 
the needs of those markets   
 Focus on providing the highest standards of customer service and support to increase customer 
satisfaction levels, referenceabilty and brand reputation whilst also reducing churn 
 Continuing to develop CloudCall into a market-leading, feature-rich service, delivering an 
exceptional value-adding customer experience, with high availability and reliability aligned with 
best-in-class security 
 Fostering a positive corporate culture, investing in staff and building relationships with local 
charities and the community in general

Chairman’s statement 
I am pleased to report on a strong set of results for the year ending 31 December 2017 that show the 
excellent progress towards the strategic objectives agreed by the Board at the beginning of the year. 
 
Business performance 
Highlights in the period were: 
 
 Total revenues up by 42% to £6.9m compared to £4.9m in FY 2016 
 Monthly recurring revenues up by 55% compared to FY 2016 
 Total users increased by 45% since 31 December 2016 
 Bullhorn expansion and strengthening relationship offers further opportunities for growth 
 Launch of integration into Microsoft Dynamics CRM, the second largest CRM in the world 
 
In addition to the improvements seen across our key financial growth metrics I am also pleased to 
report that the Group’s focus on client satisfaction and client retention has resulted in steadily improving 
metrics in these areas. Furthermore, the Group’s relationship with its key strategic partner - Bullhorn 
CRM - has continued to strengthen across Bullhorn’s global footprint. This presents a significant 
opportunity for the Group as Bullhorn has recently announced acquisitions which will significantly add 
to their global footprint. 
 
In July 2017 we confirmed that the Company’s lender, Barclays, agreed to provide an improved three-
year revolving credit facility of £1.85m to replace the previous £0.9m two-year term loan, which enabled 
management to invest in the business with more confidence. 
 
Following the half year results in September 2017, institutional investor demand was sufficiently strong 
that the Board were able to recommend a new share placing, raising £5.7m of equity finance (before 
costs) at a price of 143.5 pence per share. 
 
This additional funding, combined with the enhanced Barclays facility has ensured that the investment 
capital is now in place to confidently support further product development and sales and marketing 
expansion, in addition to broadening our CRM partner reach during 2018. 
 
Our strengthened balance sheet when combined with our growing monthly recurring revenue base, 
increasing product capabilities, strong user growth and improved customer retention, gives the Board 
comfort that the business is well-placed to continue delivering its focussed growth strategy through 
2018 and beyond. 
 
This improved position allows for more investment in sales and marketing which, combined with product 
enhancements delivered and planned, will create further opportunities to integrate the CloudCall 
platform with additional CRM platforms, creating a broader route to market and facilitating further 
accelerated growth in users and recurring revenues over time.

Outlook 
Following our most recent equity raise, the Board has conducted a review of the levels of investment 
in our platform and sales channel development to optimise the cash resources available to ensure our 
ambitious growth targets are delivered in 2018 and beyond. 
 
Based on this planning activity the Board is confident that the business is moving into 2018 stronger, 
more resilient and well placed to deliver on its growth strategy. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our staff for their drive and commitment throughout 
the year and look forward to 2018 being another year of strong progress against the clear and exciting 
growth strategy that has been set out for the business.

Chief Executive’s review 
Performance overview and financial highlights 
2017 was a strong year of progress for CloudCall with revenue growing by 42%, to £6.9m, and recurring 
revenue growing by 55% compared to the previous year, driven in part by a 45% increase in the 
number of end users to just over 23,500. 
The decision to target sales and marketing activity towards larger mid-sized businesses has proven to 
be a successful strategy.  Over the course of 2017, our average customer size grew by 24% from 21.6 
to 26.9 and we are now growing revenues from within a number of significant new customers.  This 
trend is particularly marked within the recruitment and staffing sector with several new key accounts 
growing rapidly, making inroads into our top 10 customer list.    
The efficiencies of scale that come with these larger customers means that they are generally more 
profitable to CloudCall, have higher retention rates and enable the opportunity to add more users as 
the relationship evolves. It should be noted however, that their enhanced purchasing power with often 
larger and longer commercial terms being negotiated has had a slight adverse impact on overall average 
recurring revenue per user. 
Elsewhere across the business, we have continued to make good progress. Improvements to our 
customer on-boarding processes have helped reduce the average time between order received and go-
live to approximately 5 weeks, meaning that new customers commence billing earlier than has 
previously been the case. Customer satisfaction is continuing to climb, evidenced by the fact that our 
customer support team continues to deliver excellent support ratings averaging 96%, and the number 
of customers required to be managed by our “at-risk” triaging process has also fallen during the year. 
The net effect of this has been a 10% reduction in monthly churn rates achieved over the course of 
the year, and we continue to see improvements as we enter 2018. 
Constrained growth 
Whilst these growth rates are impressive, our performance was, to some extent, restricted by a number 
of constraining factors. Indeed, 2017 would be better described as being a year of consolidation and 
preparation, with the business focussing on strengthening the foundations that will support future 
growth. 
Prior to the fundraise in the autumn, of which the VCT/EIS element received HMRC advance approval 
on 29 November, the Group was undeniably cash constrained with available cash resources only 
allowing for limited investment in sales and marketing activity. Growth rates to date have been achieved 
with minimal outbound marketing, and with sales staff numbers held at minimum viable levels. This 
lack of dedicated resources has historically held back the rate of new customer acquisition, particularly 
in the US, where our addressable market is four or five times that of the UK. 
In the run up to the year-end, and continuing into 2018, the additional funds raised are allowing us to 
begin expanding our sales and marketing functions and I look forward to reporting on progress later in 
the year.   Cloudcall Group plc

Resource limitations were also being keenly felt in product development, where for much of the year a 
significant portion of our software development resource was focussed on rebuilding our core 
infrastructure into a robust, multi-channel communications platform that would enable us to scale more 
quickly in 2018. This exercise naturally restricted our ability to launch new revenue impacting products 
and services in 2017. 
An improved platform to facilitate growth 
Driven largely by the millennial generation, there is an underlying shift from the more traditional 
methods of communication towards texting and instant messaging. To allow the Group to take 
advantage of this trend it was necessary to rebuild the underlying architecture to efficiently expand its 
product beyond supporting just voice communications to include texting and messaging capabilities as 
part of a multi-channel unified communications solution. 
Historically, CloudCall built bespoke solutions for each CRM partner, resulting in differing levels of 
functionality and an ongoing development overhead associated with maintaining these multiple bespoke 
software bases.  Continuing with this approach, would have necessitated building bespoke iterations of 
any new feature, such as SMS or messaging, for each supported CRM integration.  
The new platform architecture is designed with the software components broken down into modules 
and held centrally as a ‘software library’.  This allows CRM integrations to be built as simpler 
frameworks, that ‘pull’ their required functionality modules from this central software library.  This 
approach has multiple benefits in that it improves consistency, lowers maintenance overheads, allows 
for faster deployment of new functionality and increases the ease and speed of new integrations with 
additional CRMs.  
The updated solution also significantly improves the user interface and provides a more intuitive user 
journey.  In November, our latest Bullhorn integration was released on this new platform.  Since then 
we have also released a new integration with Microsoft Dynamics CRM on the new platform and expect 
to have finished upgrading our Salesforce integration by May 2018. Feedback from customers using 
the new platform has been extremely positive.   
Now that this fundamental architectural change has been made, we are able to move forward at a 
much faster pace. I’m pleased to be able to report that since the year-end, development work on 
building our SMS and instant messaging services has been progressing well and we are currently on 
schedule to release this functionality in May 2018. We are already aware of considerable interest from 
both existing customers and prospective customers and so, when launched, we anticipate an increase 
in revenues from both existing customers and improving new customer signup rates. 
Strengthening ties with Bullhorn 
Our relationship with Bullhorn has continued to strengthen and its staff’s knowledge of, and confidence 
in, the CloudCall service noticeably improved when it selected us as its own telecoms provider, which 
is already improving lead flow to CloudCall from Bullhorn’s own sales teams.    Cloudcall Group plc

Prior to Bullhorn’s acquisition of Connexys in September 2017, our penetration of Bullhorn’s user base 
stood at ~25% in Europe and ~6% in North America.  However, adjusting for that acquisition, 
repositions our penetration of their revised total EMEA users to 14%.   
In March 2018, Bullhorn announced that it had completed the acquisitions of both Talentrover and 
Jobscience, recruitment CRMs built on the Force.com platform (like Connexys). Whilst it remains very 
early days in terms of quantifying exactly what this means for CloudCall in terms of addressable market, 
it is very clear to see that our strong relationship with Bullhorn, in conjunction with their recent 
acquisition driven growth represents a very significant opportunity to CloudCall. 
Increasing our focus on recruitment and staffing 
Further segmentation of the global CRM market has enabled us to identify a vibrant recruitment and 
staffing sector, employing over 12 million people globally. CloudCall’s suite of integrated 
communications products is a strong fit for this sector and is appreciated by firms looking to adopt 
technology that helps them increase their speed in contacting candidates. This is something that 
CloudCall’s solution excels at. 
The Group’s success in this sector, its strong relationship with Bullhorn with its enhanced customer 
base, together with CloudCall’s growing reputation, has led the Board to decide to focus more heavily 
on this sector, before exploring other markets.  
Our culture 
Over the year, staff numbers increased from 89 to 119, reflecting our desire to capitalise on the market 
opportunity that exists today. We are continuing to focus on creating a caring and inclusive culture and 
are investing more in improving our staff mentoring, training and support mechanisms.  I’m delighted 
to say that the various charity and community initiatives we launched in 2016 are now flourishing.  I 
believe this can be exemplified by numerous staff members braving the ‘Beast from the East’ cold all 
night, looking out for, and helping homeless people in Leicester completely from their own initiative, 
which made me particularly proud. 
I’m also keen that CloudCall acts as a responsible employer, and a caring neighbour wherever it is 
represented around the world, because I firmly believe that following this path generates benefits that 
extend well beyond the obvious.

Outlook 
As we continue to grow our recurring revenue, it is clear that growth in the first half of the year has a 
far greater cumulative impact on the year’s total revenue number than growth in the latter part of a 
year. I’m therefore pleased to announce that whilst we don’t expect to see full contribution from our 
newly hired sales heads until Q2, our existing sales team have had a strong January and February and 
that trading is in line with expectations.

Revenue Growth in revenues, and particularly recurring revenues, 
demonstrates effective and targeted new customer 
acquisition and greater upsell and retention within 
existing customers. Quality and focus within service 
delivery and customer support, drives more efficient 
implementation, reduces churn and better customer 
satisfaction, all of which are revenue enhancing. 
£4.86m £6.87m 42% 
Gross Margin Strong gross margins within the Group’s operating units

partners.

Reducing operating losses show a strong commitment 
toward prudent cost management and ensuring that 
operating expense growth is contained to the minimum 
level required to support the Group’s growth and quality 
of customer experience objectives. For a SaaS business 
that is beginning to scale, operating cost growth will be 
much lower than revenue growth once the core 
infrastructure is built, although periods of investment in 
the business will take operating expenses higher as and 
when that investment takes place.

Losses and ultimately profits are reflective of policies 
focused on revenue growth, cost of sales efficiencies and 
operating expenditure containment. Depreciation, 
amortisation, financing costs, taxation and other one-

profitability.

(Outflow) 
from 
Operating 
Activities 
In maturing pre-profit SaaS businesses, cash outflows 
from operating activities, (sometimes referred to as cash 
burn) reduce as revenues outgrow operating costs. SaaS 
companies tend to see new customer acquisitions 
increase cash burn in the short-term as most customer 
acquisition costs are incurred before a new customer is 
implemented. Once implemented and billing, a customer 
will generate cash monthly, usually recovering the initial 
outflow in a 6-9-month period. Focus on maximising 
professional services income, delivery efficiencies and 
billing and credit management tools helps to reduce 
operating cash outflows. It should be noted, that periods 
of investment to facilitate further growth will temporarily 
increase cash burn in the short term.

Key Performance Indicators - Note 
The Board considers the key performance indicators (KPIs) identified above as key to understanding 
the performance of the business, and reports these KPIs externally as part of its half yearly updates. 
When calculating user numbers, the Group considers the receipt of a signed order for an ongoing 
subscription as a “sale”.  
Financial review  
Revenue 
Revenues grew by 42% from £4.9m to 
£6.9m in 2017  
The Group derives all its revenues from the 
provision of integrated communications software 
and services to customers in the UK, mainland 
Europe and North America. In 2017, the Group’s 
North American operation again delivered strong 
growth with revenues up 56% to £2.0m (from 
£1.3m in 2016). Notable also is the level of growth 
in revenues generated in mainland Europe, 
increasing 96% to £0.6m in 2017. With 87% of 
revenues that are either recurring or repeating in 
nature, recurring revenue from subscription 
services grew 55% in 2017 compared to the prior 
year. This strong top line and recurring revenue growth underpins the Board’s view that the strategy 
to focus on key CRM partnerships and industry verticals, larger mid-market customers and growth from 
within the existing customer bases continues to deliver positive results. On a constant currency basis, 
growth in revenue was 40%. 
Further analysis regarding revenues can be found in Note 5 to the financial statements. 
Gross margin 
Gross margin improved from 78.5% in 2016 to 80.0% 
The Group’s continued focus on delivering more value-adding network discovery, training and 
implementation services to our new customers, together with better partner management and more 
efficient procurement of upstream telecoms capacity has seen a further improvement in gross margin 
to 80% in 2017.  Cloudcall Group plc

Operating costs excluding depreciation, amortisation and share based 
payments 
Operating costs grew from £6.8m to 
£7.4m in 2017  
Growth in operating expenditure of 8% year-
on-year in the context of a 42% growth in 
revenues for the same period, continues to 
demonstrate the SaaS (Software as a Service) 
model whereby revenue growth outstrips 
operating expenditure growth, which can be 
held at a much lower level as the revenue 
generating assets are substantively in place 
and the business begins to scale. It is worth 
noting that periods of greater investment in the 
business designed to accelerate growth will 
naturally lead to greater operating expenditure 
and increased operating losses whilst that 
investment takes time to flow through to 
increased revenue. On a constant currency 
basis, growth in operating costs was 6%. 
Reported operating costs should be read in the context of a further £0.9m of costs incurred in the 
development of new products and services, and capitalised to the balance sheet under IAS 38 
accounting treatment. The adjusted operating cost including this expenditure would be £8.3m, an 
increase of 20% against the IAS 38 adjusted operating spend in 2016. The additional expenditure is 
reflective of the investment being made in the company, both in the run up to, and after, the fund-
raise event in October. 
EBITDA (loss) before share-based payments was £1.9m, down by 38% from £3.0m in 
2016. 
Research and development costs 
Development costs capitalised £0.91m (2016: £0.15m) 
Investment in the development of new and improved products and applications and the protection of 
the intellectual property of such development work is considered key to the further improvement of 
CloudCall’s competitive position. 
In Q3 2016, because of its improved internal systems and software development methodologies, the 
Group was able to begin capitalising software development costs as an intangible asset in accordance 
with the requirements of IAS 38. The proportion of research and development costs that can now be 
identified for capitalisation as a software asset increased throughout 2017, bringing the Group into line 
with its peers.  Cloudcall Group plc

Further to the adoption of IAS 38, the Group confirms that, as a result of new products coming into 
service during 2017, IAS 38 related amortisation charged in 2017 amounted to £35k (2016: £nil). 
Further details can be found in the ‘Principal risks and uncertainties’ section on pages 17 to 20, and 
Note 11 on intangibles. 
Debt and financing expenses 
The Company has no outstanding debt (2016: £0.9m) and a net financing expense of £73k 
(2016: £71k) 
On 12 July 2017, the Company announced that it had secured a new revolving loan facility (the 
“Facility”) with Barclays Bank, replacing its previous sterling term loan facility of £900,000 which was 
fully drawn and due for repayment in February 2018. 
The new Barclays revolving credit facility (“RCF” or the “Facility”) provides borrowing facilities of up to 
£1.85 million for a 3-year term. Interest is set at 7.45% above 3-month LIBOR rate for funds drawn. 
Funds can be drawn as required by the Company, typically for fixed periods of 3, 6 or 12 months. 
Interest is payable upon settlement of each tranche drawn. The Facility also incorporates a non-
utilisation fee whereby undrawn funds are charged at a rate of 2.98% per annum. The facility is secured 
over the assets of the Group. 
 
As at 31 December 2017 the Facility was fully undrawn. 
 
Because of the debt drawn down under the previous term loan during part of 2017, and the non-
utilisation charges incurred on the new revolving credit facility, the Group’s net financing expense 
increased marginally to £73k compared to £71k in 2016. 
Cash and working capital 
The Group had £4.9m net cash at the end of the year (2016: £3.2m).  
SaaS companies that deliver recurring revenue streams tend to see new customer acquisitions increase 
cash burn in the short-term as most customer acquisition costs are incurred before a new customer is 
live for billing. Once on-boarded and billing, a customer will generate cash monthly in line with the 
month in arrears billing terms, usually recovering the initial outflow in a 6 to 9 month period. It is for 
this reason, that SaaS companies looking to accelerate growth will typically accelerate cash-burn in the 
short-term whilst new customer acquisition is funded. 
The Group’s balance sheet includes an R&D tax credit receivable of £0.6m. As has been the case in 
recent years, this is expected to be received in cash in June or July 2018. 
Net cash absorbed by operating activities was £1.6m, down from £2.4m in 2016. This improvement 
should be considered in the context of the additional investment expenditure incurred during the year 
of £1.08m (2016: £0.24m). The Group continues to invest for future growth, and with the support of 
its shareholders, acknowledges that the execution of its strategy is likely to delay its expected break-
even date.   Cloudcall Group plc

Cloudcall Group plc 
Registered number: 05509873 
During 2017, the Group incurred £170k of capital expenditure other than intangibles, up from £96k in 
2016. Whilst the Group continues to leverage a greater proportion of web based service providers such 
as AWS to host some of its core technology services, capital expenditure is still expected to climb slightly 
over the coming year due to a planned relocation to a new larger office in Minsk, Belarus, and other 
planned equipment refreshes and resilience related activities. 
Share capital 
Total issued share capital at the year-end comprised 24,069,504 ordinary shares of 20 
pence each. 
In October 2017, the Company successfully raised new capital amounting to £5.7m (before fees and 
expenses) to allow the Group to capitalise on a number of near term growth initiatives, which the Board 
believe will generate further shareholder value. In addition to underpinning further growth, the 
additional funding further de-risks the Group’s strategy whilst simultaneously enabling the Group to 
accelerate its product development plans. 
This new capital raise was fulfilled by the issue of 3,963,000 new ordinary shares in the Company, at a 
price of 143.5 pence per share. The shares were issued in two tranches (October and December) to 
allow for processing the necessary EIS / VCT pre-assurance approval by HMRC. 
During the year, the Company also received new capital amounting to £38k in relation to exercised 
share options and warrants. 
Further details can be found in Note 20 (Equity Settled Share Based Payments). 
Earnings per share and dividends 
Loss per share for the year was 10 pence (2016: 20 pence). 
As the business continues to be in a pre-profit, high-growth, investment phase, the Board does not 
recommend the payment of a dividend (2016: nil). 
Going concern  
The Directors confirm that, as disclosed in Note 1 on page 44, they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For 
this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
The Group is exposed to several potential risks which may have a material effect on its reputation, 
financial or operational performance.  
The Board recognises that the nature and scope of risks can change, and it is not possible to identify 
or anticipate every risk that may affect the Group, or the materiality of that risk, however, the principal 
risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are set out below. The Board continually reviews the risks 
facing the Group, the controls in place to mitigate any potential adverse impacts and assurance sought 
to check that the controls are working effectively. 
Operational risks 
Key areas for on-going operational risk management are: 
 Revenues - The business remains in a high growth phase, but is still considered sub-scale and 
is therefore loss-making as it continues to invest resources to grow to a scale that generates 
an optimum balance of cash and shareholder returns. The prospects of the Group continue to 
be dependent upon the development of the revenue model, although this dependency reduces 
as monthly recurring and repeating revenues eventually grow to a sustainable level which is 
above the level of costs necessary to deliver and maintain an effective service, effectively 
creating a cash generative business, albeit with lower growth prospects.  Through the Group’s 
performance dashboards and internal reporting and review systems, the management team 
monitors incoming orders and customer account provisioning daily, while net recurring revenue 
growth is tracked and analysed regularly throughout each month. The Group keeps its pricing 
and sales commission models under constant review, and discounts and requests for credit 
notes and account cancellations are monitored and approved on a case by case basis. The 
Group operates an effective “At-risk” process for individual customers that may be experiencing 
issues, and will devote extensive resources to ensuring those customers remain satisfied and 
on board. 
 
 Business continuity – The Group is dependent on the efficient functioning of its internal 
systems, website and customer portals as well as accessibility to the wider internet 
infrastructure, key technology partner systems and assets on which they depend. Business 
disruption contingency plans are prepared and reviewed, and work continues to improve the 
resilience of our systems and core platform. Whilst the Group insures itself against potential 
significant business interruption, it would undoubtedly suffer significant reputational damage 
and lose a significant number of customers should such an event come to pass. 
 
 Staff retention and recruitment – given the importance of know-how, no individual has 
sole responsibility for any critical element of the Group’s business, albeit it is recognised that 
the loss of certain key personnel would clearly be disruptive to the business. The Group actively 
works to cross-skill resources wherever it identifies a single point of failure and continues to 
make progress in this regard. Staff retention is encouraged by a range of staff benefits including 
competitive salaries, variable pay schemes, share based incentive plans, health care, pensions, 
death in service benefits and excellent office locations, facilities and social events. Staff  Cloudcall Group plc 
2017 Annual Report and Financial Statements 
Strategic Report

Cloudcall Group plc 
Registered number: 05509873 
performance is regularly reviewed and training, mentoring, support and career development 
provided wherever necessary and appropriate. 
 
 Commercial partners (vendors) – the Group has partnerships and agreements with several 
third parties.  Whilst these partnerships are secured by contracts and in most cases alternative 
partners could be found in the short to medium term, a loss of support or disruption of service 
from any key partner could have a short term detrimental impact on CloudCall’s reputation and 
business. The Group’s policy is to ensure it only works with recognised industry leading 
technology partners with the appropriate resources to provide strong and resilient services with 
exceptional customer support. The Group continues to actively monitor its commercial partners, 
and works with them to ensure commercial, operational and geo-political risks are minimised. 
 
 Commercial partners (sales) – the Group has partnerships and agreements with several 
third-party CRM vendors.  Whilst these partnerships are secured by mutually beneficial 
agreements, underpinned by appropriate commission arrangements, there remains the risk 
that partner relationships could be terminated if alternative unified communications vendors 
secure exclusive arrangements with those CRM vendors, or if those CRM vendors elect to 
develop and provide their own integrated telephony solution. The Group also recognises the 
financial risks that exist should key partners chose to unilaterally change commercial terms on 
renewal of their contractual arrangements. The Group continues to actively monitor and 
strengthen its relationships with its commercial CRM partners, and works hard to ensure that 
those relationships are managed appropriately, mutually beneficial and that customer 
expectations are met and exceeded wherever possible. 
Political risks 
Given the recent political events such as the election of President Trump in the US, and the ongoing 
economic uncertainty of the Brexit negotiations in mainland Europe, the Group recognises that it is also 
at risk of financial, market or personnel losses because of political decisions or disruptions. Whilst the 
Group cannot necessarily quantify and negate these risks at this point in time, it is fully engaged in 
active conversations with all its stakeholders to ensure it has as much warning as possible of any 
potential impact to specific commercial arrangements. To date, the Group’s commercial activities are 
unaffected by both the Brexit issue, and the work to date of the Trump administration, barring the 
impact to the value of sterling as discussed in the currency risk section below. 
Financial risks 
The major financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk, market risk, currency risk, credit risk and 
interest rate risk. The Board regularly reviews these risks and approves policies covering overall risk 
limits and the use of financial instruments where appropriate to manage financial risk.

2017 Annual Report and Financial Statements 
Strategic Report

Cloudcall Group plc 
Registered number: 05509873 
Liquidity risk 
The key liquidity risk facing the Group continues to be the sufficiency of working capital to continue 
with its investment plans until cash break-even is reached.  The Board has detailed approved budgets, 
investment plans and rolling business forecasts, including cash flow projections, which it keeps under 
regular review, at least monthly, to ensure the adequacy of working capital at all times. Furthermore, 
in mitigation, the Board recognises that growth related expenditure can be turned off sufficiently quickly 
without necessarily impacting revenues in the short term, thereby reducing cash burn quickly and 
potentially returning the Group to cash positive operating relatively quickly. 
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has in place a revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank whereby 
Barclays has provided a revolving sterling credit facility in an amount of £1.85m (the "Facility"). Interest 
on any funds drawn down from the Facility, which is for a three-year term expiring in July 2020, is set 
at 7.45% above 3-month LIBOR. The Facility also incorporates a non-utilisation fee whereby undrawn 
funds are charged at a rate of 2.98% per annum. At 31 December 2017, the Facility remains undrawn. 
The Facility is secured over the assets of the Group. 
There is a debenture over all the assets of the group, and a cross guarantee in place in favour of 
Barclays Bank plc under which the Company’s subsidiaries undertake to repay any bank debt arising 
under the Facility should it be required.  
Market risks 
The market sector the Group operates in is competitive. The impact of competitors having more 
features, increased financial backing, better brand recognition and better global coverage increases the 
risk to the Group’s business model. 
The Group continues to grow revenues year-on year and is investing to deliver new product features, 
industry sector expertise, best-in-class customer support and service oﬀerings, enhanced brand 
recognition, best in class employee benefits, improved service delivery and global expansion to attract 
new customers and to protect its key employees from competitor approaches. 
Currency risk 
The greater part of the Group’s revenues and costs are denominated in sterling; however, the Group is 
exposed to foreign exchange risk, principally through balance sheet translation and cash flows incurred 
in US dollars by the Group’s US subsidiary as it continues to grow. The foreign exchange risk is partly 
addressed by matching income and costs denominated in US dollars monthly, although as the value of 
the inter-company payable between Cloudcall, Inc. and its parent Cloudcall Limited continues to grow, 
it becomes ever more sensitive to FX movements between USD and GBP on translation. Management 
closely monitors exchange rate fluctuations and will use forward contracts when considered appropriate 
to reduce this risk.

Credit risk 
The Group’s billing cycle ensures minimal credit risks as the clear majority of customers pay monthly 
via direct debit or recurring credit card authority which minimises the amount of credit outstanding. As 
our customers increase in size, there is more tendency for them to require monthly billing to account, 
which increases the risk of delayed payments and subsequent credit control activity. Each customer 
account has an individually assigned credit limit which, if breached, results in suspension of service 
until the account is paid or revised credit agreed.  There were no balances representing over 10% of 
the total trade receivables at the year end. As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s funds were held at 
Barclays Bank (“A-“ rated) as a condition of its ongoing credit facilities. 
Interest rate risk 
Under the revolving credit facility agreement with Barclays, dated 17 July 2017, the Group is exposed 
to interest rate risk such that a change in the UK base rate of interest will directly increase or decrease 
the interest payable on any funds drawn down under the terms of the Facility, although the Board notes 
that this impact is not expected to be material.

The Directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 
December 2017. 
Corporate governance 
Governance Statement 
The Company’s shares are listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. The Company is 
subject to the AIM Rules for Companies and consequently is not required to comply with the corporate 
governance provisions within the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). The Board 
acknowledges that whilst it does not currently fully comply with the Code, it does support the principles 
of good governance and it aims to comply with the Code to the extent that the Board considers it 
appropriate taking into account the Company’s size and stage of development. 
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness.  The processes to identify and manage the key risks of the Group are an integral part of 
the internal control environment.  Such processes, which are regularly reviewed and improved as 
necessary, include strategic planning, review and approval of annual budgets, regular monitoring of 
performance against budget (including full investigation of significant variances), control of capital 
expenditure, ensuring that proper accounting records are maintained, the appointment of senior 
management and the setting of high standards for health, safety and environmental performance.   
The effectiveness of the internal control system and procedures is monitored regularly by management, 
the results of which are reported to and considered by the Audit Committee.  The system of internal 
control comprises those controls established to provide assurance that the assets of the Group are 
safeguarded against unauthorised use or disposal and to ensure the maintenance of proper accounting 
records and the reliability of financial information used within the business or for publication.  Any 
system of internal control can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss, as it is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failing to achieve the 
business objectives of the Group. 
Relations with regulatory bodies 
The Group sets out to ensure that it is aware of, and take steps to comply with, relevant laws, policies, 
and regulations at all times. Where this is necessarily complex, such as in the field of telecoms 
compliance or international taxation, the Group will employ the services of specialist advisors to support 
it. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Company encourages two-way communications with all its shareholders and responds quickly to 
all requests or queries received. Communication is primarily through the Company’s website and the 
Annual General Meeting which shareholders are encouraged to attend and where participation is 
encouraged so that the Board may answer questions. All shareholders have at least twenty-one clear  Cloudcall Group plc

days’ notice of the Annual General Meeting. All shareholders will receive a copy of the Annual Report 
(electronic or hard copy depending on shareholder preference) and an interim report at the half year 
will be available on the Company’s website.  
In addition, the Company delivers its Annual and Interim results via a webinar which is open to all 
shareholders. 
A copy of the Company’s latest investor presentation can be located on the Rule 26 page which can be 
found in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website www.cloudcall.com/investor/rule26/. 
Corporate social responsibility 
The Group strives to ensure that its business activities positively benefit all stakeholders by committing 
to conduct its business in a fair and responsible manner, to treat its employees fairly, supporting 
personal growth and development, and to have a positive impact in its local community. 
Customers 
The Group strongly values its customers and seeks to deliver a world-class product backed by class-
leading customer service and support. The Group routinely seeks customer feedback and performance 
appraisal inputs, and takes active steps to remedy any instances of customer dissatisfaction.  
Key customers are also routinely invited to provide product improvement inputs, and in some cases to 
test key features or functionality prior to general release. 
The Group commits to provide a fair and transparent pricing structure so that customers can be 
confident that the Group’s core software and telephony services are providing cost effective integrated 
communications. 
Employees 
The Group is an Equal Opportunity Employer and its policy is to ensure that all employees and job 
applicants will be given equal opportunities in all aspects of employment and training irrespective of 
their gender, ethnic origin, disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation or religious affiliation. 
Cloudcall encourages, where possible, the employment of disabled people and the retention of those 
who become disabled during their employment with the Group. 
The Group recognises the benefit of involving employees in target setting and keeping employees 
informed of progress.  Due to the size of the Group, regular consultations with senior management 
take place.  The views of employees are considered when making decisions which are likely to affect 
their interests. 
Communities 
The Group participates in various charitable activities in the communities in which it operates. Whilst it 
is not Group policy to make direct financial contributions to charities, Group employees are actively 
encouraged to take two additional paid leave days each and donate them for the support of charitable 
projects in the community. The Group partners with “Leicester Cares” and “Boston Cares”, who act as 
facilitators for these activities.  Cloudcall Group plc

Management incentive plan 
During 2017, the Board’s Remuneration Committee put forward a new Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
(the “Plan”) for the Executive Directors, that clearly aligns the interests and resulting remuneration of 
the executive management team with the creation of shareholder value. The Plan was formally 
approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 22 May 2017, and was fully executed with 
effect from 31 August 2017. 
The new Plan provides for awards of a new class of shares in Cloudcall Limited to eligible executives.  
The value of those shares is based on performance of Company share price and number of end-user 
targets. The Company may buy back the new Plan shares using Cloudcall Group Plc shares or with cash. 
If targets are satisfied on a sliding scale from the lower to upper thresholds, the maximum potential 
Company shares available are set out below.

of that information.   Cloudcall Group plc

Annual General Meeting 
The Annual General Meeting of the Group will take place on Monday 21 May 2018 at 11.00 am at the 
offices of Cloudcall Group plc, 1 Colton Square, Leicester LE1 1QH.  
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities    
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the Group 
and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for 
each financial year. As required by the AIM rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and have elected 
under company law to prepare the Parent Company financial statements on the same basis. 
The financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the 
financial position of the Group and the Company and the financial performance of the Group. The 
Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant 
part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a 
fair presentation. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU: and 
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue in business. 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Group and Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Cloudcall 
Group plc 
 
Opinion 
 
We have audited the financial statements of Cloudcall Group plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries 
(the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, Consolidated and Company Statements of Financial Position, Consolidated and 
Company Statements of Changes in Equity, Consolidated and Company Statements of Cash Flows and 
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
In our opinion:  
 
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended; 
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; 
 the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and 
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
 
Basis for opinion 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and 
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of 
the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to SME listed entities and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Conclusions relating to going concern 
 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require 
us to report to you where: 
 
 the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or 
 the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties 
that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the Company’s ability to continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date 
when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Key audit matters 
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had 
the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. 
 
Revenue recognition – We focused on the recognition of revenue as the timing of revenue recognition 
and its presentation in the statement of comprehensive income is subject to inherent complexities in 
the software industry. We considered the controls over the recognition of revenue and whether these 
continued to be appropriate and consistently applied.  We performed controls testing, cut-off testing 
and substantive analytical review procedures to validate the recognition of revenue throughout the 
year. We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s revenue recognition accounting policy given in 
Note 1. 
 
Development costs - We focused on the capitalisation of development costs due to its impact on 
reported earnings and the judgements involved in assessing whether the IAS 38 criteria for 
capitalisation have been suitably met.   We reconfirmed our understanding of management’s basis for 
capitalising development costs and reviewed whether the costs had been appropriately capitalised in 
accordance with IAS 38. Our procedures included an assessment over the appropriateness of any 
management judgements including the future expected economic benefit of capitalised projects and 
substantive testing of the costs capitalised. We also assessed the reasonableness of the amortisation 
policies in place, potential impairment and the level of taxation credits recognised for eligible 
expenditure. 
 
Our application of materiality 
 
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we set certain thresholds which help us to determine the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effects of misstatements, both 
individually and on the financial statements as a whole. During planning we determined a magnitude 
of uncorrected misstatements that we judge would be material for the financial statements as a whole 
(FSM). During planning FSM was calculated as £160,000, which was not changed during the course of 
our audit. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all unadjusted differences 
in excess of £5,000, as well as differences below those thresholds that, in our view, warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds. 
 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
 
Our Group audit approach focused on the Company and the two key trading subsidiaries, one based in 
the UK and one in the US. The UK entities are subject to a local statutory audit completed to the Group 
reporting timetable. The US entity is not subject to local statutory audit and has been subject to full 
scope audit to Group materiality. The US entity audit was undertaken by the same team as the UK 
statutory audits. 
 
These audits covered 100% of Group revenue, 89% of Group loss before tax and 99% of Group total 
assets.

Other information 
 
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard. 
 
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
 
 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. 
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic 
Report or the Directors’ Report. 
 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 
2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
 the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
 
Responsibilities of directors 
 
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on pages 32 and 33, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.

2017 Annual Report and Financial Statements

Cloudcall Group plc 
Registered number: 05509873 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate 
the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these financial statements. 
 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at: http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditor’s report. 
 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 
16 of the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
1. Accounting policies 
 
Accounting convention and basis of preparation 
 
Cloudcall Group plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England 
& Wales. The address of the registered office is 1 Colton Square, Colton Street, Leicester LE1 1QH. The 
Company and its subsidiaries are referred to as ‘the Group’. The Group’s principal activity is to provide 
products and services designed to enable organisations to use their communications more effectively. 
The ordinary shares of the Company are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. 
 
The consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Group. The Company financial 
statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.  
 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union, and IFRIC interpretations applicable as at 31 
December 2017 and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to those companies 
reporting under IFRS. 
 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. The results are presented in round 
thousands of pounds unless otherwise noted.  
 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all 
periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. 
 
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant 
effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the 
next year, are discussed in Note 3. 
 
Going concern 
 
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
 
The Group made a loss of £2,012k (2016: £3,011k) in the year ended 31 December 2017. As at 31 
December 2017 the Group had cash reserves of £4,872k (2016: £3,169k) which have increased 
following a successful placement in the year. 
 
The Directors have prepared projections covering two years. Such forward looking projections are 
inevitably subjective and sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions and the Directors have 
sensitised these projections accordingly, in particular to factor in a delay in the growth of revenue.  
These projections, as sensitised, indicate that, based on the assumptions underlying the projections, 
sufficient working capital will be available to settle liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from 
the date of approving these accounts.  
 
The Directors remain confident in their assertion that the current trajectory of the Group’s sales income, 
combined with expense restraint, existing cash at bank, and other expected cash inflows, is enough to 
deliver the Group to cash break-even without the need to raise further funds. However, the Group also 
negotiated a £1.85m revolving credit facility with Barclays until July 2020 which is currently unutilised.  Cloudcall Group plc 
2017 Annual Report and Financial Statements 
Financial Statements

Cloudcall Group plc 
Registered number: 05509873 
This, together with a successful track record in raising new capital, are key factors in providing further 
comfort that the Group will have sufficient access to the funding it needs to execute its strategy and 
meet its financial commitments. 
 
For these reasons, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial 
statements.  
 
Basis of consolidation 
 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiary undertakings. The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date that the Group obtains control until the date that control ceases. 
 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. 
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured as the fair value of the assets given, 
equity instruments issued, contingent consideration and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of 
exchange. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured 
at fair value at the acquisition date. 
 
Revenue 
 
Revenues represent the amounts (excluding value added tax) derived from the provision of goods and 
services to customers during the period. Revenues from monthly call charges and subscriptions are 
billed at the end of the month and recognised at that point in time. 
 
Revenue from set-up costs and other up-front delivery services is recognised as the services are 
provided, based on the actual services delivered at the period end as a proportion of the total services 
to be delivered. 
 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in profit or loss when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred to the buyer. No revenue is recognised if there are significant 
uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of 
goods. 
 
Foreign currency 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities 
at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated at the rate at the reporting 
date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  
 
The functional currency of the Group is Sterling. Exchange differences arising from the translation of 
foreign operations are taken directly to the balance sheet translation reserve. 
 
Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, 
the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form 
part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation 
reserve.   Cloudcall Group plc

Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group 
 
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only 
to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:  
 
 they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to 
deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with 
another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company (or Group); 
and  
 
 where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is 
either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the 
Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity 
instruments. 
 
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. 
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts 
presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude 
amounts in relation to those shares.  
 
Where a financial instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists these 
components are separated and accounted for individually under the above policy. 
 
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance 
payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are 
recorded directly in equity. 
 
Non-derivative financial instruments 
 
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other 
receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. The Group does not have bank 
overdraft facilities.  
 
Investments 
 
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less any impairment provisions in the Statement of 
Financial Position. They are tested for impairment when there is objective evidence of impairment. Any 
impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss in the period they occur. 
 
Property, plant and equipment 
 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
 
Depreciation is charged to profit or loss to write off the cost, less any estimated residual values, on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets concerned.   Cloudcall Group plc 
2017 Annual Report and Financial Statements 
Financial Statements  
 
47 
 
Cloudcall Group plc 
Registered number: 05509873 
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
 
Technical plant and equipment  2 - 10 years 
Office and business equipment  2 - 10 years 
 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.  
 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any indication exists, 
the carrying values are written down to the recoverable amount. 
 
Intangible assets and goodwill 
 
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents the 
difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.  
 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-
generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. 
 
The Group assesses the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisitions. These include intellectual 
property arising from software development. An intangible asset will be recognised if the asset is 
identifiable and its fair value can be measured reliably. An intangible asset is identifiable if it is separable 
or if it was obtained through contractual or legal rights. Amortisation is provided on the fair value of 
the asset and is calculated on a straight-line basis over its useful life. All intangible assets except 
goodwill are amortised. 
 
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if, and 
only if, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends to 
complete the intangible to use or sell, it is probable the intangible asset will generate future economic 
benefit, the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured 
reliably and the Group has the technical ability and sufficient resources to complete development. 
Development activities involve a plan or design to produce new or substantially improved products or 
processes. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate 
proportion of direct overheads. Other development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as an 
expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses.  
 
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses.  
 
Amortisation 
 
Amortisation is charged to operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of intangible assets from the date they are available for use.  
 
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
 
Acquired IPR    5 years  
Capitalised development costs  5 years 
Software    3 years

Cloudcall Group plc 
Registered number: 05509873 
Trade and other receivables 
 
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method less any impairment provision. An impairment provision is made 
against a trade receivable only when there is objective evidence that the Group may not be able to 
recover the whole invoiced amount as a result of events occurring after the initial recognition of the 
asset.  
 
Inventories 
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the weighted 
average principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to 
their existing location and condition. 
 
Impairment 
 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated.  
 
For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is 
estimated at each reporting date. 
 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit 
exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses 
recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other 
assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of 
assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets 
or groups of assets. 
 
Reversals of impairment 
 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.  
 
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the 
impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the recoverable amount. 
 
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised. Such a reversal is recognised in profit or loss.

Employee benefits 
 
Share-based payment transactions 
 
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value on 
the date they are granted. Where there are no market conditions attaching to the exercise of the 
options, the fair value is determined using a range of inputs into the Black-Scholes pricing model. Where 
there are market conditions attaching to the exercise of the options a Monte Carlo option pricing model 
is used to determine fair value based on a range of inputs.  The fair value of equity-settled transactions 
is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period in which the service conditions 
are fulfilled with a corresponding credit to a share-based payments reserve in equity. 
 
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are 
expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. It recognises the 
impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to 
equity. 
 
On the exercise of share options, an amount equal to the fair value of the option at the date it was 
granted is transferred from the share-based payments reserve into retained earnings. 
 
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it 
recognises, in its individual financial statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries 
equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its consolidated financial 
statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.  
 
Retirement benefits 
 
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for certain employees. The assets of the 
scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. Contributions 
are charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they become payable. 
 
Trade and other payables 
 
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. After initial recognition, they are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
 
Operating lease payments 
 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in profit or loss as an integral part of the 
total lease expense. 
 
Net financing costs 
 
Net financing costs comprise interest payable and interest receivable on funds invested. Interest income 
and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Taxation 
 
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or 
loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity. 
 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous 
periods. Tax credits for research and development expenditure are recognised in the year to which they 
arise as the Group has established a pattern of claims. 
 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation 
or settlement of the carrying value of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date. 
 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will 
be available against which the asset can be utilised.  
 
2. Changes to accounting policies and disclosures 
 
There are no new standards or amendments to standards which are mandatory for the first time for 
the financial year which had a significant impact on the Group. 
 
IFRSs issued but not yet effective 
 
The following future changes are considered the most significant to the Group: 
 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, effective for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2018. Management 
expects this standard to not have a material impact although some additional disclosure will arise. 
 
IFRS 16 Leases, effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. Management expects 
this standard to have an impact on the Group financial statements when it is adopted. At 31 December 
2017, the Group had total minimum lease payments of £2,034k on leases extending beyond 12 months, 
which would need to be recognised in the Statement of Financial Position. 
 
IFRS 15 Revenue from customer contracts, is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018.  The standard will be adopted by the Group for the first time in the year ending 31 December 
2018.  The standard permits a choice of two possible transition methods for the initial application of 
the requirements of the new standard: (1) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in 
accordance with IAS 8 (Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors), or (2) 
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised on the date of 
initial application, being 1 January 2018 for the Group (the "cumulative catch-up" approach). The Group 
currently has not selected the transition method for applying the new standard.

The adoption of IFRS 15 will not alter the total contract value or timing of cashflows, but there are two 
key areas where the adoption of IFRS 15 will change current revenue recognition:   
 
Technical installation and set up fees 
Under current accounting policies, revenue from technical installation and set up fees are recognised 
up-front at the point of delivery.  Under IFRS 15, technical installation, and set up services do not meet 
the criteria to be a distinct performance obligation.  The fees associated with these services will thus 
be combined with other services in the contract and recognised over the contract term.  This will result 
in a reduction of revenue previously recognised, an increase in deferred income and an increase in 
monthly recurring revenue going forward.    
 
Contract fulfilment assets 
The costs associated with the set up and installation of the technology platform for each contract have 
previously been expensed to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.  Under IFRS 15, 
these costs will be capitalised as contract fulfilment assets, within trade and other receivables, and 
amortised over the life of the contract.   
 
The Directors have concluded that although there will be a deferral of both revenue and costs in relation 
to set up and technical installation services, the impact on profit or loss is expected to be immaterial. 
 
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
 
The following accounting judgements and estimates have been made by the Directors in interpreting 
treatment of amounts included in these financial statements in accordance with IFRSs. 
 
Development costs 
 
Management judgement is required in assessing the fair value of development costs capitalised 
including the future economic benefit expected to be generated by the assets and in calculating the 
attributable costs. Management judgement is also required in assessing the useful economic lives of 
these assets for the purposes of amortisation. The carrying value of development costs at the Statement 
of Financial Position date was £1,020,000. 
 
Impairment 
 
The requirement for the Directors to ensure that the Group and Company’s assets are not carried at 
more than their recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use) 
is covered by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. The fair values in respect of the valuation of the Group and 
Company’s assets in relation to the future value of the returns those assets are predicted to generate 
have been estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions used as inputs to the model 
are by their nature areas of judgement (see Note 11). Based on the historic sales performance of the 
business and actions being taken to grow the business further, the directors do not currently assess 
any of these assets as impaired. The carrying value of intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment at the Statement of Financial Position date was £1,359,000 and £281,000 respectively.

Share based payments 
 
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair 
value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. Judgement is required in 
determining the most appropriate valuation model and the most appropriate inputs into the model 
including the level of volatility and the expected life of the option. Further information is given in Note 
20. 
 
4. Financial Risk Management 
 
The major financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk, currency risk, credit risk and interest rate 
risk. Further information about the Group’s approach to the management of these risks can be found 
in the Strategic Report Risk Management section on pages 17-20. 
 
Capital management 
 
The Company will raise additional funds as and when required subject to market conditions and 
availability and having due regard to the prevailing equity price and dilution effect when considering 
any equity placing. Typically, where available, debt will be used for shorter term financing requirements 
with equity favoured for the longer-term financing needs of the Group. 
 
The Board is keen that employees are interested in the Company’s growth and as such they are 
encouraged to hold shares in the Company through participation in the Cloudcall Group plc. 2011 Share 
Option Plan. The number of Ordinary Shares which may be utilised within any 10-year period under the 
Share Option Plan and under any other discretionary/executive share option plans established by the 
Company shall not normally exceed 10% of the issued Ordinary Share Capital of the Company from 
time to time.  
 
Currently the Group has £1.85m of agreed but unutilised external borrowings through a loan agreement 
with Barclays, the terms of which are described more fully on page 15 within the Financial Review (as 
part of the Strategic Review), and working capital is currently funded from equity.  
 
As a condition of its loan facilities with Barclays, the Group is required to maintain a cash balance that 
is not less than £500,000.  
 
The Group has no plans to make dividend payments.

Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 
2020 was enacted in September 2016. The impact of this change on the Group's financial statements 
is not significant as it has no recognised tax liabilities or assets, whether deferred or current, at the 
year end.

The acquired IPR arose on the acquisition of Cloudcall Limited and represents the fair value of the 
proprietary software developed within Cloudcall.  
 
The carrying amount of ongoing development projects on which amortisation has not yet commenced 
was £550k (2016: £145k). The weighted average remaining amortisation period for software and 
websites is 4.8 years (2016: 5 years). 
 
The Company has no intangible assets.

Goodwill 
 
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Cloudcall Limited and represents the excess of the initial and 
contingent consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired. 
 
The goodwill was tested for impairment at 31 December 2017 by comparing the carrying value of the 
cash-generating unit with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount was determined using a 
value in use methodology based on discounted cash flow projections. The key assumptions used in the 
value in use calculations were as follows: 
 
The operating cash flows of the business for the two years to 31 December 2019 were taken from the 
plan approved by the Board which is closely linked with recent historical performance and current sales 
opportunities;  
 
Growth in operating cash flows of 2.4% has been assumed for the remainder of the value in use 
calculation period; 
 
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% has been used; 
 
Based on the above assumptions, over a 10-year projection period, the recoverable amount of the CGU 
based on value in use is estimated to exceed the carrying amount by £21,424k (2016: £11,687k). 
Future annual operating cash inflows, which are most sensitive to the level of new business sales, would 
need to be consistently 16% below the growth assumption used in the value in use calculation over a 
10-year projection period to cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. Based on 
the historic sales performance of the business and actions being taken to grow the business further, 
the directors do not currently expect this to be the case.

Recognised deferred tax liabilities 
 
Deferred tax in respect of the timing difference arising on the recognition of software development

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the cumulative losses of the Company or the 
Group in relation to unrelieved trading losses or temporary differences on share based payments, 
accelerated capital allowances and intangible assets as, in accordance with IAS 12, there is at present 
insufficient evidence that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the near future to recover the 
assets. This is due to the early stage of commercialisation of product and the position will be reviewed 
each year. The amount not recognised is £2.2m (2016: £2.4m). The Group did not recognise deferred 
tax in respect of:

19. Bank Loan 
 
On 17 February 2016, the Company agreed a £900,000 loan facility with Barclays Bank (the "Loan"). 
Interest on the Loan, which was for a fixed two-year term expiring in March 2018, was set at 8.7% 
above base rate and was payable quarterly. Repayment was by a single repayment of the principal in 
full on the final repayment date in March 2018. The loan was repaid in full in September 2017. 
 
On 11 July 2017, the Company agreed a revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank for an amount of 
£1.85m which expires on 11 July 2020. Interest is set at 7.45% above base rate and the non-utilisation 
fee is set at 2.98%. 
 
There is a debenture over all the assets of the Group, and a cross guarantee in place in favour of 
Barclays Bank plc under which the Company’s subsidiaries undertook to repay the bank debt should it 
be required.  
 
20. Equity settled share based payments 
 
The employee option scheme shares in existence in the year resulted in a total share based payments 
charge of £140k (2016: £116k) for the Group in the year and a charge of £39k (2016: £6k) for the 
Company in the year. 
 
Cloudcall Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan 
 
On 31 August 2017, the Group set up a Long Term Incentive Plan to which four senior employees were 
issued with 36 B shares in the capital of Cloudcall Limited, representing 1.2% of the Company’s share 
capital. Holders of the B shares are entitled to participate in any return of capital if certain targets are 
met by the Group. A capital return to B shareholders is possible in the event of a sale of shares, 
liquidation or reduction of capital, share buy back, dissolution or winding up. 
 
The B shares can be “put” to the Group after the end of a vesting period which runs for four years after 
31 August 2017 if certain targets are met. The minimum target is for the average mid-market closing 
price of the 20p ordinary share of the Company for the 90 days prior to 31 August 2021 to equal or 
exceed £2.50 and during the month prior to 31 August 2021, the number of active users must equal or 
exceed 40,000. The return to the B shareholders is calculated on a pro-rata basis based on the terms 
included in the Articles of Association of Cloudcall Limited. The B shares can also be “put” to the Group 
if an offer has been made to acquire a controlling interest in the Group. If the put option is exercised, 
a B shareholder obliges the Group to buy the B shares in return for cash or shares in the Group. The 
form of consideration is at the discretion of the Group. All B shares will convert automatically to Deferred 
shares on the fifth anniversary of the issue. The Deferred shares will carry no voting rights or dividend 
rights and have no economic value. 
 
Set out below is the number of shares which each of the senior employs received on the Award Date:

The fair value of the B shares issued was calculated using the Monte Carlo model with the following 
assumptions: 
 
 Date of grant – 31 August 2017 
 Share price at grant - £1.135 
            Date of put option exercise – 31 August 2021 
  Expected volatility – 49.3% 
  Expected dividend yield – 0.0% 
  Risk free interest rate – 0.3% 
  Percentage employees expected to stay over the life of the plan – 100% 
 Estimated number of active users at exercise date – 50,000 
 
The expected volatility is based upon the historic volatility of the Company’s share price over the 4 
year period to on 31 August 2017. 
 
The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company historically not paying a dividend. 
 
The risk free rate is based on a zero-coupon UK government bond as at 31 August 2017. 
 
This resulted in a charge of £30k for the Company and the Group in the year. 
 
Cloudcall Group plc 2011 Share Option Plan 
 
The Company operates the Cloudcall Group plc 2011 Share Option Plan. The number of Ordinary Shares 
which may be utilised within any 10-year period under the Share Option Plan and under any other 
discretionary/executive share option plans established by the Company shall not normally exceed 10% 
of the issued Ordinary Share Capital of the Company from time to time. The principal terms are 
summarised below: 
 
Options to subscribe for Ordinary Shares of the Company may be granted (at the discretion of the 
Board or the Remuneration Committee of the Board) to selected employees or Directors of or 
consultants to the Group. 
 
The options granted in June 2011 vest 1/3 on the expiry of 12 months from the date of grant. 
Thereafter, an equal percentage of the options vest each month until the expiry of three years from 
the date of grant when 100 per cent of the options will have vested. 
 
All other options will vest 25 per cent on the expiry of 12 months from the date of grant. Thereafter, 
an equal percentage of the options will vest each month until the expiry of three years from the date 
of grant when 100 per cent of the options will have vested. 
 
All options are equity settled by physical delivery of shares. 
 
Options lapse 3 months after leaving employment if not exercised.

The options outstanding at the year-end have an exercise price in the range of 80 to 300 pence and a 
weighted average contractual life of 8.0 years. 
 
The fair value of options granted was measured using a Black-Scholes share option valuation model 
and using the following assumptions as inputs: 
 
 Expected options life – 5 years 
 Expected dividend rate - nil 
 Risk free interest rate – 1.5%-2.5% 
 Expected volatility – 73-147% 
 %-age employees expected to stay over the life of the plan – 70% 
 
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility up to the date of grant, adjusted for any 
expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information. 
 
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.

22. Earnings per share 
 
Basic earnings per share 
 
The calculation of basic loss per share at 31 December 2017 of 9.8 pence (2016: 19.5 pence) was 
based on the loss for the year attributable to owners of the parent of £2,012k (2016: £3,011k) and a 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the period of 20,638,000 (2016: 
15,423,000), calculated as follows:

Diluted earnings per share 
 
The weighted average number of shares and the loss for the year for the purposes of calculating diluted 
earnings per share are the same as for the basic loss per share calculation. This is because the 
outstanding share options would have the effect of reducing the loss per share and would not, 
therefore, be dilutive under the terms of IAS 33. 
 
23. Financial instruments 
 
Exposure to currency and credit risk arises in the normal course of business.  
 
Qualitative disclosures in respect of the nature and extent of the Group’s and Company’s exposure to 
risks arising from financial instruments along with the methods used to measure the risks and the 
objectives, policies and processes employed for managing the exposure are described in Note 4. 
 
Credit risk 
 
The carrying value of financial assets at the reporting date represents the maximum credit exposure. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:

No collateral or security is held in relation to amounts shown within trade and other receivables. There 
is little significant concentration of credit risk by customer and geography and the Group considers the 
possibility of significant loss in the event of non-performance by a commercial counterparty to be 
unlikely.

The Group and Company invest surplus cash in short term money market or deposit accounts to achieve 
the highest possible interest rates, but having regard to the credit rating of the banking institutions and 
the currencies required by the Group. The Group has in place a revolving credit arrangement with 
Barclays, details of which can be found within the Strategic Review on page 15. 
 
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments 
 
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) 
equity and profit or loss by an amount which is deemed to be immaterial.  
 
Foreign currency risk 
 
The Group undertakes operations using £ sterling and US dollars. Exchange differences arising on the 
settlement of invoices are taken to profit or loss as incurred. Exchange gains or losses on the 
retranslation of monetary items at the reporting date are also taken to profit or loss. 
 
Most of the Group’s inter-company debt is denominated in Sterling (between Cloudcall Group plc and 
Cloudcall Limited), however, there exists an inter-company debt of £3,430k (2016: £2,657k) payable 
by Cloudcall, Inc. to Cloudcall Limited. Over the course of the year, the movement of GBP to USD FX 
rates has resulted in a charge to the operating statement of £84k (2016: £76k credit) and a credit to 
other comprehensive income of £276k (2016: £73k charge). 
 
Fair values 
 
Due to the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities it is considered that the carrying amount equals 
fair value.
