‘It was an interesting and challenging 
year in terms of global news flow, 
especially in the political and 
regulatory sphere, but the year turned 
out to be one of the least volatile in 
financial markets for decades. Against 
this backdrop I am pleased that IG 
once again delivered record revenue 
and profits.’

|  IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017 4 IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017  |
The business made good strategic progress, commencing the 
rollout of an entirely new trading platform, establishing its limited 
risk trading account globally, further developing its international 
offices and launching an exciting new low-cost passive investment 
product in the UK.
Of course, the changing face of regulation is dominating the 
backdrop for IG’s core product at the moment. The regulatory 
situation is in a state of flux, and it could take some time for clarity 
to be available in all markets. I am, however, pleased that the 
management and the entire IG team have continued to concentrate 
on developing the business, while engaging constructively with 
regulators and innovating to further improve client outcomes.
The recent increase in regulatory concerns around retail leveraged 
trading is perhaps no surprise. Like any growing profitable industry, 
competition has increased in recent years. Unfortunately a number 
of these competitors have been taking a very short-term approach 
to this market and have been targeting inappropriate clients. 
It is clear to me and the Board that IG is not the main target of 
the regulators’ concerns. IG has always sought to operate to the 
highest standards, and we are determined to assist regulators to 
remove poor providers from our market and to improve consumer 
outcomes. I also do not believe that the product itself is at the heart 
of regulators’ concerns – this is primarily about the mis-selling of the 
product by certain providers, either through unrealistic claims or by 
targeting consumers for whom the product is inappropriate.
We have a clear vision at IG: to be a global leader in retail trading 
and investments. As a Board, we are concentrating on developing 
a culture that drives behaviour focused on fair client outcomes, 
and on the creation of a growing, sustainable business. Therefore, 
we recently refreshed the values of the Group, to ensure all of our 
people understand what binds the Company together and what has 
been at the heart of our success over many years. IG’s growth has 
always been based on putting the customer first. We express our 
values as:
• Champion the client
• Lead the way
• Love what we do
By staying true to these values, I believe the Company will emerge 
from the current uncertainty in an even stronger position within 
its core industry and as a credible insurgent within the broader 
investments space.
Board
As previously communicated, Paul Mainwaring joined as CFO 
designate on 11 July 2016 and was appointed to the Board on  
20 July 2016. In September, Sam Tymms was appointed as Chairman 
of the Board Risk Committee, replacing Stephen Hill, who remains a 
member of the Committee.
The intention again this year is to put every Board Director up for 
re-election at the AGM, in compliance with paragraph B.7.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Remuneration
We seek to maintain a remuneration structure which creates a 
balance between rewarding performance against annual objectives 
and the delivery of long-term stakeholder value. Last year we 
carried out a series of adjustments across the organisation to 
ensure we can continue to motivate, recruit and retain high-quality 
people at all levels to deliver against our short-term and long-term 
priorities. This year we reviewed the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy and concluded that it continues to meet the needs of 
the Company. The sharp share price fall on 6 December 2016, 
following the publication of the FCA’s industry consultation, 
impacted the Total Shareholder Return element of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration; this fall reflected shareholder concerns 
about the future prospects of the business. We will keep the Policy 
under review as we receive increased clarity around the external 
environment in which the Company is operating.
Dividend
In line with the previously stated intention to pay out, as an ordinary 
dividend, approximately 70% of the Group’s annual earnings, the 
Board is recommending a final dividend of 22.88 pence per share, 
taking the full-year dividend to 32.3 pence per share, 2.9% ahead of 
the prior year.
IG’s people
The regulatory uncertainty during this year has created a difficult 
backdrop for our people. During this time, we have also further 
developed our global resourcing model and now have substantial 
operations in Krakow and Bangalore. The Board is clear that our 
people remain our greatest asset, and that it is their dedication and 
pride in our Company that have delivered another record year for this 
business. On behalf of the Board, I want to thank them sincerely for 
their ongoing efforts.
Looking forward
The industry is in a period of relative uncertainty. IG has a great track 
record of innovating to lead the industry in operating standards and 
developing our business to reflect a changing regulatory landscape. 
Our excellence in technology and our people’s unswerving 
commitment to fair client outcomes will serve us well as the 
uncertainty clears, and I believe that IG will come out of this period 
as an even stronger player.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
In my third year as Chairman of IG, I am pleased to report that the Company delivered 
another year of strong growth, leading to record revenue and profits, in a relatively quiet 
period for financial markets.

OUR BUSINESS
INTRODUCING IG
IG exists to empower informed, decisive, adventurous people to access opportunities in financial markets. As a global leader in online 
trading and an established member of the FTSE 250, we have a 43-year heritage.
We’re the No.1 provider of CFDs and spread betting worldwide
(1)
, with offices located in 15 countries and operations in a further two. 
Operating globally under the IG brand, and in the US as Nadex, we’re the trusted platform provider for over 185,000 clients.
Our suite of products provides efficient, flexible access to more 
than 15,000 financial markets for a broad spectrum of financially 
sophisticated consumers, ranging from active traders to retail 
investors. Using our cutting-edge platforms and apps, our clients 
place almost 8 million transactions a month with us.

A HISTORY OF  
CREATING SOLUTIONS 
Innovation has been at the heart of our business since we began life 
in 1974. As the UK’s original financial spread betting provider, we 
introduced a completely new, accessible way for people to trade on 
gold – by defining it as an index.
Over subsequent years, we went on to expand the product set and 
create increasingly advanced technology to support our clients’ 
trading needs. Our innovations have included the first online 
dealing platform for financial spread betting in 1998 and the 
first trading app for Apple Watch in 2015. This year we delivered 
a completely new trading platform that is beginning to greatly 
enhance the trading experience for our clients. An intuitive, 
customisable interface offers straightforward functionality for 
the less-experienced trader, while those with more demanding 
requirements have access to a range of advanced functions. 
Technology has also enabled us to continually refine our marketing 
techniques. As we discuss in more detail later, we’re now able to 
produce highly targeted advertising campaigns that introduce our 
products to the people they are most likely to suit. A sophisticated 
application and onboarding process then ensures that only 
appropriate clients proceed – gaining access to the products and 
educational materials that fit their objectives, knowledge and 
capital resources.
Over the years, we’ve evolved and broadened our product  
offering to meet the changing needs of traders and investors, 
and it’s now supported by an extensive range of tools and 
resources to help our clients. From teaching essential trading and 
risk-management techniques to providing market insight and alerts 
about upcoming economic events, our educational and news 
services draw on four decades of experience to help people trade 
and invest more effectively. 
Our operating model and risk management strategy have been 
thoroughly tested over time, and have proved highly resilient in 
a wide range of real-life scenarios. Our business has continuously 
adapted to a changing economic backdrop, and we remain agile 
and innovative in the face of an uncertain regulatory landscape, as 
we look to the next phase of our growth.
OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS
We have sales offices across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and the US, and our expertise in online marketing, search 
engine optimisation and multi-language client service has enabled us to extend our reach into countries where we have no physical 
presence. Using a centralised marketing strategy, we connect with clients in 156 countries – efficiently and cost-effectively. 
Our UK headquarters in the City of London is supported by two major operational hubs in Krakow, Poland, and Bangalore, India. These are 
positioned to take advantage of local pools of talent in a variety of disciplines.

Smart Portfolios
Launched in April 2017 in partnership with BlackRock,  
IG Smart Portfolios is a discretionary managed investment 
service. By offering low costs and full transparency on total cost 
of ownership, we are industry-leading. Clients have a fully online 
experience – supported by our customer services team if needed 
– with access to an elegant and intuitive platform, where their 
investments and all the costs of ownership are clearly visible.
We offer a range of portfolios designed to suit different risk 
appetites, each constructed from iShares exchange traded 
funds (ETFs) and including a blend of commodities, equities and 
fixed-income assets designed to match the degree of caution or 
aggression desired by the client.
Our asset allocation strategy is devised in partnership with 
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. We manage 
and rebalance the client’s portfolio for the entire lifetime of 
the investment.
Our research indicates a growing appetite among consumers for 
a product that enables them to build sophisticated baskets of 
investments online, rather than to choose specific shares.
OUR BUSINESS continued
OUR PRODUCT SUITE
Our range of products is designed to provide solutions across the 
spectrum of our clients’ trading and investment needs. 
Our original offering – still core to our business – is leveraged 
trading: contracts for difference (CFDs) and spread betting (in the 
UK and Ireland), which generates the majority of our revenue. This 
is now complemented by a growing suite of non-leveraged share 
dealing and wealth-management products, suiting a broad range of 
risk appetites and trading and investment objectives throughout a 
client’s lifetime.
While our original products are designed for active traders, our 
newer offering extends our reach both to self-directed investors and 
those preferring a low-cost managed-portfolio approach. Attracting 
clients who seek longer-term investments, this broader product 
range is now fully live in the UK, and we‘ve introduced share trading 
to Australia.
We believe that IG is well placed to disrupt the long-term 
investment market and further engage our clients – enabling 
us, over the longer term, to build a new revenue stream for our 
business. We’ve been able to develop our offering extremely 
cost-effectively, by building on our existing technology, teams and 
infrastructure, and by leveraging the established strength of our 
brand and marketing capabilities.
IG clients are able to access over 15,000 global financial markets – 
including shares, forex, indices, commodities and other instruments 
– via market-leading platforms and apps that provide efficient, 
secure execution. 
 
Contracts for Difference (CFDs) 
CFDs are derivatives contracts that enable clients to take advantage 
of changes in an asset’s price, without owning the asset itself. 
Clients can take a position in a financial instrument, buying or 
selling, while only putting down a small percentage of the value 
of their trade as security – known as trading on margin. This is an 
extremely efficient way of trading financial markets over the short 
term. We also offer clients access to a range of risk-mitigation 
measures, including stops and limits and a limited risk account.
• We are the world’s No.1 CFD provider
(1)
We explain how a CFD works in the IG Services section on IG.com.
Spread Betting
Financial spread betting mirrors many aspects of a CFD – enabling 
clients to take advantage of changes in an asset’s price without 
owning the asset itself, and to use the same range of risk-mitigation 
measures. Available only in the UK and Ireland, it’s a tax-free
(2)
 
alternative to trading, allowing clients to bet on the price movement 
of an asset. The size of a client’s win or loss depends on the 
magnitude and direction of the price movement.
• We are the UK’s largest and longest-running spread 
betting provider
(3)
• We hold 45% of the UK financial spread betting market
(4)
We explain how spread betting works in the IG Services section 
on IG.com.
Share dealing, ISAs and SIPPs
Our online, execution-only share dealing service is powered by the 
same market-leading technology as our spread betting and CFD 
offering. It enables self-directed clients to buy and sell over 9,000 
global shares and exchange traded funds (ETFs), with extremely 
competitive and transparent transaction fees. They can also choose 
to invest within a tax-efficient ISA or SIPP wrapper, and there’s an 
option to use stock portfolios as collateral for leveraged trading.
Launched in the UK in 2014, our share dealing offering has built 
on our pedigree in the online leveraged trading sector. As well as 
providing our current spread betting and CFD clients with facilities 
to place their non-leveraged portfolio with us, we’re now attracting 
a completely new audience to IG. Our share dealing service is also 
available to clients in Austria, France, Germany, Ireland and the 
Netherlands, and in this financial year we introduced it to Australia 
as Share Trading.
• The market in the UK for online, execution-only share dealing is 
around ten times the size of the market for leveraged products
(5)
 
• Around 80% of clients opening share dealing accounts are new 
to IG
Nadex
Nadex is our US derivatives exchange, enabling US 
and overseas investors to trade options on global 
financial markets in retail-sized contracts.
Our main product is the binary option, which 
provides a flexible way for clients to trade with 
limited risk. However, our spread product, which is also limited risk, 
is growing in popularity.
Nadex is benefitting from renewed consumer interest in retail 
trading, and increased client volumes have been driven by ongoing 
improvements to our products and platform, supported by 
enhanced liquidity from a new market-maker partnership.
• Nadex is the first and largest US-based retail-oriented exchange
• The business has seen a two-year compound growth rate of 63%
Digital 100s
Our digital 100s are a type of financial derivative with limited risk: 
clients know exactly how much they can potentially gain or lose at 
the outset, and can’t lose more than they have on their account.
A digital 100 is a simplified form of option that offers a yes/no 
outcome over a specified time period. If the trader makes the 
correct choice, they make a defined profit. If they choose wrongly, 
they make no return and lose the amount required to open 
the trade.
Timeframes can vary from five minutes to daily, weekly or monthly, 
and we offer a wide range of markets. As well as indices, forex and 
commodities, clients can trade on special markets such as political 
events and economic announcements.

OUR CLIENTS
OUR PURPOSE
To empower informed, decisive, adventurous people to access 
opportunities in financial markets.
OUR VISION
To be a global leader in retail trading and investments.
A STRATEGY BUILT ON  
CLIENT FOCUS
Our strategy puts our clients first in all our planning and decision 
making. Supporting our clients is something we invest in heavily, 
and we believe it makes good business sense. Our business 
model is dependent on trading volumes, so we provide extensive 
educational resources to help our clients identify opportunities. 
We also deliver news and analysis that traders can use to make 
informed investment decisions, and we develop technology to help 
clients trade more effectively, equipping them with the tools they 
need to seize opportunities rapidly.
Clients are our lifeblood, and our top priority is giving them the 
best possible service. To discover exactly what clients want, we 
ask them. That means conducting surveys and focus groups, as 
well as studying data to identify trends or to find common areas of 
frustration that could be solved through technology improvements 
or adjustments to the way we conduct business.
The result is a constant process of improvement and evolution, 
always driven by the feedback from our clients and our 
understanding of their changing needs. It has led to enhancements 
ranging from the introduction of limited risk accounts last summer 
to the unveiling of our new web trading platform at the start of 
2017, and from our continued investment in client education to the 
launch of our new investment products.
OUR VALUES
This client-centric approach is central for our people, too, and 
everyone at IG lives by a set of values that guide how we do 
business. We believe these three simple statements define IG:
• Champion the client
• Lead the way
• Love what we do
To ensure we live these values, we embed them in every part of our 
business and throughout the client journey – from initial marketing 
to opening an account and beyond.
Targeted marketing
We recognise that our products must be aimed squarely at the right 
people – not every product is right for everyone. As a result we’re 
extremely targeted in our marketing approach, carefully selecting 
how and where we promote ourselves. The audience we seek to 
attract is knowledgeable about the markets, financially astute, 
familiar with our products, wealthier than average and risk-aware. 
Our marketing approach is therefore deliberately aimed towards 
people who fit that profile, and we carefully test all our marketing 
material to make sure it resonates with appropriate potential clients.
Across the globe we also take measures to ensure our marketing is 
balanced, honest, straightforward and fitting for our products and 
the audience.
We want to attract new clients. But only the right clients, and in 
the right way. Our marketing approach reflects that, providing an 
important first introduction to IG and our client-centric approach.
A robust onboarding process
Once prospects have gone beyond the marketing stage and 
applied to open an account, we’re again careful to ensure that only 
those people for whom our products are appropriate proceed to 
become clients.
For all of our products, clients must complete a thorough and 
robust application form to ensure their suitability for an account. 
This assesses their trading or investing experience and product 
knowledge – specific to the account type they want to open – 
and requires them to disclose information about their education, 
occupational background and financial position. We assess this to 
determine whether or not such an account is right for them.
In each of the territories in which we operate, if through the initial 
application process, an applicant fails to prove a sufficient level of 
knowledge and experience, rather than opening an account we 
invite them to follow a learning programme and insist they take and 
pass a further test. Only on passing this test will an applicant be 
allowed to proceed to trading with IG.
Here IG is well ahead of what is required by regulation, but we 
believe it’s the right thing to do, and reflective of our status as 
industry leader. This proactive stance sets us apart from other 
providers and is a key part of our client-focused approach 
to business.
Unlike most providers, we reject clients who we believe lack the 
financial means to bear potential losses. Earlier this year we raised 
our required wealth bands, and first-time clients must now place 
an increased opening balance on their account before they begin 
trading. As far as possible, our aim is always to ensure that the 
prospects our advertising attracts are right for us, and that our 
products are right for them.
Dedicated initial support
When a client first joins us, we understand they may sometimes feel 
a little daunted. Even the most experienced trader needs time to 
become familiar with a new platform. To ensure clients are properly 
supported in those early days, we employ a professional new 
business team to introduce them to IG and to explain exactly what 
they can do with our platforms.
Naturally inquisitive and helpful, members of our new business team 
are tasked with understanding what clients hope to accomplish, 
then showing them how our products can help achieve those aims.
During this fledgling stage of our relationship, we actively 
encourage clients to use our range of educational materials, and 
we build their awareness of the up-to-the-minute trading news and 
research we provide via channels such as DailyFX and IGTV.
Importantly, the new business team also provides another layer 
of client-appropriateness assessment. Our people are trained 
to evaluate, during their conversations, whether the client has a 
realistic expectation of IG and our products.
Constant access to expertise
Once clients have become acquainted with IG, we offer them 
ongoing support and assistance via our trading services teams. 
Available continuously from 8am Sunday to 10pm Friday, as well 
as 9am to 5pm on Saturday, members of this team are experts in 
our products, and are responsive and solely customer-focused. If 
clients have questions about our products, want to know how our 
platforms work or have any other type of enquiry, they can get help 
from our trading services team around the clock. And with native 
speakers from every territory in which we are present – all available 
via phone, email or Live Chat – we make it as easy as possible for 
clients to get the information they need, quickly and in the way they 
want it. 
We manage and capture all of our interactions with clients using 
sophisticated technology. This ensures we can understand the 
whole relationship we have with each client, and have people 
available to meet their requirements on demand. 
In recognition of our commitment to clients, and to ensure we’re 
delivering ‘best practice’ service, last year we became members 
of the Institute of Customer Service. This enabled us to have our 
service standards independently appraised and verified by the 
UK-based organisation.
MARKET -LEADING 
TECHNOLOGY
We recognise that our technology is central to the customer 
experience, and we seek to get it just right. We invest heavily in IT 
development, and are continually looking at ways in which we can 
improve the tools clients use to engage, invest and trade with us.
We believe clients should be empowered by the technology we 
offer and not restricted by it, so in the last year we introduced 
significant advancements to help our clients trade more effectively.
The launch of our New Web Trading Platform (NWTP) was a 
headline improvement, delivering a more intuitive, personalised 
trading experience than ever before. Fast and customisable, it offers 
integrated research, market commentary and news alerts, including 
a social media feed. We’re proud that our clients can now access a 
platform at the very cutting edge of trading technology.
This year has also seen us improving our mobile capability – in 
particular investing in solutions that allow a seamless transition 
between desktop, mobile and tablet.
In our customer research, clients repeatedly tell us how much they 
value good trading technology, and that they seek solutions to 
help them trade in a smarter, faster way that’s tailored to suit them. 
For this reason we continue to invest heavily in our technological 
capabilities, and will keep doing so going forwards.
EXTENSIVE LEARNING 
RESOURCES
For all our clients, we provide access to a myriad of educational 
resources, prepared using our long-standing expertise in the key 
knowledge areas required for successful trading. This includes 
materials to help people learn common trading techniques, as well 
as instructional content that demystifies industry jargon or guides 
clients through every part of our product suite and platforms.
Our investment in education and training is extensive, and has a 
single purpose – to help people become more successful traders. 
Through our free IG Academy app, for example, clients can learn 
via interactive, step-by-step trading courses aimed at all experience 
levels. Likewise, our extensive collection of online how-to videos is 
accessible at any time to help clients enhance their knowledge.
Earlier this year we also acquired DailyFX – the world’s leading 
portal for forex research, trading news, charts, indicators and 
analysis. This bolsters our already extensive news and analysis 
offering, and positions us very clearly as a leading provider of 
market updates and data in our industry.
To ensure clients have access to this information anywhere, at any 
time, and in ways that best suit them, we embed it in our platforms, 
serve it on our websites and publish it via channels such as YouTube 
and Twitter.
It’s our strong belief that by using appropriate educational materials 
and having reliable information at their fingertips, our clients can 
make better trading decisions.
A CULTURE OF REGULATORY 
COMPLIANCE
Compliance is not just a team of people at IG, it’s a concept central 
to our culture. We dedicate significant resource to ensuring that we 
comply with a huge swathe of regulations worldwide – with a large 
team reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer. 
However, awareness and respect for the regulatory framework is 
also embedded throughout the organisation, and is taken into 
account from the very beginning of a product’s design through the 
entire client journey. At every stage of the client experience we 
have described, compliance is key – and going beyond regulatory 
requirements has become the norm at IG. Our first value sums this 
up – champion the client. 
For example, we decided some years ago to segregate retail 
client money, by default, across the globe – often ahead of what 
is required by regulation. Our recent introduction of limited risk 
accounts, and our decision to prevent clients trading with IG if 
they are deemed inappropriate through the application process, 
are indicative of how we place the client at the heart of our 
compliance regime.
In order for this to happen effectively, we need the right people – 
and we need to provide the framework within which they can excel. 
Over more than four decades, IG has built its name on innovation, fairness and outstanding 
client service. It’s a reputation we’re extremely proud of, and one we believe sets us apart 
from all other firms in our industry. In achieving our market-leading status, we’ve constantly 
put clients at the heart of our business.  Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements

OUR PEOPLE
We recruit and train people who are skilled in helping clients 
understand the technical nuances and potential risks of our products 
– a responsibility we take extremely seriously.
By focusing on quality, transparency and fairness in everything we 
do, we can build long-term relationships with our clients.
We continually seek ways to further assist and engage with current 
or prospective clients.
We recognise that a strong team is pivotal in forging mutually 
rewarding, long-term relationships with our clients. By attracting and 
developing talented individuals, and by providing an inclusive, fair 
and engaging environment in which they can thrive, we’re able to 
achieve our strategic objectives.
A DECADE OF RECOGNITION
In 2017, IG was named as one of Britain’s Top Employers for the 
tenth successive year. 
The Top Employer certification is awarded only to organisations that 
meet the highest standards in human resource management, and 
we’re very proud to be a long-standing recipient. The award, by the 
Corporate Research Foundation, is based on a strong performance 
in each of the audited categories: pay and benefits, training and 
development, corporate culture and career development.
OUR PEOPLE STRATEGY
Our focus over the past year has been on strengthening the 
relationship between our people, our strategic purpose, our values 
and our clients. As a global employer, our aspiration is for all of our 
people, in every location, to feel equally connected to our clients. 
In each and every role, whether customer-facing or back-office, we 
believe it’s vital for our people to share a passion for improving the 
client experience.
• We’re a global employer with people in 17 countries
• We employ 1,546 staff
• 90% of employees feel that there’s a strong sense of teamwork 
and cooperation in IG
• We’ve been certified as one of Britain’s Top Employers for ten 
consecutive years 
There are three key themes within our people strategy:
1. Global employer of choice
2. Performance and reward
3. Talent and growth
1. Global employer of choice
In essence, our guiding principle is that we‘re one IG – a unified 
business where energised, engaged people are aligned in their 
commitment to a shared purpose – providing the best possible 
client experience. A progressive and diverse working environment 
supports collaboration, and encourages each of our people to 
achieve their full potential. 
Our global expansion has highlighted the importance of maintaining 
clarity of vision and a sense of unity for all of our people. We 
continue to develop our operational presence in locations where we 
can pursue our strategic objectives most efficiently and effectively, 
and our offices in Krakow and Bangalore together now account 
for 25% of our employees. Expanding these operational hubs has 
enabled us to access additional high-quality talent, particularly in 
technology and support functions. Approximately half our global 
headcount remains based in our London headquarters.
We’re committed to ensuring that all our people feel fully 
connected and are able to work seamlessly together, regardless 
of location.
Collaboration and communication
To improve flexibility and collaboration, during the year we 
transitioned 80% of our employees to working on laptops. 
Together with enhanced collaboration technology, this gives our 
people the mobility and scope to work in different locations and 
cross-functional project teams, according to their varying needs.
We also redesigned and updated the interior of our UK 
headquarters and acquired a large, contemporary office space 
in Bangalore. Both aim to provide a vibrant and flexible working 
environment, reflecting our culture and helping us to attract and 
retain the best talent.
Alongside the physical space, we continued to develop our intranet, 
IG hub. With key internal and industry news updates added daily, 
it has become the default source of both static and dynamic 
information for our people. We’re seeing a month-by-month rise in 
usage and increased engagement, with the site now receiving more 
than twice as many daily page views versus September 2016.
Employee voice
Through our annual engagement survey, we ensure that our people 
have a direct channel of communication to the executive team and 
the Board. The feedback we receive provides important insight 
that helps us achieve our people strategy, enabling us to track our 
progress against three key goals:
• To fill our business with engaged and dedicated people
• To develop strong leaders from grassroots to Board level
• To foster a culture that values employees’ commitment and 
celebrates their success
We’re proud of our working culture, and believe it nurtures the 
behaviours and decision-making processes that best serve our 
clients. In our 2016 engagement survey (2017 financial year), 
employees across all locations reported that cooperation, 
teamwork, manager effectiveness, respect and ethics are all clear 
strengths at IG. On the downside, our people expressed clearly that 
they need greater clarity on the vision for IG.
In the 2018 financial year we’ll be focusing on ensuring that all our 
people understand our vision and feel able to share in it. To support 
this, we’ve developed the more clearly articulated purpose and new 
values detailed on page 10. Reflecting the client-centric and global 
nature of our business, these values will underpin our performance 
management, people development and recognition processes, as 
well as providing guidance for decision-making and shaping our 
employer brand.
One unified IG
With 1,546 people based in separate locations around the globe, 
we’re conscious of the need to actively promote equality, diversity 
and inclusiveness. We take great pride in creating an open, 
supportive culture, and we believe this is critical to our success, 
enabling us to unlock the potential of the workforce in every country 
where we operate.
We have extensive human resource policies in place to attract and 
support the right people, and to ensure that those who join us can 
develop without experiencing discrimination or harassment. We 
continuously reinforce the need to treat all employees fairly, creating 
an environment free from bullying, where people of all grades or 
positions enjoy dignity and respect.
In 2016, our employees led the creation of IG Open, a network to 
support those who identify themselves as LGBT+. It aims to provide 
a forum for people to exchange experiences and speak comfortably, 
in a safe space where they can be open and proud of their identity. 
We fully consider applications for employment from disabled 
persons with aptitudes and abilities in line with our requirements. 
Where existing employees become disabled, temporarily or 
permanently, it’s our policy to provide continuing employment 
wherever practicable in the same or an alternative position. 
Appropriate training and/or graduated back-to-work programmes, 
in conjunction with the occupational health professionals, help 
achieve this aim.
Wellbeing 
We’re fully committed to the health and wellbeing of our people, 
ensuring that all our employees receive appropriate protection 
benefits and discounted gym access. In the UK, our people can 
access the cycle-to-work initiative through our new flexible benefits 
portal, which also provides increased opportunity for individuals to 
personalise benefits to their lifestyle requirements. 
A confidential employee-assistance programme is available to all 
our head office employees and their immediate families, offering 
a 24/7 telephone counselling service for impartial advice on all 
matters – for example, housing and personal finance. 
Talented people, supported by a strong organisational culture, are vital to the service we 
provide for our clients. Their skill and commitment drive our success in every aspect of our 
business – from designing and building innovative products and cutting-edge platforms to 
handling client queries efficiently and resolving issues. Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements

2. Performance and reward
Our reward and recognition system is designed to drive high 
performance and global growth for the business, developing 
the leaders of the future. It centres on providing our people with 
a clearly defined purpose, specific deliverables and expected 
behaviours. Our aim is to ensure that each individual is aligned with 
our strategy, understands their role in achieving our goals and has 
the maximum possible opportunity for advancement.
With this in mind, during the year we introduced a 
high-performance model that gives our people greater clarity on 
what’s expected of them. A new ‘check-in’ process provides regular, 
ongoing opportunities for feedback, goal realignment and career 
discussions, and has replaced the traditional annual appraisal 
approach. We believe this new framework actively helps to embed 
a culture of recognition, better acknowledging and celebrating the 
successes of our people.
To attract and retain the right people, we offer a competitive reward 
package that recognises performance to date and encourages 
our key talent to be part of our future. In 2016 we adjusted some 
of our salary ranges to ensure we remain competitive. While we 
acknowledge a possible influence from external factors such as 
Brexit, we believe that our proactive approach has positively 
affected attrition.
As well as offering a market-related salary structure that is regularly 
benchmarked, we include the majority of our employees in a group 
bonus scheme. Bonus levels are intrinsically linked to the financial 
and operational performance of IG, including client satisfaction. At 
the end of each financial year, bonuses are distributed based on 
both company and individual performance, as discussed during 
check-ins throughout the year. 
The remainder of our employees are included in specific 
sales-related bonus schemes. We also reward our senior and key 
employees through a long-term incentive plan.
Alongside our formal reward structure, recognition also takes the 
form of peer- and manager-nominated awards delivered in local 
teams. These celebrate achievements in areas such as innovation, 
mentoring and being a team player or client champion. In the next 
year we’ll continue to strengthen our global recognition strategy by 
linking it directly to our values and behaviours. 
We also offer our employees in the UK, Australia and the US 
the chance to share in our success through our tax-advantaged 
share-purchase schemes. An average of 33% of eligible employees 
took part in our share plans in the 2017 financial year. We’re 
currently reviewing options to extend similar schemes to our other 
larger offices – Krakow and Bangalore.
3. Talent and growth
We recognise that a constant flow of emerging talent is vital to 
IG’s continued success, and we’re committed to ensuring that our 
people are equipped to deliver our strategy and growth in the years 
ahead. This means identifying the key roles that we’ll need in the 
future and recruiting, training and developing the right individuals 
to fulfil them.
During the year we focused on building succession approaches 
for our more senior roles. Going forward, we’ll implement similar 
principles of identification, assessment and development for other 
core roles across the Group.
To bring new talent into the business, we offer a number of 
graduate positions and apprenticeships – both in our head 
office and in various global locations. These roles are designed 
to challenge and develop high-potential people, giving them a 
platform to display and grow their skills and so to progress rapidly. 
We encourage all of our employees to take responsibility for 
their own development while they’re with us. However, we 
recognise that resources need to be in place to enable this to 
happen. As well as embedding check-ins to encourage better 
and more regular performance and development conversations, 
we’re also introducing career development workshops, building 
specialist and sales development pathways, introducing Board 
exposure programmes and continuing to implement coaching and 
mentoring programmes.
As an international company, we’re also able to offer overseas 
secondments and project-based development opportunities for 
selected individuals. 
All our leaders and potential leaders worldwide are now able  
to access the ‘Manager Success’ series of interactive webinars. 
These are available in local time zones and provide best-practice 
tips and techniques to help our people handle common 
management challenges.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Given the tough external environment, I’m extremely proud of  
the way our people at IG have pulled together over the past  
12 months. Teams of employees have been working on our Brexit 
planning, others have been heavily engaged in consultation with 
our regulators, and more still have been working hard behind the 
scenes on initiatives to further differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors and to prepare IG to take advantage of regulatory 
change – all of this while running the business from day to day. It’s 
been a fantastic effort, and I want to thank each and every one of 
our employees for their contributions during a difficult time.
To guide our business going forwards, I am especially pleased to 
have relaunched our Company purpose, vision and values this year. 
Detailed below, I believe these statements articulate why IG exists 
and what makes us tick. They underpin all our activity, express the 
way we behave and set out our ambitions as we strive to achieve 
our future vision for the Company. 
To demonstrate our commitment to these statements, I and 
members of my senior leadership team introduced them to 
everyone in the business during a series of more than 50 global 
workshops this summer. We also reminded ourselves where IG came 
from – we have a history of true entrepreneurialism and innovation. 
The feedback at those events was extremely positive, and I’m 
confident that we have the right people to deliver our strategic aims 
for 2018 and beyond. 
Our purpose
We exist to empower informed, decisive, adventurous people to 
access opportunities in financial markets.
Our vision
To be a global leader in retail trading and investments.
Our values
Champion the client
Understand them. Be part of their whole experience. 
Think big, think long-term. Make every moment count 
and stick with them all the way. Do what matters most.
Lead the way
Be brave. Back yourself. Innovate and adapt to win. 
Challenge assumptions, ideas, decisions. Ask why. Stand 
up and speak your mind. Achieve. Do the right thing.
Love what we do
Make it personal. Care, be passionate, have fun. 
Respect our diversity and learn from each other. 
Share your enthusiasm, take pride in each other’s 
achievements and work as a team.
GROUP PERFORMANCE REVIEW
The Company once again delivered record revenue in the  
twelve-month period, up 8% on the prior year to £491.1 million 
(2016: £456.3 million) – a good performance in relatively quiet 
financial markets. Profit before tax was ahead by 3% at  
£213.7 million (2016: £207.9 million). Operating expenses rose by 
14%. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of DailyFX in October 
2016, marketing investment, which continued to pay back very 
rapidly, accounted for almost half of the absolute rise in expenses. 
Profit after tax was £169.2 million, 3% ahead of the prior year  
(2016: £164.3 million), assisted slightly by a fall in the Group’s 
effective tax rate to 20.8%, from 21.0% in the prior year.
Business performance
In the principal product area, OTC leveraged trading, the Company 
experienced good growth across all regions outside the UK. The 
strongest relative performance came in EMEA, where revenue was 
ahead of the prior year by 17%, with particular year-on-year strength 
in Switzerland, Dubai and South Africa. Revenue in APAC was ahead 
of the prior year by 9%. Client numbers were up in all regions, with 
growth at a Group level averaging 7%. The number of client first 
trades was also well ahead of the prior year, up by 15%.
The share dealing service, launched in the UK in 2014, grew well in 
the period. It was launched in Australia in the middle of 2016 and 
grew well during the year in both countries. At the end of the year, 
the Company had just over 20,000 clients holding positions, up 
around 200% on the prior year. 
In the US, Nadex continued to grow strongly. Group revenue from 
the US was 26% ahead of last year, at £14.1 million. Ongoing 
marketing success, the addition of further market makers and 
technology improvements around latency and the mobile platform 
have all delivered benefits.
Further detail of the regional performance is provided in the 
Operating and Financial Review on page 30. 
Business development
The Company continued to make good strategic and operational 
progress during the year.
The rollout of our new web trading platform began late in 2016 with 
a trial for UK spread betting clients and has since progressed well. 
This is now the default platform for UK spread bettors, with more 
than half of all client desktop trades being placed here. The CFD 
rollout will commence later this year in the UK and will be extended 
to other countries by the end of 2017.
The Company relaunched its limited risk account in July 2016, which 
requires all clients using the account to cap the downside risk of 
every trade, which avoids them ever having a negative balance on 
their account. IG also only provides this type of account for new 
clients with lower levels of appropriateness, experience or wealth. 
In the last half of the year, around 28% of all OTC leveraged first 
trades were limited risk.
The acquisition of DailyFX from FXCM for $40 million was 
completed in October 2016. While the websites are delivering the 
expected number of new leads, the rate of conversion into trading 
clients has been lower than anticipated. However, the accounts 
which are opened have proved to be more valuable than expected. 
This asset is likely to prove increasingly valuable in countries where 
paid-for-marketing restrictions are put in place.
IG is in a period of rapid product transition. The Company launched 
its discretionary managed investments service in the UK towards the 
end of this financial year. Together with the share dealing service, 
this is expected to be an effective means of engaging and retaining 
valuable leveraged trading clients. The number of clients using 
multiple products (a leveraged account and a share dealing or 
investments account) more than doubled in the period and there is 
early evidence that these clients trade more actively, making them 
more valuable.
2017 was another interesting and challenging period for IG. The year was dominated by a 
series of significant global political events, with some surprising outcomes, and a regulatory 
landscape entering a period of uncertainty. Against this backdrop, I am delighted that the 
Company again delivered record revenue and profits. 
|  IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017 16
OVERVIEW
Surprisingly, given the significance of the political events in the 
period – not least the UK’s EU referendum, the US presidential 
election and a number of key European elections – financial markets 
remained incredibly quiet by historic standards. This fact makes our 
2017 performance even more pleasing.
The political events will ultimately be consigned to history, but 2017 
will be remembered in our industry as the year when regulatory 
change came to the fore. And I believe, if regulators can really grasp 
this opportunity, the change which is coming will be fundamentally 
positive for consumers globally and will put the industry on a firmer 
and more sustainable footing going forward.
Throughout our history, IG has always sought to differentiate itself 
from other providers by adhering to and, in some cases, going 
beyond regulatory standards. We seek to do what is right, not what 
is possible. We understand that CFDs and spread bets aren’t right 
for everyone, and we therefore believe that it is in the best interests 
of many consumers to be stopped from accessing them. As such, 
we target our advertising to an appropriate audience, we don’t offer 
any form of account opening bonus and we refuse to open accounts 
for people who don’t understand the product or have insufficient 
wealth to be trading financial markets using leverage. I hope 
forthcoming changes in regulation will enforce similar behaviours 
across the industry, and I look forward to a day when all consumers 
are similarly protected. 19

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW continued
Leading the way
IG takes its leadership position in the industry extremely seriously 
and constantly assesses its self-imposed restrictions and controls, 
which ensure access to complex financial products is only provided 
to clients for whom they are appropriate. Just after the end of 
the financial year, the Company carried out a full review of its 
onboarding criteria and process. As a result of this, IG altered 
various elements, including raising its self-imposed wealth hurdles 
and its minimum deposit. IG has also created and rolled out 
globally a new appropriateness test, which means that prospective 
clients who were previously allowed to proceed at their own risk 
can no longer have a leveraged account with IG unless they can 
demonstrate that they understand the potential risks and rewards of 
such an account. This is a clear example of IG doing the right thing 
to ensure fair client outcomes and going beyond what is demanded 
by regulation. As a result of these actions, the Company expects to 
recruit fewer clients, of greater average value, and so may see a fall 
in simple measures of market share.
Regulation
The retail leveraged trading industry is under scrutiny globally, 
with particular emphasis currently in the UK and Europe. This new 
level of scrutiny is overdue and IG believes that a well thought 
through update to regulation should be beneficial for clients – if 
it is proportionate, consistent and properly enforced. IG has 
differentiated itself within the industry through its adherence to 
the highest regulatory standards and its focus on fair outcomes 
for clients. However, too many providers have been allowed to 
enter this industry in recent years, many of which have behaved 
very badly and targeted clients for whom such a product is 
entirely inappropriate. This has been exacerbated by an influx 
of entirely illegal providers, based in offshore regimes and using 
the uncontrollable nature of the internet to take advantage 
of unsophisticated or unwary individuals through misleading 
advertising. These companies have often provided a single product, 
the up/down binary option, using high-pressure sales practices. This 
combination of poorly regulated and illegal providers has often left 
the impression that the entire industry is at fault and made it very 
difficult for compliant providers, such as IG, to make their voices 
heard. In order to improve outcomes for clients, the Company 
believes it is vital that regulators support and work with companies 
like IG to remove or greatly reduce the impact of these illegal and 
the poorly supervised providers.
In recent months, IG has been even more active in liaising with 
regulators to assist them in their efforts to improve outcomes for 
clients across the world. There are a number of reviews either 
complete or ongoing in countries where IG has either a presence or 
a material degree of business.
In Australia, the Government and regulator are proceeding to 
better protect client money – in the way that IG always has – and 
to provide additional powers of intervention on financial products 
provided to retail. IG welcomes both of these measures. In Dubai 
the regulator, the DFSA, has indicated an intention to alter the 
current regime surrounding leveraged products. IG has assisted 
the considerations of the DFSA and the outcomes are expected to 
be announced in the near future. The Company does not believe 
its activities are the subject of regulatory concern and so does not 
expect the changes to materially impact its operation in Dubai.
In Europe the regulatory situation is complex and in transition. IG 
is working with National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in several 
countries and has also been in discussion with the European 
Securities and Markets Association (ESMA) and shared its concerns 
about the divergence of regulation across the EU. 
Consultations in France and Germany have been finalised, and the 
outcome of a requirement to provide an account which limits the 
downside for clients fits with the leadership position IG took last 
year and enhances IG’s competitive position in these countries. The 
results of the consultations in The Netherlands and Ireland have not 
yet been announced. 
In December 2016, in the UK, the FCA announced its intention to 
enhance conduct of business rules for firms providing contract for 
difference products to retail clients, and detailed a very specific set 
of proposals. Following an announcement by ESMA in June 2017, 
the FCA decided to delay making final rules until ESMA finalises its 
discussions. ESMA announced it is in the process of discussing the 
possible use of its product intervention powers under Article 40 of 
MiFIR, the possible content of any such measures, and how they 
could be applied. Measures being discussed include leverage limits, 
guaranteed limits on client losses, and restrictions on the marketing 
and distribution of these products.
The Company believes a common set of regulations across the EU 
provides a greater chance of successfully protecting consumers 
against poor behaviour in the industry. Any inconsistency in the 
application of regulatory standards in the EU region only creates 
arbitrage opportunities for ill-intentioned providers to take 
advantage of less sophisticated consumers. IG will continue to 
engage actively with NCAs and ESMA to seek to establish a set of 
rules which improve consumer outcomes and protect competition.
In its engagement to date, IG has provided consistent advice to 
individual NCAs and to ESMA. IG believes the correct response 
needs to be broad and properly enforced. IG sees five main areas 
where regulators are expressing concern and suggesting the need 
for remedies:
• Marketing. Regulators are seeking to ensure the product is 
marketed only to the correct audience, with an appropriate 
risk warning, including the probability of trading successfully. 
This would also outlaw sports sponsorship. IG fully supports 
this development
• Bonus offers. There is a movement to ban account-opening 
bonus offers. IG does not offer these and fully supports 
this development
• Appropriateness. There already exists an obligation to assess 
whether a product is appropriate for a prospective client. 
However, under current MiFID guidance, firms are allowed to 
warn prospective clients that the product is inappropriate but 
allow them to proceed to trading. The ESMA Q&A makes it 
clear that a prospective client should not be allowed to proceed 
where the product is deemed inappropriate. IG does not take on 
inappropriate clients and fully supports this development
• No-negative protection. Certain NCAs have mandated only 
offering accounts to retail clients where the client cannot lose 
more money than they have deposited on their account. ESMA 
has indicated this may form part of its future guidance. IG 
already offers this option and fully supports this development
• Leverage. There already exists an obligation to act in the best 
interests of a client. Given this, it is already impossible to justify 
high levels of leverage where the significance of the transaction 
fee can skew the client’s probability of success. IG does not offer 
any products with this characteristic. However, there is pressure 
from certain regulators to explicitly cap leverage levels. With the 
caveat that any mandated leverage caps should aim solely to 
resolve the probability issue, IG fully supports this development
Potential regulatory impact and actions  
being taken
IG’s UK and EU OTC leveraged revenue last year of £330 million 
included £78 million from products and clients for which it is 
anticipated any regulatory impact would be minimal – equities 
trading, where leverage levels are low, corporate clients and 
non-resident clients. Therefore, around half of Group revenue will 
be unaffected by the proposals being discussed by regulators 
across the EU.
A potentially significant mitigating factor to the impact of any 
regulatory restrictions on retail clients, would be qualifying clients 
electing to take on a professional status in order to continue to 
trade as before. To qualify, a client must pass two of the three tests 
defined under MiFID: sufficient trading experience, a substantial 
investment portfolio, relevant occupational experience. As 
has always been the case, the Company’s revenue is relatively 
concentrated towards the most active end of the client base. In 
the last year, 80% of the Group’s revenue (excluding the US) was 
generated by less than 9% of clients. The vast majority of IG’s top 
9% of clients have a recent trading history which would suggest 
they should pass the sufficient trading experience test. In addition, 
a recent independent survey found that approximately 15% of IG’s 
clients have a financial instrument portfolio of a sufficient size to 
pass the second test. These statistics underline the journey the 
Group has been on for a number of years to focus on serving the 
upper end of the OTC leveraged trading market. The Company 
cannot be sure of the degree of overlap between these groups of 
clients, and it is not possible to determine how many eligible clients 
would choose to be classified as professional. 
For clients who would not be able to, or who choose not to, take 
on professional status, it is not possible to determine how they 
would respond to regulatory restrictions on their activities. Overall, 
IG clients with open positions are leveraged under ten times. This 
calculation compares client cash on accounts with open positions 
to the total size of those notional trading positions and makes no 
allowance for the very different levels of leverage in the various 
asset types. 
Many of the Group’s clients, however, currently have excess cash 
on their account compared to the trading margin required, and 
could choose to continue to trade with less headroom. Some clients 
may choose to increase the cash on their account to maintain their 
headroom. Other clients may choose to utilise their share portfolio 
held with IG as collateral. It is likely that some clients will simply 
constrain their trading, or open an account with a less constrained 
provider, although an EU-wide harmonised approach to regulation 
reduces that risk.
IG has commenced work on developing a multi-lateral trading 
facility (MTF) to serve the European market. This on-exchange 
offering could provide further protection for IG’s business across 
Europe and increase the opportunity for further growth in this 
region. There can be no certainty of success here.
The Group is planning for the UK’s exit from the EU, and good 
progress is being made in securing regulatory approval for a 
subsidiary based in the EU. The Group is also at the early stages of 
exploring further opportunities outside the EU.
In the Company’s experience, when tighter regulation has been 
applied appropriately, client outcomes have improved, the industry 
has become more sustainable, and more compliant providers have 
benefitted over the longer term. 
Outlook
IG will continue to lead the way in the industry with respect to 
how it markets its services, how it deals with clients, and through 
the products and levels of client service it offers. IG believes in 
doing the right thing, rather than simply complying with minimum 
regulatory requirements. The Company is taking measures to 
further differentiate itself within its core OTC leveraged derivatives 
trading environment, and will continue to improve the transparency 
of its products, and extend its geographic footprint in order to 
maintain and extend its competitive advantage. The recent product 
extension into share dealing and investments sets IG further apart 
from the competition and extends the loyalty of the current  
client base. 
None of the recently announced regulatory changes have adversely 
impacted the business to date, and the current year has started well. 
The nature and timing of potential regulatory changes in the UK and 
some other key markets for the Group remain uncertain, and it is 
therefore difficult to predict what impact, if any, regulatory change 
may have on the Group this financial year and beyond. Actions have 
been taken to manage costs, to allow for investments to be made 
in strategic initiatives without a significant increase in the fixed cost 
base. Operating costs excluding variable remuneration in FY18 are 
expected to remain at a similar level to FY17.
IG is better placed than most, if not all, providers in the industry to 
both influence and respond to regulatory change. The Company will 
continue to engage fully with regulators, to seek to achieve the best 
possible outcomes for current and future clients of this industry, and 
the greatest long-term value for shareholders of the Company.

STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES continued 25
|  IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017 24 IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017  |
Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
The business offers its clients opportunities to trade in a wide range 
of markets, including equity indices, individual equities, forex, 
interest rates and commodities, through online dealing platforms.
The business also offers its clients a share dealing platform, as well 
as an innovative portfolio-based product for longer-term investment 
purposes in partnership with BlackRock, one of the world’s leading 
asset managers.
RISK PROFILE
IG’s business model is based on generating a return from its services 
through transaction fees charged to clients. The level of revenue 
in any period is predominantly driven by the number of active 
clients the business serves in that period and the level of activity 
undertaken by each client. 
The business does not seek to generate returns from actively taking 
market risk, it does not take proprietary trading positions, and its 
revenue is not dependent on the direction of market movements.
In accordance with the risk appetite set by the Board, the Group 
accepts some exposure to market and credit risk to optimise the 
efficiency and effectiveness of its services to clients. The business 
manages the market risk it faces in providing its services to clients 
by internalising client flow and hedging when the residual exposures 
reach defined limits, so that its returns are driven by transaction 
fees charged and are not significantly affected by movements in 
market prices.
As a result of its business model, the Group also faces liquidity and 
capital adequacy risk.
The business faces operational risks, including those arising through 
technology, people, process and external events.
The Group faces conduct risk relating to how it deals with its clients 
and with the markets.
IG operates in a dynamic competitive environment, and its revenue 
is dependent on the number of active customers and the level of 
their activity. The business therefore faces risks relating to market 
conditions and its competitive position.
The business operates in a number of geographic markets and is 
regulated by various different financial services regulators in those 
markets. These regulations affect how the business is able to market 
and provide its services to clients. The regulations relating to the 
products and markets in which the business operates are continually 
evolving. IG supports the objectives of the recently proposed and 
enacted regulatory changes in many of its markets, but the business 
does face risks arising from changes in its regulatory environments 
that may adversely impact its activities or its competitive position.
CLIENTS
Our core focus continues to be the active retail trader – a 
knowledgeable, demanding and valuable client who expects highly 
sophisticated technology and uses it frequently.
IG exists to empower informed, decisive, adventurous people to access opportunities in 
financial markets.
We put our clients at the heart of everything we do, and we strive 
to ensure that we understand our clients’ needs and consistently 
deliver fair outcomes and positive experiences. We have a very low 
tolerance for poor consumer outcomes, and we are committed to 
continued investment in process, training and culture to prevent 
unsatisfactory customer experiences and to address root causes 
where any practice falls short. 
We ensure that commitment to our customers is embedded in our 
culture and strategic initiatives, and we regularly seek and review 
feedback from our clients. This enables us to develop our products 
and services specifically to meet the needs of active traders and 
investors globally.
Central to our commitment to our customers is the quality of 
our order execution. We process 100% of active client trades 
automatically. We never requote prices and, outside our set margin 
of tolerance, our innovative price-improvement technology enables 
customers to receive a better price if one becomes available as a 
trade is executed.
Clients’ investment requirements and appetite for risk change over 
time, affected by factors such as family or financial commitments 
or the need to plan for retirement, and this offers us the 
opportunity to broaden our product set to appeal to relatively 
sophisticated investors.
Our range of products for retail clients includes share dealing and 
investment portfolios, and clients are able to hold their investments 
in ISAs and SIPPs. Offering these services allows us to deepen 
and lengthen our relationship with our clients by catering for their 
evolving needs.
In addition to dealing directly with clients, IG services clients 
introduced through third parties who do not have their own 
front-end offering and want to take advantage of our award-winning 
dealing technology and expertise. They introduce their clients to us 
and we handle all trading activity and provide back-end support. 
The introducer manages the client relationship.
IG also provides services to corporate entities, including asset 
managers, hedge funds, broker dealers and competitors who  
lack sufficient scale to gain direct access to the major  
hedging counterparties. 
We carefully assess the risk and potential returns from introducers 
and corporate entities and only partner with reputable institutions 
that are committed to the same rigorous standards of regulatory 
compliance as ourselves, and that fit our risk profile. 
Client acquisition and education
Acquiring a new client begins with a targeted global marketing 
effort, with online marketing managed centrally and offline  
activity managed by country offices. Our sophisticated online 
marketing uses an algorithmic approach, which enables us to  
reach larger numbers of the right prospects more efficiently. We 
are able to react immediately to world events, creating campaigns 
rapidly and rolling them out to relevant regions, with appropriate 
local adjustments. 
As well as marketing our products directly, we provide a number of 
education, news and analysis services, which encourage people to 
engage with IG and to learn about our products and how to trade 
effectively and responsibly.
These include the IG Academy app, the IG Live TV channel, a suite 
of YouTube videos, and a wide range of seminars and webinars. 
During the past financial year the Group purchased the DailyFX 
website, a leading global news, information, and education and 
discussion portal for retail traders, particularly in FX. This is a 
further commitment by the Company to acquiring new clients and 
providing valuable resources to educate, engage and develop its 
client base. These assets reinforce our commitment to transparency, 
ensuring our new and existing clients are well informed about 
our services.
Our extensive educational resources also include an introduction 
programme that promotes responsible trading. Clients can access 
expert tutorials, which cover everything from fundamental trading 
concepts to risk management. We continually keep this content 
engaging and targeted towards our clients’ needs.
We also provide an extensive range of trading tools, such as regular 
free news, commentary and analysis on IG TV and via the News 
and Analysis section of our website. We offer charting packages 
and various technical analysis tools that enable our clients to screen 
markets for trading opportunities and to receive alerts when trading 
signals appear.
Appropriateness
Our products are not appropriate for everyone, and good conduct 
is particularly vital in relation to marketing and client recruitment 
to prevent poor consumer outcomes. We seek to ensure that our 
advertising is not reaching an inappropriate audience, and that 
our clients appreciate the risks involved with our products and 
understand how our services work.
We follow strict guidelines to ensure that we only promote our 
products to a target audience within appropriate sectors and 
demographic groups. We also conduct rigorous checks to ensure 
that all promotions are clear, fair and not misleading, and that risks 
are not downplayed compared to the benefits of our products.
Before we allow a prospective client to open an account, we 
carry out an assessment to determine whether our products are 
appropriate for them. We actively question applicants to assess 
whether they have the necessary knowledge and experience to 
understand the risks involved. We ask clients for details of their 
income and savings, both at account opening and in rolling reviews. 
Based on the results of these assessments, in addition to providing 
clear warnings about the appropriateness of the product, we may 
decline to open an account, or provide an applicant with a type of 
account where risk is limited. We may also close an open account.
Client risk management tools
We take very seriously our responsibility to help clients understand 
the risks associated with trading and to provide them with tools 
to manage this. Given our business model, it is in IG’s interest 
to develop lasting relationships with clients, as those who are 
more successful stay with us over the long term and become 
more valuable.
We have a number of services designed to help clients limit any 
losses they may make.
Our clients can choose to attach guaranteed stops to their 
positions, so that they know their maximum possible loss at the 
outset of a trade. Our innovative charging system encourages 
our clients to use guaranteed stops: no premium is payable for 
attaching a guaranteed stop unless it is triggered, so clients will 
frequently receive protection free of charge. IG is the first provider 
to offer guaranteed stops on this basis.
Our close-out monitor (COM) liquidates clients’ positions when their 
margin has been significantly eroded and helps protect clients by 
closing positions automatically. At 31 May 2017, 99.75% of all client 
accounts were subject to the automatic COM procedure. 
We also offer a limited risk account. This is the default account for 
less-experienced clients or clients towards the lower end of the 
wealth scale. Clients who are eligible for our other account types 
can request a limited risk account, if they so wish. These limited 
risk accounts are ‘double-lock accounts’. The client knows the 
maximum potential loss on every trade at the outset, and benefits 
from the guarantee that they cannot lose more than they have on 
their account. This gives clients certainty on the potential downside, 
enabling them to feel more secure and more confident to trade.
REVENUE GENERATION
The Group’s business is conducted through four revenue-generation 
models: OTC leveraged derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives, 
share dealing and investments.
OTC leveraged derivatives
The vast majority of the Group’s revenue is derived from OTC 
leveraged derivatives. Clients enter into derivative instruments: 
contracts for difference, financial spread bets and options. These 
enable them to take long or short positions, for varied durations, 
in a wide range of financial and other markets, gaining exposure to 
price movements in those markets without needing to buy or sell 
the underlying asset.
The Group’s OTC leveraged derivatives are priced to clients by 
reference to prices in the underlying markets. When markets are 
open, the prices of the derivative contracts are updated in real time, 
reflecting the prices in the underlying markets. For the majority of 
the derivatives, the price includes a spread around the underlying 
market price. For some derivatives on single equities, clients are 
charged a commission instead, and the contract does not include 
a spread. Clients are charged funding when long positions are 
held overnight, and receive funding when short positions are 
held overnight.
IG is the counterparty to the OTC leveraged derivatives that clients 
enter into, and as a result the business faces market risk. The Group 
accepts this market risk in order to allow instant execution of client 
orders. The business manages the market risk it faces through 
internalisation – allowing individual client trades to offset against 
each other – and by hedging the residual risk in each market at 
defined limits by entering into derivative contracts with its hedging 
brokers. The Group seeks to hedge its residual market exposures 
in an efficient manner by grouping its exposures into asset classes, 
and therefore does not hedge its exposures exactly, which gives rise 
to basis risk.
BUSINESS MODEL AND RISK PROFILE 27
|  IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017 26 IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017  |
Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
Through the process of internalisation and hedging, the Group 
limits the market risk it faces so that its trading revenue from OTC 
leveraged derivatives predominantly reflects the charges paid by 
clients through spread, commission and funding, less the costs 
incurred in hedging. This internalisation is key to the Group’s 
business model and profitability, as it reduces the cost of hedging 
market risk in the underlying markets. 
The majority of the OTC derivatives offered by the Group are 
‘leveraged’. Clients trade contracts for difference or financial spread 
bets, on ‘margin’. Clients only need to have sufficient funds in their 
account to cover the margin required to enter into a derivative 
contract, not its full value. 
Margin is usually expressed as a percentage of the notional value 
of the trade, and allows a client to use leverage to take a position 
in a market with a notional value that is significantly in excess of the 
funds they are required to deposit. Leveraged derivative contracts 
therefore magnify the gains or losses a client can make relative to 
the funds deposited.
The Group faces client credit risk, as leveraged contracts can result 
in a client making losses in excess of the funds in their account, 
and they may be unable to fund those losses. The level of margin 
for each contract is set according to the volatility of prices in the 
underlying market, and is intended to reduce the client credit risk 
faced by the Group.
The Group’s OTC leveraged derivatives activities give rise to 
liquidity risk. The business trades its hedging contracts on margin, 
and is required to deposit initial margin with its brokers reflecting 
the gross amount of open positions with each broker. As the gross 
amounts of open positions change, and as market prices move, 
the amount of margin the Group has to deposit also alters, and the 
Group is required to deposit margin with its brokers on demand. 
The business therefore faces liquidity risk through its hedging 
activities, and counterparty credit risk through the amounts it holds 
on deposit with its brokers.
The Group’s exposure to any one hedging counterparty is restricted 
by large exposure rules, and the Group needs to maintain a number 
of different hedging relationships to manage the capacity it requires 
to hedge.
Exchange-traded derivatives
The Group’s trading revenue in the USA is derived from 
exchange-traded derivatives. The Group operates a regulated 
derivatives exchange, and clients can trade binary options contracts 
on a wide range of underlying markets, with various strike prices 
and expirations. Clients become members of the exchange and pay 
a trading fee on each side of the trade: once to open, and once 
to close. Under this model, clients do not trade on margin, and 
therefore these contracts do not involve leverage, and the exchange 
does not face either market or client credit risk.
Prices for contracts listed on the exchange are provided by market 
makers, who are also members of the exchange and pay fees for 
trading. IG operates as one of the market makers to the exchange, 
and faces market risk as a result of this activity.
Share dealing
The Group operates a share dealing platform, through which clients 
can buy and sell individual equities listed on exchanges around 
the world.
The Group charges a transaction fee for each purchase and sale 
transaction, and its trading revenue from this service is net of the 
execution fees the Group pays in the market.
Clients fund the purchases of equities in full at the time of placing 
the order. This activity does not give rise to any market risk or client 
credit risk for the Group.
Investments
The Group offers a portfolio-based investment service. Clients are 
advised, through undertaking an online questionnaire, which of 
five portfolios comprising a basket of ETFs is best suited to their 
investment needs, and these portfolios rebalance periodically. 
Alternatively, clients can choose their own portfolio of ETFs to 
reflect their investment profile.
The Group charges a percentage fee on the value of the assets 
under management, and its trading revenue reflects these fees less 
the amount paid to the provider of the ETFs.
Clients fund the purchases of the investments in full at the time of 
placing the order. This activity does not give rise to any market risk 
or client credit risk for the Group.
DIFFERENTIATION – BRAND, 
TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICE
Brand
IG is a global leader in online trading and the trusted partner for 
185,000 clients. A FTSE 250 company with market capitalisation of 
over £2.0 billion, the Group has a long history of profitability and 
financial strength.
IG started in 1974 as the UK’s original financial spread betting 
provider, introducing a completely new, accessible way for people 
to trade on gold, by defining it as an index. Since then, the Group’s 
innovative, client-focused approach has enabled the business to 
grow, expand internationally, and broaden its product range, and 
today IG is the world’s No.1 CFD provider as well as maintaining its 
considerable UK market leadership in spread betting. The unified 
global IG brand was established in 2013 through the acquisition 
of the IG.com domain. This pivotal event gave the Group the 
framework to consolidate its global web traffic through a single 
route in order to focus on online leadership – something that is 
increasingly important for acquiring, educating and providing a high 
level of service for clients.
Technology
The Group’s success has been founded on developing technology 
that is market-leading and empowering for clients. The business 
invests in developing new tools and features for its client-facing 
platforms – a continuous process that is directed by detailed 
research into clients’ evolving needs. 
This year IG has launched its new web trading platform, which 
delivers a greatly enhanced trading experience. Its speed, 
customisation facilities and integrated news and analysis feeds are 
at the cutting edge of trading technology. Designed to provide 
an intuitive, personalised experience for traders of all styles and 
knowledge levels, the new platform is at the core of the suite of 
trading tools and resources offered to clients.
Desktop platforms are complemented by mobile apps, and the 
business continues to invest in solutions that enable a seamless 
transition between desktop and mobile devices. Clients can also 
access extensive educational resources, in an engaging, interactive 
format, via our IG Academy app.
For more advanced and institutional clients, the business provides 
a range of professional technology, including a direct market access 
(DMA) platform, sophisticated technical analysis tools and web 
API solutions.
Service
Providing clients with the best service is at the heart of our 
corporate culture at IG. Our operating model and our offices 
around the world allow us to provide a 24-hour service to clients. 
In addition to our global network of offices, we have operations 
and development centres in Krakow and Bangalore that allow us to 
access the skills we need to support clients.
The business offers a range of free seminars and online tutorials 
for clients, and provides dedicated 24-hour support from our 
client services team. This team is fully trained to understand our 
products and how they are best suited to individual clients. Clients 
can contact IG client services through email and telephone, and 
personal interaction is IG’s preferred mode of communication. The 
business seeks to ensure that correspondence with clients is always 
clear and fair, and is never misleading. 
To ensure that clients are at the heart of the business, feedback 
is encouraged and IG offers clear channels for comments and 
complaints. The business closely monitors its service standards 
through key performance and risk indicators tracked in real time.

Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
The impact of the changing  
regulatory environment
IG operates in a highly regulated environment, which is continually 
evolving. In the last year, there has been a series of significant 
regulatory proposals, particularly from the UK and other European 
Union country regulators, to impose restrictions on the provision 
of leveraged products to retail clients, which were unexpected in 
their severity.
Over the last 43 years IG’s strategy has been one of differentiation 
within the industry, through its adherence to the highest regulatory 
standards and its focus on fair outcomes for clients. IG believes in 
robust, proportionate and consistently applied regulatory oversight 
of the CFD sector, and as such fully supports the regulatory 
objective to improve consumer outcomes across the industry.
The timeline for the determination of the final rules and their 
implementation in many of the geographic markets in which the 
Group operates remains uncertain. It is too early to determine 
precisely how consumers will react to these new rules and what the 
long-term outcome for the Company will be. IG has a history of 
innovation and flexibility, and a proven track record of deploying 
technology and skills to adapt its business in response to regulatory 
and market changes. In the Company’s experience, when tighter 
regulation has been applied appropriately, client outcomes 
have improved; the industry has become more sustainable and 
high-quality providers, like IG, have benefitted over the longer term.
More detail on regulatory change is included in the Chief Executive 
Officer’s Review on page 16.
The level of marketing spend, the 
effectiveness of marketing in attracting new 
clients, and the rate of client attrition
IG’s business model is based on generating a return from its services 
through transaction fees charged to clients. The level of revenue 
in any period is predominantly driven by the number of active 
clients the business serves in that period and the level of activity 
undertaken by each client. 
The Group invests in marketing each year to attract new clients, and 
seeks to retain clients through the provision of quality services and 
products. The number of unique active clients has been increasing 
for the last three years, with the number of new clients trading for 
the first time each year, together with the number of clients who 
returned to trading, exceeding the number who stopped trading. 
This trend has been a key driver of revenue growth.
The Group continues to focus on the effectiveness of its marketing, 
and manages the level of marketing spend to maintain an attractive 
payback on the investment. The level of marketing spend in any 
period varies according to the perceived opportunity to spend 
effectively, and changes in the level of marketing spend, in 
the effectiveness of that spend, or in the rate of client attrition 
and reactivation could have a significant effect on the Group’s 
future performance.
The level of investment in, and success of, 
new initiatives
The Group continues to identify opportunities to invest in new 
initiatives to further broaden its range of products and services 
and its geographic coverage. These investments tend to have a 
longer payback period than marketing investment, and the level 
of investment depends on the opportunities available. Financial 
performance in any one period can therefore be affected by the 
extent of such investment, and future performance will be affected 
by the success of such initiatives. 
The level of volatility in financial markets
IG’s business model is based on generating a return from its services 
through transaction fees charged to clients. The level of revenue 
in any period is predominantly driven by the number of active 
clients the business serves in that period and the level of activity 
undertaken by each client.
One factor affecting the ability to attract new clients and the 
willingness of clients to trade is the opportunities clients perceive 
are available to them in the markets. Higher levels of volatility in 
financial markets tends to generate trading opportunities, which 
support the Group’s efforts to attract new clients and the level 
of individual client trading activity. Measures of financial market 
volatility, such as the VIX index, have been at historically low levels 
over the last three years. It is expected that an increase in the 
general level of financial market volatility would be beneficial to 
the Group’s revenue, which is therefore partly dependent upon 
market conditions.
The UK’s exit from the European Union
The Group currently operates its business in the EU through 
branches of its UK-domiciled and regulated legal entities, under 
the passporting rules. Depending on the terms and nature of the 
arrangements under which the UK will leave the EU, the Group 
may need to establish one or more subsidiary entities domiciled 
and regulated within the EU. The Group has well-developed plans 
to deal with this requirement, although the necessity and timing 
of the requirement remain uncertain. The success of the Group 
in establishing appropriate structures through which to continue 
operating its business in the EU, including receiving relevant 
regulatory approvals, and the costs involved in establishing and 
running additional regulated entities, could have a significant 
impact on its future performance.

The backdrop this year was dominated by significant political 
events, including the UK’s EU referendum in June, the US 
presidential election in November and elections in key European 
countries in the second half of the year. However, the uncertainty 
these events created was not reflected in the financial markets, 
which, outside the specific events, displayed low levels of volatility. 
Although annual revenue was split almost equally between the two 
halves of the year, the quarterly performance was more variable. 
A weak first quarter was followed by a record second quarter 
(£133.4 million). The second half of the year also started quietly 
and recovered in the final quarter, with client trading levels peaking 
around the French and German elections.
UK
OTC leveraged revenue in this region grew 0.3% to £223.0 million 
(FY16: £222.3 million) and represented 45% of Group revenues. 
Active client numbers were up by 8% to 64,725 (FY16: 59,940). 
As previously outlined, the UK, due to the large installed client 
base that comes with the most mature market, responds more 
to volatility, both negatively and positively. In the quiet markets, 
this, along with the heavy client acquisition around the UK’s EU 
referendum and the US presidential election, meant that average 
revenue per client was down by 7% to £3,446 (FY16: £3,710).
An annual study of the UK’s retail leveraged trading industry was 
released in July 2017. The survey concluded that, although the retail 
leveraged trading market remains niche, the number of traders 
grew to 148,000 (2016: 138,000 – restated). The survey showed that 
IG’s primary market share of spread bettors fell slightly, from 46% 
to 45%, and its primary share of CFD traders fell from 27% to 24%. 
The measurement of primary market share is based on an estimate 
of the number of primary accounts, excluding partner agreements, 
and makes no allowance for client value. Therefore drawing precise 
conclusions about the share of total market revenue is difficult.
EMEA
OTC leveraged revenue grew 17% to £137.5 million in the  
2017 financial year (FY16: £117.3 million), which equates to 28% of 
the Group revenue. 
Active client numbers rose 10% to 45,903 (FY16: 41,566) and 
revenue per client was up 6% to £2,997 (FY16: £2,821). 
This region divides into two broad areas when analysing 
performance. Like the UK, the EU-based offices are more mature 
and generate a slower rate of growth than the newer, non-EU offices 
of Dubai, South Africa and Switzerland. In the non-EU offices, where 
the regulatory environment appears more stable, revenue almost 
doubled to £30.7 million. Active client numbers were also up in 
these countries by 22%, and revenue per client rose by 59%.
APAC
OTC leveraged revenue in the 2017 financial year grew by 9% to 
£114.1 million, against a prior year of £104.7 million. This was driven 
by a 3% growth in clients to 37,392 (FY16: 36,364) and a 6% rise in 
revenue per client to £3,051. Revenue in the second half of the year 
was 5% ahead of the first half.
US 
Revenue grew 26% over the period to £14.1 million  
(FY16: £11.2 million). Active member numbers were up by 47%  
and revenue per client was down by 14%.
Share dealing and investments 
Share dealing is now active in IG’s two largest markets of the UK and 
Australia, and is also offered in Austria, France, Germany, Ireland 
and the Netherlands. This is an important strategic product line for 
the UK business, which further engages our current client base.
Total client numbers in the year were up around 200% on FY16 
at 20,417 (FY16: 6,748). Revenue and first trades were also up by 
around 200% to £2.4 million and 18,188 respectively. This is partly 
down to ongoing growth in the UK and partly to the launch in 
Australia in July 2016.
The IG Smart Portfolio product was launched in the UK in  
April 2017, in partnership with BlackRock. This product seeks to 
take advantage of the growing market for low-cost passive portfolio 
investment products, and is based on BlackRock ETFs.

Employee remuneration costs 
Fixed employee remuneration costs increased by 15% to £95.5 million (2016: £83.3 million). This reflects an 8% increase in average 
headcount and a 6% increase in average cost per head. The increase in average headcount reflects investment in client-service roles; the 
additional headcount associated with DailyFX; and the dual-running of teams during the process of offshoring functions to the Group’s 
resource hub in Poland. The increase in the average cost per head reflects the introduction of flexible benefits; the impact of salary 
benchmarking and the increase in the GBP equivalent cost of non-UK staff, due to the weakening of GBP compared with most other 
currencies relative to the 2016 financial year. Variable employee remuneration costs reduced by 22%, due to lower discretionary bonus 
payments for staff in the 2017 financial year compared to those made for the prior year.

Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
Advertising and marketing costs 
Advertising and marketing costs increased by 30% to £64.5 million 
(2016: £49.7 million). The Group has continued to manage its 
external marketing spend, to drive client recruitment while keeping 
acquisition cost per client flat. The cost per first trade in the 2017 
financial year (excluding Nadex clients, and including irrecoverable 
VAT) was £1,172 (2016: £1,205). 
Depreciation and amortisation 
Depreciation and amortisation increased by £3.7 million to  
£16.4 million (2016: £12.7 million). The increase includes the  
£1.9 million amortisation of the investment in DailyFX, which 
delivers market-leading education, research, analysis and news 
focused on the FX markets, and which is a key part of our future 
marketing strategy. In addition, the charge in the 2017 financial 
year includes £1.6 million relating to the write-down of leasehold 
improvements and fixtures and fittings, as a result of the office 
refurbishment that took place during the year. 
Irrecoverable VAT and other sales taxes
The Group does not recover all of the input VAT and other sales 
taxes it incurs on its costs, and the £14.1 million charge in the 2017 
financial year reflects the amounts not recovered. The increase 
in irrecoverable VAT and sales taxes reflects the increase in costs 
in the year on which VAT and other sales taxes are charged – 
predominantly marketing and advertising costs. 
Regulatory fees
The Group is charged regulatory fees by the various regulators in 
the jurisdictions in which it operates, and in addition is required 
to make a contribution to the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme (FSCS) in the UK. The £3.4 million reduction in the cost 
of regulatory fees reflects the rebate the Group received during 
the 2017 financial year relating to FSCS levies paid in prior years, 
and the benefit from the actual FSCS levy for 2016 which was 
charged in FY16 being lower than the cost accrued. The charge for 
regulatory fees is expected to revert to the normal level in the 2018 
financial year.
Dividend policy
The business continues to be highly cash-generative, and the Board 
seeks to reflect this in the direct cash returns to shareholders. IG has 
a progressive dividend policy, and it remains the Board’s intention 
to pay out, as an ordinary dividend, approximately 70% of Group 
post-tax earnings. Accordingly, the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 22.88 pence per share, giving a full-year dividend 
of 32.3 pence per share, 3% higher than the 31.4 pence per 
share paid for the year to 31 May 2016, reflecting the increase in 
post-tax earnings.
Cash generation, investments and dividends
The Group uses own funds, and net own funds, generated from 
operations as its key measures of cash generation. The make-up of 
own funds is shown on the Balance Sheet in Note A, and the Own 
Funds cash flow is shown in note C of the Other Information section 
in the Financial Statements. 
Cash generation remains strong. Own funds generated from 
operations of £229.2 million (2016: £239.8 million), compares with 
operating profit of £213.4 million (2016: £207.6 million), with a cash 
conversion rate, calculated as own funds generated from operations 
divided by operating profit, of 107% (2016: 116%). The reduction in 
the conversion rate reflects the reduction in year-end bonus accruals 
at 31 May 2017 compared with the prior year-end. The Group 
continues to benefit from a net credit balance in working capital.
Capital expenditure in the year of £17.1 million includes  
£7.6 million relating to the purchase and development of intangible 
assets during the year, including the new web trading platform and 
new financial systems to improve the control environment for cash 
and client money. It also includes £10.5 million on tangible assets, 
including £2.8 million for the office refurbishment in London and 
£6.3 million for new and replacement IT hardware.
During the year the Group purchased the assets of DailyFX, a 
leading global news and research portal, from FXCM Inc. for  
$40.0 million (£32.7 million), with $4.0 million (£3.3 million) of this 
amount deferred for a year. 
Dividend payments to shareholders during the year to 31 May 2017 
of £118.7 million comprise the final dividend for the year to  
31 May 2016 of £84.1 million, as well as the interim dividend for the 
year to 31 May 2017 of £34.6 million.
The final dividend for the year to 31 May 2017 of £83.9 million will, 
if approved, be paid in October 2017.
The Group’s own funds of £614.3 million at the end of the year 
are £26.6 million higher than at the end of the prior year. This 
reflects the £17.8 million own funds cash flow after investments and 
dividends, and £8.8 million of FX translation benefit reflecting the 
increased GBP equivalent value of own funds in non-UK businesses.
Liquidity 
The Group’s total liquid assets at the end of year were  
£731.4 million (2016: £626.7 million). The increase in liquid  
assets reflects the increase in own funds, and the increase in  
client funds on the balance sheet to £117.1 million at 31 May 2017 
from £39.0 million at 31 May 2016. Client funds on the balance  
sheet include £60.0 million (2016: £25.5 million) deposited by 
clients under title transfer arrangements, and £57.1 million  
(2016: £13.5 million) of client deposits with IG Bank SA, the Group’s 
subsidiary in Switzerland. The Group does not currently use any of 
the Swiss Bank deposits for liquidity purposes.
The Group’s primary requirement for liquidity is for the margin it is 
required to deposit with its hedging brokers. The average broker 
margin requirement in the 2017 financial year was £286 million,  
£73 million higher than in the 2016 financial year, with a peak  
broker margin requirement of £367 million during the year.  
At 31 May 2017, the actual broker margin requirement was  
£356 million (2016: £228 million). 
The Group has access to a committed Revolving Credit Facility 
(RCF) of £160 million to assist in liquidity risk management. The 
Group draws down on its RCF during periods when broker margin 
is at elevated levels and in advance of events that could result in 
an elevated broker margin requirement, in order to reduce liquidity 
risk. During the year, draw downs of the facility were made ahead 
of three political events: the EU referendum on 23 June 2016, 
the US presidential elections on 8 November 2016 and the Italian 
referendum on 4 December 2016. These precautionary drawdowns 
were repaid after the event. In June 2017 the Group renewed the 
£160 million RCF with a syndicate of four UK banks. Of the  
£160 million, £60 million is available for three years, with  
£100 million available for 12 months.
Segregated client funds
At 31 May 2017 the Group held £1,215.3 million  
(2016: £917.3 million) of client money in segregated trust bank 
accounts, and £499.8 million (2016: £177.8 million) of client assets 
in third-party custodian accounts. These amounts are segregated 
client money and assets, and are therefore excluded from the 
balance sheet.
Regulatory capital resources
The calculation of the Group’s consolidated capital resources and 
capital ratio is shown in note E of the Other Information section in 
the Financial Statements. The Group’s capital ratio – resources as a 
percentage of the total requirement was 26.7% as at 31 May 2017, 
compared with the minimum ratio for the Group of 18.7%. The 
Group continues to have sufficient capital headroom.
Impact of changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates
IG offers its clients opportunities to trade in over 15,000 markets. 
Our clients have the opportunity to gain exposure to these markets 
in the natural currency of that market or, in many cases, their 
account currency. The Group hedges its exposure to the underlying 
markets and to currencies. The Group’s trading revenue from OTC 
leveraged derivatives is the aggregate of the transaction fees on 
many millions of individual client trades net of the transaction fees 
on hedging the exposures, which are also denominated in a number 
of currencies. These transactions are almost all booked in entities 
whose functional currency is GBP . It is impractical to isolate the 
effect that changes in foreign currency exchange rates have on the 
Group’s GBP reported revenue.
Around one third of the Group’s operating expenses are incurred 
in currencies other than GBP . Although it is possible to identify the 
effect that changes in foreign currency exchange rates have on the 
GBP reported costs, as it is not practical to do so on revenue, the 
Group accepts that it manages its earnings in GBP , and reports on 
and explains its results accordingly.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued
Other costs
The £11.0 million increase in other costs to £59.7 million reflects changes as follows:
Year ended 31 May 2017 Year ended 31 May 2016
Premises-related costs 13.2 12.1
Telephone and data 2.0 1.7
IT Maintenance and support 12.2 9.7
Market data 9.7 7.9
Legal and professional costs 8.0 6.8
Net charge for impaired trade receivables 3.0 1.6
Payment card charges 2.2 0.4
Other costs 9.4 8.5
59.7 48.7
The higher IT maintenance and support costs reflect investments made in data security and IT infrastructure. The higher market data costs 
reflect the growth in client numbers. The higher payment card charges are due to the increased volume of card payments by clients. 
Taxation
The effective rate of tax for the year ended 31 May 2017 was 20.8% – slightly lower than the effective rate of 21.0% for the prior year. The 
effective rate of tax has continued to benefit from the reduction in the standard rate of UK corporation tax, which reduced from 20% to 19% 
on 1 April 2017.
The vast majority of the Group’s taxable profit arises in the UK. An analysis of the tax charge by geographic segment is shown in note F of 
the Other Information section of the Financial Statements. The Group’s effective rate of tax remains dependent on the mix of taxable profit 
by geography, the availability and use of taxable losses and the tax rates levied in those geographies. The Group’s current estimate of the 
effective rate of tax for the year to 31 May 2018 is 20.5%.
The calculation of the Group’s tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgment, in particular with respect to certain items whose 
tax treatment cannot be finally determined until agreement has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share of 45.9 pence for the year to 31 May 2017 are 3% higher than the 44.6 pence for the year ended 31 May 2016. 
Diluted earnings per share is used as a primary measure of profitability and as a financial measure in relation to the Executive Director and 
senior management share plans. 35

RISK MANAGEMENT 
FRAMEWORK
IG has an established Risk Management Framework to identify, 
measure, manage and monitor the risks faced by the business, 
and to manage the risk that the Group’s conduct may pose to 
the achievement of fair outcomes for consumers or to the sound, 
stable, resilient and transparent operation of the financial markets. 
This framework provides the Board with assurance that IG’s risks, 
including the risks relating to the achievement of Group’s strategic 
objectives, are understood and managed in accordance with 
the appetite and tolerance levels set. It provides the basis for 
enabling the Group’s ongoing assessment and monitoring of capital 
adequacy and its liquidity risk management. The framework is 
established around the following elements:
• Risk culture
• Risk Principles
• Risk Taxonomy
• Risk Appetite Statement
• Risk management governance
• Risk assessment, monitoring, control and reporting
Risk culture
The Board recognises that embedding a sound risk culture 
is fundamental to the effective operation of the Group’s Risk 
Management Framework, and sets the tone for broader conduct in 
all business activities and for promoting a common set of IG values 
and expected behaviours.
The Group’s culture is defined by the shared values, attitudes, 
competencies and behaviours present throughout the business.  
A poor culture will inevitably lead to an increase in certain areas  
of risk. 
The Group seeks to achieve the implementation of its desired 
risk management culture through principles, policies and 
practices, including:
• The core Risk Principles set out below that drive risk 
management in IG 
• The firm’s Risk Appetite Statement that clearly defines the type 
and level of risk the Group is willing to accept in pursuit of 
its objectives
• The adoption of a comprehensive policy framework 
to ensure that all employees are aware of their risk 
management responsibilities
• The allocation of responsibility for identification, assessment, 
mitigation and reporting of risks to management across 
the business (including front office, control functions and 
executive management)
• A performance management process that links staff appraisals 
and remuneration to risk management and conduct
• Corporate communications that reinforce awareness and 
understanding of the Group’s desired risk management culture 
and associated policies
Risk Principles
The IG Risk Management Framework is driven by a set of core 
principles that set the context for risk management activities across 
the Group:
• Risk management should be clearly focused on enhancing 
shareholder value and supporting the achievement of the 
Group’s strategic objectives
• The approach to risk management should address the 
requirements and expectations of the firm’s key stakeholders 
(including clients and employees as well as investors 
and regulators)
• Risk and control oversight functions should be independent of 
business functions and supported by adequate resources
• The Board risk appetite should clearly articulate the types 
and amount of risk the Group is willing to accept in pursuit of 
its objectives
• Risk management should be fully embedded into all 
departments and business processes of the Group and managed 
as an integral part of day-to-day management
• Risk management activities should be appropriate for the 
level and complexity of the firm’s business activities and 
associated risks
• Risk management should be subject to continual review 
and enhancement to ensure that the Group’s Risk 
Management Framework remains effective and aligned to 
stakeholder expectations
Risk Taxonomy
IG has developed a Risk Taxonomy to ensure that the Group 
considers the full spectrum of risks faced by the business, and to 
create a single language for classifying risks in all risk management 
activities. The taxonomy categorises the principal risks faced 
by the Group into five areas: the risks inherent in the regulatory 
environment, the risks inherent in the commercial environment, 
business model risk, operational risk and conduct risk. Each of these 
areas of risk is considered below, with an overview of how IG seeks 
to manage them.
Risk Appetite Statement
The Group’s Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) defines the level of risk 
the IG Board is willing to take in pursuit of its business objectives 
and strategic goals. The RAS provides parameters within which the 
business can operate and facilitates an articulation of the business 
risks to relevant stakeholders. 
The statement contains a set of high-level principles and Key Risk 
Indicators (KRIs). These are a balance of quantitative and qualitative 
measures that provide an indication of increasing or reducing risk 
levels, designed to alert the Board and management that risk is 
approaching or has exceeded an acceptable level. This enables the 
triggering of an appropriate responsive action.
We use nine key financial and non-financial performance metrics to measure our performance 
and progress against the short-term and long-term goals of the business.

The Group’s risk appetite is set within IG’s overall risk capacity, 
at a level which considers the potential impact to IG’s various 
stakeholders. It articulates a high-level view of the maximum loss 
or exposure the firm is willing to accept with respect to each of its 
principal risks.
The RAS provides a benchmark for calibrating the risk limits and 
indicators which operationally define the levels of exposure the firm 
can take on (eg the market risk exposure limits), as well as the levels 
of loss the firm can sustain without needing to escalate and take 
action. These indicators are monitored daily and reported weekly to 
the Executive Risk Committee and monthly in the Board Report.
RISK MANAGEMENT 
GOVERNANCE
The Group’s risk management governance structure is 
summarised below.
The Board
The Board has overall responsibility for the management of risk 
within the Group. This includes determining the Group’s risk 
appetite, which sets out the nature and extent of the principal 
risks it is willing to take in achieving its objectives, and defining 
the standards and expectations that drive the Group’s risk culture. 
It also involves ensuring that the Group maintains an appropriate 
and effective Risk Management Framework, and monitoring 
performance and risk indicators to ensure that the Group remains 
within its risk appetite. The Board delegates certain risk governance 
responsibilities to Board Committees. 
Board Risk Committee
The Board Risk Committee provides the principal forum for the 
ongoing review and evaluation of specific elements of the Risk 
Management Framework and for making recommendations to 
the Board as appropriate. To exercise these responsibilities, 
the Committee:
• Considers the risk appetite and KRIs and recommends for 
approval by the Board
• Reviews and challenges the Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ICAAP), Individual Liquidity Adequacy 
Assessment (ILAA) and Recovery Plan
• Reviews the Group’s major risk exposures, oversees rigorous 
stress-testing and scenario-testing of the Group’s business, and 
ensures that a sufficient level of risk mitigation is in place
• Considers the adequacy and effectiveness of the technology 
infrastructure and supporting documentation in the Risk 
Management Framework
• Considers the adequacy and effectiveness of the second line of 
defence risk management function
• Provides input to the Remuneration Committee on the alignment 
of the remuneration policy to risk performance
Audit and Remuneration Committees
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include reviewing the 
Group’s internal controls and risk management systems in the 
performance of its duties, as well as the assessment of the 
control environment through the review of internal audit activities 
and of the progress on implementing internal and external 
audit recommendations. The Audit Committee has a specific 
responsibility to assess the accuracy and appropriateness of 
financial reporting and narrative disclosures, the Group’s tax risk 
management, the control environment for client money and assets, 
and legal entity governance.
The Remuneration Committee’s primary responsibility in relation 
to risk management is to ensure that remuneration policies are 
consistent with effective risk management across the Group, and 
to consider the implications of those elements of the policies on 
risk and risk management. The Committee reviews the design 
and operation of performance-related pay schemes to ensure 
their effectiveness and, with the assistance of the Board Risk 
Committee, that the risks of the schemes are adequately monitored 
and controlled.
Risk management within the business
IG operates a ‘three lines of defence’ risk governance model.
First line of defence
The first line of defence has primary responsibility for risk 
management, including day-to-day responsibility for ensuring 
that the business operates within risk appetite. Management is 
responsible for the identification, assessment and management 
of risks facing the business, in compliance with the firm’s risk 
management policies. 
The Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, 
provides advice and support to management in the monitoring of 
the day-to-day management of the Group’s operations.
The Executive Risk Committee supports the risk function and 
operational management in the day-to-day operation of risk 
management. The Committee meets weekly. The frequency of 
Committee meetings reflects the corporate commitment of senior 
management to play an active role in day-to-day management and 
control of risk. This sets the tone across IG that risk management 
is central to corporate culture. The Committee oversees the 
day-to-day risk management activity across the Group, receives, 
analyses and evaluates risk management information, and addresses 
specific risk management issues as they arise.
The Client Money and Assets Committee has specific 
responsibilities with respect to risk management activities relating to 
the segregation of client money and assets.
Second line of defence
The second line of defence, independent risk oversight, is provided 
by the risk, compliance and other control functions. These are 
independent from operational management in the first line, 
and responsible for overseeing and challenging the business in 
managing its risks day-to-day. This includes maintaining the Group’s 
risk management and control policies, providing independent 
analysis control of the Group’s risks and keeping abreast of industry 
and regulatory developments that might require enhancements to 
the Group’s Risk Management Framework.
Third line of defence
The third line of defence, independent assurance, is provided 
by internal audit. The primary role of internal audit is to help the 
Board and executive management to protect the assets, reputation 
and sustainability of the organisation by providing independent, 
objective assurance reviews designed to add value and improve our 
operations. The scope of the annual audit plan includes reviews of 
the firm’s Risk Management Framework and the management of the 
firm’s principal risks. These will include assessments of the design 
and operating effectiveness of the internal governance structures 
and processes, the setting of and adherence to risk appetite and the 
risk and control culture of the organisation.
Risk assessment, monitoring, control  
and reporting
Risk assessment, monitoring and control are the responsibility of 
operational management in each area. Risk and control assessments 
are undertaken with support from the second and third lines of 
defence, and key controls are identified and documented.
Risk reporting is undertaken daily, with several reports covering key 
market, credit, liquidity and capital adequacy metrics. 
A weekly risk dashboard is presented to the Executive Risk 
Committee and provides key metrics and commentary covering 
market, credit, liquidity and operational risk exposures, including 
stress-testing results. The dashboard also provides a review of 
clients with significant exposures and a summary of operational 
incidents and associated remedial actions.
The monthly Board risk report sets out a suite of metrics covering 
capital adequacy, liquidity and key risk exposures. This includes 
summaries of market risk performance, credit provisions and debt 
experience, and operational risk metrics. The report also contains 
specific metrics on conduct risk, information security and cyber risk. 
The metrics each have defined tolerance thresholds linked to the 
Group’s risk appetite that require escalation and action where amber 
or red thresholds are reached.
The Group undertakes a quarterly review of its regulatory capital 
and liquidity position, including a review of Pillar 2 risks and 
scenarios used to assess the Group’s projected capital position 
under stress scenarios, through the ICAAP and ILAA processes.
Principal risks
IG’s Risk Taxonomy categorises the principal risks faced by the firm 
into five areas: the risks inherent in the regulatory environment, the 
risks inherent in the commercial environment, business model risk, 
operational risk and conduct risk. The major risks identified within 
each of these areas are summarised in the table below, and overleaf 
we provide an overview of how IG seeks to manage them.

Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
Regulatory environment risk
IG operates in a highly regulated environment which is continually 
evolving. IG defines regulatory environment risk as the risk that 
the regulatory environment in any of the jurisdictions in which 
the Group currently operates, or may wish to operate in, changes 
in a way that has an adverse effect on the Group’s business or 
operations, through reduction in revenue, increases in costs or 
increases in capital and liquidity requirements. 
The Group operates to the highest regulatory standards and leads 
the industry in the way in which it deals with its clients. The Group 
maintains a strong relationship with its key regulators and an active 
dialogue with them to keep abreast of impending regulatory 
developments. In the last year, there has been a series of significant 
regulatory proposals, particularly from UK and other European 
Union country regulators, to impose restrictions on the provision of 
leveraged products to retail clients. The proposals have included 
a range of measures from leverage restrictions, requirements 
for additional risk warnings, restrictions and bans on marketing, 
and outright bans on the provision of CFDs and binary options. 
The timeframes for the final rules from some of the consultation 
processes are uncertain. 
The Group has responded to all relevant consultations, with each 
of the regulatory proposals analysed in depth. A comprehensive 
analysis has been presented to regulators through a series of 
detailed response documents and consultation meetings. The 
Group has engaged with a broad range of interested parties to 
explain its stance on the issues raised. Where applicable, in addition 
to the comprehensive analysis in support of the firm’s position 
on each issue, IG has put forward alternative rule changes that 
it considers would be more likely to achieve the outcomes that 
regulators are seeking to achieve.
The Board has been actively involved in overseeing the formation 
and execution of IG’s response to these proposals, receiving regular 
updates from the Executive Committee advising on the regulatory 
and legal position and appropriate response strategy.
Within regulatory environment risk, the Group also includes the 
risk of significant adverse changes in the way in which the Group 
itself, or the Group’s business, is subject to taxation. Examples of 
the tax risk faced by the business include the risk of the imposition 
of a financial transactions tax, which could severely impact the 
economics of trading, and the risk that the basis under which the 
Group is taxed, in any of the jurisdictions in which it operates, 
changes adversely.
Commercial risk
The Group defines commercial risk as the risk that the Group’s 
performance is affected by a failure to adopt or implement an 
effective business strategy, by new or existing competitors offering 
more attractive products or services, or by a prolonged period of 
adverse market conditions.
The Group seeks to mitigate its strategic management risk through 
the Board’s regular, thorough review and challenge of the Group’s 
strategy and the performance of the various strategic initiatives 
taken. The Board holds an annual strategy day to consider and 
agree the strategic priorities for the business. The Board also 
considers specific strategic actions and initiatives during its normal 
schedule of Board meetings.
The Group’s strategy will be reviewed again in the context 
of the outcome of the various regulatory consultation papers 
discussed above.
The Group operates in a highly competitive environment, including 
from some unregulated and illegal operators. The Group seeks 
to mitigate competitor risk by maintaining a clear distinction in 
the market in terms of product, service and ethics, and by closely 
monitoring the activity and performance of its competitors, 
including detailed comparison of the terms of the product offers.
IG regards itself as the leader in its market, and given the Group’s 
strong ethical values, unlike some of its competitors, the Group 
does not deploy questionable practices that can be commercially 
attractive to clients (such as offering excessive leverage). However, 
the Group seeks to ensure that its product offering remains 
attractive, taking into account the other benefits that the Group 
offers its clients, including brand, strength of technology and client 
service quality. This allows the business to provide a competitive 
offering overall and manage competitor risk without compromising 
the Group’s values.
The Group’s trading revenue reflects the transaction fees paid 
by clients less the transaction costs incurred in hedging market 
exposures. The extent of client trading activity and the number of 
active clients in any period are the key determinants of revenue in 
that period. The ability to attract new clients and the willingness 
of clients to trade depends upon the level of opportunities clients 
perceive are available to them in the markets. The Group’s revenue 
is therefore partly dependent upon market conditions.
The Group seeks to mitigate market conditions risk through detailed 
review of daily revenue analysis, monthly financial information and 
other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and regular reforecasts 
of its expected financial performance reflecting the latest and 
expected market conditions. The Group uses these forecasts to 
determine actions necessary to manage performance in the context 
of market conditions.
The Group updates its investors and market analysts on its revenue 
performance on a regular basis, including quarterly updates and 
pre-close statements, and engages with investors and market 
analysts to manage the risk that the impact of market conditions is 
reflected in performance expectations.
Business model risk
IG defines business model risk as the risks faced by the Group 
arising from the nature of its business and its business model, 
including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital 
adequacy risk.
Market risk (audited)
IG takes market risk for the purpose of facilitating instant 
execution of client trades. The business manages this market risk 
by internalising client flow (allowing clients’ trades to offset each 
other) and hedging when the residual exposures reach defined 
limits. The Group’s real-time market position-monitoring system 
allows it to monitor its market exposure against its market risk limits 
continuously. If exposures exceed pre-determined limits, hedging is 
undertaken to bring the exposure back to the limit.
IG has a Market Risk Policy which sets out how the business 
manages its market risk exposures. The Market Risk Policy 
incorporates a methodology for setting market position limits, 
consistent with the Group’s risk appetite, for each financial market 
in which the Group’s clients can trade, as well as certain groups of 
markets or assets which the business considers to be correlated. 
These limits are determined with reference to the expected liquidity 
and volatility of the underlying financial product or asset class, and 
represent the maximum long and short client exposure the Group 
will hold without hedging the net client exposure.
The Group sets its market risk limits with the objective of achieving 
the optimal trade-off between allowing clients’ trades to be 
internalised, the cost of hedging and the variability of daily 
revenue. The Group seeks to manage its market risk so that its 
trading revenue predominantly reflects client transaction fees net of 
hedging costs, and is not driven by market risk gains or losses.
The market risk that arises as a result of offering binary contracts, 
options and guaranteed stops for clients is difficult or not 
cost-effective to hedge, and there is often no direct underlying 
market which can be utilised in setting the price which the 
Group quotes. The Group normally undertakes no hedging for 
these markets, but can hedge specific positions if considered 
necessary. The Group aims to reduce the volatility of revenue 
from these markets by offering a large number of different trading 
opportunities, the results of which should, to some extent, offset 
each other irrespective of the underlying market outcome. 
The Group monitors its market risk exposures on a real-time basis as 
well as through regular stress-testing and scenario-testing to analyse 
the impact of potential stress events, and takes action to reduce its 
risk exposures and those of its clients as appropriate.
Credit risk (audited)
IG faces the risk that either a client or a financial counterparty fails 
to meet their obligations to IG, resulting in a financial loss. 
As a result of offering leveraged trading products, IG accepts that 
client credit losses can arise as a cost of its business model. Client 
credit risk principally arises when a client’s total funds deposited 
with the Group are insufficient to cover any trading losses incurred. 
In addition, a small number of clients are granted credit limits to 
cover running losses on open trades and margin requirements. 
Client credit risk is managed through the application of the firm’s 
Client Credit Risk Policy.
The business sets margin requirements that reflect the market price 
risk for each instrument, and uses tiered margining so that larger 
positions are subject to proportionately higher margin requirements. 
The business offers training and education to clients covering all 
aspects of trading and risk management, which encourages them 
to collateralise their accounts at an appropriate level in excess 
of the minimum requirement. In addition to cash, the Group also 
accepts collateral in the form of shares from clients with a share 
dealing account.
The business further mitigates client credit risk through the real-time 
monitoring of client positions via the close-out monitor (COM), and 
by giving clients the ability to set a level at which an individual deal 
will be closed (the ‘stop’ level or ‘guaranteed stop’ level). We also 
require less experienced clients to use limited risk accounts, while 
offering the option of a limited risk account to all other clients.
The COM is an automated liquidation process which automatically 
identifies accounts that have broken the liquidation threshold. 
Where client losses are such that their total equity falls below the 
specified liquidation level, positions will be liquidated, resulting in 
reduced credit risk exposure for the Group.
Clients placing trades with guaranteed stop levels pay a small 
premium in the event that the stop is triggered. With a guaranteed 
stop, the maximum loss is known at the point of trade. The Group’s 
limited risk account combines this trade-by-trade protection with 
the assurance that a client can never lose more than the total 
amount of equity they hold in their account.
The COM, client-initiated ‘stops’ and limited risk accounts all result 
in the transfer of an element of the market risk from the client to 
the Group. This market risk arises following the closure of a client 
position, as the Group (subject to the market risk limits discussed 
above) may hold a corresponding hedging position that will, 
assuming sufficient market liquidity, be unwound.
IG has significant financial exposure to a number of financial 
institutions, owing to the placement of financial assets at banks and 
the hedging of market risk in the wholesale markets, which requires 
the Group to place margin with its hedging brokers.
Financial institution credit risk is managed through the application 
of the Group’s Counterparty Credit Management Policy.
Financial institution counterparties are subject to a credit review 
when a new relationship is entered into, and this is updated 
semi-annually (or more frequently as required, eg upon changes to 
the financial institution’s corporate structure). Proposed maximum 
exposure limits for these financial institutions, reflecting their credit 
rating and systemic position, are reviewed and approved by the 
Executive Risk Committee.
The Group actively manages the credit exposure to each of its 
broking counterparties, settling or recalling balances at each broker 
on a daily basis in line with the collateral requirements. As part of its 
management of concentration risk, the Group is also committed to 
maintaining multiple brokers for each asset class. 
The Group is responsible under various regulatory regimes for the 
stewardship of client monies. These responsibilities include the 
appointment of and periodic review of institutions with which client 
money is deposited. The Group’s general policy is that all financial 
institution counterparties holding client money accounts must have 
minimum short and long-term ratings of A-2 and A- respectively, 
although in some operating jurisdictions where accounts are 
maintained to provide local banking facilities for clients, it can 
be problematic to find a banking counterparty satisfying these 
minimum ratings requirements. In such cases the Group may use a 
locally systemically important institution. These criteria also apply 
for the Group’s own bank accounts held with financial institutions.
In addition, the majority of deposits are made on an overnight 
or breakable term basis which enables the Group to react 
immediately to any deterioration in credit quality, and deposits of an 
unbreakable nature or requiring notice are only held with a subset 
of counterparties which have been approved by the Executive 
Risk Committee.
Liquidity risk (audited)
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial 
obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure it has 
sufficient liquidity to meet its broker margin requirements and other 
financial liabilities when due, under both normal circumstances and 
stressed conditions. These liquidity requirements must be met from 
the Group’s own liquidity resources, as client money cannot be used 
for its operations. 
The Group holds liquid assets to enable the funding of broker 
margin requirements, to ensure that appropriate prudent margins 
and buffers are held in segregated client money accounts in order 
to fully protect clients’ funds and assets to support the growth 
of the business and its need for capital, and to maintain a liquid 
assets buffer.

Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
The Group manages its liquidity centrally, and key liquidity 
decisions are discussed at the Executive Committee and Executive 
Risk Committee.
The Group carries out an Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment 
(‘ILAA’) each year, and while this applies specifically to the Group’s 
FCA-regulated entities, (as liquidity is centrally managed through 
these entities), this process provides the context for determining 
the mitigating actions that would be taken in the event of stressed 
liquidity conditions for the whole Group.
The Group uses a number of measures for managing day-to-day 
liquidity risk, including the level of total liquid assets of same-day 
available cash and forecasted cash requirements. 
The Group is required to fund margin payments to brokers on 
demand. Broker margin requirements are driven by the gross 
hedging positions held by the Group. The value of these positions 
and the margin requirements are in turn driven by the number 
of active clients, the level of client activity, the make-up of the 
total client exposure, exchange rates, interest rates and the value 
of instruments.
In addition to its liquid assets the Group mitigates its liquidity risk 
through maintaining access to committed unsecured bank facilities. 
The Group regularly stress-tests its liquidity forecasts to validate the 
appropriate level of facilities it holds, and draws down on the facility 
at least once during each year to test the process for accessing 
that liquidity.
The Group produces detailed short-term liquidity forecasts 
and stress-tests, such that appropriate management actions or 
liquidity facility draw-down can occur prior to a period of expected 
liquidity demands.
Capital adequacy risk
The Group seeks to ensure that it has sufficient capital to operate 
its business successfully and to meet regulatory requirements. 
The Group manages its capital resources with the objectives of 
facilitating business growth, maintaining its dividend policy and 
complying with the regulatory capital resources requirement set by 
the FCA and other global regulators in jurisdictions in which the 
Group’s entities operate.
The Group undertakes an annual Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which it assesses its capital 
requirements, including through a series of stress-testing scenarios. 
The ICAAP document is reviewed and challenged by the Executive 
Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee and is then 
reviewed, challenged and approved by the Board.
The firm monitors its capital resources and capital requirements 
daily, calculating the credit and market risk requirements based on 
the exposures at the end of each business day, to assess the total 
capital requirement and available headroom. The firm maintains 
an additional internal warning indicator threshold with its Board 
performance reporting, and breaches, if any, would be escalated to 
the Board with a recommendation for appropriate remedial action. 
IG operates a regulated business and is required to hold sufficient 
regulatory capital at the Group level, as well as in each individual 
regulated entity, to cover its risk exposures.
The Group is supervised on a consolidated basis by the UK’s 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In addition to its two UK 
FCA-regulated entities, the Group’s operations in Australia, Japan, 
Singapore, South Africa, United States, Switzerland and Dubai are 
regulated on an entity basis. Individual capital requirements in each 
regulated entity are taken into account when managing the Group’s 
capital resources.
Operational risk
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people activities, systems or 
external events. IG includes, within operational risk, the risk that the 
Group is unable to attract and retain the staff it requires to operate 
its business successfully.
IG recognises that operational risk arises in the execution of all 
activities undertaken by the Group, and identifies and manages 
operational risk in four categories: technology risk, people risk, 
process risk and risk from external events.
The Group continues to develop its operational risk framework to 
ensure visibility of risks and controls, clear accountability for controls 
and escalation and reporting mechanisms, through which risk events 
are identified and managed and appropriate action is taken to 
improve controls.
The Group is rolling out its Risk and Control Self-Assessment 
(RCSA) methodology, focused on areas of the business identified 
as a priority, and has introduced a new operational risk event 
self-reporting process which provides increased visibility over events 
and control actions to be taken, which are monitored through a 
consolidated Control Action List.
Technology risk
IG is heavily dependent on technology to supply its service to 
clients and to run its internal processes. Technology risk is managed 
through the Group’s Technology Risk Management Framework, 
and is overseen by the Group’s Technology Risk Committee. The 
Group seeks to manage system outage risk through processes 
for prevention, including capacity assessment and management 
of single points of failure, processes for detection of emerging 
system or application hotspots using real-time monitoring systems, 
and processes for correction with a well-established incident 
management process embedded in the Group.
Information security is managed by a dedicated information security 
team. The threat of attacks from outside the Group, such as DDoS 
and hacking, are managed through several layers of control to 
provide in-depth defence, including volumetric scrubbing, multiple 
firewalls, an intrusion detection system and anti-virus scanners to 
block incoming emails containing malware. The Group undertakes 
regular penetration tests to detect vulnerabilities, and receives 
intelligence on emerging threats from an external organisation. 
Information security risks from inside the Group, such as virus 
outbreaks and data loss, are managed through several layers of 
controls, including data loss prevention controls to detect leakage 
of sensitive data and the application of network policies, end-point 
protection and proxy servers.
People risk
IG is dependent upon attracting and retaining the staff it requires 
to operate its business successfully, and has an established HR 
management framework with processes and controls to manage 
that risk.
The Group’s people strategy has four themes: clarity and 
measurement, focused on creating clear policies and measurement 
to shape and track how people are performing; performance 
and reward, to ensure that people are motivated to deliver high 
performance; talent and growth, to enable individuals to develop 
to their full potential; and working environment, to enable teams 
and the Group as a whole to operate in a constructive and 
collaborative way.
The Group operates a clear set of controls and a range of 
indicators to manage, monitor and mitigate people risk. This 
includes an annual employee engagement survey, performance 
check-ins, measurement and analysis of employee turnover, talent 
identification, succession and development planning and internal 
recruitment. New employees are subject to pre-work checks.
The Group has undertaken a significant programme of work to 
develop and communicate the Group’s vision and values that is 
intended to promote a cohesive, positive and progressive culture to 
support the delivery of the Group’s business objectives.
Within people risk, the Group also identifies the risk of loss 
intentionally or unintentionally caused by an employee, such 
as employee error and employee misdeeds, issues relating to 
employment, including disputes, and risks relating to employment 
law, health and safety and HR practices. If policies are breached, 
or employees behave inappropriately, the Group has a disciplinary 
framework to address and resolve issues.
Process risk
The Group faces risks related to the design, execution and 
maintenance of key processes, including process governance, 
clarity of roles, process design and execution. Process risk also 
includes record-keeping failures, regulatory compliance failures and 
reporting failures.
Management are responsible for implementing an appropriate 
control framework and ensuring that all staff are aware of their 
responsibilities. It does this through the maintenance of policy and 
procedure documents, training, risk and control self-assessments 
that identify key controls and highlight areas for improvement, and 
the production and review of appropriate management information.
Financial reporting risk is managed by the finance function. 
The Audit Committee receives papers and presentations from 
both finance management and External Auditors to allow the 
Committee to assess the integrity of financial reporting, and 
to conclude whether the presentation of financial information 
externally, including through the Annual Report, is fair, balanced 
and understandable.
Regulatory compliance and record-keeping risk is managed 
by the compliance function. Compliance keeps an up-to-date 
understanding of regulatory requirements and maintains policies to 
ensure that IG continues to comply with its regulatory obligations, 
including AML and KYC, account opening and client on-boarding, 
PEP and sanctions, gifts and hospitality and conflicts of interest. 
The established compliance monitoring programme is designed 
to, among other matters, detect any failure of the Group to comply 
with its regulatory obligations. 
External events risk
The Group faces the risk of loss as a result of damage to physical 
and non-physical property or assets, or the inability to access 
property or operate its business arising from natural or non-natural 
external causes.
The protection of property and other assets from external events 
is managed through a mix of risk avoidance, risk mitigation, 
operational controls and risk transfer mechanisms. The Group has 
well-developed security, business continuity and disaster recovery 
procedures in place, commensurate with the scale and nature of the 
operations it has in particular locations. The Group’s key operational 
hubs are supported by appropriate disaster-recovery facilities. 
The Group has a global insurance programme in place to cover a 
number of insurable risks, and reviews this programme annually.
Conduct risk
IG recognises and manages the risk that the Group’s conduct 
may pose to the achievement of fair outcomes for consumers, or 
to the sound, stable, resilient and transparent operation of the 
financial markets. The Group has implemented a conduct risk 
strategy that aims to analyse the conduct risks that may arise, and 
sets out how those risks are managed and mitigated. It also sets 
out specific controls used to manage conduct risk. The Group 
seeks to ensure that all employees are aware of the importance of 
managing conduct risk through programme conduct risk training 
and awareness.
The Group manages and monitors the risk of clients failing to 
understand the functionality of our products and suffering poor 
outcomes. The Group recognises that some of its products are not 
appropriate for some consumers and operates a process to identify 
potential new clients for whom the product may not be appropriate. 
The Group supports clients with education and training, and 
offers account types that limit a customer’s risk. Such accounts are 
mandatory for less experienced and less wealthy clients. Client 
outcomes are monitored and reported to the Board.
The Group recognises the risk of causing poor market outcomes if 
proper controls are not in place, for example, to detect instances 
of market abuse which must then be reported on. Clients may also 
attempt to use IG to commit fraud or launder money, and the Group 
has designed its systems, controls and monitoring programmes to 
mitigate and detect such issues.
The Group recognises the risk that the actions of its staff can result 
in poor outcomes for clients, or the financial markets. The Group 
seeks to ensure that its staff are appropriately trained, managed 
and incentivised to ensure that their behaviour and activities do not 
inadvertently result in poor outcomes for clients or the markets.
The compliance function operates a compliance monitoring 
programme and a series of ‘deep dive’ reviews to assess conduct 
risk in specific areas or processes. The Group also reviews 
remuneration policies and incentive schemes to ensure that they are 
appropriate and conducive to good conduct by staff.

The UK Corporate Governance Code requires the Directors to 
make a statement regarding the viability of the Group, including 
explaining how they have assessed the Group’s prospects, the 
period of time over which they have made the assessment and why 
they consider that period to be appropriate. 
The Group has a forecasting and planning cycle consisting of 
a strategic plan, an annual budget for the current year and 
financial projections for a further three years. The output from 
this business-planning process is used in the Group’s capital 
and liquidity planning, and the most recent forecasts are for the 
four-year period ending May 2021.
The four-year forecasting period is the length of time over which 
the Board strategically assesses the business, is the period of time 
the Board would typically look to pay back investments, and is the 
period over which the Board reviews its regulatory capital resources 
and requirements.
The first year of the planning period has a greater degree of 
certainty and is therefore used to set detailed financial targets 
across the Group, and is also used by the Remuneration Committee 
to set targets for the annual incentive scheme. Caution about the 
degree of certainty needs to be exercised, however, due to a lack 
of clarity about the detail and impact of final rules that may be 
implemented by our regulators, and the timing of implementation.
The further three-year period provides less certainty of outcome, 
but provides a robust planning tool against which strategic 
decisions can be made. These forecasts are also considered 
when setting targets for the executive and senior management 
share plans.
The Group undertakes stress-testing on these forecasts and through 
the ILAA, ICAAP and Recovery Plan, providing the Board with a 
robust assessment of the potential consequences of principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency and liquidity. 
The types of scenarios used include the impact of major regulatory 
changes; the collapse of a major financial services firm; major 
currency appreciation; and cyber-attacks. Additionally, the 
Group has undertaken reverse stress-testing to understand the 
circumstances under which the Group’s business model is no longer 
viable. With appropriate management actions, the results of these 
stresses showed that the Group was resilient to all severe but 
plausible scenarios, and would be able to withstand the impact.
Given the potential changes to the regulatory landscape in which 
the Group operates, as well as the uncertain consequences of 
Brexit, there is a range of potential outcomes. Four-year forecasts 
have therefore been prepared on different scenarios, including 
one that assumes all of the proposals from each of the consultation 
papers published by our regulators are enacted, and that there are 
no cost-reduction actions from management. 
Overall, the Directors consider the Group is well-placed to manage 
its business risks successfully, having taken into account the current 
economic outlook, the consequences of principal risks facing the 
business in severe but plausible scenarios, and the effectiveness of 
any mitigating actions on the Group’s profitability and liquidity.
On the basis of these and other matters considered and reviewed 
by the Board during the year, the Directors have reasonable 
expectations that the Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the four-year period 
ending 31 May 2021.
After over 40 years in business, we understand that sustainable 
long-term returns stem from good conduct – whether that be in the 
way we treat our clients and our employees, or the way we interact 
with the markets and our regulators. In all our relationships we seek 
to act with integrity and transparency, maintaining a reputation 
for professionalism and ethical practice along with a constant 
determination to do things better.
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS
Our conduct as a business is driven by much more than simply 
compliance with risk or regulatory requirements. This is reflected in 
the shared values that underpin all our attitudes and behaviours: 
• Champion the client
• Lead the way
• Love what we do
Our values provide the foundation for our future growth and 
success, and they give us an ongoing focus in our day-to-day work. 
We recognise the importance of defining and communicating these 
values to all of our people, providing them with a strong framework 
and direction. As well as helping our employees to realise our 
overall vision, this helps ensure that good conduct remains at the 
core of our culture.
We are conscious of the risk that poor conduct presents to our 
clients, our business model and the wider financial industry. For this 
reason, we have actively developed a risk management strategy 
and embedded various quantitative and qualitative measures to 
identify, measure, manage and monitor conduct risk. Our strategic 
initiatives include producing monthly Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and 
dashboards for conduct risk, along with a rolling plan of thematic 
conduct risk reviews and formalised conduct consideration before 
project sign-off.
In this way we ensure effective communication of the tone from the 
top throughout the organisation. We apply high standards across 
our businesses, and specifically in our corporate governance – as set 
out in the Corporate Governance Report and the Directors’ Report, 
in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
sections below demonstrate how we do this in practice.
Commitment to our customers
Ensuring fair client outcomes is at the core of our business model 
and strategy. To achieve this, it is crucial that we continually strive 
to understand our clients’ needs and the way that they view 
and interact with our products and services. We regularly seek 
and review feedback from our clients, as well as monitoring the 
outcomes they receive. This enables us to develop our products and 
services to meet the needs of retail traders and investors globally, 
and to provide our non-leveraged clients with the right tools and 
services to help them create, grow and protect their portfolios. 
We have made a number of pioneering changes to our product 
offerings, with the best interests of our clients at their heart. These 
include the market-leading features of our limited risk accounts, 
the expansion of our longer-term investment product offering and, 
crucially, the way we onboard clients and assess the appropriateness 
of our products for them.
We are committed to investing in process, training and 
improvements to our culture, to prevent poor customer experiences 
and to address root causes where any practice falls short. We 
maintain this policy even when it may have a negative impact on our 
own revenue or costs.
Central to our commitment to our customers is the quality of 
our order execution, and our investment in the technology and 
monitoring behind it. We process 100% of active client trades 
automatically. We never re-quote prices and, outside our set margin 
of tolerance, our innovative price-improvement technology enables 
customers to receive a better price if one becomes available as a 
trade is executed. 
Client support and education
We provide extensive educational resources for our clients, 
including an introduction programme that promotes responsible 
trading, an interactive educational app and a wide range of 
seminars and webinars. We continually look to keep this content 
engaging and targeted towards our clients’ needs.
Based on client feedback, and following the launch of our in-house 
TV studio in 2014, we increased the amount of original video 
content we supply for this purpose. Clients can now get instant 
access to expert tutorials, which cover everything from fundamental 
trading concepts to risk management.
We also provide an extensive range of trading tools, such as regular 
free news, commentary and analysis on IG TV and via the News 
and Analysis section of our website. We offer charting packages 
and various technical analysis tools that enable our clients to screen 
markets for trading opportunities and to receive alerts when trading 
signals appear.
OUR COMMITMENT
A sense of responsibility manifests itself in everything we do. It has 
underpinned our conduct as a business since our inception, playing 
an instrumental role in the growth and success of IG and the leading 
standards we have set in the industry.
Protecting our clients’ data, funds and assets
We prioritise the security of our clients’ information and have 
achieved the ISO 27001:2005 certificate for information 
security management.
We fully segregate client funds for retail individuals, in compliance 
with relevant regulations, and we hold segregated client money 
and assets entirely separately from our own money across a diverse 
range of banks. This ensures that, in the event of our default, client 
funds and assets would be returned to the clients rather than being 
treated as a recoverable asset by our general creditors.
We continue to engage PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to conduct 
ongoing independent reviews of our controls and procedures for 
client money calculation and segregation (ISAE 3000). In committing 
to this review process we have taken an additional step, over 
and above standard audit checks and our regulators’ reporting 
requirements. This reflects our dedication to keeping our clients’ 
funds secure and delivering beneficial outcomes for customers.
Appropriateness
Regulators are demonstrating an ever-growing recognition of the 
risks to consumers posed by poor practices in the industry. As a 
market leader, we have always prided ourselves in setting higher 
standards than our peers and those required by regulation, and 
we believe the industry would benefit from the elimination of 
poor practices.
We recognise that good conduct is particularly vital in relation  
to marketing and client recruitment, to encourage fair  
consumer outcomes.

|  IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017 44 IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017  |
Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
Conscious that our products are not right for everyone, we have 
a number of procedures that ensure the appropriateness of our 
products for clients. We follow strict guidelines to ensure that we 
only promote our services to a target audience within appropriate 
sectors and demographic groups. We also conduct rigorous checks 
to ensure that all promotions are clear, fair and not misleading, 
and that risks are not downplayed compared to the benefits of 
our products.
Before we allow a prospective client to open a CFD trading or 
spread betting account, we carry out comprehensive assessments 
to determine whether it is appropriate for them. Over the last year 
we have reviewed this assessment process and implemented some 
fundamental changes. We actively question applicants about their 
knowledge and relevant trading experience, as well as providing 
extensive educational tools. If we are not satisfied that prospective 
clients are equipped to understand the risks involved, we simply 
do not allow them to access our products. This differentiates us 
from many of our peers. It demonstrates our commitment to good 
consumer outcomes, and is ultimately in the longer-term interests of 
our business. 
Limiting client losses
We have a number of services designed to help clients limit any 
losses they may make. We believe it is important to regularly 
monitor the effectiveness of these, taking a nimble approach to 
protect our clients in both normal and volatile market conditions.
Our clients can choose to attach guaranteed stops to their positions, 
so that they know their maximum possible loss at the outset of a 
trade. Last year we introduced an innovative new charging system 
that facilitates the use of guaranteed stops. No premium is payable 
for attaching a guaranteed stop unless it is triggered, so clients 
will frequently receive protection free of charge. IG was the first 
provider to offer guaranteed stops on this basis. From July 2016, 
we also introduced a limited risk account, which has now become 
the default account we offer to clients who are less experienced or 
towards the lower end of the wealth acceptance scale. Clients who 
are eligible for our other account types can also request a limited 
risk account, if they wish.
Our close-out monitor (COM), which seeks to automatically 
liquidate clients’ positions when their margin has been significantly 
eroded, is also a means by which we help protect clients. At 
times when market volatility is expected, such as during elections 
or referendums, we devote considerable time to reviewing our 
margining practices, ensuring our margins protect both clients and 
IG from any volatility. We make amendments where necessary, 
actively communicate with our clients, and test our systems to 
ensure they can continue to operate effectively under stress. At 
31 May 2017, 99.75% of all client accounts were subject to the 
automatic COM procedure. 
SUPPORTING OUR PEOPLE
Nurturing a team of talented and dedicated people is central to 
our strategy, enabling us to deliver the exceptional products and 
services that keep us at the forefront of our industry.
By providing an inclusive, fair and engaging environment, we ensure 
that our people can thrive and achieve their potential. This in turn 
enables them to drive our business forward – thinking creatively, 
working collaboratively and building rewarding relationships with 
our clients.
Communication and involvement
As a global employer with over 1,500 staff in 17 locations 
worldwide, our challenge is to maintain a clear vision and a sense 
of unity for all of our people. We are committed to ensuring that all 
our employees feel connected and are aligned to a shared purpose. 
We take pride in being an open, non-hierarchical organisation, 
where all of our people have access to senior management. Our 
Chief Executive Officer addresses all employees every six months 
to present the Group’s half-year and full-year financial results and 
answer any questions. He and other members of the senior team 
also maintain a schedule of visits to our global offices, taking this 
opportunity to engage in dialogue with local employees.
We aim to provide our people with multiple communication 
channels, and we continue to develop our intranet, IG hub. With 
usage increasing significantly this year, this is now the default source 
of information for our people. It provides a highly effective way 
of communicating news about internal developments within the 
business, as well as building awareness of the external financial and 
economic factors affecting us.
Employee engagement
We are proud to have been certified as one of Britain’s Top 
Employers by the Corporate Research Foundation for ten 
consecutive years, and are committed to making IG a great  
place to work. 
To understand our employees’ perceptions of the business and 
address their concerns, we carry out an annual engagement survey. 
By collecting their feedback in this way, we give our people a direct 
channel of communication to the executive team and the Board. We 
take into account the insights we receive when making decisions 
that are likely to affect employees’ interests.
A diverse and fair workplace
We believe that a diverse workforce brings creative energy to our 
business, and we are committed to developing a team of individuals 
with the best skills to help us realise our vision and strategy – 
regardless of their ethnicity, faith, gender identity, sexual orientation 
or physical capacity. Our inclusive culture was evidenced in 2016, 
when our employees led the creation of IG Open, a network for 
those who identify themselves as LGBT+ and their allies. 
We have extensive human resource policies in place to ensure that 
we recruit the right people and enable them to develop without 
experiencing discrimination or harassment. We continuously 
reinforce the need to treat all employees fairly, creating an 
environment free from bullying, where people of all grades or 
positions enjoy dignity and respect. 
We fully consider applications for employment from disabled 
persons with aptitudes and abilities in line with our requirements. 
Where existing employees become disabled, temporarily or 
permanently, it is our policy to provide continuing employment 
wherever practicable in the same or an alternative position. 
Appropriate training and/or graduated back-to-work programmes, 
in conjunction with the occupational health professionals, help 
achieve this aim.
Human rights
We conduct our business in an ethical manner, following policies 
that embody key human rights principles. More information 
can be found in our Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 
on iggroup.com.
Health and wellbeing
All our employees receive appropriate protection benefits and 
discounted gym access. In the UK, our people can access the 
cycle-to-work initiative through our new flexible benefits portal, 
which also provides increased opportunity for individuals to 
personalise benefits to their lifestyle requirements. 
A confidential employee-assistance programme is available to all 
our head office employees and their immediate families, offering 
a 24/7 telephone counselling service for impartial advice on all 
matters – for example, housing and personal finance.
Rewarding high performance
Recognising the link between individual performance and global 
growth for the business, this year we introduced a new ‘check-in’ 
process to replace the traditional annual appraisal approach. The 
new system ensures that each of our people has a clearly defined 
purpose, with specific deliverables and expected behaviours. 
Regular meetings with the line manager then provide opportunities 
for feedback, goal realignment and recognition of success.
We offer a competitive reward package and a market-related 
salary structure that is regularly benchmarked. We also include the 
majority of our employees in a group bonus scheme. Bonus levels 
are intrinsically linked to the financial and operational performance 
of IG, including client satisfaction. At the end of each financial year, 
bonuses are distributed based on both Company and individual 
performance, as discussed during check-ins throughout the year.
The remainder of our employees are included in specific 
sales-related bonus schemes. We also reward our high-potential 
employees through a long-term incentive plan, and we offer our 
employees in the UK, Australia and the US the chance to share in 
our success through our tax-advantaged share-purchase schemes. 
An average of 36% of eligible employees took part in our share 
plans in the 2017 financial year. We are currently reviewing options 
to extend similar schemes to our other larger offices – Krakow 
and Bangalore.
In the next year we will continue to strengthen our global 
recognition strategy by linking it directly to our values  
and behaviours. 
Developing talent
We take the development of our people very seriously, recognising 
that a constant flow of talent and skills is key to our ongoing 
success. We continually invest in improving the quality of the 
learning opportunities our people can access, and we encourage 
employees to progress within the business, supporting them in their 
personal and professional growth.
All of our employees are able to benefit from a variety of learning 
and development resources, ranging from on-the-job coaching 
and mentoring to webinars, secondments and Board exposure 
programmes. We encourage attendance at relevant external 
events and, where appropriate, sponsor our people to undertake 
formal, industry-recognised training courses and achieve 
professional qualifications.
We have also developed succession plans for our more senior roles, 
and will now be implementing a similar approach for other core 
roles across the Group.
Community involvement
We are keen to encourage our people to engage in activities 
that both help their own development and contribute to local 
communities, so we are proud to support a wide variety of charities 
that are close to our employees’ hearts. We match any funds our 
employees have raised for sponsored events.
To make the most of charitable donations, we continue to work with 
the Charities Aid Foundation, allowing our employees to operate 
a charity fund and make contributions to selected charities from 
gross earnings, directly from their monthly pay. Not only do we 
support charities with gifts of money, but also by providing time and 
resources. Our absence-management policy offers the opportunity 
for our people to take up voluntary work, for which we grant 
additional leave on a like-for-like basis up to a maximum of five 
matched days per annual leave year.

OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
As a business that conducts nearly all of its client trades online and 
undertakes no industrial activities, we do not see ourselves as a 
significant emitter of environmentally harmful substances. However, 
we still take any necessary actions to ensure that we minimise the 
impact of our operations on the environment.
Our greatest environmental impact comes from running and 
maintaining our IT infrastructure. This technology supports our 
award-winning platform and ensures we are consistently able to 
maintain our high level of platform uptime. Powering and cooling 
our datacentres results in the majority of our energy usage – as well 
as our energy costs. As such, we update our hardware and software 
as appropriate to save money and energy.
BUSINESS CONDUCT AND SUSTAINABILITY continued 47

Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
Our offices are the second-largest consumer of energy. We apply 
a number of energy-saving processes and have a far-reaching 
recycling policy. This not only encompasses a proportion of our daily 
office waste, but also extends to our IT equipment when we replace 
hardware. We try to use any desktop equipment for its maximum 
functional life. 
Our head office building, where around half of our employees are 
based, is also ISO 14001 certified and we have installed sensor 
lighting. This year we completed a major refit of the premises, which 
will help us to work in a more energy-efficient way and reduce our 
environmental impact. By moving to a ‘hot-desk’ working model 
and providing all employees with laptops, we have enabled our 
people to work from home regularly, reducing the workspace 
required in our premises. This means we can now use our office 
space more efficiently, cutting costs.
We carried out the refurbishment with sustainability in mind, taking 
a number of steps to minimise our impact on the environment:
• 95% of existing glazing was reused to create new partitions
• 80% of existing ceiling tiles were recycled
• Existing light fittings were reused where possible, with new LED 
lamps installed to save energy
• Dimmable LED lighting was installed in open-plan areas
• All desk lamps were fitted with time clocks
• All existing carpet tiles were removed and recycled
• Existing raised-access flooring was modified, avoiding the need 
to install new floor tiles
• 50% of existing desks were reused
• Existing mechanical plant was reused, with modifications to 
support new layouts
• Unwanted furniture was donated for reuse, where possible
• All waste was removed by the contractor’s registered 
recycling provider
We have rolled out laptops and the hot-desk working model 
to our global offices wherever practical, as well as installing 
environment-friendly, state-of-the-art video conferencing and 
collaboration technology – provided by Skype for Business. 
This has reduced the need for work-related travel between our 
global locations.
We make every effort to source our office services from providers 
that are committed to sustainable principles. For example, in the 
UK our fruit supplier plants one fruit tree in Malawi, Africa, for every 
basket purchased. During the past year, around 6,000 trees were 
planted thanks to IG.
Emissions Data
We provide emissions data in respect of the financial year ended  
31 May 2017 in the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report 
and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity Ratio tables on page 47. In 
the tables, Scope 1 emissions are those incurred in air conditioning 
our offices and running back-up generators for our servers, while  
Scope 2 emissions are purchased energy such as electricity. For the 
most significant sources of energy consumption discussed above, 
we purchase electricity via our landlords.
Basis of preparation
Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated on the basis of financial 
control, with the emissions data included for the companies 
consolidated in the Financial Statements, noting the Statement of 
Exclusions given below:
• Our methodology has been based on the principles of 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, taking account of the 2015 
amendment which sets out a ‘dual reporting’ methodology for 
the reporting of Scope 2 emissions
• We have reported on all the measured emissions sources 
required under The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, except where stated
• This includes emissions under Scope 1 and 2, except where 
stated, but excludes any emissions from Scope 3
• The period of our report is 1 June 2016 – 31 May 2017 inclusive
• Conversion factors for UK electricity (location-based 
methodology), gas and fugitive emissions are those published 
by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
for 2015-16
• Conversion factors for UK electricity (market-based 
methodology) are published by electricityinfo.org
Statement of exclusions
• Global diesel use (for vehicles) has been excluded from the 
report on the basis that it is not material to our carbon footprint
• Our fugitive emissions have only been reported for regions 
where the data has been made available
• Our Krakow office has been excluded on the basis that this is 
a new site and it is not possible to obtain a full year’s worth of 
data. This will be reported in next year’s report

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION  
TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In this year’s Chief Executive Officer’s review, we reported on 
another strong set of results achieved during a period of significant 
global political events and an uncertain regulatory landscape which 
has led to a significant fall in the Company’s share price. We share 
regulators’ concerns that some in our industry are behaving in ways 
that are not in clients’ best interests. We are deeply engaged with 
regulatory bodies to help them find positive solutions to these 
issues, while ensuring that where appropriate clients can continue 
to take advantage of trading opportunities in the markets. I remain 
confident that, once this period of uncertainty is resolved, the 
Group is well placed to continue demonstrating market leadership 
and delivering shareholder value. In the meantime, the Board is 
focused on delivering results, creating new opportunities for the 
future and ensuring we have the right talent to succeed. 
Since our home regulator’s consultation on leveraged products 
began, the Board and senior management team have been very 
active in supporting the development of proportionate regulation 
to meet the challenges faced in the industry. I would like to thank 
my colleagues for the quality of debate and decision-making 
throughout this period, and in particular the exemplary approach 
of Peter and his executive team in continuing to promote and 
evidence the Group’s industry-leading commitment to fair client 
outcomes. All stakeholders, including our shareholders, staff and 
clients, can be confident that the Company has left no stone 
unturned in our efforts to ensure the best outcomes for you all.
The Board of Directors continues to be committed to maintaining 
the highest standards in the way the Company is directed, governed 
and managed. We believe that good-quality governance underpins 
IG’s ability to deliver sustainable future growth and long-term 
value-creation for shareholders.
I would like to thank Board colleagues for their continued support 
in ensuring timely, robust and constructive challenge and debate 
around the Board table. Last year I reported that Paul Mainwaring 
joined the Group as Chief Financial Officer. Paul has made great 
strides in continuing to improve control infrastructures and has 
brought fresh perspectives to discussions at Board. Since  
October 2016 the Board Risk Committee has been chaired by 
Sam Tymms, who brings a wealth of regulatory experience to the 
role. I would like to thank Stephen Hill for his wise stewardship as 
Chairman of the Board Risk Committee from its inception in 2014 
and for guiding it through a period of significant change and growth 
for the Group. We are grateful that Stephen has agreed to extend 
his role on both the Board and the Board Risk Committee for a 
further year. Following completion of my first three years in office, I 
am also delighted to report that the Board has agreed to renew my 
appointment as Chairman for a further three years to June 2020.
The success of the Board is dependent on a shared vision and 
common purpose. The relationship between the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer is central to this, and Peter and I continue 
to work closely together and to develop a strong relationship 
which is predicated on transparency and constructive dialogue, as 
well as shared culture, values and ethics. With the support of the 
Board, IG has introduced an updated set of values centered around 
championing our clients, leading the way and loving what we do. 
We are actively encouraging our people to innovate, challenge 
the status quo and demonstrate an enquiring mindset; and we are 
strengthening commitment to our business and our people through 
encouraging personal achievement, inclusion and sharing.
The Board is focused on succession planning at IG and we 
are continuing to develop our plans particularly at executive 
management level. We have continued to focus on our 
medium-term and long-term strategy. The quality of debate 
at our November strategy day was excellent, and we have 
made significant improvements to the way in which we monitor 
performance of strategic developments across our leveraged and 
unleveraged businesses. 
I am pleased to report that we have seen additional improvements 
in the timeliness and quality of materials provided to the Board 
and its Committees. The Board now receives improved monthly 
data and management information to support its decision-making. 
Together with improved processes and an increased awareness by 
paper producers and presenters of the Board’s expectations, this 
has helped improve the quality of debate and facilitated informed 
and timely decision-making. We will continue to work to improve 
the quality and content of materials. 
The way the Group has applied all aspects of the UK  
Corporate Governance Code is set out in the following  
Corporate Governance Report. 
 
 
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) sets out the standards of good practice in relation to how a company should be directed 
and governed. As we have a Premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, the Company reports in accordance with the Code published 
in September 2014. The Code is published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and further information can be found on its website at 
frc.org.uk. The Board considers that the Company has been compliant with the provisions of the Code for the year ended 31 May 2017.
Our results continue to demonstrate strong growth, leading to record revenue, profits and 
client numbers. This is against the backdrop of a quiet period for financial markets, together 
with unprecedented regulatory activity that has negatively affected the share price. Our 
results are underpinned by an enduring governance culture, which continues to put high 
ethical standards and fair client outcomes at the heart of all we do. I am grateful for the 
support and dedication of the CEO, senior management team, and of all IG’s people.

to the Board and for agreeing and monitoring progress with the

LEADERSHIP 
The role of the Board
The Board provides guidance and entrepreneurial leadership 
of the Company by setting the strategic direction of the Group 
and overseeing management’s implementation of the strategy. 
It provides robust challenge, within a framework of prudent and 
effective risk management and controls. The Board is provided with 
timely and comprehensive information to enable it to discharge 
its responsibilities, to encourage strategic debate and to facilitate 
robust, informed and timely decision-making. 
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success 
of the Group through the creation and delivery of sustainable 
shareholder value. In exercising this responsibility the Board takes 
into account the needs of all relevant stakeholders – including 
clients, investors, employees and suppliers – and the effect of the 
strategy on the environment as a whole.
It is accountable for ensuring that, as a collective body, it has 
the appropriate skills, knowledge and experience to perform its 
role effectively.
In considering the powers of the Board as set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association, and its developing strategy, the Board 
has this year undertaken a comprehensive review of the matters 
reserved to it for decision-making. These include agreeing the 
Group’s strategy; approval of major transactions, annual budgets, 
and changes to the Group’s capital and governance structure. The 
matters reserved also require regular reviews of operational and 
financial performance; reviews of succession-planning for the Board 
and senior management; setting the risk appetite of the Group 
and approving any changes to the Group’s risk management and 
internal control framework.
Specific matters for approval and recommendation to the Board 
have been formally delegated to certain Board Committees. The 
Matters Reserved to the Board and Committee Terms of Reference 
are available on the Company’s website, iggroup.com.
Board composition 
The Board currently comprises a Non-Executive Chairman who was 
independent on appointment, two Executive Directors and five 
independent Non-Executive Directors, supported by the Company 
Secretary and senior management.
The Board operates a clear division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
Chairman
The Chairman, Andy Green, is responsible for leading the Board 
and creating the right conditions, including its membership and that 
of its Committees, to ensure the Board’s effectiveness in all aspects 
of its role.
The Chairman sets the Board’s agenda, in consultation with the 
Chief Executive Officer and Company Secretary, taking full account 
of Board members’ issues and concerns and the need to allow 
sufficient time for robust and constructive discussion and challenge 
on all relevant matters. He is responsible for encouraging and 
facilitating active engagement by all Directors, drawing on their 
skills, knowledge and experience. 
The Chairman is also responsible for promoting effective 
communication between the Board, Non-Executive Directors, 
shareholders and other major stakeholders. 
The Chairman has a close working relationship with the  
Chief Executive Officer and the Company Secretary to ensure 
that the strategies and actions agreed by the Board are 
effectively implemented.
Chief Executive Officer
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Peter Hetherington, has specific 
responsibility for recommending the Group’s strategy to the 
Board and for implementing agreed strategy once approved. In 
undertaking such responsibilities, the CEO takes advice from and 
is provided with support by his senior management team and all 
Board colleagues.
Additional specific authority includes the development of the Risk 
Management Framework, regulatory stakeholder management and 
supporting the Chairman to ensure the promotion of appropriate 
standards of corporate governance and shareholder engagement.
Together with the Chief Financial Officer, the CEO monitors the 
Group’s operating and financial results and directs the day-to-day 
business of the Group. The CEO is also responsible for recruitment 
and development of the Group’s executive management team 
below Board level.
Chief Financial Officer
The Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Paul Mainwaring, is responsible 
for the financial reporting of the Group, for monitoring the Group’s 
operating and financial results and for management of the Group’s 
internal risk management and financial control systems. The 
CFO also has responsibility for oversight of capital and liquidity 
management and the management and safeguarding of client 
money and assets. He supports the CEO in implementing the 
Group’s strategy and in relation to the financial and operational 
performance of the Group.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are independent of management and 
are considered by the Board to be free from any business or other 
relationships that could compromise their independence. Their role 
is to effectively advise and constructively challenge management, 
along with monitoring management’s success in delivering the 
agreed strategy within the risk appetite and control framework 
agreed by the Board. They are also responsible for determining 
appropriate levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors.
Senior Independent Director
Malcolm Le May is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
and in this capacity he acts as a sounding board for the Chairman. 
He serves as a trusted intermediary for the other Directors when 
necessary. He is also available to shareholders if they have concerns 
which communication via the normal channels of Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer or other Executive Directors has failed to 
resolve, or when shareholders prefer to speak directly to him. He 
is responsible for evaluating the performance of the Chairman on 
behalf of the other Directors.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary, Tony Lee, supports and works closely 
with the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Board 
Committee Chairs in setting agendas for meetings of the Board 
and its Committees. He supports the accurate, timely and clear 
information flow to and from the Board and the Board Committees, 
and between Directors and senior management. In addition, he 
supports the Chairman in designing and delivering Directors’ 
induction programmes and the Board and Committee performance 
evaluations. The Company Secretary also advises the Board 
on corporate governance issues and Board procedures and is 
responsible for administering IG’s Share Dealing Code of Conduct 
and the Annual General Meeting.
How the Board operates
The Board meets regularly, at least seven times a year, including an 
annual strategy day to review strategic options open to the Group 
in the context of the economic and regulatory environment. In 
addition the Board has established a Standing Committee whose 
responsibility is to consider Board reserved matters at short notice, 
or where there are administrative matters requiring evidencing that 
does not warrant a full Board. There were seven scheduled Board 
meetings this year, including the annual strategy day.
Senior executives below Board level attend meetings as required 
to present and discuss matters relating to their business areas 
and functions.
The full Board also meets when necessary to discuss important 
ad-hoc emerging issues that require consideration between 
scheduled Board meetings. There were seven such meetings 
held during the year, convened principally to consider the Board’s 
preparedness and response to the UK referendum on membership 
of the European Union, the launch of IG Investments and responses 
to regulatory consultations. 
Each Director commits an appropriate amount of time to their 
duties during the financial year, and the Non-Executive Directors 
met the time commitment reasonably expected of them, including 
pursuant to their letters of appointment. 
Where Directors are unable to attend meetings, they are 
encouraged to give the Chairman their views in advance on the 
matters to be discussed. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors meet formally in the 
absence of the Executive Directors at least twice a year. There were 
five such meetings during the year.
During the year, Non-Executive Directors led by the Senior 
Independent Director, met without the presence of the Chairman, 
including to evaluate the Chairman’s performance.
Attendance at Board meetings
The number of full scheduled Board meetings attended by each 
Director during the year, including the Board strategy day, is set

EFFECTIVENESS
Board composition
The Board’s size and the skills and experience of its members have a 
significant impact on its effectiveness. It aims to maintain a balance 
in terms of experience and skills of individual Board members. 
These factors are regularly reviewed to ensure that the Board has 
the right mix of skills and experience for constructive discussion 
and, ultimately, effective Board decisions. 
The breadth of skills and experience currently on the Board includes 
experience in a number of key areas such as financial services, 
finance and accountancy, strategy, government and regulatory, 
marketing, risk management and regulatory liaison, technology 
and digital. Certain Non-Executive Directors currently undertake 
executive roles outside of IG. 
There is an appropriate combination of Executive Directors and 
Non-Executive Directors such that no individual or small group of 
individuals can dominate the Board’s decision-making.
Director independence
The Company is and continues to be fully compliant with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, which requires that at least half of the 
Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise Non-Executive 
Directors who are determined by the Board to be independent. 
The independence of the Non-Executive Directors is considered by 
the Board and reviewed on an annual basis, as part of the Board 
effectiveness review. The Board considers factors such as length 
of tenure and relationships or circumstances, which are likely to 
affect or appear to affect the Director’s judgment in determining 
whether they remain independent. Following this year’s review, the 
Board concluded that all of the Non-Executive Directors continue 
to remain independent in character and judgment and are free from 
any business or other relationships that could materially affect the 
exercise of their judgment.
Conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they 
may have interests that conflict with those of the Company, unless 
that conflict is first authorised by the Board. Directors are required 
to disclose both the nature and extent of any potential or actual 
conflicts with the interests of the Company. 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s Articles 
of Association allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts that 
may arise, and to impose such conditions or limitations as it sees fit. 
During the year, potential conflicts were considered and assessed 
by the Board and approved where appropriate.
Succession planning and appointments to  
the Board 
The Board uses succession planning to ensure that Executives with 
the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise are in place to deliver 
our strategy, and that it has the right balance of individuals to be 
able to discharge its responsibilities. The Board regularly reviews its 
composition to keep it constantly refreshed. Any searches for Board 
candidates, and appointments made, are based on merit against 
objective criteria. 
The Nomination Committee has specific responsibility for the 
appointment of Non-Executive and Executive Directors and it 
recommends new appointments to the Board. It regularly reviews 
the structure, size and composition required of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board as appropriate. More information 
on the work of the Committee can be found in the report of the 
Nomination Committee on pages 60 and 61. The Board as a whole 
is also involved in overseeing the development of management 
resources across the Group.

Each year, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board 
is conducted. The evaluation includes an assessment of the 
effectiveness of Board Committees and individual Directors. In 
2017, an external evaluation was carried out by Lintstock Limited 
as the final part of a three-year programme that began in 2015. 
Lintstock has no other connection with the Company.
This year the programme was enhanced by including one-to-one 
interviews between Board members and Lintstock. 
As part of the review, it was agreed to give additional focus to areas 
identified following the 2016 review and areas that had emerged 
during the 2017 financial year, including: 
• Embedding risk management within the 
organisational framework
• The effectiveness of the operational control framework as the 
Group becomes increasingly geographically diverse
• Managing strategic development in the face of 
regulatory headwinds
• Succession planning and organisational development at Board 
and senior management level
The first stage of the review involved Lintstock engaging with 
the Chairman and the Company Secretary to set the context 
for the evaluation, and to tailor the surveys used to the specific 
circumstances of IG Group, while ensuring consistent questioning to 
facilitate ongoing analysis of performance improvement.
All Board members and the Company Secretary completed 
web-based surveys addressing the performance of the Board and 
its Committees, the Chairman and individual Directors. Lintstock 
subsequently produced a report of its findings, which were 
discussed with the Chairman and subsequently with the Board.
Overall, the results indicate that the Board is operating effectively, 
with a number of areas rated positively. Progress has been made 
with all development areas identified in 2016, including: 
• Improvements to the consistency of papers provided to 
the Board
• Succession planning
• Improvements in the process for strategic reviews 
• Developing and embedding the people strategy
• Continuing to manage and enhance our understanding and 
management of cyber threats
• Ensuring our risk timetable and risk processes are driven 
holistically and reviewed in an efficient and timely manner
The main areas agreed by the Board for development in the coming 
year are:
• Continuing to progress succession-planning at Board level and at 
senior management level 
• Using optional Board training/information sessions to free the 
Board’s time for more strategic discussion
• Creating an enhanced programme for Board interaction with 
management below Executive Committee level
• Ensuring the Board increases its focus on strategic discussion by 
managing the flow of information to the Board 
• Revisiting our Incubator Governance Framework to ensure it 
remains fit for purpose
We will report on actions taken and progress made in next year’s 
Annual Report.
Led by Malcolm Le May, the Senior Independent Director, a review 
of the Chairman’s performance was carried out by the Board. The 
performance of the Chairman was discussed without the Chairman 
present, following which the Senior Independent Director and 
Chairman met to discuss the review findings. 
The evaluation of the performance and contribution of each 
Director was conducted with reference to a self-performance review 
questionnaire completed by each Director. This was then discussed 
at sessions between each Director and the Chairman.
The reviews concluded that each Director continues to perform 
effectively and demonstrate commitment to the role.
Time commitment
Following the Board evaluation process detailed above, the Board 
is satisfied that each of the Directors is able to allocate sufficient 
time to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively. 
Externally, while there have been changes to the Chairman’s 
external appointments, there has been no overall increase in the 
level of significant commitments of the Chairman during the year 
which would impact the time he has to fulfil the role.

Ongoing professional development
In order to facilitate greater awareness and understanding of the Group’s business and the environment in which it operates, all Directors 
are given regular updates on changes and developments in the business. 
Training opportunities are provided through internal meetings, workshops, presentations and briefings by internal advisers and business 
heads, as well as external advisers. The Company Secretary updates the Board on any relevant legislative, regulatory and governance 
changes on a regular basis. 
The Directors meet with global country heads in order to receive further insights into the operations of the business in the jurisdictions 
where the Group operates.
During the year, the Directors attended briefing sessions on information security, regulatory developments, Brexit Euro response, 
competition law, operational risk and risk appetite.
The Chairman ensures that the Directors continually update and refresh their skills and knowledge, and independent professional advice is 
provided when required, at the Company’s expense.
Induction 
Following appointment, each Director receives a comprehensive and formal induction to familiarise them with their duties and the 
Company’s business operations, risk and governance arrangements. The induction programme, which is co-ordinated with the help of 
the Company Secretary, includes briefings on industry and regulatory matters relating to the Company, as well as meetings with senior 
management in key areas of the business, such as compliance, legal, IT, human resources, finance, risk, marketing and investor relations. 
These are supplemented by induction materials such as recent Board papers and minutes, organisation structure charts, history of the 
Group, governance matters and relevant company policies. Newly appointed Directors also meet the Company’s external auditor, brokers 
and advisers, and attend a presentation led by Linklaters on the roles and responsibilities of a UK-listed company director. 
Inductions are tailored to each Director’s individual experience, background and areas of focus. Paul Mainwaring’s induction programme on 
joining the Board in 2016 covered those aspects set out below. 59

Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
Following all investor presentations and meetings, feedback is 
passed to the Board on any opinions or concerns expressed by 
shareholders. The Directors receive regular updates on shareholder 
views, roadshow feedback as well as analysts’ reports on market 
perception of the Group’s performance and strategy, and are 
made aware of the financial expectations of the Group from the 
outside market. The Board also receives an investor perception 
study to identify shareholders’ concerns and actions undertaken for 
its resolution.
The Chairman and the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
are available to meet shareholders on request, and ensure that 
the Board is aware of shareholder concerns not resolved through 
other communication mechanisms. The Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director provide feedback to the Board 
on any views or concerns expressed to them by shareholders.
AGM
The AGM provides the Board with the opportunity to communicate 
with private and institutional investors, and we welcome and 
encourage their participation at the meeting. The Chairman aims 
to ensure that all the Directors, including the Chairs of the Board 
Committees, are available at the AGM to answer questions. The 
2016 AGM was a successful event attended by all the Directors. 
All the proposed resolutions were passed on a poll, with the 
percentage of votes in favour of each resolution ranging from 
93.18% to 100%.
The 2017 AGM will be held on 21 September 2017. The Notice  
of the AGM sets out the resolutions to be proposed at the 
meeting. A copy of the Notice is available on the Company’s 
website iggroup.com. We send the Annual Report and Notice to 
shareholders, or make them available on the Group’s website, at 
least 20 working days before the date of the meeting. The Notice 
sets out a clear explanation of each resolution to be proposed at 
the meeting. Shareholders have the opportunity to ask questions 
and, if they are unable to attend, can submit written queries in 
advance of the meeting. After the meeting, we will make available 
to shareholders full details of the votes including proxy votes 
received on each resolution, and we will publish these on the 
Company’s website on the same day.
ACCOUNTABILITY
Financial and business reporting
The Strategic Report on pages 16 to 47 describes the business 
model and strategy whereby the Company generates and 
preserves value over the long term and delivers the objectives of 
the Company.
A Statement of the Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the 
Financial Statements is set out on page 95 and a statement 
regarding the use of the going-concern basis in preparing these 
Financial Statements is provided in the Directors’ Report on 
page 94.
Risk management and internal control
The Group is exposed to a number of business risks in providing 
products and services to its clients. The Board is responsible for 
establishing the overall appetite for these risks, which is detailed 
and approved in the Risk Appetite Statement. The Board has 
responsibility for ensuring the maintenance of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems and for annually 
reviewing them.
The framework under which risk is managed in the business is 
supported by a system of internal controls designed to embed the 
effective management of the firm’s key business risks throughout 
the Group. The risk management and internal controls systems 
are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Through reports from the Board Risk Committee and the Audit 
Committee, consideration of the ICAAP , ILAA and Recovery 
Plan, the Board regularly reviews and monitors the Group’s risk 
management and internal controls systems and the effectiveness 
with which it manages the principal risks faced by the Group.
The Directors confirm that the Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity. We outline the risks to which the Group is 
exposed and our framework under which risk is managed, including 
a description of its system of internal controls, in the ‘Business 
Model and Risk Profile’ section on pages 24 to 27 and in the ‘Risk 
Management and Viability Statement’ section on pages 35 to 42.
An annual formal review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of risk management and internal controls has been carried out by 
the Board to support the statements included in the Annual Report 
and Accounts. The review focused on the overall risk governance 
framework and the setting of IG’s risk appetite. It considered the key 
risk assessment and monitoring activities across the firm, as well as 
the processes and controls in place to manage the firm’s principal 
risks and for escalating exceptions highlighted by risk management 
processes. No weaknesses or control failures significant to the 
Group were identified.
There are risk management and internal controls systems in place 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal risks facing 
the Group, in accordance with the Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting 
published by the Financial Reporting Council.
Throughout the year and up to the date of this report, the Group 
has operated a system of internal controls that provides reasonable 
assurance of effective operations covering all controls, including 
financial and operational controls and compliance with laws 
and regulations.
Internal controls over financial reporting
The Group’s financial reporting process has been designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the 
financial reporting and preparation of Financial Statements, 
including consolidated Financial Statements, for external purposes 
in accordance with IFRS. The annual review of the effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of internal controls included reviews of systems 
and controls relating to the financial reporting process.
Internal controls over financial reporting include procedures and 
policies that:
• Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposals of the 
Group’s assets
• Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit the preparation of Financial Statements 
and that receipts and expenditures are being made only 
in accordance with authorisations of management and 
respective Directors
• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposal of 
Group assets that could have a material effect on the Group’s 
Financial Statements
REMUNERATION
The responsibility for determining remuneration arrangements 
for the Chairman and Executive Directors has been delegated to 
the Remuneration Committee. Information on the Remuneration 
Committee and the Directors’ Remuneration Report and Policy can 
be found on pages 62 to 81.
ENGAGEMENT WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS 
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining good and 
constructive communication with the Company’s shareholders, and 
has in place a comprehensive programme to facilitate this each year.
Our Annual Report is an important medium for communicating 
with shareholders, setting out detailed reviews of the business and 
its future developments in the Company Overview and Strategic 
Report sections.
In order to ensure that the members of the Board develop an 
understanding of the views of major shareholders, there is regular 
dialogue with institutional investors and shareholders, presentations 
by management and Investor Roadshows around the time of 
the Group’s year-end and half-year results announcements. Our 
Investor Relations team coordinates these. These presentations 
are available on the Group’s website iggroup.com, which also 
provides a wide range of other information to shareholders and 
prospective shareholders. We also respond to ad hoc requests from 
shareholders on a regular basis.
The Chairman, the Senior Independent Director, in his capacity 
as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, and the Executive 
Directors hold meetings with the Company’s largest institutional 
shareholders and market analysts to discuss governance 
developments (including in respect of external and internal 
remuneration policy), business strategy and financial performance.

Role of the Nomination Committee 
The principal role and responsibilities of the Committee include:
• Reviewing the composition of the Board and Board Committees 
to ensure that they are appropriately balanced in terms of skills, 
knowledge, diversity and experience
• Ensuring that there is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new Directors 
• Identifying and nominating for approval by the Board suitable 
candidates to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise
• Keeping under review the leadership needs of the Group, with 
a view to ensuring the continued ability of the organisation to 
compete effectively in its marketplace
• Keeping up to date about strategic issues and commercial 
changes affecting the Group and the market in which it operates
The Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on the 
Group’s website, iggroup.com.
Main activities during the financial year
The Committee’s main focus has been on overseeing the selection 
process and appointment of the Chief Financial Officer, on changes 
to the Chairmanship of the Board Risk Committee, on extensions 
of Non-Executive Director terms of appointment and on succession 
planning at Board and senior management level.
As reported last year the Committee concluded its search for a 
new Chief Financial Officer. Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds, 
executive search firms with no other connections with the Company, 
were engaged, following a selection process. Their role was to 
assist with the search for a suitable candidate who was able to 
demonstrate outstanding finance and leadership credentials in a 
high-quality, regulated financial services business.
Paul Mainwaring was appointed as Chief Financial Officer  
designate on 11 July 2016, and formally appointed to the Board on 
20 July 2016 following receipt of relevant regulatory approvals.
On 27 September 2016 we announced to the market that  
Sam Tymms had been appointed as Chairman of the Board Risk 
Committee following the decision of Stephen Hill to step down 
from the role. Stephen remains a Committee member. Sam brings 
a wealth of regulatory experience to the role. Stephen chaired the 
Board Risk Committee from its inception in 2014 and through a 
period of significant change and growth for the Group.
Following the expiration of six years as a Non-Executive Director, 
and following a rigorous review during which the Committee 
took account of the need for progressive refreshing of the Board, 
Stephen agreed to extend his appointment to the Board for a 
further year.
The Committee has also begun a detailed review of succession 
planning requirements at Board and senior executive management 
levels. It has had open and transparent dialogue with the  
Chief Executive Officer on his views, and has sought advice 
and support from the Head of Human Resources, the Head of 
Organisational Development and external consultants. This has 
enabled production of a comprehensive plan designed not only to 
identify talent but also to put in place personal development plans, 
ensuring that any internal candidates are able to develop the skills 
and experience required to meet the requirements of future roles 
for which they are identified as candidates. 
Following the completion of three years in office, the Committee 
also agreed to recommend to the Board – and in turn the Board 
agreed – my continued appointment as Chairman of the Board for a 
further three years from 9 June 2017.
Committee evaluation
During the year, an evaluation of the performance of the Committee 
and its members was undertaken in line with the Committee’s Terms 
of Reference. The evaluation process was externally facilitated by 
Lintstock Limited as part of the overall annual Board effectiveness 
review, details of which can be found on page 57. The performance 
of the Committee was positively rated overall, succession planning 
was highlighted as a focus for the coming year and the evaluation 
concluded that the Committee operates effectively.
Diversity statement
As a business, we are committed to maintaining a diverse workforce 
at all levels across the Company, and more information on how we 
do this can be found in the Supporting Our People section, starting 
on page 44.
The Directors recognise the importance of gender diversity on the 
Board and understand the significant benefits that come with having 
a diverse Board. The Board believes that diversity is a wider issue 
than gender and includes variations in experience, skills, personal 
attributes and background. The Board currently has a 25% female 
representation, and has an aspirational target to increase this to one 
third by 2020, as recommended by the Hampton-Alexander Review 
on women in leadership positions.
The Board will continue to appoint on merit, based on the skills 
and experience required for membership of our Board, while giving 
consideration to gender and other forms of diversity when the 
Committee reviews the Board’s composition. For appointments 
to the Board, IG uses executive search firms who have signed up 
to the voluntary code of conduct setting out the key principles of 
best practice in the recruitment process. These principles include a 
recommendation that search firms should consider gender diversity 
and IG insists on having both male and female candidates when 
drawing up longlists and shortlists of candidates.
 
CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
The Nomination Committee undertakes an important role in 
identifying, sourcing and evaluating the combination of skills 
needed to lead the Group at and immediately below Board level, 
and in supporting the development and delivery of our strategy.
It is responsible for identifying and recommending to the Board, 
suitable candidates for appointment to the Board, and ensures the 
Board’s composition meets the Company’s needs.
This year, and following an extensive search, the Committee agreed 
to recommend to the Board the appointment of Paul Mainwaring as 
Chief Financial Officer. Paul was appointed to the Board on  
20 July 2016.
The Committee also increased its focus on succession planning 
at Board and executive management level. Following initial 
discussions, it has been agreed to invest in a senior management 
development programme designed to ensure management develop 
the right balance of knowledge, skills and experience to become 
credible Executive Director candidates in due course.
Committee membership and attendance
The Committee consists of Independent Non-Executive Directors, 
and meets as necessary to discuss appointments to the Board. The 
Chairman of the Board is also the Chairman of the Committee and 
the Company Secretary acts as the Secretary of the Committee. 
On invitation, the Chief Executive Officer also attends, but is not 
involved in decisions relating to his own succession. The Head of 
Human Resources also attends on invitation.
During the year, the Committee met four times, principally to 
consider Board composition and succession planning.

IG has delivered another strong year of growth, leading to record 
revenues, profit and client numbers. Our product offering has also 
seen growth and the share dealing platform continues to attract 
new customers supporting our overall strategy. We have acquired 
certain DailyFX assets and are seeing improving client conversion. 
Most recently we have launched our Investments offering. We have 
also expanded our operational hubs in Poland and India.
Incentive outcomes for 2017
Since 2013, the Company’s Executive Directors have participated 
in a single incentive scheme, the sustained performance plan (SPP) 
which measures performance over annual and trailing three-year 
periods. The SPP replaced both the previous annual bonus and 
long-term incentive plans.
The year to 31 May 2017 is therefore the fourth year of the 
Executive’s variable remuneration being awarded under the SPP . 
Similar to the prior years’ SPP , the 2017 award is driven by three 
measures: Diluted Earnings Per Share (DEPS), Total Shareholders 
Return (TSR) and non-financial measures presented in more detail 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy beginning on page 64. In 
respect of the annual and trailing three-year performance for the 
period ended 31 May 2017, the Committee has awarded 27.1% of 
the maximum potential award under the SPP compared with 90% 
in the prior year. The overall SPP outcome is lower than last year as 
a result of the EPS performance against target and due to the zero 
vesting of the long-term trailing TSR component. 
The Company has set out an extensive explanation of the 
judgments it has made in determining the above awards. This 
disclosure is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on 
page 72.
Implementation of policy in 2017/18
The Committee has determined that the base salary of the  
Chief Executive Officer, Peter Hetherington and the  
Chief Financial Officer, Paul Mainwaring remains unchanged at  
the 1 June 2017 review date.
For 2017, the Committee will use the same SPP measures described 
above, with the same weightings. Accordingly, annual DEPS will 
drive 45% of the maximum potential award, with relative TSR 
(measured over the trailing three years) and annual non-financial 
metrics accounting for 35% and 20% respectively.
In relation to the DEPS targets, as with past years, the Committee 
has used a set of internal and external reference points to set 
targets. The target range will be disclosed and explained in next 
year’s Remuneration Report.
I hope that you will support the advisory and binding votes on the 
remuneration resolutions at the AGM.
CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 May 2017 and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
The overall structure of the executive remuneration package and 
the principles that underpin it remained unchanged in the 2017 
financial year.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Our Directors’ Remuneration Policy, that has been in place since 
June 2013, was approved in a binding vote by over 96% of our 
shareholders at the AGM in 2014. The policy is due for its triennial 
renewal at the 2017 AGM. The Committee has reviewed the policy 
in preparation for the vote, and following consultation with major 
shareholders has determined that the existing policy continues to 
meet the needs of the Company and the reasonable expectations of 
its shareholders. Accordingly no material changes are proposed.
However, there are a number of external factors which may 
influence the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in the medium term, 
including: the strategic implications for IG of the FCA’s review of 
regulation in the contracts for difference market and other reviews 
being undertaken by other regulators; developments in executive 
pay market practice and other stakeholder views and guidelines.
Therefore, although the Committee has proposed a renewal of the 
existing policy at the 2017 AGM without material change, we may 
need to return to shareholders for a further policy vote during the 
next two years, once the full implications of the external factors 
referred to above are known.
Annual Report on Remuneration for the year to  
31 May 2017
There also will be the usual advisory vote at this year’s AGM with 
regards to this annual Committee Chairman’s statement and the 
Annual Report on Remuneration, that detail amounts paid in respect 
of the year ended 31 May 2017 and the corresponding performance 
metrics, targets and outcomes. I hope you agree that the way we 
have rewarded our Executives is commensurate with the Group’s 
performance and that you will support this year’s resolutions at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Chief Financial Officer
Paul Mainwaring was appointed as CFO designate on  
11 July 2016 and appointed to the Board on 20 July 2016. His salary 
on appointment, which was subject to independent benchmarking, 
was £400,000 per annum. Paul is eligible to participate in the 
sustained performance plan and receives a pension and benefits 
allowance totaling 17% of base salary in accordance with his 
contractual terms.
The business context in 2017
As noted within the Operating and Financial Review section of the 
Annual Report on pages 30 to 33, the Group delivered another 
strong financial performance in 2017. Revenue increased by 
7.6% on 2016’s underlying results to £491.1 million, while diluted 
earnings per share (DEPS) increased by 2.9% against last year’s 
underlying results to 45.9 pence per share.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT  
AND POLICY
The Remuneration Committee’s objective is to ensure remuneration encourages, reinforces 
and rewards the delivery of shareholder value.
Malcolm Le May
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Our remuneration report covers the remuneration of the  
Executive and Non-Executive Directors of IG Group Holdings plc 
(the Company and the Group) and is organised into the following 
main sections:

Objectives of the remuneration policy
The Remuneration Policy is set to ensure that remuneration 
has the ability to attract and retain senior executives of a high 
calibre, remains competitive and provides appropriate incentive 
for performance.
The Committee has agreed that all matters relating to remuneration 
of Group employees should:
• Align with the best interests of the Company’s shareholders and 
other stakeholders
• Recognise and reward good and excellent performance of 
employees that helps drive sustainable growth of the Group
• Focus on retaining high-performing senior management
• Be consistent with regulatory and corporate 
governance requirements
• Be designed to achieve effective risk management
• Be straightforward, easy for shareholders and employees to 
understand and easy for the Group to monitor
• Not be used to reward behaviour that inappropriately increases 
the Group’s exposure to risks
The Committee considers that a successful remuneration policy 
needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes 
in the Group’s business environment and in remuneration practice. 
There must be transparency and alignment to the delivery of 
strategic objectives at both a company and an individual level. 
There must also be scope to reward for exceptional effort and 
achievement that delivers value both for the Company and 
the shareholders. Likewise, failure to achieve, individually or at 
Company level, will not be rewarded.
The Committee is also mindful of ensuring that there is an 
appropriate balance between the level of risk and reward for the 
individual, the Company and for shareholders.
When setting levels of variable remuneration, the degree of stretch 
in performance conditions and the balance of equity and cash within 
a package, consideration is given to obtaining the appropriate 
balance of each so as not to encourage unnecessary risk-taking. As 
well as financial risk, the Committee also ensures that there is an 
appropriate focus on regulatory and governance matters.
The total remuneration package is structured so that a significant 
proportion is linked to performance conditions, and it is the 
Company’s policy to ensure that a high proportion of the potential 
remuneration package is provided via share-based instruments.
This ensures that executives have a strong ongoing alignment with 
shareholders through the Company’s share price performance.
The table below summarises each element of remuneration policy 
for the Executive Directors, explaining how each element operates 
and how each part links to the corporate strategy.
DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy describes the framework, 
principles and structures that guide the Remuneration Committee’s 
decision-making process in the area of Directors’ remuneration in 
line with the Committee’s objective to ensure that remuneration for 
Executive Directors encourages, reinforces and rewards the growth 
of shareholders’ value.
The policy was approved by over 96% at the 2014 AGM, and 
is submitted for renewal at the triennial vote at the 2017 AGM, 
without any material change. The role of the Remuneration 
Committee and the objective of the remuneration policy are 
described below.
Remuneration Committee’s role
• Makes recommendations to the Board on the Group’s senior 
executive remuneration policy
• Determines an overall remuneration package for the Executive 
Directors in order to attract and retain high-quality Directors 
capable of achieving the Group’s objectives
• Sets and agrees with the Board a competitive and transparent 
remuneration framework which is aligned to the Group’s strategy 
and is in the interest of both the Company and its shareholders
• Determines the contractual terms, remuneration and other 
benefits for the Executive Directors 
• Determines and reviews the remuneration policy, ensuring it is 
consistent with effective risk management across the Group, and 
considers the implications of this remuneration policy on risk
• Determines and agrees the policy for the remuneration of the 
Board Chairman and the Executive Directors
• Reviews pay, benefits and employment conditions and the 
remuneration trends across the Group
• Approves share-based awards under the Group’s employee 
incentive schemes, to determine each year whether awards will 
be made and, if awards are made, to monitor their operation, the 
size of such awards and the performance targets to be used
• Monitors regulatory developments, including those affecting 
UK-listed companies and financial services firms, to ensure the 
remuneration policy is consistent with these
• Establishes the selection criteria, appoints and sets the terms 
of reference for any remuneration consultants who advise

Base salary
Provides a sound basis on which to 
recruit and retain key employees of 
appropriate calibre to deliver the 
strategic objectives of the Company.
Reflects the market value of the role 
and the post holder’s experience, 
competency and performance within 
the Company.
Base salaries are normally reviewed by the Committee annually, and are usually fixed for  
12 months commencing 1 June. Any salary increase may be influenced by: 
• Scale, scope and responsibility of the role
• Experience of the individual and his or her performance
• Average change in wider workforce pay
• Business performance and prevailing market conditions 
• Commercial need
• Periodic benchmarking of similar roles at comparable companies selected on the basis of  
comparable size, complexity, geographic spread and business focus 
The general policy is to pay around mid-market levels, with annual increases 
typically in line with the wider workforce.
Increases beyond the percentage increases granted to the wider workforce 
may be awarded in exceptional circumstances, such as:
• Where there is a change in the individual’s responsibility
• Where the salary set at initial appointment was below the level expected 
once the individual gains further experience and a track record of 
performance in the role
An above-market positioning may be appropriate in exceptional 
circumstances, to reflect the criticality of the role and the individual’s 
experience and performance.
Base salary levels for the financial year ending 31 May 2018 are:  
Chief Executive Officer – £575,000 
Chief Financial Officer – £400,000
No performance metrics  
apply to base salary.
No recovery or withholding 
applies to base salary.
Pensions and benefits
Competitive, cost-effective flexible 
pension benefits allowance to help 
recruit and retain Executive Directors.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s flexible pension and benefits  
plan, from which the executive can receive a range of benefits, Company pension contribution  
or cash allowance.
Relocation and related benefits may be offered where a Director is required to relocate. 
The aim is to provide a flexible, market-competitive pension and benefits 
allowance, with value for Directors capped 17% of base salary. Flexible 
benefits are also provided for the wider workforce who receive a 12% 
allowance. The Board recognises certain stakeholder views that advocate 
the alignment of pensions benefits throughout the business and, recognising 
its commitment to continue to honour existing contractual commitments, it 
will keep the policy under review.
No performance metrics 
apply to performance 
and benefits.

All-employee share schemes
All employees including Executive 
Directors are encouraged to 
become shareholders through the 
operation of an HMRC-approved 
share-incentive plan (SIP) and/or such 
other all-employee share plans as the 
Company may adopt in the future.
The SIP is a flexible, tax-efficient, all-employee plan. Partnership, Free, Dividend and Matching  
shares may be granted under the SIP .
If other HMRC-approved all-employee plans are introduced, they will operate in  
accordance with HMRC guidance and limits.
Similar non-UK plans may be operated to enable non-UK employees and Directors to participate. 
HMRC or non-UK 
plan equivalent limits 
will apply to any 
all-employee schemes 
that may be introduced.
This currently constitutes 
a small proportion of 
Executive Directors’ 
total remuneration.
No performance metrics apply to this benefit. No recovery or 
withholding applies to 
this benefit.
Share ownership policy
This aligns the interests of 
management and shareholders and 
promotes a long-term approach to 
performance and risk management.
A share ownership policy was introduced from the financial year ended 31 May 2014.
Under this policy, the Chief Executive Officer is required to build a holding of shares to the  
value of a minimum of 200% of base salary, and for other Executive Directors a requirement  
of 150% of base salary applies.
Only vested shares forming part of the Directors’ share interests and shares purchased by the  
Director out of his own funds are included in the guideline, which, unless there are exceptional  
circumstances approved by the Committee, must be achieved within five years from the date  
of appointment.
The Committee will review progress annually, with an expectation that Executive Directors will  
make progress towards achieving the shareholding policy each year.
Sustained performance plan (SPP)
Approved by shareholders at the 
2013 AGM, the SPP provides a single 
incentive plan for Executive Directors 
rather than having separate annual 
and long-term plans.
It provides a simple and competitive 
incentive mechanism that encourages 
and rewards both annual and 
sustained long-term performance, 
linked to the Company’s 
strategic objectives.
The SPP encapsulates traditional 
annual bonus and long-term incentive 
plans. It is entirely share-based, 
encouraging executives to build up 
a substantial stake in the Company, 
thereby aligning the interests of 
management with shareholders.
We are initially operating the SPP by reference to five consecutive ‘plan years’. The first plan  
year was the financial year which ended 31 May 2014.
Awards of shares (either in the form of par value options, nil cost options or conditional awards),  
known as ‘plan contributions’ are made after the announcement of results relating to each  
plan year.
Plan contributions are granted by reference to achievement against applicable performance  
targets and accumulate within a participant’s ‘plan account’.
Each year, a percentage of the accumulated balance in the plan account vests (ie options or  
awards are released to participants).
Therefore, a participant’s plan account will comprise the sum of the plan contribution (if any)  
being made in relation to the relevant plan year plus the accumulated awards registered in the  
plan account from previous plan years.
In the first five plan years, a participant’s plan account vests as follows:
Following Financial year ending % of cumulative shares in plan account vesting
Plan year 1 31 May 2014 40.0%
Plan year 2 31 May 2015 40.0%
Plan year 3 31 May 2016 33.3%
Plan year 4 31 May 2017 33.3%
Plan year 5 31 May 2018 33.3%
If the SPP is closed following plan year 5, unvested awards remaining in the plan account will  
vest in tranches of 50%, 25% and 25% on the first, second and third anniversaries of the SPP’s  
closure. The same principles will apply on a later termination of the plan.
Participants may receive a payment at the time of delivery of vested shares of an amount  
equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on those shares while in the plan account  
(adopting a first-in, first-out basis). This amount may assume dividend reinvestment. Dividends  
will not accrue on vested but unexercised awards. 
The maximum plan 
contribution in respect 
of a plan year is an 
award of shares with a 
market value of no more 
than 500% and 400% of 
an annual rate of salary 
for the Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial 
Officer respectively.
The quantum of any awards granted is dependent on performance against the 
targets set by the Committee for each relevant financial year.
Performance targets may comprise, for example, diluted earnings per share 
(DEPS) targets, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and non-financial measures. 
Performance is measured over single plan years (financial years) except for TSR 
(from plan year 2 – awards in respect of financial year ending 31 May 2015). We 
currently intend to apply the following performance criteria:
• DEPS – a sliding scale of targets will apply for each plan year. The targets 
will be set at the start of each plan year. Targets and performance will be 
disclosed retrospectively in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the 
relevant financial year-end
• Relative TSR – the Company’s share price (plus dividends reinvested) 
performance is measured against an appropriate comparator group. For 
the first plan year, performance was based on that plan year alone; for the 
second plan year, performance was based on plan years 1 and 2. For plan 
years thereafter performance is measured over three plan years ending with 
the plan year being reported on. The Committee retains the discretion to 
scale back the level of award if it feels the Company’s underlying financial 
performance does not warrant the level of award resulting from TSR 
performance alone
• Non-financial – these may comprise strategic goals, operational and client 
satisfaction measures for each plan year. Targets and performance will be 
disclosed retrospectively
Where possible, a sliding scale of targets will be set. For the DEPS and relative 
TSR measures, no more than 25% will be payable for achieving threshold 
performance, rising to full pay-out for achieving a more challenging target.
The scorecard of financial, share price and non-financial metrics may 
vary from year to year in accordance with strategic priorities and the 
regulatory environment.
At the time of determining the contribution for plan year 5, in the event that the 
Committee feels the Company’s underlying financial performance over the first 
five plan years has not been satisfactory, the Committee may scale back the final 
balance of the plan account.
The Committee may 
decide within three years 
of a plan contribution 
that the underlying 
award will be subject 
to clawback. This may 
happen where there 
has been a material 
misstatement in the 
Company’s financial 
results or an error in 
assessing any applicable 
performance condition. 
It may also be triggered 
if there has been 
substantial failure of risk 
management, or if the 
participant’ s employment 
is terminated for 
serious misconduct. 
The clawback may be 
satisfied by a reduction 
in the amount of any 
subsisting plan account, 
a reduction in the 
vesting of any subsisting 
vested awards or future 
share awards and/or a 
requirement to make 
cash payment.

Annual DEPS targets and non-financial performance measures, 
where used, are likely to be too sensitive to disclose in advance for 
commercial reasons. We will, however, disclose the measures and 
targets (where applicable) used, and the extent to which we have 
achieved them, on a retrospective basis, at the end of the relevant 
performance period.
Incentive plan discretions
The Committee will operate the current SPP (and other share 
plans still in operation) according to their respective rules and the 
policy set out above, and in accordance with the Market Abuse 
Regulations, Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant. Copies 
of the SPP rules are available on request from the Company 
Secretary. As is consistent with market practice, the Committee 
retains discretion over a number of areas relating to operating and 
administrating these plans. These include (but are not limited to) 
the following:
• Who participates in the plans
• The timing of grant of award and/or payment
• The size of an award and/or a payment within the plan limits 
approved by shareholders
• The choice of (and adjustment of) performance measures and 
targets in accordance with the policy set out above and the rules 
of each plan (including the treatment of delisted companies for 
the purpose of the TSR Comparator Group)
• Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the 
event of a change of control or reconstruction
• Determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified 
categories) for incentive-plan purposes, based on the rules of 
each plan and the appropriate treatment under the plan rules
• Adjustments required in certain circumstances (eg rights issues, 
corporate restructuring, special dividends and on a change 
of control)
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be 
explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration. As appropriate, 
it might also be the subject of consultation with the Company’s 
major shareholders.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, the Company has authority to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former Directors that 
have been disclosed to shareholders previously. This includes 
awards made under any other share plans operated by the 
Company described in more detail in the following section.
Illustrating the application of  
Remuneration Policy
As a result of the Company’s remuneration policy, a significant 
proportion of the remuneration received by Executive Directors 
depends on Company performance. The charts below show how 
total pay for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
vary under three different performance scenarios: minimum, target 
and maximum:
Minimum: This comprises the fixed elements of pay, being base 
salary, benefits and pension. Base salary and pension are effective 
as at 1 June 2017 and the benefits value is the actual value for the 
year ended 31 May 2017. 
Target: This comprises fixed pay and the target value of SPP  
(250% and 200% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and  
Chief Financial Officer respectively). 
Maximum: This comprises fixed pay and the maximum value  
of SPP (500% and 400% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and  
Chief Financial Officer respectively).
No account has been taken of share price growth, or of dividend 
shares awarded in respect of the deferred element of bonus and 
SPP awards over the deferral/performance periods.
Notes to the policy table
The performance measures that are used in the sustained performance plan (SPP) are a subset of the Company’s Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs).
Metric Rationale and link to the strategic KPIs How performance measures are set
Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) relative to a suitable 
benchmark group
TSR measures the total return to IG Group’s 
shareholders, both through share price growth 
and dividends paid, and as such it is aligned to 
shareholder interests.
TSR is influenced by how well IG Group 
performs on a range of other metrics, including 
financial indicators such as revenue, profit, cash 
generation and dividends, and non-financial 
indicators such as client satisfaction and 
operational performance. 
The Committee sets the requirements for 
each plan year. The current benchmark group 
comprises the constituents of the FTSE 350 
Index (excluding investment trusts).
Diluted earnings per 
share (DEPS)
DEPS is a key indicator of the profits generated 
for shareholders, and a reflection of both 
revenue growth and cost control.
The Committee determines appropriate 
performance targets each year, taking account 
of the annual and longer-term business plans. 
DEPS is calculated on such adjusted basis as the 
Committee reasonably selects (eg adjusting for 
the effects of any share buybacks).
Non-financial performance schemes
Specific non-financial measures Specific non-financial criteria traditionally 
include those relating to areas such as system 
reliability, customer satisfaction, effective 
risk management, sustaining the Company’s 
excellent reputation and maintaining a good 
standing with regulators. Each of these measures 
has a direct impact on a number of the Group’s 
KPIs. For example, system reliability is a 
key measure of the resilience of our trading 
platforms, which is an essential element of 
revenue generation and client satisfaction.
Customer satisfaction is also measured using 
the Net Promoter Score (NPS) data supplied by 
Investment Trends. NPS is a measure of whether 
clients would recommend IG.
The basket of measures chosen is considered 
to provide a broader assessment of executive 
delivery than financial metrics alone.
The Committee approved, in advance, a basket 
of non-financial measures for the year ended  
31 May 2017.
Following the end of the year the Committee 
assesses performance relative to prior years, 
internal targets and sector averages. Assessment 
is undertaken ‘in the round’, taking account of 
activities and achievements during the year.
For example, for NPS, performance is assessed 
through comparison of the Group’s performance 
against other companies in the sector, with the 
aim of maintaining a high NPS score relative to 
the sector average.
Execution and delivery of key 
strategic initiatives
The delivery of the Group’s strategic initiatives is 
key to the delivery of the strategy and will, over 
time, drive financial performance and growth.
As part of the Board’s strategy planning, there 
is a clear plan of strategic initiatives provided to 
the Remuneration Committee at the start of the 
year, which details the underlying projects set 
for delivery in the short-to-medium term. The 
Remuneration Committee uses this plan to judge 
performance and management’s execution and 
delivery of key strategic initiatives.

Recruitment Remuneration Policy
The Committee’s overriding objective is to appoint Executive 
Directors with the necessary background, skills and experience to 
ensure the continuing success of the Company. We recognise that 
the pace of change and technology development in our industry, 
as well as the global nature of IG Group, mean that the right 
individuals may often be highly sought-after.
We set the remuneration package for a new Executive Director in 
accordance with the Company’s approved remuneration policy, 
as detailed from page 64 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
subject to the additional provisions described below. The maximum 
level of variable remuneration (excluding any buyout arrangements) 
that we can offer to a new executive on an annual basis will be in 
accordance with the sustained performance plan limit, being 500% 
of salary.
In many cases, where we make an external appointment, the 
individual will forfeit incentive awards connected with their previous 
employment on resignation.
The Committee may therefore decide to offer further cash or 
share-based payments to ‘buy-out’ these existing entitlements by 
making awards of a broadly equivalent value, in the Committee’s 
view. These awards can be made either under the Company’s 
existing incentive plans or via other arrangements. In determining 
the appropriate form and amount of any such award, the 
Committee will consider various factors. These include the type 
and quantum of award, the length of the performance period and 
the performance and vesting conditions attached to each forfeited 
incentive award.
Where an individual is appointed to the Board, different 
performance measures may be set for the SPP for the year of 
joining the Board, taking into account the individual’s role and 
responsibilities and the point in the year when they joined.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element granted in 
respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to 
its terms, adjusted as appropriate to take into account the terms of 
the Executive Director appointment. The Committee will carefully 
determine the base salary level for a new Executive Director, taking 
into account the individual’s background, skills and experience, and 
the business criticality and nature of the role being offered. It will 
also consider the Company’s circumstances and relevant external 
and internal benchmarks. Above all, the Committee must exercise 
its own judgment in determining the most appropriate salary for the 
new appointment.
In certain circumstances, the Committee will have set a starting base 
salary which is positioned below the relevant market rate. It may 
then wish to adjust the Executive Director’s base salary, at a level 
above the average increase in the Company, as the individual gains 
experience and establishes a strong performance track record in the 
role. Conversely, the base salary may need to be positioned above 
the relevant market rate in order to attract the most appropriate 
candidate for the role.
We will provide benefits in accordance with the approved policy. 
We may pay relocation expenses or allowances, legal fees and other 
costs relating to the recruitment as appropriate.
We will set fees for a new Non-Executive Director or Chairman in 
accordance with the approved policy.
Executive Directors’ service contracts
Executive Directors are employed under a service contract with  
IG Group Limited (a wholly-owned intermediate holding company) 
for the benefit of the Company and the Group.
The period of notice for existing Executive Directors does 
not exceed 12 months and, accordingly, Executive Directors’ 
employment contracts can be terminated on 12 months’ notice by 
either party.
In the event that the Company terminates an Executive Director’s 
service contract other than in accordance with the terms of his or 
her contract, the Committee will act in the best interests of the 
Company and ensure there is no reward for failure. All service 
contracts are continuous, and contractual termination payments 
relate to the unexpired notice period. 
On a Director’s departure, the Company may at its sole discretion 
pay base salary and the value of any benefits (including pension) 
that would have been receivable in lieu of any unexpired period 
of notice. In the event of termination for gross misconduct, the 
Company may give neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice. 
Where the Company, acting reasonably, believes it may have a right 
to terminate employment due to gross misconduct, it may suspend 
the executive from employment on full salary for up to 30 days to 
investigate the circumstances prevailing.
The Company may place an executive on gardening leave for up 
to the duration of the notice period. During this time, the executive 
will be entitled to receive base salary and all contractual benefits 
(including pension). At the end of the gardening leave period, the 
Company may, at its discretion, pay the executive base salary alone, 
in lieu of the balance of any period of notice given by the Company 
or the executive.
When considering payments in the event of termination, 
the Remuneration Committee takes into account individual 
circumstances. Relevant factors include the reasons for termination, 
contractual obligations and the relevant incentive plan rules. When 
determining any loss of office payment for a departing director the 
Committee will always seek to minimise the cost to the Company 
while complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect 
the circumstances in place at the time.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments 
where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an 
existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such 
an obligation); or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim 
arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s 
office or employment.
For new executive appointments, the Committee has discretion to 
offer a longer notice period of up to 24 months where it is essential 
for the purposes of securing an appointment but reducing to no 
more than 12 months on a phased basis over no more than two 
years following appointment. Any payments in lieu of notice will be 
at the Committee’s discretion, and will be limited to base salary and 
the value of benefits (including pension) as set out above.
Sustained performance plan (SPP) awards
As a general rule, if a participant ceases to hold employment or be 
a Director within the Group, or gives notice of leaving, they forfeit 
any entitlement to receive further plan contributions. All awards 
subsisting in their plan account at such time are forfeited in full.
However, the situation may be different if the participant ceases 
to be an employee or a Director within the Group under certain 
circumstances. These include injury, disability, retirement, 
redundancy, the disposal of the participant’s employing company 
or the business for which they work by the Group, or other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Committee. In this case, 
participation in the plan will cease once the plan contributions 
in respect of the plan year in which the cessation arises are 
determined. This will take into account the proportion of the full 
plan year worked. Ordinarily, the participant’s plan account will then 
vest, yielding one third immediately and thereafter the remaining 
balance in equal parts on the first and second anniversary of 
such determinations.
For the purposes of any awards permitted to vest to leavers as 
described above, the Committee retains discretion to reduce the 
level of vesting that would otherwise result. It may refer to such 
time-based adjustments as it considers appropriate.
Where awards are granted in the form of options, any vested 
awards already held at the time of cessation (ie vested awards held 
outside the plan account but unexercised) will remain exercisable 
for a limited period. The exception is when dismissal has been for 
misconduct, in which case such awards lapse in full.
Change of control
The Executive Directors’ contracts do not provide for any enhanced 
payments in the event of a change of control of the Company 
nor for liquidated damages. Copies of the Executive Directors’ 
service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s 
Registered Office.
Remuneration Policy across the Company
We have designed the remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors and senior management with regard to the policy for 
employees across the Company as a whole. The Committee is kept 
updated through the year on general employment conditions, basic 
salary-increase budgets, the level of bonus pools and pay-outs and 
participation in share plans.
The Committee is therefore aware of how total remuneration at 
the Executive Director level compares to the total remuneration 
of the general population of employees. Common approaches to 
remuneration policy which apply across the Company include:
• Consistency in ‘pay for performance’, with annual bonus 
schemes being offered to the vast majority of employees
• Offering pension, medical, life assurance and other 
flexible benefits for all employees, where practical given 
geographical location
• Ensuring that salary increases for each category of employee 
are considered, taking into account the overall rate of increase 
across the Company, benchmarking, and both Company and 
individual performance
• Encouraging broad-based share ownership through the use of 
all-employee share plans, where practical

Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee engages proactively with the Company’s major shareholders. For example, when making any material changes to the 
remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee Chair will inform major shareholders of these in advance, and will offer a meeting to 
discuss details as required.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
In setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the overall approach to reward for employees 
in the Company. The Group operates in a number of different environments, and has many employees who carry out diverse roles across 
a number of countries. All employees, including Directors, are paid by reference to the market rate, and base salary levels are reviewed 
regularly. When considering salary increases for Directors, the Company will be sensitive to pay and employment conditions across the 
wider workforce. However, no remuneration comparison measurements have been utilised to date. The Committee does not formally 
consult with employees on the executive remuneration policy. The Committee is periodically updated on pay and conditions applying to 
employees across the Company.

SUSTAINED PERFORMANCE PLAN (SPP)
Determination of SPP plan contribution for the financial year ending 31 May 2017
Performance targets for plan year 4 (financial year ending 31 May 2017) comprised Diluted Earnings per Share (DEPS) targets, Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) and non-financial measures. TSR performance was measured over the three-year period from 1 June 2014 to 31 
May 2017 and DEPS and non-financial measures over the financial year ending 31 May 2017.

Performance measures – how these are set and review of performance for the year ended  
31 May 2017
Diluted earnings per share (45% weighting)
At the start of the financial year, the Committee established a DEPS range in order to measure the performance and determine the pay-outs 
under the SPP . In doing this, the Committee took into account a number of relevant factors, including internal and external considerations 
and an appropriate degree of challenge on the prior year’s performance.
In setting the DEPS range for the year ending 31 May 2017, the Committee considered the annual Board approved budget and market 
consensus expectations and historical targets.

Total Shareholder Return (35% weighting)
Under the TSR measure, a median ranking against the FTSE 350 (excluding Investment Trusts) would result in 25% of this element being 
granted with the full award being granted for upper-quartile ranking or better. The award to be granted for performance between median 
and upper quartile would be determined on a straight-line basis between these points.
For the award to be granted in respect of plan year 4, TSR was measured over the three-year period from 1 June 2014 to 31 May 2017. 
Actual TSR performance for the Group, as measured by New Bridge Street, for the three-year period was -2.9% (2016: 61%).
Against the peer group this performance ranked IG at 200 out of 278 companies and resulted in 0% (2016: 98.37%) of the potential pay-out 
under this measure being awarded.
Non-financial measures (20% weighting)
The Committee approved a series of non-financial measures comprising strategic goals as well as operational and client satisfaction 
measures, indicative of the performance during the year ended 31 May 2017. These measures are also used for a portion of the staff 
general bonus pool. An average of the performance under the specific non-financial measures combined with performance under the 
strategic delivery measures resulted in an overall assessment of 85.0% (2016: 83.5%) of the potential pay-out under this element. The below 
table details the individual measures considered and their performance assessment for the year ended 31 May 2017.
Component Detail FY17 outcome
System uptime and reliability The primary measures used to assess the performance against this 
metric and the parameters IG strives to achieve are:
• Core dealing availability per month – minimum 99.8% 
• Maximum percentage downtime in any one day – maximum 4.0%
IG achieved 99.98% rolling cumulative 12-month uptime and 
experienced three outages totalling 113 minutes over the financial year. 
This compares to a record 99.99% rolling cumulative 12-month uptime 
in the 2016 financial year with a total outage time of 59 minutes.
95.0% 
(FY16: 95.0%)
Maintaining good standings 
with regulators
IG is licensed by ten regulators, as well as being subject to regulatory 
oversight in all countries where it has a physical presence. IG continues 
to have strong working relationships with its regulators, however the 
regulatory landscape in EMEA is clearly challenging. This regulatory 
focus is mainly being directed at the industry, rather than specifically at 
IG, but given the challenges an outcome of 60% was deemed to reflect 
IG’s continuing strong relationships with non-EMEA regulators (such as 
ASIC, CFTC and MAS) and IG’s extensive interaction with all regulators.
60.0% 
(FY16: 60.0%)
Customer satisfaction The Remuneration Committee uses a number of indicators to measure 
performance against this metric. In FY16 IG scored 90% based on both 
improved measures of client satisfaction and the number of changes 
introduced for clients. FY17 has seen IG continue to innovate and 
improve to ensure it serves clients via a channel of the clients’ choice. 
IG has also increased its client facing headcount and improved its 
payments process, which has historically been a point of friction for 
clients. These measures have resulted in 92% of clients rating IG good 
or very good.
95.0% 
(FY16: 90.0%)
Reputation and PR The Remuneration Committee assessed whether there have been any 
events resulting in negative media coverage or reputational damage 
during the year. Although the industry received some poor coverage 
related to the FCA’s regulatory actions, IG mostly negated adverse 
coverage. IG received positive coverage over the UK referendum and 
the US presidential election. Due to the positive coverage received, 
especially given the nature of the challenges faced, a score of 95% was 
determined in line with last year.
95.0% 
(FY16: 95.0%)
Component Detail FY17 outcome
Risk management All teams performed strongly over both the UK referendum and the  
US presidential election. IG took sensible precautions in advance 
of both events and managed the associated volatility, resulting in 
increased profitability. Furthermore, the number of loss-making days 
reduced from two in FY16, to none in FY17. The Committee therefore 
determined an outcome of 90% in line with last year, given the 
similar performance.
90.0% 
(FY16: 90.0%)
People This measure is assessed against three metrics: voluntary attrition, 
employee engagement and succession planning.
Voluntary attrition has fallen to 14.9%, under the 17% target set by IG 
at the beginning of the period. 
Employee engagement is assessed via an anonymous survey 
administered by an external provider. Engagement was impacted by 
the number of changes IG is currently making to ensure it has a stable 
and scalable base for future growth, resulting in a 5% year-on-year 
reduction in engagement. 
Succession planning has progressed well and a number of measures 
have been introduced to help IG develop the next generation  
of leaders. 
73.3% 
(FY16: N/A)
Strategic delivery measures As part of the Board’s strategic planning, there is a clear plan relating to 
strategic projects provided to the Remuneration Committee at the start 
of the year. This details the underlying projects set for delivery in the 
short-to-medium term. The Remuneration Committee uses this plan to 
judge performance, and management’s execution and delivery of the 
key strategic initiatives. There were a number of key strategic projects 
delivered during the year. Examples of the projects include: launching 
IG Investments; making limited risk accounts available globally and 
delivering IG’s European location strategy. IG decided to terminate the 
planned launch of a binary option app given the adverse regulatory 
environment. The Board believe this was the correct decision and its 
prompt action prevented IG incurring additional costs.
85.8% 
(2016: 81.2%)
Overall summary
Based on the performance for the financial year ending 31 May 2017, we will grant awards under the SPP at 27.1% of the maximum 
potential pay-out to the Executive Directors after the announcement of the results. The actual number of shares that will be deposited 
within the Directors’ plan accounts will be based on the ten-day average share price immediately prior to grant.

(1) P G Hetherington will be granted awards in respect of plan year 4 following the announcement of results for the year ended 31 May 2017 on 18 July 2017. The share price used to 
calculate the number of awards to be granted will be the ten-day average share price immediately following the announcement of results for the year ended 31 May 2017 on  
18 July 2017. As the actual average share price is not known at the time of signing of the Annual Report, the above number of awards has been estimated using a share price of  
584 pence, being the share price on 31 May 2017. Share awards have an exercise price of 0.005 pence and are exercisable until August 2024.
(2) In accordance with the scheme rules 33.3% of the cumulative awards in the plan account (after the contributions in respect of plan year 4) will vest in August 2017 with the vesting of 
the remaining options deferred. The August 2017 vesting will include additional dividend shares accrued as follows in respect of plan years 1, 2 and 3 held in the plan account – T A 
Howkins (4,803) and P G Hetherington (10,660) based on reinvestment at the dividend payment date.

A share ownership policy was introduced from the financial year ending 31 May 2014. Under this policy, the Chief Executive Officer is 
required to hold shares to the value of a minimum of 200% of base salary, and for other Executive Directors a requirement of 150% of base 
salary applies. Only shares forming part of the Directors’ share interests are included in the calculation, which must normally be achieved 
within five years, from the date of appointment. There have been no changes to any of the Directors’ share interests in the period since 
31 May 2017. The awards to be made under the Company’s SPP in respect of the performance period ending on 31 May 2017 are set out

award. The change is calculated based on the change in the total of the SPP contribution for the plan year.
(3) The increase in the average base salary and taxable benefits for Group employees was driven by salary benchmarking, the increase in the GBP equivalant cost of non-UK staff and the 
introduction of flexible benefits.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy in the financial year ending 31 May 2018
The Committee decided not to apply an increase to the salary of Executive and Non-Executive Directors for the financial year 2018.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ fees
Each year, the Board reviews the Non-Executive Director fees (the Remuneration Committee reviews the Chairman’s fees). This year, as 
part of the review, the Board instructed New Bridge Street to carry out an external benchmarking exercise to assist the Board with the 
fee-review process.
Following the review, a decision was made to keep all fees unchanged as follows:
• Chairman: £255,000
• Non-Executive Director base fee: £65,000
• Committee Chairman fees (other than the Nomination Committee): £15,000
• Senior Independent Director fee: £10,000
Sustained performance plan
For the awards to be granted in respect of plan year 5, which will end on 31 May 2018, a maximum opportunity of 500% and 400% of 
annual rate of base salary will apply for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer respectively. 
The performance targets for these awards are shown below.

recommendations to the Board as appropriate.
To ensure the Committee discharges its responsibilities 
appropriately, an annual forward calendar, linked to the Committee’s 
Terms of Reference, is approved by the Committee. The Company 
Secretary assists the Chairman of the Committee in drafting 
the agenda for each Committee meeting ensuring that each 
of the items under the Committee’s Terms of Reference and 
responsibilities is covered at least once in the financial year and 
more frequently if required.
The full Terms of Reference for the Committee can be found on the 
Group’s website, iggroup.com.
Activity during the financial year 
During the year, the Committee’s key activities included the  
review of:
• The Director’s Remuneration Report published in the 
2016 Annual Report and Accounts and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy
• The fee for the Company Chairman and Executive Directors’ 
remuneration for FY18
• Performance against targets for the vesting of awards under the 
SPP and the LTIP and for the determination of the bonus pool
• The remuneration and bonus awards including for 
senior management
• Proposed targets for the FY18 SPP and the LTIP
In addition the Committee received regular updates on 
developments in remuneration governance including updates on 
the Group’s gender pay gap reporting and from the Committee 
Chairman on outcomes of meetings with shareholders.
Advice to the Committee
During the financial year ended 31 May 2017 the Committee 
consulted the Chief Executive Officer about remuneration matters 
relating to individuals other than himself. The Company Secretary 
also provided advice and support to the Committee.
External advisers attend Committee meetings at the invitation of 
the Committee Chairman.
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year by  
New Bridge Street (NBS), which was appointed following a 
competitive tender process in early 2013. The Committee considers 
the advice obtained from NBS to be objective and independent. 
NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is 
a signatory to its Code of Conduct, which requires its advice to be 
objective and impartial.
NBS provided advice in respect of a wide range of issues, including 
advice on the operation of the SPP , TSR performance monitoring, 
drafting the Remuneration Report and Policy, remuneration 
benchmarking and share plan implementation services. NBS’s fee 
for advice provided to the Remuneration Committee during the 
financial year ending 31 May 2017 was £0.1 million (excluding VAT). 
Other than in respect of the advice described above NBS has no 
other relationship with IG that might prejudice its independence. 
Committee evaluation 
During the year, the Committee undertook a questionnaire-based 
review of its own effectiveness. The evaluation process was 
externally facilitated by Lintstock Limited as part of the overall 
annual Board effectiveness review. Overall, the Committee’s 
performance was rated highly as was the management of its 
meetings. The Committee had made great strides during the year 
in ensuring it was kept up to date with, and in debating, significant 
information on market developments relating to executive pay. 
The need to continue to focus on improvements in the quality of 
materials provided to the Committee was highlighted.

• Reviewing the Financial Statements and announcements relating 
to the financial performance and governance of the Group
• Reviewing the control environment through a number of 
means including via Internal Audit reports and the progress on 
implementation of audit recommendations 
• Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
Internal Audit function in the overall context of the Group’s

Terms of Reference and covering key events in the financial 
reporting cycle, is approved by the Committee. 
The Company Secretary, with input from the Chairman of the 
Committee, drafts the agenda before each meeting, ensuring that 
each of the items under the Committee’s Terms of Reference and 
responsibilities is covered at least once in the financial year, and 
more frequently if required.
Following each Committee meeting, a formal report is made 
to the Board in which the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
describes the proceedings of the Committee meeting and makes 
recommendations to the Board as appropriate.
Members of the Committee also meet separately with the Head of 
Internal Audit and the External Auditors to focus on their respective 
areas of responsibility and to discuss any potential requirements for 
support from the Committee to address any issues arising.
Main activities during the financial year
Financial reporting
In relation to financial reporting, the primary role of the Committee 
is to work with management and the External Auditors in 
reviewing the appropriateness of the half-year and annual Financial 
Statements. The Committee discharged its responsibilities in this 
area through focusing on the following, among other matters:
• Assessing the quality and acceptability of accounting policies 
and practices
• Ensuring disclosures are clear and compliant with financial 
reporting standards and relevant financial and governance 
reporting requirements
• Considering material areas in which significant judgments  
have been applied or there has been discussion with the  
External Auditors 
• Reviewing formal financial announcements and Financial 
Statements prior to issuance including preliminary and half-year 
announcements and recommending these to the Board 
for approval
• Before recommending and approving the Viability Statement to 
the Board, reviewing the processes to support the assessment 
and determination of the Group’s principal risks that may have 
an impact on the Group’s longer-term solvency and liquidity 
• Evaluating on behalf of the Board whether the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy
• Reviewing the inherent risks in the financial reporting process 
and systems
To aid this review process, the Committee has considered reports 
from the Chief Financial Officer and his team, Internal and 
External Auditors.

Chairman of the Audit Committee
CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
This report sets out the role of the Committee and how it has 
discharged its responsibilities during the year. The Committee 
has continued to develop ever closer links with the Board Risk 
Committee in areas requiring the input of both Committees.  
Thanks are due to Malcolm Le May, the Senior Independent 
Director, for chairing one Committee meeting where I was unable to 
attend in person. 
The Committee has expanded its role during the year, in particular 
in the way in which it monitors the control environment. It is now 
responsible for reviewing and challenging the Group’s Tax Risk 
Policy, as well as receiving specific reports on the effectiveness of 
the control environment relating to client money and assets. As 
the Group expands its geographical reach the Committee has also 
requested an annual review of legal entity governance, focusing on 
its regulated subsidiaries. The Board has agreed amended Terms of 
Reference to reflect these new responsibilities. 
The Terms of Reference now include a quick reference guide, 
setting out those decisions falling within the responsibility of  
the Committee and those requiring the approval of the Board,  
to assist paper providers in highlighting the input sought from  
the Committee.
Membership and attendance
All Audit Committee members are Independent Non-Executive 
Directors who draw on considerable and broad business and 
financial services experience. There have been no changes to 
membership of the Committee during the year. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code requires the inclusion in the Committee of at 
least one member determined by the Board as having recent 
and relevant financial experience. The Committee Chairman is 
considered to fulfil this requirement.
The Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, Head 
of Internal Audit, Company Secretary and representatives from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) the External Auditors attend 
the Committee meetings by standing invitation. Members of 
senior management from various areas of the business attend the 
Committee meetings by invitation as necessary.
The Committee has four scheduled meetings a year and will 
additionally meet if and when required. The following table details 
meetings scheduled and attended during the year. 85

AUDIT COMMITTEE continued
The Committee considered and discussed with management and External Auditors the following primary areas of judgment and disclosure  
in relation to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 May 2017:
Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken
Goodwill 
In accordance with accounting standards, 
the Group is required to review any goodwill 
balances for impairment and consider the 
underlying assumptions involved in calculating 
the value-in-use of separate parts of the business 
known as cash-generating units (CGUs). 
The Committee observed that the significant 
proportion of the Group’s goodwill relates to 
the UK CGU. The goodwill related to this CGU 
was considered not impaired as it is highly 
profitable and its recoverable amount exceeds 
its carrying value.
The Committee reviewed a paper from 
management setting out the key assumptions 
used in the impairment review and an associated 
sensitivity analysis.
In addition, the Group’s External Auditors 
provided commentary on the matter to 
the Committee.
Based on the assessment 
performed, the Committee 
concluded that there should 
be no change to the recorded 
goodwill value.
Other intangible fixed assets
The Group is required to make judgments 
regarding the useful economic life and carrying 
value of all its acquired and internally developed 
software and licences and domain names. 
During the year the Group completed the 
purchase of DailyFX assets, for $40.0 million  
(£32.7 million) from FXCM. This was classified as 
an intangible asset within domain names and will 
be amortised over ten years. There is a judgment 
as to whether the purchase was of an asset or 
a business. This was also subject to an enquiry 
from the Financial Reporting Council who 
subsequently confirmed the appropriateness of 
our treatment.
As there is a risk of obsolescence for such 
assets, the Committee reviewed a report from 
management detailing the financially significant 
intangible assets, the rationale for their useful 
economic life, their continued use within the 
business and their remaining carrying value.
Based on the assessment 
performed, the Committee 
concluded that there 
should be no change to the 
recorded carrying values of 
intangible assets.
The Committee was also 
satisfied that the treatment of 
the purchase of the DailyFX 
assets as an asset purchase was 
reasonable in the circumstances 
given the nature of the assets 
purchased, that the assets 
were not considered to be 
an integrated set of activities 
and assets and given the work 
required to successfully integrate 
DailyFX into IG’s existing 
business. The disclosures in 
respect of the purchase have 
also been enhanced.
Corporation tax
Calculating the Group’s current corporation 
tax charge involves a degree of estimation and 
judgment, as the tax treatment of certain items 
cannot be finally determined until resolution has 
been reached with the relevant tax authority. 
The Group holds tax provisions in respect of 
the potential tax liability that may arise on these 
unresolved items. 
The Committee reviewed a report from 
management that detailed the assumptions made 
in calculating the Group’s current corporation 
tax charge and provisions. The Group’s External 
Auditors also provided commentary on this 
matter to the Committee.
The Committee has also reviewed the Group’s 
updated tax policy and strategies.
The Committee concluded 
that the corporation tax charge 
and provisions recorded by 
the Group were appropriate 
and complete.
Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken
Principal risks and viability 
For the 2017 reporting year onwards, 
the Directors are required to make a 
statement in the Annual Report as to the 
longer-term viability of the Group.
The Committee evaluated various reports 
from management that set out the view 
of the Group’s longer-term viability. These 
reports detailed the impact of:
• Brexit, recent and potential regulatory 
changes 
• Outcomes of stress tests after applying 
principal and business model risk 
scenarios to the Group’s financial 
forecasts, based on a four-year 
strategic plan
Taking into account the assessment by 
management of stress-testing results and risk 
appetite, the Committee agreed to recommend 
the Viability Statement to the Board 
for approval.
Segmental reporting
The Group has revisited the way it 
discloses its segments in the Annual 
Report to better reflect the management 
and internal reporting structure of 
the Group.
The Group now operates with regional 
heads for the UK, EMEA, APAC and the 
US all reporting into the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker. Accordingly the Group 
has changed its presentation to reflect 
this new structure.
The Committee reviewed the Group’s new 
reporting segments to ensure that they 
were consistent with the way the business 
is managed and resources allocated.
Based on the assessment performed, the 
Committee concluded that the changes to the 
new reporting segments were appropriate.
Segmental tax information
The Group reviewed its disclosures 
in relation to tax given that its legal 
entity structure and transfer pricing 
arrangements meant that the majority of 
the Group’s profit are taxed in the UK. 
The Group has enhanced its disclosures 
with respect to the tax charge in each 
jurisdiction. We explain why this is the 
case on page 142. 
The Committee reviewed disclosures which 
the Group made to assist the users of the 
Group’s Financial Statements to better 
understand the Group’s business model 
and how this impacts the tax charge in the 
regions in which the Group operates.
Based on the assessment performed, the 
Committee concluded that additional 
disclosures would assist the users of the 
Financial Statements to better understand the 
impact of the Group’s business model and 
transfer pricing on taxable profits across the 
Group’s reporting segments. 87

AUDIT COMMITTEE continued
Control environment
Other matters addressed by the Committee focused on the effectiveness of the Group’s control environment and performance of the 
Group’s IT systems, and the Internal Audit function, including the objectivity and independence of Internal Audit personnel.
Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken
Risk management and internal control
The Committee is required to assist the Board 
in the annual review of the effectiveness of the 
firm’s Risk Management Framework and internal 
control systems.
The Committee received a report from the Board 
Risk Committee including an assessment of those 
risks that might threaten the Group’s business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
It considered and challenged management on 
the overall effectiveness of the Risk Management 
Framework and internal control systems
The Committee reviewed the relevant disclosures 
within the Accountability section of the Corporate 
Governance Report within the Annual Report
The Committee agreed to 
recommend to the Board the 
Annual Report statements 
relating to the effectiveness of 
the Risk Management Framework 
and internal control systems 
Internal Audit
The Committee is required to oversee the 
performance, resourcing and effectiveness of the 
Internal Audit function.
The Committee monitored and reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit 
function in the overall context of the Group’s 
internal controls and risk management systems.
It reviewed and assessed the risk-based Internal 
Audit plan.
It reviewed and monitored management’s 
responsiveness to the findings and 
recommendations of the Internal Audit function.
The Committee received all Internal Audit reports 
and in addition received summary reports on the 
results of the work of the Internal Audit function 
on a periodic basis.
It reviewed the performance of the Internal Audit 
function against plan and an assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Internal Audit function.
The Committee reviewed the 
resourcing and effectiveness 
of the Internal Audit function 
and approved the risk-based 
audit plan.
The Internal Audit function 
remains effective and has 
sufficient resources to deliver the 
proposed plan.
Whistleblowing
The Committee considers the adequacy of the 
Group’s arrangements by which employees may 
in confidence raise concerns about improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting or other matters.
The Committee reviewed the Group’s 
Whistleblowing Policy and agreed a number of 
updates to ensure that it will remain fit for the 
needs of the Group.
The Committee concluded that 
whistleblowing processes were 
operating effectively during the 
period under review.
Client money and assets
The Committee oversees the Group’s systems 
and controls relating to the holding and 
management of client money and assets.
The Committee monitors the effectiveness of the 
control environment relating to client money  
and assets including receiving reports from the 
Chief Financial Officer on the operation of the 
Client Money and Assets Committee.
The Committee reviewed 
improvements made to the 
control environment and the 
steps being taken to further 
enhance controls in this area 
and considered that these were 
appropriate to the circumstances 
of the Group.
Legal entity governance
The Committee is responsible for the 
establishment of a risk-based system for the 
governance, operation and maintenance of the 
Group’s legal entities.
The Committee’s role is to gain comfort that 
decisions are made and evidenced at the 
appropriate legal entity level and that appropriate 
mechanisms are in place for monitoring, control 
and oversight of legal entity decision making at 
Group level.
The Committee received 
regular updates on the ongoing 
development of the legal entity 
governance framework, satisfying 
itself as to the progress made in 
improving the overall framework.
Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken
Information systems 
The Committee has considered the 
risk associated with information 
technology relating to super-user access 
to certain legacy areas of the Group’s 
trading system.
The Committee reviewed reports from 
management and Internal Audit on 
ongoing monitoring of a number of key 
controls designed to mitigate the risks 
associated with the super-user access.
The Committee considered the relevant  
control risk in this area to have been 
appropriately managed. 
The Committee’s focus is to ensure that the 
Group continues to move away from legacy 
systems, including the delivery of a finance 
transformation programme.
Fair, balanced and understandable reporting
The Group is required to ensure that 
its external reporting is fair, balanced 
and understandable.
At the request of the Board, the Committee 
assessed, via discussion with and challenge 
of management, whether disclosures in the 
Group’s published Financial Statements 
were fair, balanced and understandable, 
taking into account comments received 
from investors and others.
It sought and obtained confirmation from 
the Chief Financial Officer and his team 
that they considered the disclosures to 
be fair, balanced and understandable and 
discussed this evaluation with the External 
Auditors who took this into account when 
conducting their audit.
It also established via reports from 
management that there were no 
indications of fraud relating to financial 
reporting matters.
Having assessed all of the available information 
and the assurances provided by management, 
the Committee concluded that the processes 
underlying the preparation of the Group’s 
published Financial Statements were 
appropriate in ensuring that those statements 
were fair, balanced and understandable. 89

Effectiveness of External Auditors
In assessing the effectiveness and independence of the External 
Auditors, the Committee considered relevant professional and 
regulatory requirements and the relationship with the External 
Auditors as a whole. The Committee monitored the Auditors’ 
compliance with relevant regulatory, ethical and professional 
guidance on the rotation of partners, and assessed their 
qualifications, expertise, resources as well as the effectiveness of the 
audit process, including a report from the External Auditor on its 
own internal quality procedures. 
As part of the assessment, a questionnaire, based on criteria 
recommended by professional and governance bodies, was 
completed by the key stakeholders in the Group. The questionnaire 
addressed matters including the Auditors’ integrity, objectivity, 
skills and technical knowledge, the quality of planning and 
execution of the audit, the level of challenge applied and the 
Auditors’ understanding of the Group’s business. The results were 
analysed and a report was presented to the Committee. Following 
the review, of the effectiveness of the External Auditors, the 
external audit process and an assessment of the External Auditors’ 
independence and objectivity, the Committee has recommended 
the reappointment of PwC to the Board for recommendation to and 
approval by shareholders at the Company’s 2017 Annual General 
Meeting. There are no contractual obligations restricting the 
Company’s choice of an External Auditor.
Audit tendering and rotation
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the Group’s External 
Auditors since October 2010 following a tender process. The 
Committee remains satisfied with the external audit process and is 
currently not planning to undertake a formal retender process until 
it is required to under legislation for the year ending 31 May 2021. 
The Group is required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the 
Group audit every five years, with this year being the second year 
for the current audit partner.
Audit Committee effectiveness 
During the year, the Committee undertook a questionnaire-based 
review of its own effectiveness. The evaluation process was 
externally facilitated by Lintstock Limited as part of the overall 
annual Board effectiveness review. The Committee performance 
was highly rated, as was the management of meetings. Progress 
had been made with the standard of papers received and the 
commitment of management in this area was acknowledged. 
Progress made with the development of finance systems had 
been welcomed. Given the scale of regulatory change facing the 
business, the Committee had undertaken to increase the time made 
available to Internal Audit and on discussing the internal controls 
environment, in order to ensure it responded to the continuing 
needs and circumstances of the business.
External Auditors
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations on the appointment, reappointment and removal of External Auditors, and 
for assessing and agreeing the fees payable to the Group’s External Auditors (both audit and non-audit fees). The Committee is also 
responsible for reviewing the audit plans and reports from the External Auditors. The main activities undertaken in relation to the external 
audit are summarised below:
Reporting issue Role of the Committee Conclusion/action taken
Oversight of external audit
The Committee is required to oversee the work 
and performance of PwC as External Auditors, 
including the maintenance of audit quality during 
the period.
The Committee met with the key members of the 
PwC audit team to discuss the 2017 audit plan 
and agree areas of focus.
It assessed regular reports from PwC on the 
progress of the 2017 audit and any material 
issues identified.
It debated the draft audit opinion ahead of the 
2017 year-end.
The Committee was also briefed by PwC on 
critical accounting estimates, where significant 
judgment is needed.
The Committee approved the 
audit plan and the main areas 
of focus, including goodwill 
impairment, valuation of 
intangible assets and IT systems 
and controls.
Read more about the 
Committee’s role in assessing the 
performance, effectiveness and 
independence of the External 
Auditor and the quality of the 
external audit on page 89.
Audit and audit-related fees
Audit-related fees include the statutory audit 
of the Group and its subsidiaries, as well as 
audits required due to the regulated nature of 
our business. Also included therein are fees 
associated with the ISAE 3000 controls opinion 
relating to the Group’s processes and controls 
over client money segregation.
During the year, the Committee reviewed and 
approved a recommendation from management 
on the Company’s audit and audit-related fees.
The Committee considers 
the 2017 audit fees to be 
competitive. 
Non-audit fees
To safeguard the objectivity and independence 
of the External Auditors from becoming 
compromised, the Committee has a formal 
policy governing the engagement of the 
External Auditors to provide non-audit services. 
The policy is reviewed on an annual basis and 
this year the Committee reviewed the Group’s 
policy governing non-audit work against details 
of new regulations on the statutory audit of 
public interest entities which were effective from 
June 2016.
The Group has updated its internal process on 
engagement of auditors and review of non-audit 
services to ensure that its policy is in line with 
new regulation.
The Committee reviewed and approved all 
arrangements for non-audit fees. Fees in relation 
to Permitted Services below £0.05m are deemed 
pre-approved by the Committee and are subject 
to the approval of the Chief Financial Officer. 
Fees above £0.05m must be approved by the 
Committee, through the Committee Chairman.
The Committee ensured that firms other than 
the External Auditors have been considered, 
following a competitive tender process for the 
provision of a wide range of services, including 
tax advisory services, changes to regulation, tax 
compliance services, risk and regulatory advice.
The Committee also requested and received 
an explanation from PwC of its own in-house 
independence process.
The Committee ensured there were no 
exceptions to fee limits and approval process per 
the policy during the year.
During the year, non-audit 
fees of £0.5 million were paid 
to PwC as discussed in note 
5 to the Financial Statements. 
These principally related to tax 
compliance, tax advice and 
regulatory work.
Non-audit fees have fallen in 
respect of each of the last three 
financial years.
The Committee continues to 
follow the statutory guidance 
to seek to reduce the reliance 
on the External Auditors for 
non-audit work. 
The Committee approved the 
rationalisation of non-audit work 
among service providers by 
the Group. This resulted in the 
Group engaging EY for global 
tax compliance.  91

CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
Thanks are due to Stephen for his leadership in establishing the 
Committee and developing it to the extent that he was able to 
hand the Chairmanship over with the Committee well positioned to 
address future challenges.
The Committee has continued to focus on providing oversight and 
advice to the Board in relation to current and potential future risk 
exposures of the Group and future risk strategy. In addition, its 
focus has developed towards ensuring a holistic approach to risk 
management is taken across the Group.
In response to the areas identified for development in last year’s 
Committee evaluation, we have continued to enhance the 
professional development programme for Committee members 
and to further improve forward planning and the quality of materials 
provided to the Committee.
The Committee’s programme has been enhanced by the 
development of a detailed timetable for consideration of its 
principal regulatory documents and by improving the Committee’s 
forward calendar. In addition, the Committee’s calendar now 
includes scheduled Non-Executive Director risk workshops.
Continuing professional development 
The Non-Executive Director risk workshop held in October 2016 
considered initial steps relating to the enhancement of the Group’s 
Risk Taxonomy. Directors were updated on the development of 
the Risk Management Framework, how the framework was being 
embedded throughout the organisation and linked to the Group’s 
corporate strategy, and its Risk Appetite Statement. The workshop 
considered proposed developments to Pillar 2A daily capital 
stress tests for market and credit risk and changes to Pillar 2B 
forward-looking scenarios and reverse stress-tests. The workshop

activities during the financial year. Sam was appointed Chairman of the Committee on  
27 September 2016 in place of Stephen Hill, who continues to be a member of the 
Committee and served as its Chairman until Sam’s appointment.
Sam Tymms
Chairman of the Board Risk Committee
reviewed planned updates to the Recovery Plan and discussed 
the Recovery Plan indicators in some depth. Finally, the workshop 
reviewed the operational risk capital model.
A further training session was held in May 2017 in preparation for 
the consideration of the Risk Appetite Statement for approval by 
the Board. The training session discussed technical aspects of the 
risk appetite indicators including the use of Value at Risk as well as 
ensuring the Group strategy reflected IG’s risk appetite.
Role of the Board Risk Committee 
The Committee made a number of changes to its Terms of 
Reference (ToR) during the year by highlighting its responsibilities 
to review and recommend to the Board major risks documents 
including the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP), the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment (ILAA) and

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Profit and dividends
The Group’s statutory profit for the year after taxation amounted to 
£169.2 million (2016: £164.3 million), all of which is attributable to the 
equity members of the Company.
The Directors recommend a final ordinary dividend of 22.88 pence per 
share, amounting to £83.9 million, making a total of 32.30 pence per 
share and £118.5 million for the year. Dividends are recognised in the 
Financial Statements for the year in which they are paid or, in the case 
of a final dividend, when approved by the shareholders. The amount 
recognised in the Financial Statements, as described in note 11, includes 
this financial year’s interim dividend and the final dividend from the 
previous year, both of which were paid.
The final ordinary dividend, if approved, will be paid on 27 October 2017 
to those shareholders on the register at 29 September 2017.
Certain nominee companies representing our employee benefit trusts 
hold shares in the Company in connection with the operation of the 
Company’s share plans. Evergreen dividend waivers remain in place on 
shares held by them that have not been allocated to employees.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association (‘the Articles’) are available 
from the Group’s website, iggroup.com, or by writing to the Company 
Secretary at the Group’s registered office. The Articles can also be 
obtained from the UK Registrar of Companies. The Articles were 
amended by the shareholders by means of a special resolution on  
21 September 2016.
Board of Directors and their interests
Details of the Directors who held office at the end of the year are set out 
on pages 50 to 51 and are incorporated into this report by reference. 
Details of Directors’ beneficial and non-beneficial interests in the shares 
of the Company are shown on page 77. Changes to Directors during the 
year are set out below:
Name Role 
Effective date of 
appointment
Paul Mainwaring Executive Director Appointed 20 July 2016 – 
Chief Financial Officer
Appointment and retirement of Directors
The appointment and retirement of Directors is governed by the Articles, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’), the Act and related 
legislation. The Board has the power to appoint any person as a Director 
to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director, provided the total 
number of Directors does not exceed the maximum prescribed in the 
Articles. Any such Director holds office only until the next AGM, and is 
then eligible to offer himself or herself for election.
The Articles also require that all those Directors who have been in office 
at the time of the two previous AGMs, and who did not retire at either of 
them, must retire as Directors by rotation. Such Directors are eligible to 
stand for re-election. However, in line with the Code’s recommendation 
that all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual 
election, all Directors will stand for re-election at the 2017 AGM.
Directors’ conflicts of interests
In accordance with the Act, all Directors must disclose both the nature 
and extent of any potential or actual conflicts with the interests of the 
Company. We explain the procedure for this on page 55.
imposed from time to time. The Directors and certain employees of 
the Company are required to obtain the Company’s approval prior 
to dealing in the Company’s securities. The Company is not aware 
of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Exercise of rights of shares in employee  
share schemes
The trustees of the IG Group Employee Benefit Trust do not seek to 
exercise voting rights on shares held in the employee trusts, other 
than on the direction of the underlying beneficiaries. No voting 
rights are exercised in relation to shares unallocated to individual 
beneficiaries. The trustees have a dividend waiver in place in respect 
of unallocated shares held in the trust.
Powers of the Directors to issue or purchase 
the Company’s shares
The Articles permit the Directors to issue or repurchase the 
Company’s own shares, subject to obtaining shareholders’ prior 
approval. The shareholders gave this approval at the 2016 AGM. The 
authority to issue or buy back shares will expire at the 2017 AGM, 
and it will be proposed at the meeting that the Directors be granted 
new authorities to issue or buy back shares. The Directors currently 
have authority to purchase up to 36,664,907 of the Company’s 
ordinary shares. However, the Company did not repurchase any of its 
ordinary shares during the year. 
During the year, the Company instructed the trustee of the Employee 
Benefit Trusts to purchase shares in order to satisfy awards under 
the Group’s share-incentive plan schemes. The Company also 
issued shares in respect of the sustained performance plan. Details 
of the shares held by the Group’s Employee Benefit Trusts and 
the amounts paid during the year are disclosed in note 25 to the 
Financial Statements.
Major interest in shares
Information provided to the Company by major shareholders 
pursuant to the Financial Conduct Authority Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules (DTRs) is published via a Regulatory Information 
Service and is available on the Company’s website. The following 
information has been received, in accordance with DTR5, from 
holders of notifiable interests in the Company’s issued share capital

Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Company Financial Statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company, and of 
the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that period. In 
preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently
• State whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements
• Make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
• Prepare the Financial Statements on a going-concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions, and to disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company 
and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and Company, and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial 
Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Change of control
Following any future change of control of the Company, the Group’s 
banking facilities, which are currently undrawn, will be cancelled, 
and any obligations will become immediately due and payable. 
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors 
or employees providing for compensation on any loss of office 
or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. However, 
options and awards granted to employees under the Company’s 
share schemes and plans may vest on a takeover, under the 
schemes’ provisions.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Company’s AGM will be held on 21 September 2017. Details 
of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM will be provided in a 
separate circular sent to all shareholders.
Independent Auditors
Resolutions to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the 
Company’s Auditors and to authorise the Directors to determine 
their remuneration will be put to shareholders at the AGM on  
21 September 2017.
Going concern
The Directors have prepared the Financial Statements on a 
going-concern basis, which requires them to have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s processes for managing 
the financial risks to which they are exposed, their available liquidity, 
their regulatory capital position and their annual budget. As a 
result of this review, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going-concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT continued
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of 
information to Auditors
So far as each person who was a Director at the date of approving this 
report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being information 
needed by the Auditors in connection with preparing their report, of 
which the Auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps 
that he or she is obliged to take as a Director in order to make himself or 
herself aware of any relevant audit information, and to establish that the 
Company’s Auditors are aware of that information. This confirmation is 
given pursuant to section 418 of the Companies Act 2006 and should be 
interpreted in accordance with and subject to these provisions.
Subsequent events
Please refer to note 32 of the Financial Statements.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the Corporate Governance Report, confirms that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
• The Group and Company Financial Statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group and profit of the Company
• The Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Company, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces
In the case of each Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report 
is approved:
• So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Group and Company’s Auditors are unaware
• They have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group and Company’s Auditors 
are aware of that information.

How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the Financial Statements as 
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
Group operates. 
The Group consists of a UK holding company with a number of subsidiary entities and branches containing the UK and overseas operating 
businesses. The accounting records for the UK and overseas businesses are primarily maintained by the Group finance team in London. As a 
result, the audit work was performed by the Group audit team in London.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and on the Financial Statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £10.7 million (2016: £10.2 million).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied Consistent with last year, we applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, as it is 
the most relevant metric against which the performance of the Group is measured.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £534,000  
(2016: £508,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
REPORT ON THE  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion:
• IG Group Holdings plc’s Group Financial Statements and 
Company Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”) 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s affairs as at 31 May 2017 and of the Group’s profit 
and the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows for the year 
then ended;
• the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and
• the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
What we have audited
IG Group Holdings plc’s Financial Statements comprise:
• the Group and Company Statements of Financial Position as at 
31 May 2017;

then ended;
• the Group and Company Statements of Changes in Equity for

preparation of the Financial Statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the company 
Financial Statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006, and applicable law.

Our audit approach
Overview
We present below an overview of our audit approach, the details of which are considered within our audit report:
• Overall Group materiality: £10.7 million which represents 5% of profit before tax.
• The Group consists of a UK holding company with a number of subsidiary entities and branches 
containing the operating businesses of both the UK and overseas territories. The accounting records 
for both the UK and overseas businesses are primarily maintained and controlled by the Group’s 
finance teams in London. 
• We have determined the appropriate work to perform based on the consolidated balances of the 
Group. As a result, the audit work was performed by the Group audit team in London, reflecting the 
centralised nature of the business.
• Revenue recognition.
• Risk of management override of internal controls, incorporating super user access to IT systems 
relevant to the financial reporting process.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the Financial Statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk 
of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to 
provide an opinion on the Financial Statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in 
this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Revenue recognition 
The Group provides its clients access to a broad range of 
financial markets predominantly through spreadbetting and 
contract-for-difference (“CFD”) activities.
The Group’s trading revenue predominantly comprises net 
revenues from these spreadbetting and CFD transactions 
placed by clients, and the net gains or losses from the 
hedging trades that the Group places with external 
counterparties to manage its risk. 
We focused firstly on testing the control environment in which revenue 
is recorded. In particular we tested controls directly associated 
with revenue transaction reporting, and the valuation of year-end 
positions held by clients with the Group. We also tested controls 
associated with cash reconciliations and reconciliations with external 
counterparties through the year. We agreed cash accounts to external 
third party evidence at year-end through a combination of independent 
confirmations and examination of bank statements, and amounts 
and positions held with hedging counterparties to external third 
party evidence.
Finally, to address the risk that improper adjustments or transactions 
had been entered into the trading systems, we reviewed client activity 
reports and read a sample of customer complaints, as well as testing 
a sample of accounts for authenticity to identify any instances where 
revenue might have been improperly recognised.
We identified a number of exceptions in our testing of the control 
environment, but have performed sufficient additional procedures to 
conclude that they do not have a material impact on revenue.
Risk of management override of internal controls 
incorporating super user access to the Universe 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK 
& Ireland)) require that we consider this as a significant risk 
as management is in a unique position to perpetrate fraud 
because of their ability to manipulate accounting records 
and prepare fraudulent Financial Statements by overriding 
controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively.
Although management is responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the business, we planned our audit so that we had a 
reasonable expectation of detecting material misstatements 
to the Financial Statements and accounting records.
Specifically in relation to information technology, the risk 
relates to super-user access to Universe, the main client 
ledger system, by certain individuals in order to perform their 
role. Those individuals have an opportunity to commit and 
conceal fraud.
We understood and tested key controls in place over the financial 
reporting process. Specifically, in relation to information technology, 
we performed testing of the IT general controls related to Universe, 
including access rights. Additionally we tested the controls mitigating 
the risks relating to Universe super-user access including controls that 
would identify unexpected changes to data which could impact the 
Financial Statements, and reconciliations of Universe reports to external 
third party sources including broker and bank reconciliations. We did not 
identify any material exceptions.
We tested the fraud risk assessment performed by management 
and the preventative and detective controls in place in the Group 
with no material exceptions noted from our testing. We tested the 
appropriateness and authorisation of journal entries that we identified as 
unusual and no issues arose from this work.
We examined significant one-off transactions and considered their 
accounting treatment with no exceptions arising. We also incorporated 
an element of unpredictability into our testing approach.

Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 94, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Financial Statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, 
and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the Financial Statements were signed. As part of our audit 
we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements 
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Financial Statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group, the company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have 
nothing to report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
Information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Financial Statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group and 
Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions 
to report arising from 
this responsibility.
• the statement given by the directors on page 95, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate

and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group and Company acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions 
to report arising from 
this responsibility.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT continued
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ 
statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the directors’ statement in 
relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was 
substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of 
making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting 
their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with 
the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the 
statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
Adequacy of accounting records and 
information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Company Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration 
Directors’ remuneration report -  
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
 
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of  
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further 
provisions of the Code. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review. 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND 
THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 95, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK

Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. 
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the viability of  
the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention 
to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 42 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing 
material to add or to 
draw attention to.
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated.
We have nothing 
material to add or to 
draw attention to.
• the directors’ explanation on page 42 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, 
as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We have nothing 
material to add or to 
draw attention to.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT continued
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit 
evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With 
respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable 
legal requirements.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  Presentation, critical accounting  
estimates and judgments
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of Financial Statements requires the Group to 
make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported for 
assets and liabilities as at the year-end, and the amounts reported 
for revenues and expenses during the year. The nature of estimates 
means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the Directors’ opinion, the accounting estimates or judgments 
that have the most significant impact on the presentation and 
measurement of items recorded in the Financial Statements are 
the following:
(a) Consideration as to whether the Group’s purchase of DailyFX (a 
leading global FX related news and research website and selected 
associated assets, refer to note 13) was a business combination or 
an asset purchase. Determining whether the purchase is a business 
combination or an asset is a matter of judgment. 
The purchase included the website together with its historical 
content and lead list. In order to enable lead capturing and to 
re-establish the DailyFX Plus facility, which captures details on 
new subscribers, the infrastructure necessary for operating and 
integrating the website needed to be rebuilt. A number of the 
DailyFX staff were offered and subsequently accepted roles with 
IG. Therefore whilst inputs had been acquired, the processes that 
IG would ultimately benefit from had to be recreated and rebuilt 
or separately acquired. Accordingly, the Group accounted for the 
transaction as an asset purchase as not all the requirements for a 
business combination were met.
In addition, the assessment of the useful economic life of the assets 
acquired is judgmental. In line with the Group’s accounting policy 
for domain names and generic top level domains, the principal 
intangible asset arising from the purchase of DailyFX assets will be 
amortised over ten years. 
(b) The assessment of the useful economic life of the Group’s 
internally developed and acquired software, licenses, domain name 
and generic top-level domain based intangible assets is judgmental 
and can change due to obsolescence as a result of unforeseen 
technological developments, and other factors. The useful life for 
licenses represents management’s view of the expected term over 
which the Group will receive benefits from the software, and does 
not exceed the licence term. For internally developed and acquired 
software and domain assets the life is based on historical experience 
with similar products as well as anticipation of future events which 
may impact their useful economic life (refer to note 13).
(c) The calculation of the Group’s current corporation tax charge 
involves a degree of estimation and judgment with respect to 
certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined 
until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority. 
Amounts to be paid/received may ultimately be materially different 
than the amounts already accounted for and could therefore impact 
the overall profitability and cash flows of the Group in future periods 
(refer to note 9).
(d) The measurement of the Group’s net trading revenue 
predominantly reflects transactions that have settled in cash and 
accordingly involves little judgment. However, the calculation of 
the segmental net trading revenue involves the use of an allocation 
methodology determined by management, as the Group manages 
risk and hedges on a group-wide portfolio basis. This allocation 
methodology does not impact the overall Group net trading 
revenue disclosed. 
2. Net trading revenue
Net trading revenue represents trading revenue after deducting introducing partner commissions, and is analysed as follows:
Year ended 
31 May 2017
Year ended 
31 May 2016
£m £m
OTC leveraged derivatives:
• Indices 205.6 226.7
• Commodities 66.3 36.0
• Equities 76.4 67.4
• Foreign exchange 82.3 77.4
• Options 44.0 36.8
474.6 444.3
Exchange traded derivatives 14.1 11.2
Share dealing and investments 2.4 0.8
Total net trading revenue 491.1 456.3
The Group does not derive more than 10% of net trading revenue from any one single client.
3. Segment information
The Executive Directors are the Group’s chief operating decision-maker (CODM). Management has determined the operating segments 
based on the information reviewed by the Executive Directors for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. 
During the year, the management structure of the Group has evolved and the CODM now receives information from the business on a 
different basis to previous years. Accordingly, the segmental reporting for the comparative year has been restated.
The Executive Directors continue to consider the business performance principally from a geographic perspective, but now as the  
United Kingdom (UK), Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific (APAC) and the United States of America (US):
• The UK segment comprises the Group’s local trading activities in the United Kingdom
• The EMEA segment comprises the Group’s local trading activities in Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and South Africa
• The APAC segment comprises the Group’s local trading activities in Australia, Singapore and Japan
• The US segment comprises the Group’s local trading activities in the US
The UK segment derives its net trading revenue from OTC leveraged derivatives, share dealing, and investments. The EMEA and APAC 
segments derive their net trading revenue from OTC leveraged derivatives and share dealing. The US segment derives its net trading 
revenue from exchange traded derivatives. 
Segment net trading revenue is stated after deducting introducing partner commissions as this is consistent with the management 
information received by the Executive Directors. 
Net trading revenue from OTC leveraged derivatives is reported by segment reflecting the location of the office that manages the 
underlying client relationship and represents an allocation of the net trading revenue that the Group generates from clients’ trading activity.
The Executive Directors review segment contribution as the measure of segment profit or loss. Segment contribution is segment net trading 
revenue less direct costs, which are reported by segment reflecting the costs that are directly related to activities within that region or 
controlled by management in that region.
The Group manages market risk and a number of other activities on a group-wide portfolio basis and accordingly a large proportion of 
costs are incurred centrally. These central costs are not allocated to individual segments for decision making purposes for the CODM and 
accordingly these costs have not been allocated to segments. 
Capital expenditure is predominantly managed centrally and depreciation and amortisation is not allocated to individual segments for 
decision making and accordingly has not been allocated to segments.

The Group has unrecognised tax losses of c.$28 million in respect of the US businesses, the recoverability of which is dependent on 
sufficient taxable profits in those entities. The deferred income tax asset reflects the extent to which it is considered probable that future 
taxable profits can be offset against the tax losses carried forward.
Share-based payment awards have been charged to the Income Statement but are not allowable as a tax deduction until the awards vest. 
The excess of tax relief in future years over the amount charged to the Income Statement is recognised as a credit directly to equity.

The Finance Act 2015 passed into legislation in July 2015 and changed the main rate of UK corporation tax, reducing the rate from 20% 
to 19% effective from 1 April 2017. The Finance Act 2016 passed into legislation in September 2016 and further reduced the main rate of 
UK corporation tax to 17% effective from 1 April 2020. The impact of these changes on deferred tax have been assessed and deferred tax 
assets and liabilities have been assessed at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability settled. The 
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the year ended 31 May 2017 were calculated at rates between 19% and 17% depending on the nature 
of each temporary difference. 
Factors affecting the tax charge in future years
Factors that may affect the Group’s future tax charge include the geographic location of the Group’s earnings, the tax rates in those 
locations, changes in tax legislation, future planning opportunities, the use of brought-forward tax losses and the resolution of open tax 
issues. The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgment with respect to the recognition of 
deferred tax assets and of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the 
relevant tax authority. The Group has made tax payments in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise on these unresolved items, 
however, the amount ultimately payable may be materially lower than the amount already paid and could therefore improve the overall 
profitability and cash flows of the Group in future periods. 113

10. Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held as own shares in Employee Benefit Trusts. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the same profit figure as that used in basic earnings per share and by adjusting the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive ordinary shares arising from share schemes. 
The following reflects the income and share data used in the earnings per share computation:

13. Intangible assets continued 
Goodwill primarily relates to the purchase of IG Group plc by IG Group Holdings Limited – detail is provided in note 14. 
Domain names include the cost of acquiring IG.com and a suite of complementary domains to support the Group’s global brand. Included 
within the amount provided during the year ended 31 May 2016 is £2.7 million relating to the impairment of industry-specific generic 
top-level domains.
On 31 October 2016 the Group completed the purchase of DailyFX, a leading global news and research portal, from FXCM Inc. for a total 
consideration of $40.0 million (£32.7 million), with $4.0 million (£3.3 million) of this amount deferred for up to 12 months.
DailyFX, through a series of global websites, delivers market-leading education, research, analysis and news, focused predominantly on the 
FX markets. The Group believes this transaction will significantly enhance its ability to acquire new clients and to engage with and improve 
the retention rates of its current clients.
In line with the Group’s accounting policy for domain names and generic top-level domains, the intangible asset arising from the purchase 
of DailyFX is amortised over ten years.
Development costs relate to internally generated intangible assets. 
Software and licenses relate entirely to external purchases of off-the-shelf commercially available software for internal consumption within 
the Group. 
The expected useful lives of each class of intangible asset are set out in note 34, Accounting Policies.
14. Goodwill
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash-generating units (CGUs) as follows:
31 May 2017 31 May 2016
Group £m £m
UK 100.9 100.0
US 5.9 5.3
Australia 0.1 0.9
South Africa 1.2 0.9
108.1 107.1
Goodwill arose from the following:
• UK from the purchase of IG Group plc by IG Group Holdings Limited on 5 September 2003
• Australia from the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in IG Australia Pty Limited in the year ended 31 May 2006
• US from the acquisition of Nadex and the associated exchange technology and licence
• South Africa from the acquisition of Ideal CFDs
Impairment testing
The Group’s goodwill balance has been subject to an impairment review and there has not been any impairment recognised for the year 
ended 31 May 2017 and 31 May 2016. For the purposes of impairment testing of goodwill, the carrying amount of each CGU is compared 
to the recoverable amount of each CGU and any deficits are provided. The carrying amount of a CGU includes only those assets that can be 
attributed directly, or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.
The estimated recoverable amount for the UK CGU is based upon fair value (calculated as a percentage of the Group’s market capitalisation 
based on the UK CGU’s net trading revenue versus that of the Group) less costs of disposal. The UK CGU has a fair value in excess of the 
carrying amount.
Key assumptions used in fair value less costs of disposal calculations
The fair value less costs of disposal of the UK CGU has been determined by reference to the Company’s quoted market capitalisation and 
apportioned to the UK CGU.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The UK represents 45% of the Group on net trading revenue basis (refer to note 3, segment information). There is sufficient headroom 
between the UK CGU’s fair value and its net assets. Accordingly the outcome of the impairment review for the CGU is not considered to be 
sensitive to non-significant share price movement.

Amounts due from brokers represent balances with brokers where the combination of cash held on account and the valuation of financial 
derivative open positions results in an amount due to the Group. In addition to the £313.0 million (2016: £245.5 million) the Group had 
£63.2 million (2016: £53.4 million) of UK Government Securities held as collateral at brokers.
Included within amounts due from brokers is £11.9 million (31 May 2016: £3.2 million) related to amounts held on Bitcoin exchanges and in 
third party vaults.

Authority (FCA) ‘CASS’ rules and similar rules of other regulators in whose jurisdiction the Group operates and includes £12.7 million  
(31 May 2016: £1.5 million) to be transferred to the Group on the following business day. 
Amounts due from clients arise when a client’s total funds deposited with the Group are insufficient to cover any trading losses incurred or 
when a client utilises a trading credit limit, stated net of an allowance for impairment.

• Client monies deposited with the Group’s Swiss banking subsidiary, IG Bank SA, of £57.1 million (31 May 2016: £13.5 million)
To ensure effective management of the Group’s cash resources, all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are swept to another Group 
company each day and accordingly the Company holds no cash at year-end. 117

HM Revenue and Customs approved share-incentive plan (SIP). At 31 May 2017 392,014 ordinary shares (2016: 378,028) were held in the 
trust. The market value of the shares held conditionally at the year-end was £2.3 million (2016: £3.0 million).
The Group has a Jersey resident Employee Benefit Trust which holds shares in the Company. At 31 May 2017, the Trust held 86,161 
ordinary shares (2016: 512,075) which are available to satisfy awards under the long term share plans and Directors’ deferred bonus award. 
The market value of the shares held conditionally at the year-end was £0.5 million (2016: £4.1 million).

At 31 May 2017 23,498 ordinary shares (2016: 15,538) were held in the trust.
26. Employee share plans
The Company operates four employee share plans; a sustained performance plan (SPP), a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), a Value-Sharing 
Plan (VSP) and a share-incentive plan (SIP), all of which are equity-settled. The expense recognised in the Income Statement in respect of 
share-based payments (including associated social security costs) was £7.5 million (2016: £8.3 million).
Sustained performance plan (SPP) 
The SPP award was introduced in the year ended 31 May 2014 to replace the VSP award for the Group’s Executive Directors and other 
selected senior employees. The Remuneration Committee approves any awards made under the plan and is responsible for setting the 
policy for the operation of the plan, agreeing performance targets and participation.
The legal grant of awards under the SPP occurs post the relevant performance period. At the outset of the financial year the Remuneration 
Committee approves, and communicates to the participants, performance conditions and a pre-defined maximum monetary award in terms 
of multiple of salary. The grant of awards, in the form of equity-settled par value options, is based upon three performance conditions: Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR), diluted earnings per share and operational non-financial performance. Awards subsequently vest in tranches over 
the long-term (up to seven years), so the participant retains an ongoing substantial stake in the share price performance of the Company.
The following table shows the number of options in the SPP plan for the year ended 31 May 2017:

4 Aug 2014, 6 Aug 2015 and 2 Aug 2016 881.50p
The weighted average exercise price of all SPP awards is 0.005p.
As ‘shared understanding’ is established under IFRS2 between the Company and participants that, at the scheme outset, the costs 
associated with the SPP are accounted for as share-based payments from this time.
Further information on the Company’s SPP awards is given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The awards for the current year SPP will be granted post year-end following the approval of actual performance against targets set by the 
Remuneration Committee. A ten-day share price averaging period that will commence after the Company’s closed period is utilised to 
convert notional salary awarded into a number of options (refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report for performance conditions).

Long-term incentive plan (LTIP) 
The LTIP award has been made available to senior management who are not invited to participate in the SPP . 
LTIP awards allow the award of nominal cost options, which vest when specific performance targets are achieved, conditional upon 
continued employment at the vesting date. For each award a minimum performance target has to be achieved before any shares vest and 
the awards vest fully once the maximum performance target is achieved. 
The awarded LTIP vests after three years with a predefined number of shares allocated pro-rata based on achieving diluted earnings per 
share growth of pre-defined thresholds.
The maximum number of LTIP awards that can vest under the awards made are:

Share-incentive plan (SIP) 
SIP awards are made available to all UK, Australian and USA employees. The Executive Directors have responsibility for setting the terms of 
the award which are then approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The UK and Australian awards invite all employees to subscribe for up to £1,800/A$3,000 (2016: £1,800/A$3,000) of partnership shares, 
with the Company typically matching on a two-for-one (2016: two-for-one ) basis. All matching shares vest after three years as long as the 
employee remains employed with the Group for the term of the award. Shares awarded under the scheme are held in trust in accordance 
with local tax authority rules. Employees are entitled to receive dividends on the shares held in trust for as long as they remain employees. 
The USA award invites employees to invest a maximum of 5% of their salary bi-annually to the award. The award runs for a six-month 
period, and at the end of this period the employees are invited to purchase shares in IG Group Holdings plc at a discount of 15% to the 
scheme price, being the lower of the opening share price and the closing share price for the period.

The weighted average exercise price of all SIP awards during the year ending 31 May 2017 is 722.06p.
Fair value of equity-settled awards
The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date at which a shared understanding of the 
terms and conditions of the arrangement is reached between the Company and the participants. The weighted average fair value of the 
equity-settled awards granted or deemed as such under IFRS2 during the year was £9.8 million (2016: £6.7 million). 
For SIP awards, the fair value is determined to be the share price at the grant date, without making an adjustment for expected dividends, 
as awardees are entitled to dividends over the vesting period. 
For LTIP awards the fair value at grant date is determined by taking the share price at grant date. An adjustment for the present value of 
future dividends is not required as dividend equivalents are awarded on options granted under the LTIP .
For potential SPP awards made under the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) criteria, fair value is calculated using an option pricing model 
prepared by advisers. For the SPP awards made under the earnings per share and non-financial operational measures the fair value is 
determined by taking the share price at deemed grant date less the present value of future dividends for the duration of the performance 
period. Dividend equivalents accrue under the SPP on awarded but unvested options post the performance period. Post vesting (minimum 
holding period) dividend equivalents cease to accrue on unexercised options. 
The inputs below were used to determine the fair value of the TSR element of the SPP awards granted on 2 August 2016:
Date of grant 2 August 2016
Share price at grant date (pence) 898.45p
Expected life of awards (years) 3
Risk-free sterling interest rate (%) 0.08%
IG expected volatility (%) 21.36%
Interim dividend estimate 8.45p
Risk free rate - due to minimal exercise price the risk free rate has no impact on the fair value calculation.
IG’s expected volatility is based on historical TSR volatility of IG Group Holdings plc measured daily over a period prior to the date of grant 
and commensurate with the remaining performance period.
The interim dividend estimate is the dividend paid in the period from the deemed grant date to the end of the performance period, from 
which date dividend equivalents accrue on awarded but unvested options.
The weighted average fair values per award granted are as follows:

Legacy schemes
Value-sharing plan (VSP) 
The VSP award was an annual award introduced during the year ended 31 May 2011. In the year ended 31 May 2014 the VSP was 
replaced by the SPP and LTIP schemes. VSP awards were conditional awards made available to Executive Directors and other senior 
staff. Participants do not pay to receive awards or to exercise options. The VSP performance period is over three years with a pre-defined 
number of shares allocated, for each £10 million of surplus shareholder value created over the three-year period above a hurdle. Half of the 
shares vest after three years and can be exercised at that date, with the remaining half being deferred for a further year, conditional upon 
continued employment at the vesting date. The VSP is based upon two performance conditions, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and profit 
before taxation.
The maximum number of VSP shares that vested during the year based on the awards made are:

The historic LTIP awards were made available to Executive Directors and other senior staff in the years ended 31 May 2005 to 31 May 2010 
which were then replaced by the VSP award. 
These historic LTIP awards allowed the award of nil cost or nominal cost shares which were legally classified as options and vested when 
specific performance targets were achieved, conditional upon continued employment at the vesting date. For each award a minimum 
performance target had to be achieved before any options vested and the awards vested fully once the maximum performance target  
was achieved.

30. Financial instruments 
Accounting classifications and fair values – Group
The table below sets out the classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities and their fair values. The Group considers the 
carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities to be a reasonable approximation of fair value and represents the Group’s maximum credit 
exposure as at balance sheet date without taking account of any collateral held.
‘Trade receivables - due from brokers’ represent balances with brokers where the combination of cash held on account (disclosed as loans 
and receivables) and the valuation of financial derivative open positions (disclosed as held for trading) results in an amount due to the 
Group. These positions are held to hedge client market exposures and hence are considered to be held for trading and are accordingly 
accounted for at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). These positions are reported net in the Group Statement of Financial Position as 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right is in the normal course of business.

Financial assets:

Level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments. This category includes the 
Group’s open exchange-traded hedging positions. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the period-end 
bid price. 
Level 2 assets are valued using techniques where a price is derived based significantly on observable market data. For example, where 
an active market for an identical financial instrument to the product offered by the Group to its clients or used by the Group to hedge its 
market risk does not exist. This category includes the Group’s open non-exchange-traded hedging positions, and these comprise shares, 
foreign currency and foreign currency options. The fair values used in the valuation of these products are sometimes brokered values and 
may occur after the close of a market but before the measurement date. The effects of discounting are generally insignificant for these Level 
2 financial instruments.
Level 3 assets are valued using techniques that incorporate information other than observable market data that is significant to the 
overall valuation.
There have been no changes in the valuation techniques for any of the Group’s financial instruments held at fair value in the year (year 
ended 31 May 2016: none). There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into or out of 
Level 3 fair value measurements for years ended 31 May 2017 and 31 May 2016.

31. Financial risk management
Financial risks arising from financial instruments are analysed into market, credit, concentration and liquidity risks. Details of how these risks 
are managed are discussed in the risk management section on page 35.
Market risk
Market risk for accounting standards disclosure requirements is analysed into these categories: 
• Market price risk – non-trading interest rate and price risk
• Foreign currency risk 
Where applicable the quantified maximum exposures for the Group from each risk category are disclosed below:
Non-trading interest rate risk
The Group has interest rate risk relating to financial instruments on its Statement of Financial Position not held at fair value through profit or 
loss. These exposures are not hedged.
The interest rate risk profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities at each year-end was as follows:
Within 1 year Between 2 and 5 years Total

518.8 536.3 52.4 25.0 571.2 561.3
There are no financial assets and liabilities which are held for a period over 5 years. 
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis – non-traded interest (fixed rate)
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The level of future fixed interest 
receivable would be similar to that received in the year and is considered immaterial to the Group’s profit for the year. Refer to note 19. 
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis – non-traded interest (floating rate)
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Trade receivables and payables 
include client and broker balances upon which interest is paid or received based upon market rates.
Interest rate sensitivity has been performed on floating rate financial instruments by considering a 0.5% interest rate increase/decrease on 
the financial assets and liabilities held the Statement of Financial Position date. The impact of such a movement on the Group’s profit for 
the year is below. 
Year ended 31 May 2017
Cash and cash equivalents Trade receivables – due from brokers Trade payables – client funds held on balance sheet
Impact +/- 1.2 +/- 1.6 +/- 0.6
Year ended 31 May 2016
Cash and cash equivalents Trade receivables – due from brokers Trade payables – client funds held on balance sheet
Impact +/- 1.1 +/- 1.2 +/- 0.2
The net impact of such a movement in interest rates is considered to be immaterial to the Group’s profit for the year. Refer to note 7 and 8.  129

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
Price risk
The Group is exposed to investment securities price risk because financial investments held by the Group and classified on the Group’s 
Statement of Financial Position as available-for sale are based on closing market prices published by the UK Debt Management Office.
The table below summarises the impact of increases/decreases in value of financial investments on the Group’s post-tax gain or loss on 
equity. The analysis is based on the assumption that the value of financial investments have increased/decreased by 1% with all other 
variables held constant:
Year ended 31 May 2017 Year ended 31 May 2016
Impact on available for sale reserve (equity) (1.4) (1.4)
The financial impact of such a movement in fair value is considered to be immaterial to the Group’s available for sale reserve. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group faces foreign currency exposures on financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than its functional currency. 
The management of this risk is outlined in the risk management section on page 35. This exposure is hedged in the normal course 
of business.
The table below illustrates the sensitivity of net trading revenue with regard to currency movements on financial assets and liabilities 
denominated in currencies other than its functional currency (which are not held at fair value through profit and loss) as at the year-end.
Based on a 5% weakening in the following exchange rates, the effect on net trading revenue would be as follows:
Year ended 31 May 2017
US dollar Euro Yen South African rand Swiss franc Other
Impact (4.3) (5.7) (0.4) (0.3) (0.6) (0.3)
Year ended 31 May 2016
US dollar Euro Yen South African rand Swiss franc Other
Impact (2.4) (5.0) (0.3) – (0.3) (0.1)
Since the impact of foreign exchange rate movements is hedged, the Group would experience an opposite foreign exchange gain for the 
losses above as a hedging gain, and vice versa. 
Based on this analysis and the Group’s hedging model the net impact of foreign exchange rate movements is considered immaterial to the 
Group’s net trading revenue.
The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Group’s net assets with regard to currency movements on financial assets and liabilities 
included in the balance sheets of non GBP functional currency entities which are denominated in the functional currency of that entity (and 
which are not held at fair value through profit and loss) as at the year-end.
Based on a 5% weakening in the following exchange rates, the effect on the Group’s net assets would be as follows:
Year ended 31 May 2017
US dollar Euro Yen South African rand Swiss franc Other
Impact (3.0) (1.5) (1.0) (0.3) (0.5) (0.7)
Year ended 31 May 2016
US dollar Euro Yen South African rand Swiss franc Other
Impact (1.5) (0.3) (0.8) (0.4) (0.6) (2.6)
Since the impact of foreign exchange rate movements is hedged, the Group would experience an opposite foreign exchange gain for the 
losses above as a hedging gain, and vice versa. 
Based on this analysis and the Group’s hedging model the net impact of foreign exchange rate movements is considered immaterial to the 
Group’s net trading revenue.
Credit risk
The principal sources of credit risk to our business are from financial institutions and individual clients.
• Financial institution credit risk
• Client credit risk
The analysis of neither past due nor impaired credit exposures in the following table excludes individual client funds held in segregated 
client money accounts. Refer to section B, in the Other Information section, on page 140.

Impairment of trade receivables due from clients
The Group records specific impairments of trade receivables due from clients in a separate allowance account. Impairments are recorded 
where the Group determines that it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts owing according to the contractual terms of the 
agreement. There are no collective impairments taken, and no other assets are considered impaired. Below is a reconciliation of changes in 
the separate allowance account during the year:

a £100.0 million tranche available for up to a 1 year term (with an option to extend for a further year) and a £60.0 million tranche available 
for up to 3 years.
A final dividend of 22.88p per share amounting to £83.9 million was proposed by the Board on 18 July 2017.
33.  Authorisation of Financial Statements and statement of compliance with IFRS
The Financial Statements of IG Group Holdings plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together the Group) for the year ended 31 May 2017 
were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 18 July 2017 and the Statements of Financial Position signed on the Board’s behalf 
by Paul Mainwaring. IG Group Holdings plc is a public limited company that is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and 
domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s registered address is 25 Dowgate Hill, London, United Kingdom, EC4R 2YA.
The Group’s Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union (EU) and with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Financial Statements have 
been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets 
and liabilities (including derivatives instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated Financial Statements are disclosed in 
note 1.
34. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow have been applied in preparing the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 May 2017.
As permitted by Section 408(1)(b), (4) of the Companies Act 2006, the individual Income Statement of IG Group Holdings plc (the 
Company) has not been presented in these Financial Statements. The amount of loss for the year dealt with in the Financial Statements 
of IG Group Holdings plc is £1.1 million (2016: profit for the year of £124.0 million). A Statement of Comprehensive Income for IG Group 
Holdings plc has also not been presented in these Financial Statements. No items of other comprehensive income arose in the year 
(2016: £nil).
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of Financial Statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the 
Group’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 May 2016. 133

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
New accounting standards and interpretations - standards 
and amendments adopted during the year
No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the 
first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 June 2016 
have had a material impact on the Group or parent Company.
Standards not yet adopted, but expected to  
have significant impact on the Financial Statements  
when adopted: 
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ – effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018
• IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ – effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018
• IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ – effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2019 
The impact of these standards on the Financial Statements is being 
assessed by the Group but we do expect an impact on the level  
of disclosure. 
Going concern
The Directors have prepared the Financial Statements on a 
going concern basis which requires the Directors to have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future.
Basis of consolidation 
(a) Subsidiaries
The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Financial 
Statements of IG Group Holdings plc and the entities it controls (its 
subsidiaries) made up to the reporting date as listed on page 138.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, 
being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control 
comprises the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities 
and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting 
rights; currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights; 
or by way of contractual agreement. The results, cash flows and 
final positions of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the 
consolidated Financial Statements are prepared for the same 
reporting year as the parent Company and are based on consistent 
accounting policies. All inter-company balances and transactions 
between group entities, including unrealised profits arising from 
them, are eliminated on consolidation.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of 
acquisition. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value 
of consideration paid including an estimate of any contingent or 
deferred consideration. Contingent or deferred consideration is 
re-measured at each Statement of Financial Position date with 
periodic changes to the estimated liability recognised in the 
consolidated Income Statement. Acquisition related costs are 
expensed as incurred. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over 
the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised 
as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the 
fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (discount on 
acquisition) is credited to the Income Statement in the period 
of acquisition.
Foreign currencies
The functional currency of each Company in the Group is that of 
the country of incorporation (as disclosed in note 35) as this is 
consistent with the primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates. The Group’s most significant functional currency 
is sterling. Transactions in other currencies are initially recorded in 
the functional currency by applying spot exchange rates prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions. At each Statement of Financial 
Position date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate 
of exchange prevailing on the same date. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the 
fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on translation 
are taken to the Income Statement, except for exchange differences 
arising on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the 
Group’s net investment in a foreign operation. These are taken 
directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which 
time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas 
operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates prevailing 
on the Statement of Financial Position date. Income and expense 
items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. 
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and 
taken directly to a translation reserve. Such translation differences 
are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which 
the operation is disposed of. Goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets 
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Use of non-GAAP measures and exceptional items
The Group believes that, where applicable, the presentation 
of underlying results provides additional useful information to 
shareholders on the underlying trends and comparable performance 
of the Group over time. These terms are not defined under IFRS 
and may therefore not be comparable with similarly titled profit 
measures reported by other companies. They are not intended 
to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures. The term 
‘underlying’ refers to the relevant profit, earnings or taxation being 
reported excluding exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those items of income and expense that 
the Group considers are material one-off in nature and of such 
significance that they merit separate presentation in order to aid the 
readers understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Such 
items would include profits or losses on disposal of businesses and 
costs associated with acquisitions and disposals; major restructuring 
programmes; significant goodwill or other asset impairments; other 
particularly significant or unusual items. 
Other non-GAAP measures used in these Financial Statements are 
capital resources (refer to page 142) and own funds generated from 
operations (refer to page 141).
Revenue recognition
Trading revenue includes revenue arising from each of the Group’s 
four revenue generation models: OTC Leveraged Derivatives, 
Exchange Traded Derivatives, Share Dealing, and Investments.
OTC leveraged derivatives 
Revenue from the OTC leveraged derivatives business represents:
(i)  Fees paid by clients for spread, commission and funding charges 
in respect of the opening, holding and closing of financial spread 
bets, contracts for difference or options contracts, together 
with gains and losses for the Group arising on client trading 
activity; less
(ii)  Fees paid by the Group in spread, commissions and funding 
charges arising in respect of hedging the risk associated with 
the client trading activity and the Group’s currency exposures, 
together with gains and losses incurred by the Group arising on 
hedging activity
Open client and hedging positions are fair valued on a daily basis 
and gains and losses arising on this valuation are recognised 
in revenue as well as gains and losses realised on positions 
that have closed. The policies and methodologies associated 
with the determination of fair value are disclosed in note 30, 
Financial Instruments.
Exchange-traded derivatives 
Revenue from exchange-traded derivatives represents fees paid by 
members of the Group’s regulated futures and options exchange, 
with members of the exchange charged a fee per transaction 
undertaken, together with gains and losses incurred by the Group 
arising on its market making activity on the exchange.
Share dealing
Revenue from Share Dealing represents commission earned 
from share dealing service after deducting contracting and trade 
settlement fees payable to third-party brokers. Revenue is stated 
net of sales taxes and is recognised in full on the date of trade 
being placed.
Investments
Revenue from Investments represents management fees, which are 
earned as a percentage of assets under management. These are 
recognised over the period in which the service is provided.
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is shown net of value 
added tax after eliminating sales within the Group. 
Trading revenue is reported before introducing partner commission, 
along with betting duties and financial transaction taxes paid, which 
are disclosed as an expense in arriving at net operating income.
Net trading revenue, disclosed on the face of the Consolidated 
Income Statement and in the notes to the Financial Statements, 
represents trading revenue after taking account of introducing 
partner commission as this is consistent with the management 
information received by the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
Income received from clients for market data such as chart fees 
and income received from charging clients for funding using debit 
and credit cards are netted within operating costs as the amounts 
involved are not considered material.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the 
year are included in the consolidated Income Statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, 
as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial Statements 
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by other members of the Group.
(b) Non-controlling interests
Where the Group and a non-controlling shareholder enter into a 
forward contract under which the Group is required to purchase the 
non-controlling interest for its fair value (formulae based valuation), 
at the forward date, the Group continues to recognise the 
non-controlling interest at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets, until expiry of the arrangement. The forward 
liability is also recognised for management’s best estimate of the 
present value of the redemption amount with a corresponding entry 
in equity. The accretion of the discount on the liability is recognised 
as a finance charge in the consolidated Income Statement. The 
liability is re-measured to the final redemption amount with any 
periodic changes to the estimated liability recognised in the 
consolidated Income Statement. On expiry of the forward, the 
liability is eliminated as paid and any difference in the value of the 
non-controlling interest to the exercise price deducted from equity. 
On an acquisition by acquisition basis non-controlling interests 
are measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. 
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as 
transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases from 
non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration 
paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of the 
non-controlling interest is recorded in equity.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling shareholder in a 
consolidated subsidiary’s equity may exceed the non-controlling 
interest in the subsidiary’s equity. The excess and any further 
losses applicable to the non-controlling shareholder, are allocated 
against the majority interest, except to the extent that the 
non-controlling shareholder has a binding obligation and is able to 
make an additional investment to cover the losses. If the subsidiary 
subsequently reports profits, such profits are allocated to the 
majority interests until the non-controlling shareholder‘s share of 
losses previously absorbed by the majority has been recovered. 
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss 
and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is 
presented within equity in the consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position, separately from parent shareholders’ equity.
Segmental information
The Group’s segmental information is disclosed in a manner 
consistent with the basis of internal reports regarding components 
of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker, who for the Group is the Executive Directors 
(CODM), in order to assess the performance and to allocate 
resources to those ‘operating segments’. The Group has therefore 
determined its operating segments based on the management 
information received on a regular basis by the Executive Directors 
of the IG Group Holdings plc Board as they are considered to be 
the CODM. Operating segments that do not meet the quantitative 
thresholds required by IFRS 8 are aggregated. 135

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
Finance income and costs on segregated client funds
Interest income or expense on segregated client funds is accrued 
on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at 
the effective interest rate applicable. The effective interest rate is 
the rate which exactly discounts estimated future cash flows on the 
carrying amount of the asset/liability. Issue costs are included in the 
determination of the effective interest rates.
Interest income and interest expense on segregated client funds are 
disclosed within operating profit, as this is consistent with the nature 
of the Group’s operations. 
Dividends
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised 
as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Dividends receivable are recognised when the shareholder’s right to 
receive the payment is established.
Employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations
The Group operates defined contribution schemes. Contributions 
are charged to the Income Statement as and when they become 
payable according to the rules of the schemes. Once the 
contributions have been paid the Group has no legal or constructive 
obligations to pay further contributions.
(b) Bonus schemes
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based 
on formulae that take into consideration the revenue or earnings 
attributable to the Group’s shareholders after certain adjustments 
and also based on operational non-financial measures.
(c) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when an employment contract 
is terminated by the Group. The Group recognises termination 
benefits when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of 
those benefits.
Operating leases
Leases are classified as operating leases where the lessor retains 
substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset. 
Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as an 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the 
user’s benefit.
Taxation
The income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable 
and movements in deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current 
tax is calculated using tax rates in the respective jurisdictions that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Statement of 
Financial Position date.
Deferred tax is accounted for on all temporary differences 
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the 
Financial Statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the 
computation of taxable profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities 
are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available, against which deductible temporary differences 
may be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill (or negative goodwill) or 
from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of 
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
Statement of Financial Position date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted 
basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial 
Position date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income 
Statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with 
in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises 
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other 
consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly 
attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at 
rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value 
based upon estimated useful lives. Estimated residual value and 
useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and residual values are 
based on prices prevailing at the Statement of Financial Position 
date. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the 
expected useful lives as follows:
Leasehold improvements Over the lease term of up to 15 years
Office equipment,  
fixtures and fittings
Over 5 years
Computer and 
other equipment
Over 2, 3 or 5 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down 
immediately to their recoverable amount. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of an asset is determined as the difference between 
the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is 
included in the Income Statement in the period of derecognition.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of 
the cost of acquisition (fair value of consideration paid) over 
the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of a business at the date of 
acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is allocated 
to cash-generating units for purposes of impairment testing. 
Cash-generating units represent the smallest identifiable group of 
assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of 
the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase 
method. Any excess of the cost of the business combination over 
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the Statement 
of Financial Position as goodwill and is not amortised. To the 
extent that the net fair value of the acquired entity’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost 
of the investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the Income 
Statement. Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition of equity 
accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being 
reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
the related cash-generating units monitored by management. 
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less 
than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is 
recognised in the Income Statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit 
is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal 
of the unit, or of an operation within it.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried 
initially at cost. An intangible asset acquired as part of a business 
combination such as a trade name or customer relationship is 
recognised at fair value outside goodwill if the asset is separable 
or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value 
can be measured reliably. Expenditure on internally developed 
intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the 
Income Statement in the year in which it is incurred. Development 
expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after all the 
following criteria are met:
• The project’s technical feasibility and commercial viability can 
be demonstrated
• The availability of adequate technical and financial resources and 
an intention to complete the project have been confirmed 
• The correlation between development costs and future revenue 
has been established
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised over their expected 
useful lives, as follows:
Development costs Straight-line basis over 3 years
Software and licences Straight-line basis over the contract 
term of up to 5 years
Trade names Straight-line basis over 2 years
Client lists and 
customer relationships
Straight-line basis over 3 years
Domain names and 
generic top-level domains
Straight-line basis over 10 years
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. In addition, the carrying value of 
capitalised development expenditure is reviewed for impairment 
annually before being brought into use.
Impairment of non-financial assets
At least annually, or when impairment testing is required, the 
Directors review the carrying amounts of the Group’s property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. 
If any such indication exists (or at least annually for goodwill), the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs 
and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax 
discount rate. This rate reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money as well as the risks specific to the asset for 
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than 
its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced 
to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised as an 
expense immediately. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there 
is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may 
no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount 
since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, 
the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable 
amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised as income immediately, although impairment 
losses relating to goodwill may not be reversed.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. 137

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
Financial instruments 
Classification, recognition and measurement 
The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments 
at initial recognition in accordance with the categories outlined 
below and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end. 
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are 
measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case 
of financial assets and financial liabilities not at fair value through 
profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Financial 
instruments are disclosed in note 30 to the Financial Statements. 
(a)  Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss
Financial assets and financial liabilities classified as held for trading, 
or designated as such on inception, are included in this category 
and relate to the financial derivative open positions included in 
trade receivables – due from brokers and trade payables – due to 
clients as shown in the Statement of Financial Position and related 
notes. Financial instruments are classified as held for trading if they 
are expected to settle in the short-term. The Group uses derivative 
financial instruments, in order to hedge derivative exposures 
arising from open client positions, which are also classified as held 
for trading.
All financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are 
carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with 
gains or losses recognised in revenue in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Determination of fair value
Financial instruments arising from open client positions and the 
Group’s hedging positions are stated at fair value and disclosed 
according to the valuation hierarchy required by IFRS 7. Fair values 
are predominantly determined by reference to third party market 
values (bid prices for long positions and offer prices for short 
positions) as detailed below:
Level 1:  Valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets 
for identical financial instruments.
Level 2:  Valued using techniques where a price is derived based 
significantly on observable market data. For example, 
where an active market for an identical financial instrument 
to the product offered by the Group to its clients or used 
by the Group to hedge its market risk does not exist.
Level 3:  Valued using techniques that incorporate information 
other than observable market data that is significant to the 
overall valuation. 
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater 
than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are 
classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables 
comprise ‘trade receivables’, ‘cash and cash equivalents’ and ‘trade 
payable - amounts due to title transfer clients’.
(c) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either 
designated in this category or not classified in any other categories. 
They are included in non-current assets unless the investment 
matures or management intend to dispose of it within 12 months 
of the end of the reporting period. The Group’s available-for-sale 
assets comprise of ‘financial investments’.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the 
contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expired.
(a) Financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised where the rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset have expired; the Group retains the right to 
receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation 
to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement; or the Group has transferred its rights 
to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. Where the Group 
has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and 
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset 
is recognised to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement 
in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the 
original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of 
consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
(b) Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the 
liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on 
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated 
as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of 
a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying 
amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in 
profit or loss.
Trade receivables and trade payables
Offsetting financial instruments
Assets or liabilities resulting from profit or losses on open positions 
are carried at fair value. Amounts due from or to clients and brokers 
are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts 
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right 
must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable 
in the normal course of business and in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparty.
Trade receivables represent balances with counterparties and 
clients where the combination of cash held on account and the 
valuation of financial derivative open positions result in an amount 
due to the Group. A provision for impairment is established where 
there is objective evidence of non-collectability. Reference is 
made to an aged profile of debt and the provision is subject to 
management review.
Trade payables represent balances with counterparties and clients 
where the combination of cash held on account and the valuation of 
financial derivative open positions results in an amount payable by 
the Group.
Bitcoins
The Group offers Bitcoin as a product that can be traded on its 
platform. The Group normally would hedge its clients’ trading 
positions with its brokers. However, as its brokers do not offer 
Bitcoin as a hedging product, the Group purchases and sells 
Bitcoins to hedge the clients’ positions. 
At present there is a lack of guidance in IFRS on how 
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin should be accounted for and 
subsequently disclosed. This product is used in a similar manner 
to using broking counterparties for hedging purposes and not 
held with a view to making a profit or loss for the Group. Whilst it 
does not strictly meet the definition of a financial asset we have 
accounted for the Bitcoin as a financial asset and disclosed the 
Bitcoin values within ‘amounts due from brokers’ as Bitcoin is used 
in a similar manner to the financial assets held with our brokers.
Prepayments and other receivables
Prepayments and other receivables are non-derivative financial 
assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not 
been designated as fair value through profit or loss. Such assets are 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the 
time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised 
in income when the receivables are derecognised or impaired, and 
when economic benefit is consumed. A provision for impairment is 
established where there is objective evidence of non-collectability.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits which may be 
accessed without penalty. Cash equivalents comprise short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. For the purposes of the consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, net cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
The Group holds money on behalf of clients in accordance with the 
client money rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and 
other regulatory bodies. Such monies are classified as either ‘cash 
and cash equivalents’ or ‘segregated client funds’ in accordance 
with the relevant regulatory requirements. Segregated client funds 
comprise individual client funds held in segregated client money 
accounts or money market facilities. Segregated client money 
accounts hold statutory trust status restricting the Group’s ability to 
control the monies and accordingly such amounts and are not held 
on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position. 
The amount of segregated client funds held at year-end is disclosed 
in the other information section on page 140. The return received 
on managing segregated client funds is included within net 
operating income.
Title transfer funds are held by the Group under a Title Transfer 
Collateral Arrangement (TTCA) by which a client agrees that full 
ownership of such monies is unconditionally transferred to the 
Group. Title transfers funds are accordingly held on the Group’s 
Statement of Financial Position with a corresponding liability to 
clients within trade payables. Cash and cash equivalents also 
includes client monies deposited with the Group’s Swiss banking 
subsidiary (refer to note 17).
Financial investments
Financial investments are held as available-for-sale and are 
non-derivative financial assets that are not classified as held for 
trading, designated at fair value through profit or loss, or loans and 
receivables. Financial investments are recognised on a trade date 
basis. They are initially recognised at fair value plus directly related 
transactions costs. They are subsequently carried at fair value. Fair 
value is the quoted market price of the specific investments held.
Financial investments available-for-sale are carried at fair value. 
Unrealised gains or losses are reported in equity (in the available 
for sale reserve) and in other comprehensive income, until such 
investments are sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until 
any such investment is determined to be impaired. On disposal of 
an investment, the accumulated unrealised gain or loss included 
in equity is recycled to the Income Statement for the period 
and reported in other income. Gains and losses on disposal are 
determined using the average cost method.
Interest on financial investments is included in finance income using 
the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected 
life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period 
to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. 
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates 
cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial 
instrument (for example, prepayment, call and similar options) but 
shall not consider future credit losses. The calculation includes all 
fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract 
that are an integral part of the effective interest rate (see IAS 18 
Revenue), transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.
At the year-end date the Group considers whether there is 
objective evidence that a financial investment is impaired. In case 
of such evidence, it is considered impaired if its cost exceeds the 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount for a quoted financial 
investment is determined by reference to the market price. A 
quoted financial investment is considered impaired if objective 
evidence indicates that the decline in market price has reached 
such a level that recovery of the cost value cannot be reasonably 
expected within the foreseeable future.
If a financial investment is determined to be impaired, the 
cumulative unrealised loss previously recognised in equity is 
recycled to profit for the period.
Other payables
Non-trading financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method if the time value of money is significant. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and 
the amount can be reliably estimated.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at their issue proceeds less 
transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, taking into consideration 
the term of the borrowings, an assessment is made whether to state 
at amortised cost, with any difference between net proceeds and 
the redemption value being recognised in the Income Statement 
over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest 
rate method.
All borrowing costs are expensed as they are incurred.
Share capital
(a) Classification of shares as debt or equity
When shares are issued, any component that creates a financial 
liability of the Group is presented as a liability in the Statement of 
Financial Position; measured initially at fair value net of transaction 
costs and thereafter at amortised cost until extinguished on 
conversion or redemption. The corresponding dividends relating 
to the liability component are charged as interest expense in the 
Income Statement.  139

Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Equity instruments are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
(b) Own shares held in Employee Benefit Trusts
Shares held in trust by the Company for the purposes of employee share schemes are classified as a deduction from shareholders’ equity 
and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between 
the proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
(c) Share-based payments
The Company operates three employee share plans: a share-incentive plan, a sustained performance plan and a long-term incentive plan. 
Previously the Company operated a value-sharing plan, which was equity-settled. 
For market-based vesting conditions, the cost of these awards is measured at fair value calculated using option pricing models (refer to the 
share based payment note for additional detail of the models and assumptions used for the various award schemes) and are recognised as 
an expense in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Company’s estimate of the number of 
shares that will eventually vest.
For non-market based vesting conditions, at each Statement of Financial Position date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated 
representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of 
non-market conditions determining the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense 
since the previous Statement of Financial Position date is recognised in the Income Statement as part of operating expenses, with a 
corresponding credit to equity.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to employees of the subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a 
capital contribution. The fair value of the employee services received is recognised over the vesting period as an increase in the investment 
in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.

The Group is required to hold a minimum amount of regulatory capital in accordance with the Individual Capital Guidance (‘ICG’) 
periodically determined by the FCA based on their supervisory review and evaluation process (‘SREP’) of the Group, plus an amount equal 
to the higher of the internally calculated Capital Planning Buffer and the combination of the Conservation and Countercyclical buffers. The 
FCA determine the ICG following review of the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process through which the Group calculates 
the amount of capital that should be held against specific firm risks, in addition to the Pillar 1 requirements.
The FCA last undertook a SREP of IG Group in the first half of calendar year 2016, and advised the Board of the level of capital the Group 
is required to hold in August 2016. The ICG advised in August 2016 replaced the ICG advised to the Board in May 2013. The FCA plan to 
carry out their next SREP around August 2019. 
The Group’s total capital ratio and its minimum capital requirements are expressed as a percentage, calculated as capital resources divided 
by the Pillar 1 Risk Exposure Amounts in accordance with CRD IV rules.
The ICG advised by the FCA in August 2016 requires the Group to hold capital in addition to the Pillar 1 minimum equal to 9.4% of the 
Pillar 1 Risk Exposure Amounts. The previous ICG required the Group to hold capital in addition to the Pillar 1 minimum equal to 5.0% of 
the Pillar 1 Risk Exposure Amounts. The increase in the ICG primarily reflects an increase in the level of market risk that will be faced by the 
Group as a result of the increasing take up of Limited Risk Accounts, and includes a scalar (at 5% of the minimum requirements) to reflect 
‘unsighted’ risks the Group may face following the launch of IG Investments.
The required minimum capital ratio at 31 May 2017 was 18.7%, including the effect of the Capital Conservation Buffer, which the  
Bank of England raised on 1 January 2017 to 1.25% in line with the transitional provisions laid out by the FCA in IFPRU TP 7.
The Group’s Total Capital Ratio, using the balance sheet of the Group as at 31 May 2017 including the profit for the financial year, 
was 26.7%.
(f) Segmental tax information
The segmental analysis in note 3 reflects the information reviewed by the Executive Directors for the purposes of allocating resources and 
assessing performance. Net trading revenue from OTC leveraged derivatives is reported by segment reflecting the location of the office 
that manages the underlying client relationship and represents an allocation of the net trading revenue that the Group generates from 
clients’ trading activity. This does not reflect the statutory revenue or costs recorded in individual legal entities and branches which is the 
basis for the determination of taxable profit.
With the exception of South Africa, where the local office hedges the market risk arising from clients’ trading in onshore products, all the 
local offices and branches hedge the market risk arising from their clients’ activities in OTC leveraged derivatives with a legal entity in the 
UK, on a back to back basis, and as result report nil net trading revenue from OTC leveraged derivatives in their statutory accounts.
Revenue and profit reported in the statutory accounts of legal entities and branches reflect the transfer pricing arrangements in place, which 
change from time to time reflecting the commercial and operational circumstances of the individual legal entity or branch, and changes in 
tax legislation. These arrangements mean that the majority of the Group’s profit is taxed in the UK, reflecting the fact that majority of the 
business value is created through the trading platform developed and maintained in the UK, and through the internalisation of global client 
flows in the UK.
The table below sets out the statutory profit before tax, and tax charge, reported by the legal entities and branches in each of the 
geographic segments in order to explain the make-up of the Group’s tax charge by region.
