About WideCells
WideCells Group PLC is building an integrated stem cell services company, focused on
making stem cell treatments accessible and affordable. The Directors believe that the
use of cord blood stem cells for transplant will drive one of the next important phases
in medicine and the Group is developing market leading products in complementary,
strategic areas which are designed to take advantage of substantial market
opportunities in one of the fastest growing segments in the healthcare industry.
Keeping this in mind, WideCells Group PLC has been developing its three divisions:
• CellPlan: The world’s ﬁrst stem cell healthcare insurance plan providing ﬁnancial
cover for a second medical opinion and recommendation of the best transplant
centre worldwide, private cord blood transplantation costs, travel to treatment
centre where required, accommodation expenses and concierge service to manage
the whole transplant process.
• WideCells: The WideCells Institute of Stem Cell Technology (ISCT) has been
established and is based in the University of Manchester Innovation Centre. The
focus is on stem cell research and regenerative medicine. The WideCells ISCT also
has a Cryogenics division specialising in cell freezing and long term stem cell
storage.
• Wideacademy: An education and training division to promote understanding of the
beneﬁts of stem cell storage and treatment across the global medical, patient and
cord blood client and lay community.
To support the growth of these divisions, WideCells Group has built an experienced
Board and Senior Management Team, which was strengthened during the period
through the appointment of three new board members and the creation of a new
Scientiﬁc Advisory Committee.
Cord Blood Stem Cell Facts:
• Umbilical cord blood (the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta
following the birth of a baby) provides the most effective source of haemopoietic
stem cells for families. Collection of cord blood at birth is simple, safe and painless
compared to other sources of haemopoietic stem cells such as bone marrow,
which requires a general anaesthetic and a surgical procedure to collect. WideCells
is focused on promoting the collection and storage of umbilical cord blood and
tissue.
• Since 2005, there has been a 300% increase in the number of illnesses that can be
treated using cord blood stem cells reﬂecting its use in the treatment of blood
disorders.
• Cord blood is currently in clinical trial for the treatment of cerebral palsy which is a
neurological disorder.
• 82 different blood disorders have been treated using cord blood stem cell
transplantation.
• Despite initial cord blood collection, processing and storage often costing no more
than a few thousand pounds, cord blood stem cell transplantation for blood
disorders costs hundreds of thousands of pounds. WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017––––––– 2

wideacademy Overview WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017––––––– 6 Overview –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 7
We believe that the stem-cell sector is reaching a tipping
point in terms of the market’s understanding of its
potential to treat rare and life-threatening conditions; the
global stem cell market is currently valued at
c.US$96 billion and is predicted to grow to US$170 billion
by 2020 and US$270.5 billion by 2025, implying a CAGR of
13.8%. We are proud to be recognised as an intrinsic part
of this medical revolution.
Our integrated stem cell support services proposition
includes: CellPlan, the ﬁrst-of-its-kind stem cell insurance
plan; WideCells, our storage focused division leading the
way in the development and use of cell banking services;
and Wideacademy, which is driving education and
awareness on the stem cells sector. Each division made
signiﬁcant advances during the year as outlined below. 
As testimony to our commitment to both innovation and
education, in June 2017 the Group was ranked as the 21st
most disruptive company globally by DISRUPT 100, an
annual index celebrating the businesses with the most
potential to inﬂuence, change or create new global
markets. More recently, post period end, our CEO,
João Andrade, was awarded the CEO Europe Award 2018
by CEO Today Magazine.
CELLPLAN
CellPlan has developed the world’s ﬁrst stem cell
healthcare insurance plan and medical concierge service,
designed to revolutionise stem cell healthcare by making
stem cell transplants affordable for families who require
treatment for life threatening diseases. 
During the year, it made signiﬁcant advances bolstering its
innovative offering to create new revenue opportunities
and expand its service globally. It secured an agreement
with Biovault Technical Ltd, the UK’s largest private human
tissue storage facility (‘Biovault’), to roll-out CellPlan to
Biovault’s client base. Additionally, it launched its
e-commerce platform, www.cellplan.com, which allows
the Group to sell CellPlan directly to families, whether
existing or new clients. 
Although the UK stem cell market is comparatively small,
our initial launch in the UK has enabled us to trial our
offering. The aim is now to roll CellPlan out internationally
I am delighted to be part of this ground-breaking company and
deliver my inaugural statement as its Chairman; the prospects of
WideCells Group truly excite me. Through our three divisions, we
are focused on making stem cell treatment affordable and
accessible for families around the world. To this end, 2017 was
a year of building both our service offerings and our partnerships
with key players to position the Group as a multi-revenue
generative opportunity in a fast-growing sector. This resulted in an
inﬂection point with ﬁrst revenues generated before the year end. 
Chairman’s Review

and include additional product offerings over time. We are
set to launch in Spain imminently, and in support of this
have secured an agreement with Stem Cell Banco Celulas
Madre, S. A., an established provider of stem cell storage
services, to offer CellPlan to its clients, and will also launch
our e-commerce platform to ensure maximum market
penetration. A Deﬁnitive Agreement has also been secured
with Hemocord Clinica Medica Ltd in Brazil, a world-class
leader in cord blood storage, which is set to provide
CellPlan access to the largest cord blood storage market
in South America, a market projected to be worth
US$445 million by 2023.
In March this year WideCells announced a landmark deal
with Cryoviva Group, an established cord blood storage
facility with operations in Thailand, Singapore and India, to
sell CellPlan in Asia. Cryoviva has c.250,000 inspected
samples stored to-date which represents almost 9% of all
samples stored worldwide, with forecasts to store
c.25,000 new samples every year. CellPlan will be
launched to Cryoviva customers on a phased basis,
commencing in H2 2018, providing staged revenue
increases. 
Finally, with our storage division WideCells having recently
launched BabyCells, an umbilical cord blood and tissue
storage service which is available to clients in the UK and
Europe, additional synergistic growth opportunities are
available for CellPlan, as one year’s stem cell insurance
cover will be included as part of the initial storage
package.  It is our hope and expectation that this will lead
to ongoing uptake and revenue generation for CellPlan,
whilst also giving a competitive advantage to our storage
services. 
WIDECELLS
WideCells offers stem cell procurement, processing,
retrieval and storage services in the UK and Europe.
Through WideCells Brasil, it also operates a stem cell
laboratory in São Paulo, Brazil, licensed by the Brazilian
regulatory authority, the Agência Naciónal de Vigilância
Sanitáría (ANVISA). 
WideCells has established its own storage and processing
facility, called the Institute of Stem Cell Technology (‘ISCT’)
based at the University of Manchester Innovation Centre in
the UK, which is well positioned to capture an increasing
share of the cord blood banking market in the UK and
Europe. This provides the Group with exposure to
a fundamental part of the market; 4 million cord blood
samples are currently held in storage in 500 facilities
across the world and this is increasing by 250,000 a year. 
Whilst the Group had been offering umbilical cord stem
cells processing and storage services through a third-party
storage facility under its BabyCells brand in Portugal
between 2014 and early 2015, it was only post period end
in February 2018 that WideCells was awarded a Human
Application Licence by the UK’s Human Tissue Authority
(“HTA”). This licence permits the Group to procure, import,
export, process, store and distribute for treatment,
umbilical cord blood and umbilical cord tissue from the
UK and Europe at our ISCT facility in Manchester, UK. This
transformational milestone licence enables the Group,
under the brand name BabyCells, to offer affordable
umbilical cord blood and tissue storage services at the
highest standards to clients in the UK and Europe. Our
focus is now on promoting client-uptake and we are
actively looking for agents, initially focusing on Europe, to
promote our stem cell storage services. In support of this,
we believe we have a very strong product offering, as
alongside offering clients state-of-the-art storage services,
new BabyCells clients will be given a year’s stem cell
insurance cover, provided by our CellPlan division.
Going forward, WideCells intends to add additional stem
cell services such as dental pulp processing and storage
(TeethCells) and Adipose tissue collection, processing and
storage (LipoCells) to increase the Group’s stem cell
storage product offering. Furthermore, during the year
under review, WideCells secured a licence to provide
INDUS, a novel synthetic bone graft which promotes new
bone formation. The Group commenced selling this new
product in the UK in Q4 2017, initially targeting the dental
industry, with obvious potential for further roll out
internationally. 
Alongside our cryogenics facility at the ISCT, we have
a state-of-the-art laboratory which allows us to undertake
pioneering paid-for research projects to support the
continued development of the stem cell industry. Our
leading stem cell scientists have, for example, been
appointed by Qigenix, a California-based clinical stage
medical device company, to undertake research on its
behalf, testing a new laser technology designed to
increase the homing and integration of stem cells. By
supporting development, we ensure we remain at the fore
of the stem cell industry.
WIDEACADEMY
Spearheaded by Alan Greenberg, the former Director of
Apple Education, Wideacademy, the Group’s education
and training division, is focused on promoting
best-practice and quality, whilst driving innovation. By
helping people to understand this growing industry from
multiple perspectives and angles, Wideacademy will help
drive the uptake of our other products and services and in
turn investment across the entire sector, which ultimately,
could save many lives. The platform, which combines
free-to-access educational areas with paid-for premium
Chairman’s Review Overview –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 9
digital tools and resources for doctors and medical
professionals, was launched post period end and is already
receiving excellent feedback. 
Going forward, we intend to add additional functionality,
including access to educational modular courses that can
support Continual Professional Development (‘CPD’) for
medical professionals. The Group is currently in
discussions with a number of universities and educational
organisations to reﬁne its planned courses and CPD
offering. Wideacademy also intends to launch a Diseases &
Treatment section in H1 2018, to provide more detailed
information on speciﬁc illnesses.
CORPORATE
During the year, several corporate changes were
undertaken to reﬂect the Group’s transition from product
development into a revenue-generative, international
provider of stem cell services. Accordingly, we have
brought together individuals of outstanding quality who
have proven track records in the stem cell industry and
ﬁnancial sector. 
Directorship appointments included: Alan Greenberg,
previously Vice President of Wideacademy and a Group
Non-Executive Director, who became a Group Executive
Director and Group Chief Business Development Oﬃcer
whilst remaining Vice President of Wideacademy; Malcolm
Glaister, who has held a number of management roles
across a broad spectrum of leading investment and trading
businesses and joined as a Non-Executive Director; and
myself as Non-Executive Chairman, having previously held
several senior directorship positions with both large and
small companies in the insurance, healthcare and IT
industries. As part of these board changes, Dr. Graham
Hine, my predecessor as Chairman, retired from his board
role; I would like to thank him for all his work and support
in helping advance the Group to a point of international
growth and development. 
Post period end, David Henriques, who has signiﬁcant
asset management and corporate ﬁnance experience, and
is involved with the digitalisation of insurance products,
was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director.
He replaced Mr. Zakaria Aziz who stepped down from his
position as Non-Executive Director.
A new Scientiﬁc Advisory Committee consisting of leading
ﬁgures in the industry was also appointed. Responsible for
identifying and advising the Board on new developments
within the stem cell sector, the Committee will ensure that
we continue to address market demand and offer the
most competitive and innovative portfolio of services. 
Finally, post-period end, investors will be aware that
trading in our shares was suspended. This was a result of
a delay in publishing our ﬁnal results for 2017 pending
completion of the audit process, which in turn could not
be completed as we were in discussions with our ﬁnancial
advisers with a view to a fundraising. 
Having received commitments in respect of approximately
£1.47 million via a placing, and with a live market
bookbuild underway to bolster this further, we have been
able to successfully conclude the auditing of our annual
accounts. In light of this, we expect our trading
suspension to be lifted in the near term and are working
with the FCA to achieve this. 
I would like to assure shareholders that despite this
audit/corporate setback, all business operations have
continued to operate as usual and our growth prospects
remain strong. Our focus is ﬁrmly on achieving the
commercial roll-out of our stem cell services to build
revenues and ultimately drive the value of our business. 
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
We successfully raised £1.4 million before expenses in two
placings in 2017 on the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange. This has enabled us to set up our operations for
WideCells and Wideacademy in Manchester and for
CellPlan in Porto and we are on target to grow sales in
2018.
OUTLOOK
We are now focused on growth and the commercial
roll-out of products and services across all three divisions.
As well as our existing regions, we are exploring
opportunities in the Asia-Paciﬁc territories, where the stem
cell industry is gaining increasing proﬁle. Our preeminent
team and staff are leading the world in this exciting sector
and with their support, I anticipate steady growth during
the year. 
To conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to thank
our shareholders who provide ongoing support and look
forward to updating our progress on a regular basis.

Stem cell therapy is gaining increasing recognition for its
life-saving potential in a wide-range of medical
applications. 82 illnesses can currently be treated using
stem cell procedures, and developments in its use in
illnesses such as cystic ﬁbrosis, cerebral palsy, diabetes
and autism have caught the headlines of late. As the value
potential of this innovative treatment advances, more and
more people are becoming aware of the beneﬁts of
storing stem cells, which in turn is driving additional
development and advancement in the industry. This is
accordingly an opportune time to be building a leading
position within the stem cell industry and having
successfully launched our ﬁrst of its kind end-to-end stem
cell service that covers storage, insurance, research and
education/training, we are now focused on achieving
global roll-out to build revenues, drive development and
ultimately ensure that all people, regardless of geography
or ﬁnancial position, have access to stem cell treatment.
Through ﬁrst-hand experience, I have identiﬁed both the
value potential and the limitations of the industry in which
we operate. In terms of value potential, we are focused on
cord blood, taken from the umbilical cord following birth,
as we believe it is the most useful and best “quality” source
of stem cells and it is an area of rapid growth, with more
than 250,000 samples being stored per annum and
growing fast. However, looking at the limitations, whilst
over 4,000,000 people have stored cord blood with over
500 cord blood bank companies that exist worldwide,
paying c.£2,000 to do so, many do not realise that if
treatment is needed costs could climb to as high as
£300,000, making it unaffordable for many. It is because
of these limitations and strong growth dynamics that we
have created our end-to-end stem cell service. 
At the core of this offering is our highly innovative CellPlan
product – the ﬁrst global stem cell insurance package.
This provides access to stem cell specialists and hospitals,
covering the whole family for up to £/€1 million worth of
medical, travel and accommodation expenses worldwide
for an affordable £150-£300 per annum. With CellPlan live
in the UK and strategic agreements in place to launch in
Spain, Brazil, Thailand, India and Singapore in the coming

year it is clear to see that our focus is now on achieving
roll-out on a commercial scale. Of course, critical to stem
cell treatment is stem cell storage and so alongside
CellPlan, we are delighted to have recently launched our
own stem cell storage services at our state of the art
facilities at the Institute of Stem Cell Technology in
Manchester, UK. Following landmark licencing approval
from the Human Application Licence in February 2018, our
BabyCells service, offering umbilical cord blood and tissue
storage services to clients in the UK and Europe, is now
live and we are accordingly focused on promoting uptake.
BabyCells will be charged at a cost of circa £2,000 per
sample for one year’s storage (including collection and
processing), with recurring storage revenues of
£50-£75 per annum thereafter and alternative multi-year
pre-paid storage plans. Clients of BabyCells will be also
offered one year’s stem cell insurance cover, provided by
CellPlan, highlighting the synergistic offering of our
tripartite business model. 
The ﬁnal string to our offering is education and training
focused services, delivered through a bespoke online
platform – Wideacademy – of which we launched the ﬁrst
stage in February 2018. Being spearheaded by the former
Director of Apple Education, Alan Greenberg,
Wideacademy is committed to utilising the power of
education to support stem cell uptake across all levels of
the industry, with revenue opportunities available through
educational tools and courseware targeted at medical
professionals. 
Looking ahead, it is clear to see that 2018 is set to be
incredibly active for WideCells Group. Having successfully
launched all three divisions/services, our primary focus is
now on driving product update to deliver strong recurring
revenues and realise meaningful value for our investors,
whilst providing our clients with an affordable and quality
product offering that provides them with life-saving
medical cover for them and their family, now and for
many years to come. In line with our commitment to
being at the fore of the rapidly growing global stem cell
industry, we maintain an active growth strategy and will
continue to target strategic opportunities that provide our
company with value uplift opportunity, but our ﬁrst and
foremost focus is on building the proﬁle and global reach
of our innovative stem cell services.

Strategic Report
INTRODUCTION
WideCells Group PLC (the “Group”) is a company
domiciled in England. The Group was incorporated on
24 May 2016 and this is the second set of ﬁnancial
statements prepared by the Group.
The WideCells Group was formed on 16 June 2016 when
WideCells Group PLC acquired the entire issued share
capital of WideCells International Limited which had been
originally incorporated in 2012 under the name of Wide
Universal Ltd and its wholly owned subsidiaries based in
the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain.
On 27 July 2016, WideCells was admitted to the London
Stock Exchange’s Main Market, raising £2.00 million,
£1.72 million net of costs, via the placing of 18,181,819
new ordinary shares at a price of £0.11 and since then the
Group has raised approximately £1.4 million (before fees)
in two private placings. A placing and live market
bookbuild to raise an additional ~£1.80 million is
underway, as referred to in note 26 to the Financial
Statements.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS
REVIEW
WideCells Group is an international specialised provider of
stem cell services. Its business is separated into three key
divisions each of which is operated under a separate
brand: WideCells, CellPlan and Wideacademy.
OUR STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
The market and recent trends
Over 4,000,000 people have stored cord blood with over
500 cord blood bank companies that exist worldwide. 
The global stem cell market was valued at approximately
US$96 billion in 2017, and is expected to grow at a
compound annual growth rate of 13.8% to 2025, to reach
an estimated value of US$270 billion (Source:
Transparency Market Insight report). As one of the fastest
growing segments of the stem cell market, the number of
cord blood banks worldwide has grown from 23 in 2004
to over 500 in 2013 (Source: BioInformant Report).
The Directors believe that the Group’s growth will be
driven by the following factors, amongst others:
• while the cord blood market in the US is reasonably
mature, it is an early-stage market in other areas of
the world where cord blood banks were not well
established until the 2000s. This provides potential
for growth and expansion;
• cord blood stem cells are relatively uncontroversial
because they are derived from otherwise discarded
materials associated with living new-borns.
WideCells is not involved in embryonic stem cell
research;
• the effectiveness of cord blood transplants has been
widely validated, with 30,000 transplants performed
worldwide to date;
• cord blood is a very versatile biological material, as it
can be used to treat a wide range of blood diseases,
genetic and metabolic disorders,
immunodeﬁciencies, and various forms of cancer;
• cord blood is a naturally occurring resource
available during the birthing process;
• collecting cord blood for transplant use is a safe,
easy and pain-free process. Thus, cord blood
transplant has a distinct advantage over directly
competing alternatives, such as bone marrow
transplant;
• the industry serves expectant parents, who are
generally open-minded about options that could
provide protection to their families;
• public awareness is improving and perception
toward cellular therapy is becoming increasingly
favourable due to news coverage about stem cells
being used to treat serious medical conditions, as
well as to heal traumatic injuries for sports icons;
• clinical trial data support applications for
haemopoietic stem cells from cord blood and
mesenchymal stem cells from cord tissue;
• there is substantial potential for consolidation and
cooperation within the industry, including mergers,
acquisitions and funding rounds and industry
associations; and
• there is a trend toward diversiﬁcation within the
industry, with cord blood banks effectively
becoming stem cell banks through the storage of
cord blood, cord tissue, and in some cases placental
tissue, amniotic ﬂuid, and more. Overview –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 13
Strategy 
Current Business Strategy
The strategy of the Board is to continue to develop and
expand the business segments noted above. In addition, it
will work to develop the existing Group’s business. The
Directors believe that the growth of the global cord blood
banking industry, and the trends within the industry
referred to below, will create opportunities to build the
Group’s services and products.
The Group’s strategy in the cord blood banking market
comprises three key elements: 
• It is intended that the CellPlan insurance product,
which the Group has developed with the medical
advisory group, will give customers access to
renowned specialists and hospitals globally and will
include cover for medical, travel, accommodation
expenses (including a companion), arranging
doctors’ appointments, hospitalisation, paperwork
and bills. The Group expects that the CellPlan
insurance will be priced within the range of
£150-£300 p.a. (depending on the country). The
Group will retain a percentage of the net premium
of each policy sold;
• Through its WideCells business, the Group has
established a laboratory called the ‘Institute of Stem
Cell Technology’ at the University of Manchester
Innovation Centre. The facilities at UMIC include two
clean rooms used for contract research projects and
stem cell processing, and a Cryogenics section
which are used for freezing and storing a range of
human cells and tissues. WideCells will collect,
process and store cells and tissue of various kinds.
The average cost to the consumer is expected to be
in the region of £2,000; and
• The Group has launched Wideacademy, which is its
education and training branch and continues to
develop it. It will offer a series of online stem cell
training programmes for healthcare professionals.
The Directors believe that training will help to
accelerate the growth of the stem cell market.
These digital stem cells courses and content are
being developed in partnership with the University of
Westminster and other partnerships with strong
inﬂuencers in the stem cell industry and the
‘ed-tech’ space are currently being exploited.
CellPlan
CellPlan insurance 
CellPlan provides a specialist insurance product for the
stem cell and cord blood banking services sector, which
provides cover for expenses relating to use of stored stem
cells in certain medical procedures, following speciﬁed
diagnoses. This product is complementary in nature to the
services offered by the WideCells division of the business. 
The CellPlan insurance product was launched in July 2017
and has so far been trialled with a UK cord blood bank
initially, and the future strategy is for this to be rolled out
across the UK including through its own brand WideCells.
Launch in Spain is underway, and expansion across
additional territories is set for later in 2018 supported by
agreements the Group has entered into in Asia-Paciﬁc and
Brazil. Furthermore, the Group maintains an active growth
strategy and will continue to target new partner cord
blood banks as policies are adapted for local insurance
requirements.  WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017––––––– 14
Strategic Report
The Group has an active growth strategy to further build
CellPlan’s global reach and increase sales, which is in part
via the e-commerce platform, which facilitates low-cost
global rollout. To this end, CellPlan is currently in
discussions with additional stem cell storage facilities to
widen its existing networks. 
The CellPlan insurance product is, and will continue to be
available for selected potential customers via its
e-commerce platform. Through an extended provider
network, CellPlan insurance will be offered to families
which store their child’s stem cells in cord blood storage
facilities which are of high quality in terms of licensing and
accreditation. The Group, together with its insurance
providers, intend to make the premiums payable as
affordable as possible. This approach was undertaken to
widen the Group’s reach and make the product available
to more families, in line with CellPlan’s mission to make
stem cell treatment accessible and affordable for families
globally. Families with stem cells stored in banks that do
not have CellPlan Excel accreditation, or form part of the
extended provider network, will not be eligible to purchase
the CellPlan insurance product. 
To implement this strategy, the Group has developed
a user-friendly e-commerce website allowing potential
policyholders to purchase CellPlan online. It delivers
a comprehensive overview of the beneﬁts of the coverage,
and is planned to be supported by call centres, live chat
and tracking features. The Group intends to use social
media and advertising to promote its services and will
distribute materials at group events and activities attended
by expectant parents, new parents and parents of
school-aged children who have, or are looking to have,
their children’s stem cells stored. The business may also
approach insurance companies and brokers to encourage
a larger distribution of the CellPlan product, for example,
as an addition to existing private healthcare insurance
policies. 
CellPlan Excel
CellPlan is in the process of developing an accreditation
programme “CellPlan Excel”; a membership programme
aiming to promote best practice within the marketplace.
Accredited cord blood banks sign up to a prescriptive set
of requirements, and also agree to exclusively promote the
marketing of CellPlan to its existing and future members.
The cord blood bank receives commission payments for
policies sold. Members of the CellPlan Excel membership
programme will be the primary focus of the CellPlan
product launches, due to the comprehensive cover of
CellPlan products. The proposed plan includes a mix of
marketing channels and tools, and focuses on engaging
with an Excel accredited cord blood bank customer at
strategic points throughout the parent’s journey, as well as
commercial activities such as sponsorships, training, social
media and trade fair participation. The existing customers
of an Excel accredited cord blood bank will be offered
CellPlan. Agreements are already in place with Hemocord,
Biovault, Stem Cell S.A., WideCells, Cryoviva Group and the
Directors are in discussions with a number of other cord
blood banks. 
Once a referral agreement is in place with a cord blood
bank, CellPlan and the bank will develop a detailed
implementation plan covering, amongst other things
• sales operations (including sales approach, the
policy issuance processreporting and design and
implementation);
• sales training (including the preparation of
supporting materials);
• the establishment of a detailed marketing roll-out
plan across the key jurisdictions in which the cord
blood bank conducts operations
– launch the CellPlan website, which will be
directed at both retail customers and cord
blood banks; and
– formally launch the CellPlan product in the
market.
WideCells
The Directors’ intention is to continue developing
WideCells’ products to support and enhance its existing
offerings. 
WideCells Ltd has received the HTA Licence. This licence
is a human tissue application licence which enables
WideCells Ltd to procure, import/export, process, store
and distribute cord blood stem cells and cord tissue cells.
The Group is now offering its BabyCells stem cell retrieval,
processing, storage and distribution services in the UK
through its laboratory facilities, which are designed to
apply industry-leading techniques to optimise the quality
and safety of stem cells. WideCells España has obtained
a licence from SERMAS, and WideCells Portugal may seek
to apply to obtain licences from the relevant authorities so
as to allow for the export of samples collected by
WideCells España and WideCells Portugal to the Group’s
UK cord blood bank operated from the Core Technology
Facility of the UMIC. Overview –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 15
The initial processing capacity of the facility is expected to
be approximately 1,000 cord blood and 1,000 cord tissue
samples per year. This capacity can be increased in the
facility, albeit dependent on investment in additional
equipment and staff. The facility will also be able, when
licensed to do so, to process limited numbers of dental
pulp and adipose tissue collections. The initial storage
capacity of the facility, which is based on a single large
storage tank, is anticipated to provide storage space for at
least 2 years’ operation. The storage area has capacity of
at least another 4 storage tanks and additional storage
space is potentially available at UMIC. The use of an
additional clean room, plus an investment in additional
equipment and staff, could increase capacity to allow
30 cord blood and cord tissue samples to be processed
per day. It can store up to 30,000 cord blood and 50,000
cord tissue samples, with the capacity to increase this to
a total of 480,000 samples. In addition, there is an option
to further expand capacity on the current site if required.
The Group’s Chief Scientiﬁc Oﬃcer, Professor Hollands
oversees the Group’s operations at the laboratory. He is
the Designated Individual under the HTA Licence. Further
applications are expected to be made in the future to the
HTA to enable the processing of dental pulp stem cells
and adipose tissue. WideCells BabyCells brand was
launched on 19 March 2018 and is now fully operational.
Cord blood storage (including the ﬁrst years’ storage costs,
collection kit, testing and CellPlan insurance for the ﬁrst
year) is priced at £1,995. Cord blood and tissue storage is
priced at £2,390. 
WideCells intends to further develop its research facilities
to take on additional products from its existing two,
referred to in paragraph above. The University of
Manchester has its Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health
and Division of Cardiovascular Research located near to
the UMIC Core Technology Facility building, which may
enable further academic and research collaboration with
WideCells. In addition, the University of Manchester is
adjacent to Manchester Royal Inﬁrmary, which may enable
collaboration with clinical teams in the future.
Additional products
The Board plans to further expand the offerings of the
Group by developing the following products and services:
• TeethCells: dental pulp stem cells processing and
storage
• LipoCells: adipose tissue stem cells processing and
storage
KEY STRENGTHS
The Directors believe that the Group is well-placed to
compete against other market participants in the stem cell
and cord blood banking and services sector due to the
collectively strong track record, understanding and
experience of its Board.
The Directors believe that the CellPlan insurance product
is the most attractive product suite on the market, owing
to: the partnership with Best Doctors; the key
differentiating features of the insurance coverage,
including the high ﬁnancial limit of coverage, high levels of
service provision including a concierge service, the
territorial scope of the coverage being global, and limited
pre exclusions; complementary services for the umbilical
cord blood industry such as the establishment of CellPlan
Excel, a membership programme where membership is
dependent upon positive assessment against rigorous
technical and regulatory criteria, and the cooperation with
large, well known banks, such as Biovault. 
The arrangements with Best Doctors allows the Group to
beneﬁt from the experience, brand reputation and
back oﬃce infrastructure of Best Doctors and its
relationships with specialist medical insurance
underwriters, in order to help drive the take-up of the
CellPlan insurance product.
Taken on a standalone basis, the WideCells business has
a number of competitors offering accredited storage and
processing services for cord blood in the UK, Europe and
other jurisdictions. However, the Directors believe that the
integration of the WideCells business with the CellPlan
business, including the association with Best Doctors and
with high-quality service providers through CellPlan Excel,
will enable the WideCells business to be competitive with
other stem cell storage and processing ﬁrms, particularly
as the Group expands into broader stem cell banking
services such as in relation to dental pulp and adipose
tissue. Additionally, the Directors believe that the
education and training courses being developed by the
Wideacademy business will serve to complement and
promote the WideCells business.

Strategic Report
Given WideCells’ stage of development, KPIs are focused
on the key areas of cash management and operating
results. Non-ﬁnancial KPIs, including KPIs in respect of the
research and development programmes, will be formalised
as the business moves forward.
The board currently has Dr Marilyn Orcharton as the sole
female director at the end of the year. 1 of the 4 senior
managers are female and 7 of the 20 total employees in
the Group are female. The average number of employees
during the year was 17.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
For the year ended 31 December 2017, WideCells
generated consolidated revenues of £0.05 million (2016:
£0.03 million). This was from the development phase of an
£0.1 million R&D contract which will run through 2017 and
2018 and the start of CellPlan and INDUS sales. The
revenues from 2016 were the from the planning phase of
the R&D contract.
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS
WideCells’ administrative costs of £2.84 million (2016:
£1.26 million) consisted of ongoing costs to set up the
facility in Manchester and obtain the research and human
application licences from the Human Tissue Authority; to
develop and market the CellPlan stem cell health
insurance platform in the UK and Europe; and to develop
the Wideacademy platform to provide training and
education in stem cell technologies.
• During the year the average number of staff
employed grew to 17 (2016: 8) and the payroll cost
increased to £1.20 million (2016: £0.61 million).
• Share options were granted to Marilyn Orcharton,
David Bridgland and Alan Greenberg and the fair
value of the options at the date of the grant were
charged to consolidated statement of the
comprehensive income.
Research and development expenditure
Research and development activities consisted solely on
the development phase of the initial £0.10 million contract
and were part of normal payroll cost.
Capital expenditure
The total cash expenditure on ﬁxed assets in 2017 was
£0.32 million (2016: £0.21 million) as WideCells continued
to prepare its laboratory in Manchester to process and
store stem cell samples; and to develop the CellPlan
insurance platform. 
Cash ﬂow
Net cash outﬂow from operating activities was
£2.14 million in 2017 (2016: £0.75 million). The Group
invested £0.32 million in ﬁxed assets, raised £1.33 million
(net of costs) following the placing of shares in 2017,
raised a net £0.14 million of ﬁnancial debt, resulting in an
overall net cash outﬂow for the year of £1.00 million
(2016: inﬂow of £1.12 million). This was reduced by an
overdraft of £0.50 million so the cash balance at the end
of the year was £0.62 million (2016: £1.15 million).
Capital structure
WideCells Group PLC made a number of changes to its
capital structure during 2017.
On 28 April 2017 the Company issued and allotted
5,405,806 ordinary shares to investors at a price of
£0.12 per share in a private placement.
On 18 August 2017 the Company issued and allotted
5,357,143 ordinary shares to investors at a price of
£0.14 per share in a second private placement.
As a result of the above transactions, as at 31 December
2017 WideCells Group PLC had in issue 64,821,010
Ordinary Shares of £0.0025 each.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Directors consider the principal risks facing the
business to be as follows:
Risks relating to the Company and its
business strategy
• Early stage company - The Group faces risks
frequently encountered by early stage companies.
In particular, its future growth and prospects will
depend on its ability to manage growth and to
continue to expand and improve operational,
ﬁnancial and management information and quality Overview –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 17
control systems on a timely basis, whilst at the same
time maintaining effective cost controls.
• Dependence on key executives and personnel –
Although the Directors have entered into service
agreements or letters of appointment with the
Company, the loss of the services of any such
individual may have an adverse material effect on
the business, operations, revenues, customer
relationships and/or prospects of the Company. 
• Reliance on the stem cell and cord blood banking
market.
• Risks relating to compliance and licensing – The
Group is reliant upon certain key licenses. Any
diﬃculties in maintaining such licenses could
signiﬁcantly damage the prospects of such group
and business.
• Liability and insurance – It is not possible for the
Board to ensure that the business is insured against
all possible or potential risks.
• Failure of the Group’s premises, staff performance,
quality management system or procedures.
• Reliance on the medical advisory group Agreement
and UMIC Lease - A substantial part of the Group’s
business and growth potential depends on its
CellPlan insurance product and therefore its
relationship with the medical advisory group. Should
the agreement with the medical advisory group be
terminated and the Group ﬁnd it diﬃcult or
impossible to replace this relationship it could have
a signiﬁcantly adverse impact on the Group. The
WideCells division of the Group’s business depends
substantially on the lease in relation to the
laboratory premises at the University of Manchester
Innovation Centre (UMIC). Should the lease be
terminated or fail to be renewed at the end of its
three year term (in circumstances where the Group
would like to renew it) this could have a signiﬁcantly
adverse impact on the Group.
Risks relating to the stem cell and cord blood
banking and services sector
• Operating within a regulatory environment – The
Group’s business is subject to a variety of regulatory
regimes, and compliance with or changes in law and
regulation, or in its’ interpretation and application by
regulators, could impose operational restrictions on
the Group, increase its’ expenses relating to ongoing
compliance and/or otherwise have a material
adverse effect on such business. 
• Licensing requirements – The Group is dependent
upon holding valid licences to enable the business
to carry out its work, including the HTA Licence.
Maintenance of such licences may present a
damaging or insurmountable barrier to its business
development and growth if the necessary licences
cannot be obtained or maintained in a ﬁnancially
and commercially viable manner. 
• The threat of competition and new technology –
There is a risk that the science underpinning the
Group’s business will reveal alternative, more
effective solutions to the issues the Group’s services
and products seek to address which will decrease
demand for the Group’s products and services. In
addition, technologies in alternative solutions may
advance more rapidly than that which the Group’s
business relies on, making those alternative solutions
more attractive to end users. 
• Limitations to the application of medical treatments
- There are a number of limitations in relation to the
use of stem cells and cord blood in medical
treatments, some of which are inherent and some of
which arise from the fact that the underlying science
and technology is relatively new and of a limited
track record. Such drawbacks could have a negative
impact on the overall value of, and opportunities
within, the stem cell and cord blood banking and
services sector. This would result in a decreased
demand for the business’ products.
Financial risk management objectives and
polices
The Group is exposed to a variety of ﬁnancial risks which
result from both its operating and investing activities. The
Board is responsible for coordinating the Group’s risk
management and focuses on actively securing the Group’s
short to medium term cash ﬂows.
Finance risk
The Group enters into very few transactions involving
signiﬁcant complexity, potential material ﬁnancial exposure
or atypical risk. The Group does not actively engage in the
trading of ﬁnancial assets and has no ﬁnancial derivatives. WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017––––––– 18
Strategic Report
Funding risk
The Group continues to incur substantial operating
expenses. The recent placings generated suﬃcient cash to
take the Group toward break even and becoming cash
ﬂow positive however until the Group generates positive
net cash inﬂows from the commercialisation of its
products it may be required to seek additional funding
through the injection of equity capital from share issues.
The Group may not be able to generate positive net cash
inﬂows in the future or be able to attract such additional
funding as may be required, either at all, or on suitable
terms. In such circumstances the development
programmes may be delayed or cancelled and business
operations cut back.
The Group seeks to reduce this risk by keeping a tight
control on expenditure, avoiding long-term supplier
contracts, prioritising development spend on products
closest to potential revenue generation, maintaining
a focused portfolio of products under development and
by keeping shareholders informed of progress.
This report was approved by the Board on 4 June 2018
and signed on its behalf.

remuneration policy
The Remuneration Policy came into effect from the date of the AGM in 2017. The main aim of the Group’s remuneration
policy is to align the interests of Executive and Non-Executive Directors with the Group’s business strategy and the
long-term creation of shareholder value. The policy aims to pay the Directors competitively, whilst considering the
remuneration practices of other international companies of similar size and scope, the current economic climate, the
regulatory and governance framework, remuneration around the Group and the need to ensure that the Directors are
remunerated appropriately, whilst ensuring the Group pays no more than is necessary. The Committee has no formal
method of involving employees in the setting of Directors’ remuneration, however the members of the Committee have
access to employees both in formal and informal settings and take into account the level of employee remuneration
when setting Directors’ remuneration. Shareholders views on Directors’ remuneration are taken into account when
setting the Remuneration Policy.

Remuneration Report
reCruitMent poLiCy
The Committee’s approach to remuneration with regard to recruiting staff is to pay no more than is necessary to attract
candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role. The Committee would consider payment of
compensation for the forfeiture of variable awards from previous employers on an individual basis. The table sets out the
Committee’s approach to recruitment of new Executive Directors in regard to each element of remuneration.

Basic salary The Committee will offer salaries in a range appropriate for comparative roles while also
considering the experience of the individual, the wider economic climate and pay and conditions
throughout the Group, in line with its policy for existing Executive Directors.

Executive Directors. This includes, but is not limited to, a car allowance and private health

When determining any loss of oﬃce payment for a departing individual the Committee will ensure that a consistent
approach is adopted so that there is no reward for poor performance and the liabilities of the Group are minimised
where appropriate.
No amount is payable if an Executive Director is dismissed for serious breach of contract, serious misconduct or
under-performance or acts that bring the Executive Directors, or Group, into serious disrepute.
The table below sets out the policy on exit payment in relation to each element of remuneration for Executive Directors.

Corporate Governance
boArd oF direCtors
As at 31 December 2017 the Board comprised nine Directors,
ﬁve of whom are Executive Directors and four Non-Executive
Directors, reﬂecting a blend of different experience and
backgrounds. Subsequent to the year-end Zakaria Aziz
resigned, and one additional Non-Executive Director, David
Henriques, was appointed. The non-executive Directors are
not regarded as fully independent in view of their ownership
of shares in the Company.
The Directors give due regard to the principles set out in
The UK Corporate Governance Code published in
September 2014 by the Financial Reporting Council
(the ‘Code’) and the Quoted Companies Alliance (QCA)
published Corporate Governance Guidelines. Under the
listing rules compliance with the Code is voluntary.
Although the Board has not formally adopted the Code,
throughout the year ended 31 December 2017 it has sought
to adopt procedures to institute good governance insofar as
is practical and appropriate for a group of its size while
retaining its primary focus on the success of the business.
The Board is responsible for inter alia approving interim
and annual ﬁnancial statements, formulating and
monitoring Group strategy, approving ﬁnancial plans and
reviewing performance, as well as complying with legal,
regulatory and corporate governance matters. There is
a schedule of matters reserved for the Board.
The Board meet regularly to consider strategy, performance
and the framework of internal controls. To enable the
Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive
appropriate and timely information. Brieﬁng papers are
distributed to all Directors in advance of Board meetings.
The Company has established audit and remuneration
committees of the Board with formally delegated duties
and responsibilities.
tHe Audit And risk CoMMittee
The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its
responsibilities with regard to ﬁnancial reporting, external
and internal audits and controls, including reviewing and
monitoring the integrity of the Group’s annual and interim
ﬁnancial statements, advising on the appointment of
external auditors, reviewing and monitoring the extent of
the non-audit work undertaken by external auditors,
overseeing the Group’s relationship with its external
auditors, reviewing the effectiveness of the external audit
process and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s
internal control review function. The ultimate responsibility
for reviewing and approving the annual report and accounts
and the half-yearly reports remains with the Board.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Peter Presland, David
Henriques took over as chair from 19 February 2018 and its
other members are Marilyn Orcharton and Malcolm Glaister,
The Audit and Risk Committee meet not less than twice
a year. During 2017 the Audit Committee has met twice.
internAL ControL
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining
the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. The system of internal control is designed to
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure of the
achievement of business objectives and can only provide
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee continues to monitor and review the
effectiveness of the system of internal control and report
to the Board when appropriate with recommendations.
The annual review of internal control and ﬁnancial reporting
procedures did not highlight any issues warranting the
introduction of an internal audit function. It was concluded,
given the current size and transparency of the operations of
the Group that an internal audit function was not required
however this remains a matter for ongoing review.
The main features of the internal control system are
outlined below;
• A control environment exists through the close
management of the business by the Executive
Directors. The Group has a deﬁned organisational
structure with delineated approval limits. Controls
are implemented and monitored by the Executive
Directors.
• The Board has a schedule of matters expressly
reserved for its consideration and this schedule
includes acquisitions and disposals, major capital
projects, treasury and risk management policies and
approval of budgets.
• The Group utilises a detailed budgeting and
forecasting process. Detailed budgets are prepared
annually by the Executive Directors before submission
to the Board for approval. Forecasts are updated at
least quarterly to reﬂect changes in the business and
are monitored by the Board including future cash
ﬂow projections. Actual results are monitored against
annual budgets in detail on a monthly basis, with
variances highlighted to the Board.
Financial risks are identiﬁed and evaluated for each major
transaction for consideration by the Board and senior
management. Governance –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 33
• Standard ﬁnancial control procedures are operated
throughout the Group to ensure that the assets of
the Group are safeguarded and that proper
accounting records are maintained.
• A risk review process is in development whereby the
Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Finance Director will
present a report to the Board each year on the key
business risks.
GoinG ConCern
As disclosed on page 47 the Directors have prepared
cashﬂow forecasts for a period of 12 months from the
date of approval of this annual report and accounts which
show that the Group and parent company will have
suﬃcient funds to continue and therefore that the going
concern basis of preparation is appropriate. First and
foremost, this assumes the successful completion of the
current funding round. The other key assumption within
these forecasts is the growth in sales of CellPlan insurance
policies and of the BabyCells umbilical cord blood and
tissue storage service launched this year. Should the
fundraising fail to complete or the forecast sales be below
budget or delayed, a further injection of working capital
will be required to meet the Group and company’s
liabilities as they fall due.
Thus the Directors continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the annual ﬁnancial
statements, though they also acknowledge that a material
uncertainty exists that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the
Group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going
concern given the factors described above.
reLAtionsHip WitH sHAreHoLders
The Directors seek to build a mutual understanding of
objectives between the Company and its shareholders.
The Company reports formally to shareholders in its Annual
Report and Interim Statements setting out details of the
Group’s activities. In addition, the Company keeps
shareholders informed of events and progress through the
issue of regulatory news in accordance with the Listing Rules
for Companies of the London Stock Exchange, The Chief
Executive and Finance Director meet with institutional
shareholders following interim and ﬁnal results. The
Company also maintains investor relations pages and other
information regarding the business, the Group’s products and
activities on its website at http://www.widecellsgroup.com/
The Annual Report is made available to shareholders at least
21 days before the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) along with
notice of the AGM. Directors are required to attend the AGM,
unless unable to do so for personal reasons or due to
pressing commercial commitments, and shareholders are
given the opportunity to vote on each separate resolution
proposed at the AGM. The Company counts all proxy votes
and will indicate the level of proxies lodged for each
resolution after it has ﬁrst been dealt with by a show of hands.

direCtors’ responsibiLities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’
Report, Strategic Report and the ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the
Directors have elected to prepare the Group ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union and the Company ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the
Directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless
they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the
proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the ﬁnancial statements; Governance –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 35
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Group will continue in business; and
• prepare a directors’ report, a strategic report and
directors’ remuneration report which comply with
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate
accounting records that are suﬃcient to show and explain
the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Group
and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006
and as regards the group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of
the IAS regulation. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.

OPINION
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of WideCells
Group PLC (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiary
companies (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 December
2017 which comprise of the consolidated income
statement and statement of other comprehensive income,
consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position, the
consolidated statement of cash ﬂows, the consolidated
statement of changes in equity, the company balance
sheet, the company statement of changes in equity and the
notes to the ﬁnancial statements, including a summary of
signiﬁcant accounting policies. The ﬁnancial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as
regards the parent company ﬁnancial statements, as
applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the
group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at
31 December 2017 and of the group’s loss for the
year then ended;
• the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union;
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union and as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies
Act 2006; and
• the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006; and, as regards the group ﬁnancial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of
the ﬁnancial statements section of our report. We are
independent of the group and the parent company in
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant
to our audit of the ﬁnancial statements in the UK, including
the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public
interest entities, and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
suﬃcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY IN RELATION TO
GOING CONCERN
We draw attention to note 1 in the ﬁnancial statements
concerning the group and parent company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. The Directors have prepared
cashﬂow forecasts for a period of 12 months from the date
of signing the ﬁnancial statements, which show that the
group requires funds from an equity placing and from an
increase in the Cellplan and cell storage sales. Should the
fundraising fail to complete or the forecast sales are below
budget or delayed, a further injection of working capital will
be required. These conditions, along with the other matters
as set out in note 1, indicate that a material uncertainty
exists that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the group and
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our opinion is not modiﬁed in respect of this matter.
Given the conditions and uncertainties noted above we
considered going concern to be a Key Audit Matter. We
have performed the following work as part of our audit:
Independent Auditor’s
Report to the Members of
WideCells Group PLC Financial Statements ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 39
• We critically challenged the directors’ forecasts to
assess the group and parent company’s ability to
meet their ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due for
a period of at least 12 months from the date of
approval of the ﬁnancial statements and assessed
and corroborated the key underlying assumptions,
Including:
• Assessing the reasonableness of forecast
expenditure by reference to actual expenditures in
2017 and the Director’s planned activity.
• Agreement of referral contracts signed with cord
blood banks in Thailand, India, Brazil and the UK
which will allow for the sale of CellPlan insurance
policies to users of the blood banks.
• Agreement of the potential raising of £1.80m of
funding, referred to in the directors report, shortly
after the signing of these ﬁnancial statements to
placing letters.
• Conﬁrmed with Management and the Directors
whether there are any other matters that may
adversely impact upon their assessment of going
concern.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgment, were of most signiﬁcance in our audit of the
ﬁnancial statements of the current period and include the
most signiﬁcant assessed risks of material misstatement
(whether or not due to fraud) we identiﬁed, including those
which had the greatest eﬀect on: the overall audit strategy,
the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the
eﬀorts of the engagement team. This matter was addressed
in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on this matter.
Other than the matter described in the material uncertainty
related to going concern section above we did not identify
any further key audit matters during the audit.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and
performing the audit, in evaluating the eﬀect of identiﬁed
misstatements on the audit in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality is deﬁned as the magnitude of an omission or
misstatement that, individually or in aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic
decisions of the users of the ﬁnancial statements and
provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of
our audit procedures.
The materiality for the group audit as a whole was set at
£90,000 (2016: £20,000) and was determined with
reference to the benchmark of adjusted group loss before
taxation of which it represents 4% (2016: 3%). The group’s
loss has been adjusted by adding back the costs incurred by
the group as part of its further placing made during the
year, which are exceptional in nature. This was deemed an
appropriate measure due to the fact that the group has
generated little revenue to date, the group’s transactions
mainly consist of the expenditure and other setting up
costs of the business. Performance materiality is the
application of materiality at the individual account or
balance level to reduce to an appropriately low level the
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and
undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the
ﬁnancial statements as a whole. Performance materiality
was set at 60% (2016: 60%) of the above materiality levels, WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 –––––– 40
having considered a number of factors including the
expected total value of known and likely misstatements and
management’s attitude toward proposed adjustments.
The materiality for the audit of the WideCells Group PLC
individual ﬁnancial statements was set at £67,500 (2016:
£15,000). In both years materiality for the company was
capped at 75% of group materiality. Performance materiality
was set at 60% of materiality at £40,500 (2016: £9,000).
For signiﬁcant overseas components we set materiality at
£54,000 (2016: £12,000) which is 60% of group materiality.
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected and
uncorrected misstatements exceeding £3,600 (2016: £600)
in addition to other audit adjustments that warranted
reporting on qualitative grounds.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our assessment of audit risk and group materiality
determines the audit scope for each component within the
group, and allows us to form an opinion on the group
ﬁnancial statements. The group engagement team
completed full scope audits on the following signiﬁcant
components, WideCells Group PLC, WideCells Limited,
WideCells International Limited and Wideacademy Limited. 
These components account for 98% of the group’s revenue
and 86% of the group’s loss before tax. The remainder of
the group is made up of subsidiary companies based
outside of the United Kingdom. During the audit we had full
access to the books and records of these companies and
so the group audit team completed audit procedures on
balances above performance materiality on these
companies to a materiality of £54,000 which is 60% of the
group materiality.
OTHER INFORMATION
The directors are responsible for the other information. The
other information comprises the information included in
the annual report, other than the ﬁnancial statements and
our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the ﬁnancial
statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our
report, we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the ﬁnancial statements,
our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the ﬁnancial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements,
we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the
work we have performed, we conclude that there is
a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in
this regard.
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED
BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course
of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the
directors’ report for the ﬁnancial year for which the
ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with
the ﬁnancial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have
been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO
REPORT BY EXCEPTION
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the
group and the parent company and its environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identiﬁed
material misstatements in the strategic report or the
directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following
matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by
the parent company, or returns adequate for our
audit have not been received from branches not
visited by us; or
• the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the directors’ remuneration report to be
Independent Auditor’s Report Financial Statements ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 41
audited are not in agreement with the accounting records
and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement ,
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair
view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of ﬁnancial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the directors are responsible
for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the
group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these ﬁnancial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the
ﬁnancial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This
description forms part of our auditor’s report.
OTHER MATTERS WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO
ADDRESS
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were
appointed by the audit committee to audit the ﬁnancial
statements for the year ending 31 December 2016 and
subsequent ﬁnancial periods. The period of total uninterrupted
engagement is 2 years, covering the years ending 31 December
2016 to 31 December 2017.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard
were not provided to the group or the parent company and we
remain independent of the group and the parent company in
conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the
audit committee.
USE OF OUR REPORT
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the parent company and the
parent company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY (continued) 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation and going concern
WideCells Group PLC the company is a public company (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in England. The Company
was incorporated on 24 May 2016 and this is the second set of ﬁnancial information prepared by the Company.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied to all
the periods presented.
The Directors have prepared cashﬂow forecasts for a period including 12 months from the date of approval of this annual
report and accounts which show that the Group and the parent company will have suﬃcient funds to continue and
therefore that the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate. First and foremost, this assumes the successful
completion of the current funding round of £1.80 million. The other key assumption within these forecasts is the growth in
sales of CellPlan insurance policies and of the BabyCells umbilical cord blood and tissue storage service launched this year.
Should the fundraising fail to complete or the forecast sales be below budget or delayed, a further injection of working
capital will be required to meet the Group and company’s liabilities as they fall due. 
Thus the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual ﬁnancial statements,
though they also acknowledge that a material uncertainty exists that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Group and parent
company’s ability to continue as a going concern given the factors described above.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies
reporting under IFRS and are presented in £ Sterling.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
Changes in accounting policies
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not eﬀective for 2017 and therefore have not
been applied. The eﬀective dates shown are for periods commencing on the date quoted.
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (eﬀective 1 January 2018) – EU endorsed
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (eﬀective 1 January 2018) – EU endorsed
• IFRS 16 Leases (eﬀective 1 January 2019) – EU endorsed
As the Group has not yet started to generate signiﬁcant revenues the Directors are of the opinion that the introduction of
IFRS15 will have no material impact on the previously reported revenue. The Directors will continue to review the Group’s
revenue recognition policy of its core revenue which should commence in the coming year to ensure that this is compliant
with IFRS15. The Directors are also of the opinion that IFRS9 will have minimal impact on the Group. IFRS16 will not aﬀect
the Group until the year ended 1 January 2019. This will have the eﬀect of capitalising some of the Group’s leases on the
Group’s balance sheet and its eﬀect has yet to be fully documented  by the Directors.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate those of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries. The parent controls
a subsidiary if it has power over the investee to signiﬁcantly direct the activities, exposure, or rights, to variable returns from
its involvement with the investee, and the ability to use its power over the investee to aﬀect the amount of the investor’s
returns, all subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 December.
All transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised gains and
losses on transactions between Group companies. Where unrealised losses on intra-Group asset sales are reversed on
consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from a Group perspective. Amounts reported in the ﬁnancial
statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted
by the Group.
Proﬁt or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from
the eﬀective date of acquisition, or up to the eﬀective date of disposal, as applicable.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements consist of the results of the following entities:
Entity Summary description
WideCells Group PLC Ultimate holding company
WideCells International Limited Holding company of subsidiaries
WideCells Limited Trading company
WideCells Portugal SA Trading company
WideCells España SL Trading company
WideAcademy Limited Trading company
CellPlan Limited Holding company
CellPlan International Lda Trading company
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in the year, net of discounts and sales taxes.
Sales income derives from the procurement and marketing of cord blood stem cell storage. Revenue is recognised as
detailed below;
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic beneﬁts associated with a transaction will ﬂow to the Group
and the amount of revenue and associated costs can be measured reliably. Where the work has been carried out and it is
certain that the income is due, appropriate adjustments are made through deferred and accrued income on a percentage
of completion basis. Deferred income comprises of income received in advance of the consideration being due and has
been included within current liabilities on the basis that the revenue becomes due within 12 months from the balance
sheet date. Accrued Income Includes the value of work performed during the period and where a right to consideration
has arisen, which was not invoiced until after the period end.

WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 –––––– 48 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets (excluding inventories and deferred tax assets)
Other non-ﬁnancial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the
higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the
smallest group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows; its cash generating units
(‘CGUs’). Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s CGUs that are expected to beneﬁt from the
synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in proﬁt or loss, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other
comprehensive income.
Foreign currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in
which they operate are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and
liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange diﬀerences arising on the retranslation of
unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss, except for foreign currency
borrowings qualifying as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, in which case exchange diﬀerences are
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve along with the exchange
diﬀerences arising on the retranslation of the foreign operation.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to those ruling when
the transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting
date. Exchange diﬀerences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas
operations at actual rate are recognised in the translation reserve.
Exchange diﬀerences recognised in the proﬁt or loss of Group entities on the translation of long-term monetary items
forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassiﬁed to other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
Financial assets
The Group does not have any ﬁnancial assets which it would classify as fair value through proﬁt or loss, available for sale or
held to maturity. Therefore all ﬁnancial assets are classed as loans and receivables as deﬁned below.
Loans and receivables
These assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also
incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that
are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the eﬀective
interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as signiﬁcant ﬁnancial diﬃculties on the part
of the counterparty or default or signiﬁcant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts
due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the diﬀerence between the net carrying amount and
the present value of the future expected cash ﬂows associated with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which
are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within
administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On conﬁrmation that the trade
receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written oﬀ against the associated provision.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated
statement of ﬁnancial position.
Financial Statements ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 49 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less, and - for the purpose of the statement of cash ﬂows - bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are
shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position.
Equity instruments
Convertible loan notes are categorised based on the substance of the contract and not their legal form. Any contract that evidences
a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities is treated as an equity instrument.
A ﬁnancial instrument is treated as an equity instrument only if:
1. The instrument may or will be settled in the issuers own equity instruments, it is either a derivative that will be settled by the
issuer exchanging a ﬁxed amount of cash or another ﬁnancial instrument for a ﬁxed number of its own equity shares, or
a non-derivative that includes a contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of the entity’s own equity shares.
2. The instrument includes no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another ﬁnancial asset to another entity
Financial liabilities 
The Group does not have any ﬁnancial liabilities that would be classiﬁed as fair value through the proﬁt or loss. Therefore these
ﬁnancial liabilities are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial liabilities at amortised cost, as deﬁned below.
Other ﬁnancial liabilities include the following Items:
• Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest rate method, which
ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the
consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position. Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs and premium
payable on redemption, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
• Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method.
Share capital
The Group’s ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity instruments.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when
declared by the Directors. In the case of ﬁnal dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM. No dividends were
declared during the years to 31 December 2017.

for the year ended 31 December 2017
WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 –––––– 50 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Tangible ﬁxed assets
Items of plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly
attributable costs.
Depreciation is provided on all other items of property, plant and equipment, so as to write oﬀ their carrying value over
their expected useful economic lives. It is provided at the following rates:
Plant & machinery – 33% straight line basis
Leasehold improvements – 33% straight line basis
Computer hardware– 33% straight line basis
Motor vehicles – 33% straight line basis
Intangible ﬁxed assets
Intangible assets comprise capitalised computer software and are initially recognised at cost.
Amortisation is provided so as to write oﬀ their carrying value over their expected useful economic lives. It is provided at
the following rates:
Computer software – 33% straight line basis
Leased assets
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the
Group (a "ﬁnance lease"), the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised as an
asset is the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments payable
over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. Lease payments are analysed
between capital and interest. The interest element is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income
over the period of the lease and is calculated so that it represents a constant proportion of the lease liability. The capital
element reduces the balance owed to the lessor.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group (an "operating
lease"), the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are initially recognised at cost, and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises
all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition.
Share-based payments
Where equity settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged
to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken
into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the
cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. Non-vesting
conditions and market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting
conditions are satisﬁed, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisﬁed. The
cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition or where a non-vesting condition is
not satisﬁed.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modiﬁed before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options,
measured immediately before and after the modiﬁcation, is also charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income over the remaining vesting period.
Financial Statements ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 51 2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The Group makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually
evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may diﬀer from these estimates and assumptions.
There are no estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year.
3. REVENUE
Revenue in all periods principally arises from the provision of services. In 2016 this was from the planning phase of an
R&D contract with Qiginex, which will run through 2017 and 2018 in the UK. The revenues in 2017 also included the start of
sales of CellPlan and INDUS product.
4. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Operating segments are components of the entity that:
1. Engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses
2. Of which discrete ﬁnancial information is available
3. Whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker
Until sales begin in the new operating divisions of CellPlan and Wideacademy, the Group has three main operating
segments, all of which have the same intended sources of revenue from the WideCells division:
• UK
• Portugal
• Spain
The Group’s reportable segments are geographical business units that oﬀer WideCells products and services into diﬀerent
market. They are managed separately as each business is operated from a diﬀerent location.
Measurement of operating segment proﬁt or loss, assets and liabilities
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of signiﬁcant
accounting policies.
The Group evaluates performance on the basis of proﬁt or loss from operations but excluding non-recurring losses and the
eﬀects of share-based payments.
Inter-segment sales are priced along the same lines as sales to external customers, with an appropriate discount being
applied to encourage use of Group resources at a rate acceptable to local tax authorities. This policy was applied
consistently throughout the current and prior period.

The Group is exposed through its operations to the following ﬁnancial risks;
• Credit risk.
• Market risk.
• Liquidity risk.
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of ﬁnancial instruments. This
note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure
them.
Principal ﬁnancial instruments
The principal ﬁnancial instruments used by the Group, from which ﬁnancial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
• Trade receivables.
• Cash and cash equivalents.
• Trade and other payables.
• Loans and borrowings.
A summary of the ﬁnancial instruments held by category is provided below:

General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and,
whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that
ensure the eﬀective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s Management Committee. The Board
receives quarterly reports from the Management Committee.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly aﬀecting the
Group’s competitiveness and ﬂexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below:
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Group if a development partner or a counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails
to meet its contractual obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is group policy,
implemented locally to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering into contracts. 
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and ﬁnancial institutions. For banks and
ﬁnancial institutions, only independently rated parties with high credit status are accepted.
The Group does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk.
Quantitative disclosures of the credit risk exposure in relation to ﬁnancial assets are set out below. Further disclosures
regarding trade and other receivables, which are neither past due nor impaired, are provided in note 13.
The total exposure to credit risk of the Group is equal to the total value of the ﬁnancial assets held at each year end as
noted above.

Cash held at HSBC - S&P Rating AA 610,707 1,131,301
Cash held at Santander - S&P Rating A 4,512 18,457
Total ﬁnancial assets 615,219 1,149,758
The Group is continually reviewing the credit risk associated with holding money on deposit in banks and seeks to mitigate
this risk by holding deposits with banks with high credit status.
Market risk
Cash ﬂow interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to cash ﬂow interest rate risk from short term borrowings at variable rate. 
It is group policy that all borrowings are approved by the Directors to ensure that it is not taking on signiﬁcant risk related
to possible movements in interest rates. Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely
from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor eliminates fully cash ﬂow risk associated with variability in
interest payments, it considers that it achieves appropriate balance of exposure to these risks. 
During the period, the Groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling.

for the year ended 31 December 2017
WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 –––––– 60 17. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises because the Group has operations in Portugal and Spain, whose functional currency is not the
same as the functional currency of the Group. The Group’s net assets arising from such overseas operations are exposed
to currency risk resulting in gains or losses on retranslation into sterling. Given the levels of materiality, the Group does not
hedge its net investments in overseas operations as the cost of doing so is disproportionate to the exposure.
Foreign exchange risk also arises when individual Group entities enter into transactions denominated in a currency other
than their functional currency; the Group has several customers and a regular supplier who are invoiced in currency other
than sterling. These transactions are not hedged because the cost of doing so is disproportionate to the risk.
As of 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk was not material.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital. It is the risk that the Group will encounter diﬃculty in
meeting its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due.
It is the Group's aim to settle balances as they become due, however following the anticipated placing in June 2018 it is
agreeing with creditors an extended payment plan to manage short term liquidity risk.
The Group’s ﬁnancial position following the placing in June 2018 will be such that the Board does not consider there to be
a short term liquidity risk however the Board will continue to monitor long term cash projections in light of the
development plan and will consider raising funds as required to fund long term development projects. Development
expenditure can be curtailed as necessary to preserve liquidity.

Capital risk management
The Group monitors capital which comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium, and accumulated
deﬁcit).
The Group’s objectives when maintaining capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and continue to provide returns for shareholders
beneﬁts for other stakeholders
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurably with the level of risk.
At present the Directors do not intend to pay dividends, but will reconsider the position in future periods, as the Group
becomes proﬁtable.

The Black-Scholes valuation model was used setting an implied volatility of 50%, interest rate of 5% and dividend yield of
1%. Each tranche of share options was valued separately using the actual exercise price. The Group recognised total
expenses of £120,462 and £186,626 related to share-based payment transactions in 2017 and 2016 respectively.
Warrants
In 2016 the company issued 727,272 Broker warrants that allowed for the conversion of these warrants into ordinary shares
in the company at any time within two years of the date of the placing at the placing price of £0.11. Given the early stage of
the company’s development and the limited active market in its shares, the Directors considered that the IPO placing price
at £0.11 represented the most recent, reliable benchmark of share/warrant valuation. 
Using the Black-Scholes valuation model and setting an implied volatility of 50%, interest rate of 5% and dividend yield of
1%, the warrants were valued at £24,887. As this was considered to be a cost related to the IPO, the £24,887 was charged
to the share premium account rather than the proﬁt & loss account in 2016.

WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 –––––– 68
WIDECELLS GROUP PLC – STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY  1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
WideCells Group PLC is a public company (the ‘Company’) domiciled in England. The nature of the Company’s operation is
a holding company.
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 (FRS102) issued by
the Financial Reporting Council.
In preparing the separate ﬁnancial statements of the parent company, advantage has been taken of the following disclosure
exemptions available in FRS 102:
– No cash ﬂow statement has been presented for the parent company;
– Disclosures in respect of the parent company’s ﬁnancial instruments and share-based payment arrangements have
not been presented as equivalent disclosures have been provided in respect of the group as a whole; and
– No disclosure has been given for the aggregate remuneration of the key management personnel of the parent
company as their remuneration is included in the totals for the Group as a whole.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any provision for losses arising on impairment, In relation to acquisitions,
where advantage can be taken of the merger relief rules, shares issued as consideration for acquisitions are accounted for at
nominal value.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset in respect of unutilised tax losses has not been recognised on the basis that the future economic beneﬁt
was not certain.
Going concern
Accounting standards require the Directors to consider the appropriateness of the going concern basis when preparing the
ﬁnancial statements. The Directors have prepared cashﬂow forecasts for a period including 12 months from the date of approval of
this annual report and accounts which show that the Company will have suﬃcient funds to continue and therefore that the going
concern basis of preparation is appropriate. First and foremost, this assumes the successful completion of the current funding of
£1.80 million. The other key assumption within these forecasts is the growth in sales of CellPlan insurance policies and of the
BabyCells umbilical cord blood and tissue storage service launched this year. Should the fundraising fail to complete or the forecast
sales be below budget or delayed, a further injection of working capital will be required to meet the Company’s liabilities as they fall
due.
Thus the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual ﬁnancial statements, though
they also acknowledge that a material uncertainty exists that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Group and parent company’s ability
to continue as a going concern given the factors described above.
Financial Statements ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– 69
Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Items of plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. As well as the purchase price, cost includes directly
attributable costs.
Depreciation is provided on all other items of property, plant and equipment, so as to write oﬀ their carrying value over
their expected useful economic lives. It is provided at the following rates:
Computer hardware and software – 33% straight line basis
Foreign currency
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet
date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of
transaction. Exchange diﬀerences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Leasing
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the Company at their fair value or, if lower, at the present
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the
lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁnance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance
charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability.
Retirement beneﬁt costs
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments
Where equity settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged
to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are
taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that,
ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually
vest. Non-vesting conditions and market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As
long as all other vesting conditions are satisﬁed, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions
are satisﬁed. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition or where a non-
vesting condition is not satisﬁed.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modiﬁed before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options,
measured immediately before and after the modiﬁcation, is also charged to the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income over the remaining vesting period.

WideCells Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 –––––– 70 2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The Company makes certain estimates and assumptions regarding the future. Estimates and judgements are continually
evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may diﬀer from these estimates and assumptions.
There are no estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year.
The valuation of share options and warrants are directors’ estimates and details are disclosed in note 21 of the consolidated
accounts.
