STRATEGIC REPORT EXCITING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES  
IN THE ATIC MARKET
The global ATIC market is 
currently valued at $250bn. 
With more and more 
companies outsourcing their 
Quality Assurance activities, 
Intertek is well placed to 
capture a disproportionate 
share of the $200bn that’s 
currently managed in-house.
WHY OUTSOURCE?
The growing complexity of companies' 
operations is creating unprecedented 
levels of risk in supply and distribution 
chains across the world.
Many forces are at play, from 
increasingly decentralised supply and 
manufacturing operations, to more 
empowered and demanding consumers 
and an ever-more competitive 
distribution and retail landscape.
Many companies are recognising two 
key truths. 
First, they need an end-to-end Total 
Quality Assurance solution that 
manages quality, safety and endemic 
risk at every point of the supply and 
distribution chain. 
Second, that using independent TQA 
experts with a proven track record 
delivers peace of mind while freeing 
them up to concentrate on their core 
competencies.
Intertek provides independent TQA 
expertise, based on our integrated 
portfolio of ATIC solutions, delivered 
through the unmatched precision, pace 
and passion of our 43,000+ experts 
located in more than 100 countries 
across the world.
In short, we believe that Intertek can 
truly deliver the peace of mind that our 
clients seek.

The single biggest step forward that we

organisations to operate more safely,

STRATEGIC REPORT
13 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 The Group has delivered continued 
progress in revenue, margin and cash 
performance in 2017 , reflecting the 
Group's performance management 
discipline focused on margin-
accretive revenue growth and cash 
conversion delivering strong returns 
for our shareholders. 
In line with our progressive dividend policy 
and underpinned by our excellent cash 
generative earnings model and strong 
balance sheet, we have announced a full 
year dividend of 71.3p, an increase of 
14.3% and are increasing the dividend 
payout ratio to circa 50% from 2018. 
The Products and Trade related divisions, 
which represent 94% of the Group's 
earnings, delivered excellent performance 
with organic revenue growth of 4.8% at 
constant rates while, as expected, trading 
conditions remained challenging in the 
Resources related division. 
Moving forward, the growth opportunities 
are highly attractive for Intertek as we 
further leverage our high-quality, 
cash-generative earnings model, built on 
the local expert delivery of Assurance, 
Testing, Inspection and Certification 
services on a global scale, that together 
define our unique Total Quality Assurance 
(TQA) value proposition. 
It remains important to contextualise our 
performance of 2017 and anticipated 
future earnings growth, driven by our 
differentiated growth strategy based on 
our TQA value proposition and the 
significant market development 
opportunities ahead, all underpinned by 
the exceptionally deep and broad 
expertise of our people.
 
SEIZING THE MARKET 
OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD
At Intertek, our aim is to give our clients 
across the world the uncompromised peace 
of mind that builds trust.
One thing is for certain – this is a 
differentiated approach with the 
commercial potential to step up our scale 
and performance as we move ahead. 
Intertek is facing a tremendous 
opportunity: a global opportunity that we 
currently value at around $250 billion.
This is the estimated total value of the 
global Quality Assurance market, of which 
only around 20 per cent is currently 
outsourced. That means that companies 
across the world manage approximately 
$200 billion-worth of quality assurance 
for themselves – the massive hidden 
‘iceberg’ of potential.
Additionally, in our view, there is significant 
untapped opportunity beyond the $250 
billion, as companies increasingly become 
aware of systemic risk in their businesses 
and the need for T otal Quality Assurance. 
In 2017 , we made progress on performance and 
strategy... the organic and inorganic growth 
opportunities ahead are truly exciting!

LEVERAGING OUR UNIQUE 
TQA VALUE PROPOSITION
Intertek pioneers the Quality Assurance 
industry on a global scale with a fully 
integrated portfolio of Assurance, 
Testing, Inspection and Certification (ATIC) 
services. This is what we call Total Quality 
Assurance and is what clients increasingly 
want and need in a progressively 
complex world. 
Intertek is the only company to have 
added the Assurance dimension to the 
‘TIC’ components to offer an integrated 
ATIC value proposition to its clients.
So what drove us to take this step? We 
took the simple decision to look at our 
value proposition from the customer’s 
perspective. And this rapidly revealed to 
us that TQA is what our customers now 
require, almost regardless of their size, 
their industry or their location. 
This is for a very simple reason. In the 
past, companies were primarily focused on 
the quality control issues around their 
end-products, raw materials, components 
and assets – all of which rely on the 
efficiency and effectiveness of Testing, 
Inspection and Certification activities. 
Importantly, the demand for TIC 
components will continue to grow in the 
years to come, benefiting from a number of 
André Lacroix
Chief Executive Officer
parallel trends: companies’ investments in 
quality and innovation, for example, as well 
as ever-strengthening regulatory 
standards, increased focus on sustainability, 
accelerating global and regional trade flows, 
and increasing demand for energy.
Another powerful trend is also at play, 
however. In our global market place, 
corporations are sharpening their focus on 
the management of risk in their 
increasingly complex supply chain and 
distribution operations. This is where 
Assurance comes in – and it is why we 
have evolved beyond quality control alone 
to additionally assure the reliability of 
clients’ operating processes and quality 
management systems. 
BUILDING OUR VALUE PROPOSITION
It was this recognition that led us to 
substantially adapt the Intertek value 
proposition around a new Customer 
Promise. This Promise commits us to 
“Intertek Total Quality Assurance 
expertise, delivered consistently with 
precision, pace and passion, enabling our 
customers to power ahead safely”.
Now we can support the existing and 
emerging TQA needs of our customers 
in all areas of their extended 
operations, from R&D, sourcing 
materials and component suppliers to 
transportation, distribution, retail and 
consumer management. 
This gives our clients the systemic TQA 
solution they want and we believe TQA is 
set to be an increasingly important 
requirement in the future, as the trading 
landscape in which our customers operate 
continues to become more complex and 
global. And it is already complex – today, 
almost 60 per cent of GDP is international. 
THE ATIC ADVANTAGE
Our global TQA Experts give 
our clients the ATIC 
Advantage by delivering our 
TQA Customer Promise."
Read more about our full services  
on page 10 
Compare this with 50 years ago, when 
global trade represented only 25 per cent 
of global GDP.
This burgeoning globalism is driving 
change in the ways that supply chains 
are formulated. It is giving corporations 
the opportunity to focus squarely on their 
core competencies and take advantage 
of new, decentralised sourcing and 
manufacturing opportunities that are 
driving down their costs.

However, there is a price to pay – the price 
of additional complexity in the supply 
chain, particularly around the ongoing and 
accelerating shift to multi-tier sourcing. 
This is not the only driver of complexity. 
Consumers, too, are becoming more 
demanding and selective as they seek 
greater variety, more sustainable and 
ethically sourced products, better customer 
service, faster delivery, heightened quality 
and enhanced value. This in turn has 
increased competition, giving rise to 
increasing numbers of products and brand 
choices as well as more trade channels and 
routes to market. As a result, the distribution 
chain too is becoming ever-more complex.
This additional complexity in both the 
supply and the distribution chains is 
heightening the risk of failure at any 
number of points, and therefore increasing 
the value for organisations of having 
granular insight into the risks they face.
Our internal data is telling us that the role 
of Assurance is increasing significantly. 
Moreover, the success that we are deriving 
from the move into Assurance is providing 
hard evidence that TQA is what customers 
want and need. 
OUR DIFFERENTIATED 5X5 STRATEGY 
FOR GROWTH
The lead, already two years in the making, is 
delivering a commercial advantage for 
Intertek with our TQA Customer Promise 
lying at the heart of our 5x5 differentiated 
strategy for growth.
Our 5x5 strategy has one overriding 
objective – to move the Intertek centre 
of gravity towards those sectors of our 
addressable market that will in years to 
come deliver both the highest rates of 
growth and the best available margins. 
Achieving this aim will accelerate our 
growth and help us maximise our share 
of that $250 billion ‘iceberg’ in the fastest 
and most efficient way possible.
It is by achieving our five medium-to-long-
term corporate goals that we believe we 
will measure progress and achieve against 
this strategy. 
As we are ultimately a people business 
whose success depends on the 
knowledge, expertise and commitment of 
our workforce, the first two goals are 
about our people and our clients.

It is by successfully fulfilling these first two 
goals that the next two, more financially-
focused, goals will be facilitated:
• To deliver margin-accretive organic 
revenue, based on GDP+ organic growth
• To achieve strong cash conversion from 
our operations
Finally, given our highly cash-generative 
business model and broad-based 
investment opportunities, our fifth goal 
is an important shareholder value-

STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REVIEW
CEO'S REVIEW
continued A CUSTOMER-CENTRIC 
ORGANISATION
Intertek is uniquely positioned to deliver 
ATIC solutions with a truly global network: 
over 1,000 laboratories and offices in 
more than 100 countries across the 
world, providing fast and efficient services 
to customers on a local basis. This is the 
primary focus of our more than 43,000 
employees. In order to ensure we are 
focused on the needs of our clients at 
the point of delivery, we operate a 
decentralised business model. 
The real strength of Intertek is in its 
people, its global team of experts. Indeed, 
it is both humbling and enormously 
exciting to recognise through every 
interaction with them, that our people 
have the most remarkable expertise, 
entrepreneurial capabilities and talent 
for innovation. 
Our people give us the foundations we 
need to support our Customer Promise 
that sits at the heart of our value 
proposition. In short, it is our people who 
consistently set us apart from our 
competition – and they do so by 
demonstrating five powerful 
differentiating attributes:
•  The consistent quality and precision of 
their findings, conclusions and reports
• Their speed of response, delivering the 
rapid, detailed and accurate feedback 
that clients demand
• The ability to manage properly 
customer-centric relationships (summed 
up best by one employee who recently 
said to me “the customer is the centre 
of our universe”)
•  Deep expertise in their subject areas 
and incisive understanding of customer 
requirements
• A proven track record of innovating 
and anticipating the changing needs 
of our clients. 
It’s in such ways that we aim always to 
live up to the standards set by our 
founding forefathers. These most 
famously include Thomas Edison, the 
giant of innovation who is not only 
credited with inventing the first practical 
incandescent lightbulb, the phonograph 
and the movie camera, but who also 
created the forerunner of today's 
Electrical Testing Laboratories that 
continue to provide Assurance to 
consumers through product performance 
and safety testing. Indeed, when 
manufacturers apply Intertek’s ETL Listed 
Mark to their products, the letters “ETL ” 
carry with them a long history of 
innovation, influence, and independence.
A PIONEERING CULTURE
That spirit of innovation continues today 
as Intertek people continue to drive the 
global development of the Quality 
Assurance industry. And it’s not just about 
the innovative capabilities of our people 
already within the organisation. While our 
primary focus is on organic growth, we are 
constantly seeking the right acquisition 
targets that genuinely complement and 
add to our existing expertise.
During 2016, for example, we made 
several strategically important acquisitions 
and investments. These included ABC 
Analitic, market leader in the provision of 
environmental water testing and analytical 
services in Mexico, and EWA-Canada, a 
world-leading cyber security business 
providing security assurance services for 
products, equipment and networks across 
multiple industries.
In April 2017 , we expanded our global 
profile in automotive testing with the 
acquisition of KJ Tech, a leading provider of 
vehicle, component, lubrication and fuel 
testing services based in Germany. 
And in December 2017 , with increasing 
demand for security Assurance services 
resulting from the rapid growth in 
connected devices (Internet of Things or 
'IoT'), the increase in data security 
breaches, and an increasingly diverse 
range of global certification standards and 
security requirements, we further 
strengthened our global footprint in cyber 
security Certification and Assurance with 
the acquisition of Acumen Security, 
headquartered in Maryland, USA. 
These acquired businesses are 
established, recognised and highly 
regarded, and will continue to operate 
under their own brands within the Intertek 
family, while bringing us access to 
additional areas of expertise that we can 
take to new countries and customers. 
OUR DEPTH AND BREADTH OF 
TQA EXPERTISE
Customers understand the depth of 
expertise that our people have; our 
opportunity is to leverage the breadth of 
what we have to offer. Again, it is 
humbling to appreciate the sheer scope of 
our people’s expertise in a range of areas 
that covers just about the full range of 
business activities undertaken anywhere 
on the planet. 
The best way of explaining that breadth is 
to describe in some detail how our services 
can be applied to the sourcing, production 
and distribution of a simple product – such 
as a T -shirt, for example.

In such an organisation, it is

 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 17
STRATEGIC REPORT We offer our clients the 
ATIC Advantage, our global 
TIC expertise combined with 
our Assurance Difference.
INTERTEK TIC EXPERTISE
This starts well before manufacturing 
actually begins, with testing of the physical 
and chemical safety of the materials 
involved. For example, we can test against 
the GOTS (Global Organic T extile Standard) 
on organic cotton. The further T esting, 
Inspection and Certification processes that 
we can apply include:
  H ig h - V o lu m e I ns t r u m e n t 
Testing: here, we test factors 
including the air-permeability, 
length, strength and colour of the 
cotton fibres prior to shipment
 Raw Materials & Pre-Production 
Inspection: we help to eliminate 
any manufacturing variances at later 
stages in the process by inspecting 
the quality and quantity of raw 
materials before production begins
 Product Testing for Physical and 
Chemical Safety: at this stage, we 
test for a range of the product’s 
physical and chemical safety 
attributes, including factors such as 
flammability and the presence of any 
sharp edges in the finished garment
 Final Random Inspection: we 
carry out a detailed inspection of 
finished goods before they proceed 
to shipment
 Certificate of Conformity: this is 
the point at which we certify that 
goods comply with the importing 
country’s specific health, safety and 
environmental standards
 Retail Store Building Testing: we 
provide a wide range of Building and 
Construction services
 Commercial and Functional 
Claims: we carry out tests on final 
products to ensure that they 
achieve the standards claimed in 
promotional materials; these can 
include factors like ‘quick-dry’, 
colour-fastness, thermal resistance 
and waterproofing.
T esting, Inspection and Certification is 
required to control quality and safety at the 
high-risk, regulated points of the supply 
chain and the urgent desire of our people to 
develop new solutions throughout is a key 
differentiator for Intertek: it is in our culture 
that we should, whenever necessary or 
desirable, develop effective and original 
solutions to emerging issues.
OUR ASSURANCE DIFFERENCE
The Intertek difference comes when we 
complement the physical T esting, Inspection 
and Certification at the critical points with 
end-to-end, truly systemic Assurance 
processes. We achieve this through expert, 
in-depth audits and assessments of all the 
systems and operating processes that are 
involved. These take place in enormous 
numbers – during 2017 , our 3,000 
professional auditors carried out more than 
100,000 audits across the world, 
positioning us as significantly the number 
one compliance auditor globally.
Not only is our growing ability to provide 
fully bespoke Assurance solutions an 
important competitive advantage – it is also 
highly attractive from an earnings-model 
position, as it is capital-light and delivers 
margins that are greater than the average 
across our Group. 
Once again, this approach extends far 
beyond our customers' own premises. 
Staying with the T -shirt example, we carry 
out onsite audits and training to ensure the 
correct usage and treatment of chemicals 
throughout the entire length of the supply 
chain. Other Assurance services include:
 D a m ag e S u r v e y i ng : we can 
inspect cotton for any damage that 
might have been sustained during 
transit
 Mill Qualification Programme: 
under this key service, we can 
evaluate a manufacturing supplier’s 
quality, environmental and social 
performance, and certify the mill’s 
own in-house lab. This is a 
particularly important aspect of 
the quality assurance process, as 
it provides peace of mind that 
suppliers are abiding by international 
standards and legislation on 
modern-day slavery and child labour
 E n v ir o n m e nt a l Ch e mi c a l 
Management Solutions: we 
ensure proper chemical management 
by undertaking thorough testing of 
wastewater and sludge as well as 
onsite auditing and training
 Ethical Supply Chain 
Assessments: we can certify 
garment factories against a wide 
range of international standards, 
including Worldwide Responsible 
Accredited Production (WRAP), 
SA8000 (a leading social 
accountability certification 
standard) and our own widely 
recognised Workplace Conditions 
Assessment (WCA) standard
 S u p p l ie r Q u al i fi c at io n 
Programme: this is a wide-ranging 
programme that supports a 
coherent and truly world-class 
standard enabling corporations to 
drive continuous improvement in 
their benchmarking. This covers 
areas ranging from product and 
process quality to site 
management and training
 Custom and Trade Partnership 
against Terrorism: we help 
importing businesses set up policies 
that improve not only their own 
security practices but those of their 
supply chain partners too
 C o u n t e r fe i t i ng A s s u r a n c e : 
integrating our Intellectual Property 
(IP) expertise into our family of 
Assurance services enables us to 
determine whether partners in the 
supply chain pose a risk of 
counterfeiting our customers' 
products
 B e n c hm ar ki n g : by comparing the 
features and quality of our customers' 
products to industry norms, we can 
enable informed decision-making on 
factors such as performance claims, 
design and pricing
 Cyber Security Assurance: our 
cutting edge cyber security 
solutions, strengthened by our 
acquisition of EWA-Canada, provide 
protection against ransomware, 
increasingly sophisticated phishing 
scams, distributed denial-of-service 
attacks and more
 L i f e c y c l e A ss e ss me n t s : we use 
cloud-based technology to deliver a 
sustainability Assurance solution that 
enables customers to compute the 
carbon footprint of their products, 
processes and business operations.

 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 18
STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REVIEW
THE T-SHIRT JOURNEY AN INDUSTRY-AGNOSTIC TQA 
APPROACH
Here, we have only looked at one specific 
area of the global apparel industry. But 
while our service portfolio includes services 
that are specific to individual industries and 
sectors, Intertek’s reach is industry-
agnostic. We apply our TQA approach to all 
of the industries with which we work.
We can demonstrate this by taking 
another example – a highly appropriate 
one given our historical connections to 
Thomas Edison. This time, we look at how 
we provide a TQA solution in support of 
the global manufacturing and distribution 
of a LED lightbulb, as shown on page 12. 
Once again, our TIC services are wide-
ranging; they embrace physical testing and 
chemical analysis at the copper mine, 
T esting and Inspection during 
manufacturing, packaging Certification for 
the distributor, battery T esting at the 
hauliers, and market surveillance Inspection 
and claims T esting for the retailer.
But this is only half the story. A product 
with a global market is naturally subject to 
a wide range of complex risks, which is 
why we complement these TIC services 
with our global market Assurance service. 
This is part of our comprehensive 
Assurance portfolio that helps our 
customers identify and mitigate the risks 
that are intrinsic to their operations, 
supply chain and distributed quality 
management operations.
So, at the mine, physical testing and 
chemical analysis can be underpinned by a 
Damage Survey, for example. In production, 
energy efficiency T esting and global safety 
Certification might be complemented with 
global market and packaging evaluation 
Assurance services. And even at the retail 
end, a market surveillance initiative 
inspecting product quality might coincide 
with Assurance services like benchmarking 
and returns analysis.
The emerging picture is complex enough 
when we consider relatively simple 
products like a T-shirt or LED lightbulb. But 
we are every bit as capable of delivering 
an end-to-end, integrated TQA service in 
greatly more complex industries, including 
automotive manufacturing. 
To take a live example, we provide one 
manufacturer with a wide range of TIC 
services at every stage of the value chain, 
from R&D and raw materials, through 
manufacturing and production processes 
to import and export, the dealership 
network, customer experience 
considerations and into the aftermarket.
Once again, we support the manufacturer 
at all the same stages with a bespoke 
range of Assurance services, from 
regulatory compliance assessments and 
design validation planning at the R&D 
stage, through Greenhouse Gas Validation 
and Verification Failure Analysis during 
manufacturing and ultimately to Field 
Performance Data Collection Analysis. We 
clearly demonstrate our flexibility when it 
comes to factors like emissions and fuel 
consumption – for this sort of Assurance 
work does not take place in the 
laboratory, but out on the road in 
ordinary driving conditions.
Our industry-agnostic TQA approach 
provides our clients with global TIC 
expertise and an Assurance Difference: 
the ATIC Advantage delivered by Intertek 
TQA Experts.
OUR GLOBAL TQA EXPERTS
The key to our continuing sales growth is 
our responsive culture, decentralised 
organisation and global network of 
state-of-the-art laboratories – and above all 
the depth and breadth of our people’s 
expertise: global TQA subject-matter 
experts, who know how to innovate and 
solve challenges that nobody has previously 
been able to overcome.
These are some of the Intertek strengths 
that enable us to live and fulfil our Core 
Purpose of 'Bringing Quality and Safety to 
Life'. But they would not be so effective 
without a clearly defined organisational 
structure based around an operating 
model that always puts the customer 
first. We maximise the potential returns 
accrued from this infrastructure through 
multiple further factors, including:
• A disciplined and systemic approach to 
financial performance management
• Our highly cash-generative earnings 
model
• Our capital-light business model, which 
enables us to respond and adapt rapidly 
to the changing needs of our customers 
and markets
• Our disciplined approach to capital 
allocation, which enables us to support 
organic growth through creating new 
services, developing client relationships 
in high-margin areas and investing in the 
most attractive growth opportunities.
LOOKING AHEAD
We believe that the strength of our 2017 
results demonstrates the attractive 
nature of our industry, Intertek's high-
quality earnings model and the 
effectiveness of our 5x5 differentiated 
strategy for growth. We are confident 
about the structural growth prospects in 
the global Quality Assurance market.
We are uniquely positioned to seize these 
attractive growth opportunities, 
underpinned by the increased 
complexities of corporate supply and 
distribution chains and the associated 
challenges of maintaining a high level of 
quality assurance end-to-end.
Leveraging our industry-leading expertise 
and innovative and entrepreneurial culture, 
we service a diversity of industries, 
geographies and customers, with our 
global network enabling us to follow the 
supply chains of our customers wherever 
they are in the world.
We have a strong track record of creating 
sustainable growth and shareholder value, 
leveraging our high-margin and highly 
cash-generative earnings model.
We are moving the Company's centre of 
gravity towards our industry's most 
attractive growth and margin areas with 
a disciplined approach to performance 
management and capital allocation.
We are on track on our 'good to great' 
journey, making progress on both 
performance and strategy.
I am certain that the passion and expertise 
of our people will continue to be the primary 
differentiator that makes Intertek a true 
pioneer in the global Quality Assurance 
market. In short, I am very excited about 
what the future holds for Intertek, its 
employees, shareholders and customers. 
Above all our TQA Customer Promise of 
Total Quality. Assured is providing our 
clients with the peace of mind they need 
to grow their business.

WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE IN THE 
PROJECT?
I was the technical lead, setting the programme 
layout and managing the integrated, risk-based 
approach we took to project delivery.
WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND? 
The Nespresso Company is the world-leader 
in coffee pods, machines and accessories. As 
such, it takes its environmental responsibilities 
very seriously, and wants to ensure that the 
recycling paths for their capsules are 
sustainable and effective. 
So it has created a global programme, which 
not only enables materials to be recycled but 
also allows waste coffee to be used in 
producing biomass energy. But this mammoth 
operation, involving more than 100,000 
international drop-off points, uses several 
different ‘pathways’ in numerous countries 
across the world.
When Nespresso asked Intertek to develop 
an assurance process across the entire value 
chain, the intent was to improve the system by 
challenging its implementation, enabling them 
to iron out any inconsistencies and ultimately 
ensure that performance can be verified with 
a reasonable level of assurance.
WHAT DID INTERTEK DELIVER?
Intertek developed and assisted with the 
roll-out of the integrated programme, ranging 
from brainstorming sessions and workshops 
through determining the most effective means 
of combining different processes for the best 
possible outcomes. 
This involved creating new risk-assessment 
tools and flexible bespoke solutions that give 
Nespresso a rigorous approach to assess and 
improve its recycling processes, flexible 
enough to be used in all countries.
This is now not only delivering the assurance 
that the system is working to its current 
maximum capability – it is also enabling 
continuous improvement for the years ahead.

Research Associate,

Germany
WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE IN THE 
PROJECT?
I was dedicated to this project for a year, 
planning and organising it as well as carrying 
out the practical work. This allowed me to be 
laser-focused on delivering the project.
WHAT WAS THE BACKGROUND? 
In the world of food processing, it is vital that 
manufacturers can prove the authenticity of 
their products, which means that they contain 
what the label claims. 
This is particularly important for fish fillet: not 
only is it often difficult to identify a species 
following the removal of skin and fins, but the 
wide disparity in value of different species also 
creates the risk of ‘food fraud’. This could 
involve the substitution of a low-value species, 
such as catfish, for an expensive species such 
as sole.
At present, DNA-based methods are the only 
reliable and widely used means of testing. They 
can be costly and time consuming but it all 
depends, however, on the species tested. 
WHAT DID INTERTEK DELIVER?
That has now all changed, following Intertek’s 
innovative application of ‘MALDI-TOF’ mass 
spectrometry technology – previously used 
only in the microbial area – to identify fish 
species by their protein pattern.
It’s an approach that has several key 
advantages over the DNA approach. First, it is 
quick – the laboratory time involved is typically 
around 90 minutes. Using our own developed 
database of fish species also ensures it is 
highly accurate. And low manpower and 
maintenance requirements make it cost-
effective too.
As a result, we can now give customers the 
assurance that they are selling the right fish to 
customers, and that their labelling is correct. 
The same for importers buying fish with 
complex supply chains.

Assurance Testing Inspection
WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE IN THE 
PROJECT?
I launched and ran the project because, as 
a physicist, I was intrigued as to why tonnage 
assessments of stockpiled materials from 
coal and rice to fertilisers and copper 
concentrates were so poor. 
WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND? 
Businesses that own stockpiles of materials 
have historically faced significant difficulty in 
gaining accurate assessments of their weight 
– and therefore their value. Typical margins of 
error ranged between +/- 5-7%. 
When very large qualities of a high-value 
material are involved, this can bring about 
miscalculations worth millions of dollars. The 
issue therefore has long been the cause of a 
profound lack of confidence, not just for 
companies that cannot accurately value their 
own stock-holdings, but also for financial 
institutions and potential M&A partners who 
demand trustworthy valuation data.
WHAT DID INTERTEK DELIVER?
Now, Intertek has developed a new method 
of measurement based on combining the 
volumetric profile (width, height and shape) 
of a stockpile with the compaction force at 
play. This means the density (and therefore 
weight) of a layer of materials depends on 
how far down the stockpile it is.
Over the last three years, the new 
methodology has been proven in Australia’s 
chemical, agriculture and energy sectors, 
delivering a quantum leap in accuracy 
performance of up to 0.01 -1%. 
As a result of this work, organisations in 
sectors ranging from mining and power 
generation to fertilisers and even 
government can benefit from independent, 
scientifically proven expertise in asset 
evaluations and management.
In addition, this revolutionised accuracy 
means that the number of occasions on 
which measurement is required may decrease, 
potentially enabling customers to buy a 
premium product at a lower overall cost.

2017 PERFORMANCE
Our Resources-related businesses 
faced, as expected, challenging trading 
conditions and reported an organic 
revenue reduction of 8.6% at constant 
currency. We delivered operating profit of 
£28.5m with our disciplined approach to 
cost control, which enabled us to expand 
our margins by 10bps at constant 
currency:
• Driven by a lower volume of 
investments in exploration activities 
from our clients and price pressure in 
the industry, revenue from Capex 
Inspection Services was lower than 
last year.
• The demand for Opex Maintenance 
Services remained stable in a 
competitive pricing environment.
• We saw an improved level of demand 
for testing activities in the Minerals 
business.
2018 OUTLOOK
While we have seen a reduction in the 
negative growth rate in the July to 
December period of 2017 , we do not 
believe that we have reached the trough 
in the Resources division, and we expect 
trading conditions to remain challenging in 
the first half of 2018 with a gradual 
improvement expected in the second half.
MID- TO LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
Our Resources division will grow in the 
medium to long term as we benefit from 
investments in the exploration and 
production of Oil and Minerals to meet the 
demand of the growing population around 
the world.
WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE IN THE 
PROJECT?
I led the project, heading up software and 
algorithm design and implementation.
WHAT DID INTERTEK PROVIDE? 
With deregulation in electricity markets, 
power generators have been challenged by 
the need to become ‘leaner and meaner’ in 
order to compete and provide favourable 
returns to their investors. 
While operators understand fuel costs and 
efficiency, one area where the understanding 
of the underlying nature of costs is particularly 
weak is power plant operation and maintenance 
(O&M), which includes a wide variety of 
activities such as equipment monitoring, 
replacement, and upgrading.
Moreover, with increased renewable 
generation, traditional power plants across 
the world have been forced to change their 
operations, resulting in increased O&M costs. 
Power plants across the world have struggled 
to determine the effects of this change in 
operating regime on the equipment and, more 
importantly, the change in operating cost to 
set their price and margin. Historically, 
however, they’ve had little insight into their 
costs in real time. In addition, any cost analysis 
was immediately out of date as it only ever 
addressed a specific moment.
WHAT DID INTERTEK DO?
Now, thanks to a specialist new Intertek 
solution called Costcom, all that has 
changed. Today, growing numbers of plants 
across the world are implementing this 
ground-breaking algorithm, which uses 
machine learning to analyse data streaming 
from hundreds of sensors. 
These plants are not only getting an 
immediate and accurate view of costs – they 
can also use Costcom to immediately identify 
any activities that are less than optimal.
The implications for the global power 
industry are significant. Not only can plants 
cut their costs, they can also improve their 
competitiveness with sharper pricing based 
on better insight.
And that’s a valuable benefit for power 
generators everywhere.

STRATEGIC REPORT RISK FRAMEWORK
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and 
oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. This work 
is complemented by the Group Risk Committee, whose purpose is 
to manage, assess and promote the continuous improvement of 
the Group’s risk management, controls and assurance systems. 
This risk governance framework is described in more detail in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 75 to 80.
The Head of Internal Audit and the Group General Counsel, who 
report to the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer 
respectively, have accountability for reporting the key risks that 
the Group faces, the controls and assurance processes in place 
and any mitigating actions or controls. Both roles report to the 
Audit Committee, attend its meetings and meet with individual 
members each year as required.
Risks are formally identified and recorded in a risk register for 
the significant countries and for each business line and support 
function. The risk register is updated at least twice each year 
and is used to plan the Group’s internal audit and risk strategy.
In addition to the risk register, all senior executives and their 
direct reports are required to complete an annual return to 
confirm that management controls have been effectively applied 
during the year. The return covers Sales, Operations, IT, Finance 
and People.
This section sets out a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s strategy, 
performance, results, financial 
condition and reputation.

Reputation Reputation is key to the Group maintaining and growing 
its business. Reputation risk can occur in a number of 
ways: directly as the result of the actions of the Group 
or a group company itself; indirectly due to the actions 
of an employee or employees; or through the actions of 
other parties, such as joint venture partners, suppliers, 
customers or other industry participants.
• Failure to meet financial performance expectations.
• Exposure to material legal claims, associated costs and 
wasted management time.
• Destruction of shareholder value.
• Loss of existing or new business.
• Loss of key staff.
• Quality Management Systems; adherence to these is regularly audited 
and reviewed by external parties, including accreditation bodies.

• Whistle-blowing programme, monitored by the Audit Committee, where staff 
are encouraged to report, without risk, any fraudulent or other activity likely 
to adversely affect the reputation of the Group.
• Relationship management and communication with external stakeholders.
• This risk remains stable compared with 2016.
• The Group continues to invest in staff development, 
quality systems and standard processes to prevent 
operational failures.
Customer Service A failure to focus on customer needs, to provide 
customer innovation or to deliver our services in 
accordance with our customers’ expectations and our 
customer promise.
• May lead to customer dissatisfaction and  
customer loss.
• Gradual erosion of market share and reputation  
if competitors are perceived to have better, more 
responsive or more consistent service offerings.
• Net Promoter Score (‘NPS’) customer satisfaction, customer sales trends and 
turnaround time tracking.
• Global and Local Key Account Management (‘GKAM’/’LKAM’) initiatives 
in place.
• Customer feedback meetings.
• Customer claims/complaints reporting.
• This risk remains stable compared with 2016.
People Retention The Group operates in specialised sectors and 
needs to attract and retain employees with 
relevant experience and knowledge in order 
to take advantage of all growth opportunities.
• Poor management succession.
• Lack of continuity.
• Failure to optimise growth. 
• Impact on quality, reputation and customer confidence.

 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 32
STRATEGIC REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES PRINCIPAL RISKS 
The Group is affected by a number of risk factors, some of which, 
including macroeconomic and industry-specific cyclical risks, are 
outside the Group’s control. Some risks are particular to Intertek’s 
operations. The principal risks of which the Group is aware are 
detailed on the following pages including a commentary on how 
the Group mitigates these risks. These risks and uncertainties do 
not appear in any particular order of potential materiality or 
probability of occurrence.
There may be other risks that are currently unknown or regarded 
as immaterial which could turn out to be material. Any of these 
risks could have the potential to impact the performance of the 
Group, its assets, liquidity, capital resources and its reputation.
LONG-TERM VIABILITY STATEMENT 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a five-year period to 31 December 2022, by 
carrying out a robust assessment of the potential impact of the 
principal risks and uncertainties on the Group’s current position, 
including those that would threaten the Group's business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. This is documented on 
the following pages.
The Directors have determined that a five-year period is an 
appropriate period over which to provide the viability statement of 
the Group, as the Group’s strategic review covers a five-year period. 
Furthermore, the Directors believe the five-year period 
appropriately reflects the average business cycles of the 
business lines in which the Group operates, particularly in 
relation to capital expenditure investment horizons.
In addition to the bottom-up strategic review process where 
the prospects of each business line are reviewed, an assessment 
has been made of the potential operational and financial impacts 
on the Group of the principal risks and uncertainties outlined in 
the following pages. The Directors have also assessed certain 
combinations of these principal risks and uncertainties in a 
number of severe, but plausible, scenarios, as well as the 
effectiveness of any mitigating actions.
The Group has a broad customer base across its multiple 
business lines and in its different geographic regions, and is 
supported by a robust Balance Sheet and strong operational 
cash flows. The Board considers that the diverse nature of 
business lines and geographies in which the Group operates 
significantly mitigates the impact that any of these scenarios 
might have on the Group’s viability.
Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period to 31 December 2022.

 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 37
STRATEGIC REPORT Edward Leigh
Chief Financial Officer
This year we delivered double-digit growth in 
operating profit and diluted EPS at constant 
currency. Cash conversion was strong as the 
focus on working capital initiatives 
continued to deliver, resulting in good 
progress in ROIC in the year.”
Solid organic revenue growth and 
a focus on cost and operational 
initiatives delivered strong margin 
accretion for the Group.
CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT COMMENTARY 
Revenue for the year was £2,769.1m, up 7 .9% (up 3.0% at 
constant exchange rates), with organic revenue growth of 2.1% 
at constant exchange rates.
The Group’s organic revenue reflected robust growth in the 
Products division and good growth in the Trade division, while 
challenging conditions in the oil and gas infrastructure market 
impacted the Resources division.
The Group’s adjusted operating profit was £467 .7m, up 14.2% 
on the prior year (up 10.0% at constant exchange rates).
The adjusted operating margin was 16.9%, an increase of 110bps 
from the prior year at constant exchange rates. Adjusted organic 
operating margin at constant rates increased by 90bps as we 
benefited from positive operating leverage, margin-accretive 
divisional mix and the restructuring activities in prior years.
The recent storms in the southern regions of the USA disrupted 
the operations of our clients in the last 10 days of August, in 
September and October, impacting our Cargo/AA, Building & 
Construction and Industry Services businesses, and continued 
to impact our Cargo/AA business in November and December.
These operational disruptions reduced our revenue performance 
by £6.5m at constant currency over the period from August to 
December, negatively impacting our Products, Trade and 
Resources divisions by £1.5m, £4.3m and £0.7m respectively.
The Group remains very focused on cost and margin 
management. In line with the review linked to the 5x5 strategy 
announced in March 2016, an impairment of £8.0m has been 
charged following a full assessment of the Group’s IT assets, an 
impairment of £8.8m has been charged in respect of plant and 
equipment related to a specific service line and the Group has 
recognised a further £12.4m restructuring cost.
The Group’s statutory operating profit for the year was £422.7m 
(2016: £369.5m), with statutory operating margin of 15.3%, up 
90bps on the prior year.
NET FINANCING COSTS
The Group had an adjusted net financing cost of £28.9m 
(2016: £22.4m) in the year. This comprised £1.2m (2016: £0.9m) 
of finance income and £30.1m (2016: £23.3m) of finance 
expense. The statutory net financing cost of £29.4m included 
£0.5m (2016: £nil) relating to Separately Disclosed Items.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 38
STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW TAX
The Group effective tax rate on adjusted profit before income 
tax was 24.5% (2016: 25.3%) with the reduction being driven by 
a 1% one-off benefit from the net revaluation of deferred tax 
balances following the US Tax reforms. 
The statutory tax charge, including the impact of SDIs, of £86.9m 
(2016: £75.5m), equates to an effective rate of 22.1% (2016: 
21.8%) and the cash tax on adjusted results is 23.0% (2016: 
24.3%). The statutory tax charge, excluding the impact of SDIs, 
is £107 .5m (2016: £98.0m).

STRATEGIC REPORT
EC1031429_08_Financial_review_38-43_AW.indd   39 3/16/18   5:18 PM EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Group delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share (‘EPS’) of 
191.6p (2016: 167 .7p). Diluted EPS after SDIs was 176.3p (2016: 
156.8p), and basic EPS was 178.6p (2016: 158.5p).
DIVIDEND
The Board recommends a full-year dividend of 71.3p per share, 
an increase of 14.3%. This recommendation reflects the Group’s 
earnings progression, strong financial position and the Board’s 
confidence in the Group’s structural growth drivers into the future.
The full-year dividend of 71.3p represents a total cost of 
£115.1m or 37% of adjusted profit attributable to shareholders 
of the Group for 2017 (2016: £100.7m and 37%). The dividend is 
covered 2.7 times by earnings (2016: 2.7 times), based on 
adjusted diluted earnings per share divided by dividend per share.
PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES
In March 2016, the Group announced its 5x5 differentiated 
strategy for growth, with the aim to move the centre of gravity 
of the Company towards high-growth, high-margin areas in its 
industry, which included two strategic priorities relevant to  
the operational structure of the business: 
•  to operate a portfolio that delivers focused growth amongst 
the business lines, countries and services, including a strategic 
review of underperforming business units. 
•  to deliver operational excellence in every operation to drive 
productivity, including re-engineering of unnecessary 
processes and layers.
During the year, the Group has continued to implement certain 
non-recurring action plans identified through the portfolio review 
in specific country and/or business line combinations, consistent 
with the 5x5 strategy, with a resulting charge of £12.4m in the 
year. These activities included the termination of certain 
business lines in some countries; the closure and consolidation of 
business line locations in certain countries; the re-organisation of 
various management structures either in-country or across 
multiple countries in a region; or the fundamental re-organisation 
of global business lines including direct staff, management and 
support function structures.
Restructuring charges are included in the SDI section below, in 
instances where they have been specifically identified as part of 
the Portfolio review, are non-recurring and meet the IAS 37 
criteria, in contrast to restructuring costs for ongoing standard 
cost efficiency and cost-saving opportunities, which are incurred 
within Adjusted Results.
SEPARATELY DISCLOSED ITEMS (‘SDIs')
A number of items are separately disclosed in the financial 
statements as exclusion of these items provides readers with 
a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating 
performance of the Group’s business. Reconciliations of the 
Statutory to Adjusted measures are given below.
When applicable, these SDIs include amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles; impairment of goodwill and other assets; the profit 
or loss on disposals of businesses or other significant fixed 
assets; costs of acquiring and integrating acquisitions; the cost of 
any fundamental restructuring of a business; material claims and 
settlements; significant recycling of amounts from equity to  
the income statement; and unrealised market or fair value gains 
or losses on financial assets or liabilities, including contingent 
consideration.
Adjusted operating profit excludes the amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, as we do not 
believe that the amortisation charge in the Income Statement 
provides useful information about the cash costs of running our 
business as these assets will be supported and maintained by the 
ongoing marketing and promotional expenditure, which is already 
reflected in operating costs. Amortisation of software, however, 
is included in adjusted operating profit as it is similar in nature to 
other capital expenditure. The costs of any restructuring are 
excluded from adjusted operating profit where they represent 
fundamental changes in individual operations around the Group 
as a result of the portfolio activities discussed above, and are not 
expected to recur in those operations. The profit and loss on 
disposals of businesses or other significant assets and the costs 
associated with successful, active or aborted acquisitions are 
excluded from adjusted operating profit in order to provide 
useful information regarding the underlying performance of 
the Group’s operations. 
The SDIs charge for 2017 comprises amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles of £16.0m (2016: £14.0m); acquisition costs relating 
to successful, active or aborted acquisitions of £3.2m (2016: 
£2.8m); restructuring costs (as described above) of £12.4m 
(2016: £21.4m); loss on disposal of subsidiaries and associates 
of £nil (2016: £2.0m); impairment of IT assets related of 
computer software of £8.0m (2016: £nil); impairment of plant 
and equipment related to a specific service line of £8.8m (2016: 
£nil); and a credit for material claims and settlements of £3.4m 
(2016: £nil), where a large claim was settled resulting in a 
significant release of excess provision that has been recorded 
within SDIs due to its size, so as not to distort Adjusted results.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Group uses a variety of key performance indicators  
(‘KPIs’) to monitor the financial performance of the Group  
and operating divisions. The specific metrics and associated 
definitions are disclosed on pages 30 to 31.
Organic revenue at constant currency is presented to show the 
Group's revenue excluding the effects of the change in the scope 
of the consolidation (acquisitions and disposals made since  
1 January 2016) and removing the impact of currency translation 
from the Group's growth figures.

The rate of return on invested capital (‘ROIC’), defined as 
Adjusted Operating Profit less Adjusted Taxes divided by 
Invested Capital, measures the efficiency of Group investments. 
This is a key measure to assess the efficiency of investment 
decisions and is also an important criterion in the decision-making 
process when projects are competing for limited funds.

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENT
One of the key corporate goals of the Group's 5x5 strategy is 
delivering an accretive, disciplined capital-allocation policy. As 
a result the Group invests both organically, and by acquiring or 
investing in complementary businesses to strengthen our 
portfolio in the locations demanded by clients. This approach 
enables the Group to focus on those existing business lines or 
countries with good growth and margin prospects where we 
have market-leading positions or to enter new exciting 
growth areas offering the latest technologies and quality 
assurance services.
Acquisitions and investments
The Group completed two (2016: three) acquisitions in the year 
with cash consideration of £27 .4m (2016: £34.8m), net of cash 
acquired of £2.1m (2016: £0.7m).
In March 2017 , the Group acquired KJ Tech Services GmbH  
('KJ Tech'), a leading provider of vehicle, component and fuel 
testing services based in Germany.
In December 2017 , the Group acquired Acumen Security LLC 
('Acumen'), a leading provider of Security Certification solutions 
for products, headquartered in Maryland, USA.
These acquisitions provide valuable additional service lines and 
new geographic locations for the Group, and will help drive future 
profitable revenue growth.
In 2017 £7 .8m (2016: £2.0m) was spent in relation to 
consideration for prior year acquisitions, namely the settlement 
of the contingent consideration for EWA-Canada Ltd.
Organic investment
The Group also invested £112.9m (2016: £105.5m) organically 
in laboratory expansions, new technologies and equipment and 
other facilities. This investment represented 4.1% of revenue 
(2016: 4.1%).

STRATEGIC REPORT CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT
Cash flow
The Group relies on a combination of debt and internal cash 
resources to fund its investment plans. One of the key metrics  
for measuring the ability of the business to generate cash is cash 
flow from operations. Due to the cash payments associated with 
the SDIs, and to provide a complete picture of the underlying 
performance of the Group, adjusted cash flow from operations

To ensure the Group is not exposed to income statement 
volatility in relation to foreign currency translation on its debt, 
the Group ensures that any foreign currency borrowings are 
matched to the value of its overseas assets in that currency 
(an ‘effective’ hedge).
The Group borrows primarily in US dollars and any currency 
translation exposures on the borrowings are offset by the 
currency translation on the US dollar and US dollar-related 
overseas assets of the Group.

FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS
The Group transacts in over 80 currencies across more than 
100 countries, and revenue and profit are impacted by currency 
fluctuations. However, the diversification of the Group’s revenue 
base provides a partial dilution to this exposure.
At constant exchange rates, revenue grew 3.0% (actual 
exchange rates 7 .9%) and adjusted operating profit grew

 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 43
STRATEGIC REPORT During 2017 we established a set of five group sustainability 
priorities, linked to our 5x5 differentiated strategy for growth:
1 Having a positive impact on our people, our suppliers, 
and the communities in which we operate
2 Supporting our customers with our industry-leading 
Sustainability value proposition
3 Improving our non-financial disclosures to strengthen 
our investment proposition
4 Tracking our progress with the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals
5 Continuous progress in sustainability through 
appropriate organisational focus
Across our business, our people provide Assurance, Testing, 
Inspection and Certification ('ATIC') services that assist our 
customers in mitigating the environmental impacts of their 
products, processes and operations, ensuring their goods are 
ethically and sustainably sourced, improving the health and 
safety of their employees, and advancing their contribution to 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).
Our people are passionate about their work and are proud to be 
involved in activities that generate a positive impact for society 
and the environment. Intertek operates a decentralised and 
customer-centric organisational model that enables our team to 
innovate to improve our sustainability value proposition on a 
continuous basis, and direct resources locally towards the most 
value-enhancing activities, both for the financial performance of 
the operating unit and for the communities and environment in 
which they operate.
Each of our countries and business lines define their own 
sustainability agenda tied to our Group priorities, but specific to 
their local operations. During 2017 , we established a network of 
Sustainability Champions across our major countries and business 
lines to develop global connectivity across our sustainability 
activities. Two networks were created:
• Country network: focused on internal sustainability activities
• Business line network: focused on sustainability services for 
our customers 
The Sustainability Champions meet monthly to discuss progress 
against our group priorities and share best practice. A newly 
formed Sustainability Operating Committee reports to me on 
a monthly basis and provides the Executive Management Team 
with a quarterly update and the Board with an annual update. Our 
objective is to make continuous progress in sustainability through 
appropriate organisational focus.
Sustainability is at the heart of

 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 44
STRATEGIC REPORT SUSTAINABILITY AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY We recognise we have further to go in our non-financial 
disclosures and have made significant progress in 2017 , 
particularly in our environmental data collection and reporting.
As a Total Quality Assurance provider, we are in a strong position 
to align with each of the UN SDGs, both through the internal 
activities we carry out for our people, our communities and the 
environment, as well as through the sustainability services we 
provide to our customers. In this report we are using the UN SDGs 
as a third party, independent framework to track our country and 
business line progress in sustainability, and from 2018 onwards, 
each of our major business lines and countries will provide 
quarterly updates on the progress they are making toward the 
UN SDGs with which they have chosen to align.
I am delighted that so much of what we do for our customers 
is helping them with their own sustainability strategies, whilst 
internally our passionate and dedicated colleagues are improving 
the lives of the communities around them and the environments 
in which we operate.
Ultimately, sustainability is a broad and evolving topic for all our 
stakeholders – I believe we have made great progress during 
2017 and we will continue to make further strides in our 
sustainability journey during 2018.
This report describes Intertek’s sustainability performance in 
2017 and highlights some of the work we are doing to help our 
customers; develop our people; partner with our local 
communities; reduce our own ecological footprint and track 
our progress with the UN SDGs.

STRATEGIC REPORT Intertek's Green Leaf Mark is proof that a product has been 
independently tested and found to conform to multiple existing 
environmental regulations, such as RoHS laws, REACH and Eco 
Design requirements through one mark rather than multiple 
marks. The Green Leaf Mark is used on product packaging, in 
point of purchase displays, product advertising and literature 
to explain a product’s environmental credentials.
Since 2011, Intertek has partnered with a leading Chinese Steel 
manufacturer to measure the environmental footprint of its 
carbon steels used in the automotive and packaging industry, 
and certify the products to the Green Leaf standard. To date, 
30 products from 10 categories have been verified and awarded 
with the Intertek Green Leaf Mark. By receiving these 
certifications, the company is able to effectively demonstrate 
its efforts to reduce the adverse environmental impact of its 
production processes and final products.
Water Footprint Verification Services
Intertek provides Water Footprint Verification Services for its 
customers covering the evaluation, calculation and 
documentation associated with both water consumption and 
quality at customer and supplier sites. In 2017 , we provided this 
service for an appliance manufacturing site in Turkey amongst 
others. Working with our local offices, Intertek was able to 
support a verification of the organisations water footprint, 
which included six manufacturing facilities, offices and 
ancillary buildings.
As part of the Water Footprint assessment, companies commit to 
reduce consumption in measurable metrics to minimise stress on 
fresh-water sources for industrial processes. Water-stress 
impacts communities globally, where industrial uses of water can 
divert resources and affect safe potable drinking water 
availability. Intertek’s Water Footprint Verification Services 
ensure that companies are following acceptable standards for 
evaluating their water sustainability so that substantiated 
improvements can be made over time.
In a world where companies are facing an 
increasing number of challenges driven by growing 
complexities in their operations, the demand is 
growing for T otal Quality Assurance solutions that 
extend beyond the quality and safety of physical 
components, to those that deliver sustainable 
solutions in the development of products and 
services for the future.
As a Total Quality Assurance provider, we are in a strong position 
given our global scale and expertise to support the sustainability 
objectives of our customers with our Sustainability value 
proposition. Our Assurance, Testing, Inspection and Certification 
(ATIC) services cover many industries, from textiles, toys and 
electronics, to building, heating, pharmaceuticals, petroleum 
products, food, cargo inspection, exploration and production, and 
minerals. We work globally with our customers to improve social, 
ethical, safety and environmental impacts of their services and 
products that are used by their customers every day.
Our proven supply chain expertise, global network and on the 
ground local knowledge help our customers with increased 
transparency to manage social, ethical and environmental risk in 
their processes and supply chains, whilst supporting their ability 
to operate effectively and act responsibly. Our customers trust 
us to ensure the quality and safety of their products, assets 
and processes, to protect their brands and to help them gain 
competitive advantage, whilst ensuring they achieve this in an 
environmentally responsible manner.
Full details of our Sustainability value proposition are listed on 
our Group website at www.intertek.com/sustainability/services. 
In this section of the report we have provided some interesting 
examples of the work we carry out for our customers.
SUSTAINABILITY ATIC SERVICES
Green Leaf Mark
Environmental product claims are coming  
under scrutiny by regulators and are a growing 
source of distrust by consumers. Recent studies 
show that consumers continue to support 
companies and brands that demonstrate social 
and environmental responsibility and are 
increasingly looking for certification marks or 
labels on products to validate environmental credentials. What's 
more, manufacturers and retail brands are under greater pressure 
to ensure products meet standards and have accurate test and 
analysis data to back up their claims.

 OUR SUSTAINABILITY VALUE PROPOSITION Regulatory approvals for innovative biocides and 
pesticides
Intertek provides clients with regulatory approvals for innovative 
biocides and pesticides gaining access to global markets and 
multiple sectors. Introduction of new biocide and pesticide 
products can replace older and deleterious alternatives, make 
equipment more efficient and prevent the spread of harmful 
bacteria and contamination.
Intertek supports the approval of innovative biocide uses in 
healthcare and food processing industries to prevent outbreak of 
harmful bacteria, while replacing existing products that may have 
harmful environmental impacts.
In 2017 , Intertek assisted transportation clients by developing 
approvals for the use of biocides in exterior paints on ships. The 
use of biocides in paint reduces barnacle attachment, whilst 
effectively maintaining aqua-dynamics and reducing overall 
emissions resulting from shipping activities.
Additionally, we also supported the building & construction 
sector by assisting our clients with the development of biocides 
for cooling towers, a major contributor to a building’s overall 
energy consumption. By using biocide products to reduce the 
buildup of organisms and algae, our clients could improve the 
performance of their cooling towers.
Helping to develop an alternative to fish oil
During 2017 , Intertek helped squid oil receive approval as a 
natural health product ingredient in Canada, offering Canadians a 
new sustainably-sourced alternative to fish oil. Squid oil is 
emerging as an alternative sustainably-sourced healthy omega-3 
fatty acid. Much of the squid harvested for human consumption 
does not make it to market, but is discarded as "cut-offs" during 
food preparation; these "left-over" trimmings are predominantly 
rich in the healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Thus, squid oil is 
manufactured solely from by-products obtained during the food 
production of squid.
Additionally, the management and fishing methods for squid have 
minimal environmental impacts compared to methods typically 
used for other fish. The main fishing method employed for 
catching squid is jigging, which involves equipping fishing boats 
with bright lights at night to attract large schools of squid to the 
surface and then deploying a vast number of un-baited hooks 
just below the surface. As a result, there is virtually zero by-
catch, as the fishing method is highly selective, specifically 
targeting same size specimens, with no impact on the ocean 
floor or coral reefs.
Intertek assists clients in navigating complicated regulatory 
approvals for their new, innovative and sustainable alternative 
products. With the availability of these products, consumers can 
select brands that reduce their impact to life under water, and 
minimise wasteful production processes.
Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals
In 2017 , Intertek joined the Zero Discharge of Hazardous 
Chemicals (ZDHC) Programme, a major body which is leading the 
textile, leather and footwear industries to advance towards zero 
discharge of hazardous chemicals. As a contributor, Intertek is 
supporting the programme’s vision of achieving the widespread 
implementation of sustainable chemistry and best practices in 
the textile, leather and footwear industries to protect consumers, 
workers and the environment. Intertek delivers comprehensive 
solutions to enable fashion retailers and brands to fulfil their 
ZDHC Programme commitments. The solutions include:
• Waste water and sludge testing and sampling services at 
various key textiles and footwear manufacturing sites;
• Chemical Management System auditing services;
• Training for ZDHC Academy; and
• Manufacturing Restricted Substances Lists management 
and testing.
ZDHC has approved Intertek to provide waste water and sludge 
testing services for its members through the ZDHC Provisional 
Laboratory Acceptance Programme.
In other sections of this report, we have added further 
examples of our Sustainability value proposition, assisting 
our customers in their social, ethical and environmental 
goals.

STRATEGIC REPORT As part of The 10X Way! events and in order to support a highly 
engaged and high performing workforce of expertise, we have 
launched a brand new performance and growth conversation, My 
10X JOURNEY, which replaces our previous appraisal process and 
is truly transformational. This new development plan enables 
quality conversations to clarify expectations, foster continual 
improvement and inspire people to perform beyond their best.
In addition to The 10X Way! we also provide a variety of in-house 
and external learning opportunities to provide our employees 
with the requisite skills and expertise needed to deliver our TQA 
Customer Promise. We operate across a wide range of sectors 
requiring different employee technical training – this education 
and support ranges from apprenticeships and internship 
programmes through to college, degree and professional 
qualifications.
UK Living wage 
In the UK we are committed to becoming a Real Living Wage 
employer in accordance with the recommendations of the Living 
Wage Foundation. We will continue to align our directly-employed 
staff with the Real Living Wage UK, and are also working towards 
aligning third party contractor staff to the recommended 
guidelines. 
INCLUSION, DIVERSITY AND GENDER EQUALITY
To live our values and be a global family that is inclusive and 
values diversity, we apply all employment policies and practices, 
including recruitment, promotion, reward, working conditions, and 
performance management related policies, in a way that is 
informed, fair and objective.
Our inclusion and diversity policy acts to eliminate discrimination 
so that our employees are treated fairly, feel respected and 
included in our workplaces. We are committed to maintaining the 
highest standards of fairness, respect and safety and adhere to 
the principles of the UN Convention on Human Rights and the 
International Labour Organization’s core conventions.
At Intertek we recognise the importance of gender diversity not 
only in management, but across our business. In line with the 
Hampton-Alexander Review, in addition to supporting gender 
diversity on our Board, in June 2017 we contributed our data on 
the gender balance across our senior executive team and their 
direct reports:
Male Female
Board 70.0% 30.0%
Executive Management Team (Exec) 84.6% 15.4%
Direct reports (DR) 82.7% 17.3%
Combined: Exec + DR 82.9% 17.1%
Data submitted as at 30-Jun-17 .
We will continue to promote and endorse fair, consistent and 
thoughtful working practices that are in accordance with 
our values.
Our 43,906 passionate Intertek people work 
globally for our customers on a daily basis, 
contributing to the success of our customers' 
products, services and operations and helping us 
succeed in Our Vision of being “The world’s most 
trusted partner for Quality Assurance.”
To achieve this, our 5x5 strategy energises our people to take 
Intertek to new heights, deliver our customer promise and to live 
our own values. We want to foster a company culture where our 
people are recognised for being inspired to find innovative ways 
to continually develop the services and solutions for our 
customers and be engaged in the activities they perform.
In this section we detail the ways in which we engage and inspire 
our people, ensure they have the frameworks in place for them to 
succeed in a safe working environment and ultimately make them 
proud to work for Intertek.
ENERGISING, INSPIRING AND ENGAGING OUR 
TALENTED PEOPLE
To seize the exciting growth opportunities of our Total Quality 
Assurance value proposition we continually invest in the growth 
of our people. We want to provide our people with skills to grow 
our business, to hire, inspire, engage and retain the best people to 
power our 5x5 strategy. We want our people to grow by learning 
new skills to help them advance their careers and deliver our 
customer promise. Our talent mapping process is critical to the 
future success of our organisation in delivering our strategy and 
fostering our passionate culture and values throughout Intertek.
Training
During 2017 we developed our own in-house employee training 
programme – The 10X Way! This was a unique programme as it 
was designed and delivered internally to over 1,000 Intertek 
leaders globally. Two-day training workshops were held across 
three locations in the Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA and were 
delivered by our expert faculty from our global leadership team. 
The content of the workshops was based on internal feedback 
and developed into engaging and interactive sessions where key 
tools and best practice was shared.
We continue to roll-out the training across our entire organisation 
to ensure everyone has the tools, processes and principles to 
create sustainable growth for all. To supplement the face-to-face 
event, embed learning and consistently deliver the messaging, 
we are also developing eLearning modules, available to all 
43,000+ employees on our Learning Management System, 
The 10X Way!

regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, age, disabilities, and other 
protected characteristics. We reach out to prospective employees 
in a variety of ways, depending on location and role, in compliance 
with local regulations for fair recruitment practices and equal 
opportunities. We post vacancies via our website (www.intertek.
com/careers) and employ different ways of sourcing talented 
people, such as recruitment agencies, social media, printed 
advertisements, employee referrals, professional bodies and 
associations, schools, colleges and universities. To offer people 
career growth and progression within the Group, where possible, 
we fill vacancies from within the company first.
SUPPORTING OUR CLIENTS IN GENDER EQUALITY
Our Sustainability value proposition also supports our clients in 
achieving gender equality in their own operations:
EDGE Certification Standard
The EDGE Certified Standard was developed with the input of 
experts in gender equality from leading academic institutions 
and top multinational companies. The EDGE assessment 
methodology was developed by the EDGE Certified Foundation 
and launched at the World Economic Forum in 2011. EDGE has 
been designed to help companies not only create an optimal 
workplace for women and men, but also to benefit from it. The 
methodology uses a business, rather than theoretical, approach 
that incorporates benchmarking, metrics and accountability into 
the process.
The EDGE Certified Standard ensures that companies certified to 
the standard have a structured and systematic approach to 
measure, track and close the corporate gender gap by looking at 
both quantitative and qualitative indicators, including:
• Equal pay for equivalent work
• Recruitment & promotion
• Leadership development
• Flexible working
• Company culture
Intertek was the first certification body fully approved to certify 
companies against the EDGE Standard.
During 2017 amongst others, our team in Mexico certified the 
Banco de Mexico, the Central Bank of Mexico, to the EDGE 
Standard.
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 49
STRATEGIC REPORT Intertek employees or people acting on Intertek's behalf are 
responsible for applying the Code in their own job role, their part 
of the business and location.
To support their continuing understanding, they are required to 
complete our comprehensive online Code of Ethics training 
course annually. When completing the training, all employees are 
required to sign a certificate confirming their understanding that 
any breaches of the Code will result in disciplinary action that 
may include summary dismissal of the employee concerned. 
Whistle-blowing hotline
To empower the people who work for Intertek to act, we have a 
well-publicised hotline for all employees, contractors and others 
representing Intertek, enabling them to confidentially report 
suspected misconduct or breaches of the Code.
Our whistle-blowing hotline is run by an independent, external 
provider, is multi-language and is accessible to all employees 24 
hours a day either by phone or by email. Those concerned are 
encouraged to report any conduct, compliance, integrity or ethical 
concerns using the hotline. Information posters are present in all 
of our sites.
If a report is made to the hotline, it is followed up by Intertek's 
Compliance officers. All reports received are fully investigated by 
our Group Compliance function, which is independent of our 
operational businesses and reports directly to our Group General 
Counsel. Provided there is no conflict of interest, all reports are 
also notified immediately to our Group Ethics & Compliance 
Committee which consists of our Group CEO, Group CFO, Group 
EVP for HR and Group General Counsel. This ensures effective 
resolution both of individual issues and any systemic or process 
improvements that can be made to address them.
• During 2017 , 202 reports of non-compliance with our Code of 
Ethics were made to our hotline. Of those reports, 36 were 
substantiated and required remedial action. Of those 
substantiated claims: there were no substantiated grievances 
relating to human rights, labour practices or societal impact 
breaches;
• there were no environmental incidents;
• there were no reported violations of the rights of indigenous 
people; and
• there were no cases of discrimination.. 
DOING BUSINESS THE RIGHT WAY
At the heart of everything we do at Intertek is our vision to be 
the world's most trusted partner for Quality Assurance. We can 
only deliver that vision if we maintain the trust and confidence of 
all our stakeholders, including our shareholders, our customers, 
our people and the communities and environment in which we 
operate. Integral to this is our internal risk, control, compliance 
and quality programme which we call "Doing Business the 
Right Way".
At Intertek, Doing Business the Right Way means having the 
highest standards of ethics and integrity in how we conduct 
ourselves every day, everywhere and in every situation. Our 
Doing Business the Right Way programme includes processes, 
tools and training to ensure that:
• our people work in a safe and inclusive environment;
• the services we provide and the contracts we enter into are 
delivered with integrity and our commitment to Total Quality; 
and
• we deliver growth that is sustainable by managing our risks 
and doing the right thing for the longer term.
Key elements of our Doing Business the Right Way programme 
are described below.
Ethics, integrity and professional conduct
Doing Business the Right Way is our commitment to upholding 
the highest standards of integrity and professional ethics. This 
commitment is embedded in the Group's culture by the integrity 
principles set out in our Code of Ethics ('the Code') available at 
www.intertek.com/ investors/governance/code-of-ethics, 
which also covers health and safety, anti-bribery, labour and 
human rights.
We have a culture in which all issues relevant to our professional 
conduct and our Code of Ethics can be raised and discussed 
openly without recrimination. We operate a strict zero tolerance 
policy regarding any substantial breach of our Code of Ethics and 
any behaviour that fails to meet our expected standards of 
integrity.
To support this policy in action, all people working for or on 
behalf of Intertek are required to sign our Code of Ethics upon 
joining the Company or before commencing work on our behalf, in 
order to confirm their acceptance of the high standards expected 
of them in all business dealings. The Code sets clear expectations 
that people working for our business must act at all times with 
integrity and in an open, honest, ethical and socially responsible 
manner.

OUR PEOPLE
continued HEALTH & SAFETY
One of our five key corporate goals is to ensure that our 
colleagues are fully engaged in a safe working environment – 
therefore, managing the health, safety and welfare of our people, 
clients and third parties connected with the business is a top 
priority for us. Intertek is committed to the continuous review 
and improvement of its health and safety performance and works 
towards achieving zero incidents.
As a key element of our commitment to health and safety and 
following its successful implementation during 2016, this year 
we saw increased adoption of our ‘Speak up for Safety’ campaign 
across the whole of Intertek. Additionally we implemented 
further Health & Safety processes enabling all Intertek sites to 
report and track Health & Safety activities with our new Global 
H&S Platform.
In 2017 , we achieved a 14% reduction in lost time incidents, 
a 17% reduction in medical treatment incidents and a total 
recordable incident rate reduction of 13%.
Sadly, one fatality was recorded in Veracruz in Mexico. This 
occurred when a grain silo in the port collapsed and fell onto the 
harbour where our employee was working.

* Rates refer to the number of lost time incidents and medical treatment incidents

We go to great lengths to train all our employees on health and 
safety matters, including emergency response procedures, 
intervention and reporting of accidents, incidents and near 
misses, during on-boarding. Where relevant, all employees and 
contractors are provided with personal protection equipment 
when performing work for the Company.
To ensure that each Intertek location is able to operate safely, 
there is a dedicated fire warden, first-aider and health and safety 
representative at each Intertek location. These representatives 
are empowered to not only investigate incidents and implement 
preventative and corrective actions, but also to disseminate 
safety information through training and continual improvement 
programmes to target specific areas of concern that are 
identified. 
SUPPORTING OUR CLIENTS IN HEALTH AND SAFETY
Our Sustainability value proposition also supports our clients in 
their health and safety management
Certifying to OHSAS 18001
We can provide our customers with the support they need to be 
certified as an organisation with high quality health and safety 
management systems. lntertek provides enterprises with 
occupational health and safety management system certification 
services to UK domestic standard GB/T28001 and international 
standard OHSAS 18001.
In 2018, ISO 45001 is due to be published – this standard is set to 
replace the popular OHSAS 18001 standard with the same 
overall purpose – to improve the occupational health and safety 
performance of an organisation. ISO 45001 will more easily 
integrate with other ISO Management Systems standards 
including ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015.
As globalisation and global trade continue to escalate, 
organisations' stakeholders are expecting organisations to be 
ethical in every aspect of their business, especially in the way 
they treat employees. ISO 45001 will give organisations an 
internationally recognised occupational health and safety 
standard to follow. This standard provides the specification for 
formal systematic analysis and management of risk; management 
of regulatory compliance; promotion of safer work practices and 
evaluation of occupational health and safety performance. This 
systematic approach facilitates a decrease in the number of 
incidents and ultimately less disruption to business.
In 2017 , lntertek certified PepsiCo in China to the OHSAS 18001 
standard amongst other customers. Going forward, lntertek will 
be working with its customers to ensure a smooth transition to 
ISO 45001 from OHSAS 18001, whilst also encouraging more 
organisations to work towards this internationally recognised 
benchmark in health and safety management.

SCHOOL SUPPLY SANTA
School Supply Santa is a community programme in Michigan, US, 
that provides students in need with a backpack filled with school 
related items such as notebooks, markers, pens, and folders to 
ensure they start the school year out on the right foot with 
everything they need to grow and learn.
Being aware of this programme, the Intertek Grand Rapids Health 
& Wellness Committee and Events & Communications 
Committees teamed up to lead the efforts to all employees 
across all divisions. Intertek Grand Rapids became a corporate 
partner of School Supply Santa and received a list of supplies that 
were needed in their local districts. The committee members 
created posters, sent emails, and leveraged operations managers 
to rally employees and communicate the efforts. Following the 
communications, employees donated supplies and filled collection 
boxes at Intertek Grand Rapids. Together, they collected 15 
backpacks and hundreds of other requested supplies.
The recipients of these supplies are part of the free lunch 
programme from 20 different schools covering 8 districts in the 
greater Grand Rapids, Michigan area. Thanks to the combined 
efforts of all donations, more than 100 students were helped 
through the programme this year. 
The role we play in the communities in which 
we operate is vital to the success of our business. 
Fostering good relationships provides benefits 
beyond reputation, but also in recruitment, local 
education, and ultimately engagement, as our 
passionate and dedicated colleagues are proud of 
improving the lives of the people and communities 
around them.
In this section we have selected some examples from across the 
world of Intertek of how we have engaged with our local 
communities during 2017 , through community work, education 
and disaster relief efforts.
CARING COMPANY RECOGNITION
Intertek Hong Kong has been continuously recognised as a Caring 
Company by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service (HKCSS) and 
this year is the 6th consecutive year that we received this 
acclaim. Partnering with Hong Kong Red Cross, Intertek Hong 
Kong has cultivated good corporate social responsibility through 
cross-sectoral activities and exchanges, developing community 
projects that address the needs of the local community. In 2017 , 
Intertek Hong Kong organised and carried out a number of 
community activities including:
• Blood Donation Day which involved more than 80 Intertek 
colleagues donating blood to the Hong Kong Red Cross;
• Mid-Autumn Elderly Visit in October 2017 by our Intertek 
Volunteer Team, during which festival food and supplies were 
provided for elderly people;
• Participated in charity fund-raising at the Hong Kong Red Cross

a corporate social responsibility newsletter covering updates on 
laws, regulations and national standards of China relating to CSR 
auditing on labour, health and safety, environmental protection 
and business practice.
With our Sustainability value proposition and experience in CSR

 OUR COMMUNITIES LITTLE SCIENTISTS PROGRAMME
Intertek Hong Kong held its first community educational 
programme, named “The Little Scientists” for young children and 
their parents in September 2017 .
The objective of the programme was to provide the children with 
a fun and engaging scientific learning experience, including 
experiments that they could carry out with their parents.
Offering this high-quality Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
Mathematics (STEM) education helped stimulate the young 
children’s interest in exploring new fields of knowledge and 
experimental learning.
A total of 30 participants took part, aged 7 to 10, and the 
feedback received was overwhelmingly positive. We will look 
to run this programme again in 2018.
TRANSPORTATION DONATIONS
During 2017 , Intertek’s Transportation Technologies Business 
donated automobile parts to the National Auto Body Council to 
support their Recycled Rides programme. Recycled Rides is a 
unique programme in the US, in which insurers, collision repairers, 
paint suppliers, parts vendors and others collaborate to repair and 
donate vehicles to deserving individuals and service 
organisations in local communities throughout the country. 
Over 1,000 vehicles have been donated through the National 
Auto Body Council’s Recycled Rides programme since its 
inception in 2007 .
In addition, the Transportation Technologies business also 
donated parts to technical schools to support education.
HURRICANE MARIA RELIEF EFFORTS
Hurricane Maria was regarded as the worst natural disaster on 
record in Puerto Rico and Dominica. The tenth most intense 
Atlantic hurricane on record and the most intense tropical cyclone 
worldwide of 2017 .
As the hurricane hit, our employees in our Houston offices, having 
just recently suffered from Hurricane Harvey themselves, wanted 
to assist their fellow colleagues in Puerto Rico.
The team rallied together and made arrangements to secure a 
container for supplies in the Houston area. An email was sent out 
to Houston area employees to donate water and nonperishable 
foods and request for volunteers to help pack the donations. The 
team were able to fill a large trailer and flatbed truck. The 
supplies were packed into the container, where it left via truck to 
Miami. One of our employees volunteered to work from our 
Florida location, to ensure secure passage of the container to 
Puerto Rico. On arrival in Puerto Rico the supplies were 
distributed to our employees.
During 2017 , Intertek USA donated $25,000 to the hurricane 
disaster relief efforts, in addition to employee contributions, as 
well as providing the much-needed support and assistance to 
employees and customers.
EXTENDING A HELPING HAND TO FLOOD VICTIMS IN 
BANGLADESH
Geographically, Bangladesh is in a delta of the three major rivers: 
Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna — commonly known as the 
GBM basin. In the recent past, we have observed major floods in 
Bangladesh during the monsoon seasons of 1987 , 1988, 1998, 
2004, 2007 , and 2016. However, in 2017 , the peak water level 
crossed the highest recorded water levels in Brahmaputra, 
Teesta, Dharala, and Jamuneswari rivers.
The second spell of floods this year has affected nearly 7 .5 million 
people, according to figures by the National Disaster Response 
Coordination Centre (NDRCC). Additionally, 10,583 hectares of 
land have been totally washed away, while another 600,587 
hectares of farmland have been damaged.
To help people affected by the flooding, Intertek Bangladesh 
employees contributed to, and participated in, relief activities to 
help those affected by the devastating floods in Durgapur Union, 
Kalihati Upzila in Tangail District. Volunteer teams from Dhaka 
travelled from almost 150 kilometers away to the flood 
affected areas to distribute food, drinking water, cooking oil, 
candles and other essential items to support around 200 
flood-affected families.
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 53
STRATEGIC REPORT In the Our Sustainability Governance section of this report we 
introduce our newly-formed Sustainability Operating Committee, 
Country and Business Line Champions network and sustainability 
reporting processes. Using our newly-established network, we 
will focus on reducing our material impacts in our major countries 
and over time plan to extend our country network to cover more 
sites and locations globally. At present our country network 
accounts for 82% of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions.
From 2018 onwards, using our enhanced data tracking, GHG 
emissions will form part of our quarterly performance discussions,  
in order to ensure that our environmental footprint is receiving 
the requisite level of attention at the global, country and site 
level, and we will be utilising our Country Sustainability 
Champions network to drive material improvements in our 
major markets.
In line with this improved practice, we are setting our first carbon 
reduction target: To reduce our annual CO
2
 emissions per 
employee by 5% by 2020*.
We plan to achieve this through utilising renewable sources of 
energy; implementing ‘green’ waste management practices; 
efficient water management; minimising business travel and 
operating quality management systems.
In addition, and to support our longer-term objectives, we have 
defined a four-year plan:
• 2017: Establish a robust financial grade reporting system and 
process, implement a 2020 target
• 2018 & 2019: Roll-out best practice guidelines to support and 
promote environmental efficiency and broaden the scope of 
environmental reporting (i.e. additional scope 3 reporting) 
based on the materiality of business activities which are 
relevant to our business, our peers and our key stakeholders
• 2020: Reach our 2020 carbon target and explore 
implementation of a Science Based Target for future 
emissions reductions
Through tracking accurately and setting meaningful objective 
targets, we can ensure that we are minimising our environmental 
footprint whilst also providing our key stakeholders, including 
shareholder and customers, with the data they need to 
understand our performance. In line with this focus, we also 
intend on externally verifying our data in the 2018 reporting year.
*Against the 2017 base year and excluding Process Emissions.
Our environmental mission is to provide a better 
quality of life today and a more environmentally 
responsible world tomorrow, by continually 
improving our business performance to minimise 
the impact our operations have on the 
environment.
OUR APPROACH
Intertek’s primary environmental goal is to work with each of our 
sites globally to reduce their impact on the environment, through 
reducing energy consumption and improving their overall 
sustainability credentials. Intertek plays an important role in 
raising awareness of Climate Change and National Resource 
Constraints in its employees, suppliers and customers. As such, 
our aim is to improve operational and natural resource efficiency 
in a consistent manner across all of our 1,000 sites, and to 
establish a global community of sustainability champions who 
share their site level knowledge and experience for the benefit 
of others.
To support this effort, our environmental and climate change 
policy is implemented through country management to ensure 
compliance with local guidelines and regulations.
To support our environmental goals, and following a thorough 
review of our 2015 and 2016 reporting of Group emissions, it 
was recognised that a more flexible and robust reporting tool 
was required to more accurately carry out site level 
environmental data tracking. In 2017 , Intertek implemented a 
Global Sustainability Environmental Software platform, which is 
optimised specifically to provide Intertek with the financial grade 
reporting, analytics, and auditability to support its site level 
sustainability initiatives and corporate reporting going forward.
Due to the wider scope and depth of reporting in 2017 and the 
increased attention to detail and diligence across all Intertek sites 
globally, our 2017 data is meaningfully different to our previously 
reported 2015 and 2016 figures. The data gathering has become 
more accurate and granular, using less extrapolation, hence 
leading to differences versus the 2015 and 2016 data. Going 
forward, data should be comparable to the 2017 base year.
As a result of this renewed approach, we have already witnessed 
a material uplift in the level of engagement across the business 
regarding Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, with each site now 
being able to access their own, bespoke GHG data dashboard.

STRATEGIC REPORT SUSTAINABILITY AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
 OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR DATA
Our annual GHG reporting cycle runs from 1 October 2016 to 30 
September 2017 .
As a Total Quality Assurance provider, we carry out testing on 
behalf of our clients which involves the direct consumption of 
fuel or the direct release of emissions through refrigerant testing 
procedures (Scope 1 – Process Emissions). The tests we perform 
are required by our clients to help them determine the safety, 
quality and environmental efficiency of their products and as 
such, whilst this increases our overall Group reported emissions, it 
has a positive longer-term impact on the item being tested. For 
example, we perform tests for automotive manufacturers on 
their engines, to help them improve efficiency, performance and 
reduce emissions, however in doing so we will burn fuel both in 
stationary and mobile environments. Similarly, we are one of very 
few companies globally which carry out safety testing on 
refrigerants which are then used in commercial and domestic 
everyday items.
In the table below, we have specifically split out the Scope 1 
“Process Emissions”. Where possible we look to reduce the impact 
of these emissions, for example, in our engine testing lab in the 
UK, our Transportation Technologies business has implemented 
several electricity-producing dynamometers, which generate 
power from the engines being tested, resulting in a reduction in 
their site Scope 2 emissions and operating costs.

For 2017 , Intertek’s electricity consumption was reported to be 
241,991 MWh (5.65 MWh per employee) and gas consumption 
was reported to be 66,432 MWh (1.55 MWh per employee).
The platform used by Intertek complies with the methodologies 
outlined by the GHG Protocol “Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard”, the GHG Protocol “Corporate Value Chain 
(Scope 3) Standard”, ISO 14064-1, and the UK Government’s 
“Environmental Reporting Guidelines: Including Mandatory 
greenhouse gas emissions reporting guidance”.
In compliance with the above standards, the platform uses the 
most up-to-date GHG emission factors available for each country 
and type of activity. The emission factors are sourced from the 
relevant government department in each country. Where local 
emission factors are not available, the platform uses default 
emission factors provided by the International Energy Agency 
(IEA), GHG Protocol, the UK’s Department for Environment, Food 
and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the US Environmental Protection 
Agency (US EPA).
ENVIRONMENTAL ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2017
As we operate a decentralised business model, our teams locally 
look for ways to become more environmentally efficient and 
reduce the impact of operations on the environment. Below are 
some examples of our achievements in 2017 and through 
actively performance managing our GHG emissions in 2018, we 
hope to make further improvements:
• In T urkey, we have implemented a water recycling system’ by 
re-using the heated water from laboratory machinery. By doing 
so we have been able to recover 50% of the waste water, 
thereby reducing our consumption by 4 tonnes of water/per day.
• In India, our team implemented a number of initiatives following 
World Environment Day, including:
–   Elevator usage restrictions during allotted time slots to 
reduce power and energy;
–   Celebrating ‘No Paper Day’ and overall reducing paper 
usage;
–    Encouraging usage of air purifying plants both indoors and 
outdoors; and
–   Tree plantation to improve biodiversity.
• In France, we are trialling a scheme with a recycling company 
whereby they collect waste paper from our sites and in 
exchange we receive vouchers to buy green office supplies.
• In Australia, we have installed skylights in one laboratory which 
has reduced the need entirely for lighting during the day. This 
has delivered both cost savings and GHG emission reductions.
• Globally, we have made a further progress to upgrade 
lightbulbs to more efficient LEDs, with particular improvements 
in conversion in Turkey, France, India, USA and Australia.

STRATEGIC REPORT Zero Waste to Landfill Certification
Intertek provides companies with the Zero Waste to Landfill 
certification, which showcases an organisation's contribution 
towards improving their sustainability initiatives through their 
pledge to minimise the amount of waste that enters landfills from 
their operations.
Zero Waste to Landfill certification provides improved credibility 
and visibility to an organisation’s sustainability efforts. 
Implementing a Zero Waste to Landfill programme will not only 
improve the efficiency in manufacturing processes but can also 
save physical and financial resources through energy 
conservation and reuse of raw materials.
During 2017 , Intertek awarded the Zero Waste to Landfill to 
Mahindra Group, a leader in the tractor and utility vehicles space, 
employing more than 200,000 people across the globe. Mahindra 
was among the first to receive this certification in India which 
truly demonstrates their commitment to improving the 
environmental effects their manufacturing process has on the 
communities in which they operate.
Clean energy
Across the world, our Sustainability value proposition positions us 
well to support our clients in their development of clean energy 
solutions, including solar, wind, biofuel and water power. In 
Mexico, during 2017 , along with our Joint Venture partner, 
Intertek+ABC Analitic have participated extensively in the 
sampling of the initial conditions of sites where wind farms are to 
be placed, in order to advise on the appropriateness of the 
location and impact on the ecosystem. In addition, we have also 
been involved in monitoring and assessing the environmental 
impact of the noise generated by the wind turbines.
SUPPORTING OUR CLIENTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL 
MANAGEMENT
With our Sustainability value proposition, there are multiple ways 
in which we support our clients in their Environmental 
Management goals:
Carbon Footprinting Services
During 2017 Intertek HERS performed a carbon footprint for a 
North American transport and operations services provider. As 
part of the assessment Intertek worked with the client to 
determine year-on-year improvements and how they relate to 
specific changes and upgrades to their operations. Results were 
reported in CO
2
 equivalent emissions and encompassed 
improvements such as fuel and fleet changes, warehouse 
logistics and implementing policies that require efficient 
movement of materials within operations.
Resource efficiency and adoption of cleaner technologies can 
positively impact sustainable growth, demonstrated by 
implementing strategies that increase efficiency in operations 
and the responsible use of fuel and materials. With the 
transportation sector contributing over a quarter of the world’s 
GHG emissions, movement of materials, whether in a factory or 
cross-country is an important part of sustainable consumption 
and economic growth.

STRATEGIC REPORT SUSTAINABILITY AND CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Ecotoxicology
Intertek provides ecotoxicology services for clients, to assess the 
toxicity of a variety of different samples that pose a risk to the 
marine environment, i.e. effluents, crude oils, bulk shipping cargo 
to name a few. The outcomes of each toxicity assessment are 
then used by our clients to ensure environmental protection.
In addition to the testing of samples for toxicity, the 
ecotoxicology division also provides assurance services to assist 
clients with environmental risk assessments. Specialising in 
determining the bioavailability of contaminants, our 
ecotoxicologists provide focused and insightful data analytics 
to assist our clients in their environmental goals.
During 2017 , Intertek’s ecotoxicology team have worked with 
Jacobs for many of the major Oil and Gas companies in the 
Australasian region in relation to the produced water testing for 
the offshore oil and gas platforms.
Pollution Prevention Planning Services
Intertek provides industrial and institutional clients with pollution 
prevention planning services. Some jurisdictions require the 
testing for wastewater discharge from industrial and institutional 
facilities for a range of parameters. The strategy behind pollution 
prevention planning is to address hazardous chemicals that are 
found in freshwater resources and landfills. Before wastewater is 
treated, many solid and larger inorganic materials are removed 
and deposited, untreated, into landfills where previously absorbed 
pollutants can later leach into soil and groundwater. To manage 
unwanted chemicals from reaching freshwater resources and 
landfills, pollution prevention planning, includes testing 
wastewater when it is discharged from the facility and relating 
findings back to chemicals, products and infrastructure used.
In Ontario, Canada Intertek’s pollution prevention planning 
services led to the removal of a subject pollutant from cleaning 
products commonly used in healthcare facilities, among major 
manufacturers. Additionally, Intertek is also working with a global 
supplier of laboratory equipment, to identify pollution prevention  
planning requirements in various countries world-wide so their 
products can meet customer demand and reduce their 
contribution of pollutants discharged to the environment.
Pollution prevention effectively incorporates strategies for 
clean and safe drinking water with controllable activities and 
wastewater discharge. Intertek supports evaluation and planning 
for management of freshwater ecosystems that are essential to 
human health, environmental sustainability and economic 
prosperity.

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
('UN SDGs'), both through the internal activities 
we carry out, for our people, our communities and 
the environment, as well as through the 
sustainability services we provide our customers.
We are therefore using the UN SDGs as a third party, independent 
framework to track our country and business line progress in 
sustainability. From 2018 onwards, each of our major business 
lines and countries will provide quarterly updates on the progress 
they are making toward the UN SDGs that they have chosen to 
align with, providing quantitative and qualitative examples of 
how they have helped to contribute to the goals.
By way of example, during 2017 we ran a case study with our 
Building & Construction (B&C) division, to evaluate B&C’s 
performance in internal and external sustainability initiatives vs. 
the UN SDGs.
By taking this approach, we aim to increase engagement across 
our business by providing Our People with a framework upon 
which they can clearly demonstrate the wider positive 
sustainability contribution that they are making through their 
daily activities.
We will continue to update vs. the UN SDGs going forward, by 
providing annual examples of the progress we are making in 
different business lines.

STRATEGIC REPORT During 2017 we established a set of five 
group sustainability priorities, linked to our 5x5 
differentiated strategy for growth. One of our 
five priorities is to make continuous progress in 
sustainability through appropriate 
organisational focus. 
Our objective is to ensure that we provide the organisation with 
the requisite levels of support and engagement, at the highest 
levels of the organisation, both for our internal sustainability 
activities and for the sustainability services we provide our 
customers.
SUSTAINABILITY OPERATING COMMITTEE
To enhance engagement across our sustainability initiatives, in 
2017 we established a network of Sustainability Champions 
across our major countries and business lines to develop global 
connectivity across our sustainability activities. Two networks 
were created:
• Country network:
–   Seeking opportunities to act sustainably, through energy 
efficiency and cost reductions across energy, water and 
waste usage
–   Engaging with people locally to drive positive behaviours 
throughout the organisation, but also through encouraging 
sustainability engagement with local stakeholders
–   Maintaining best in class internal labour and human rights 
practices, activity monitoring, and liaising with HR 
colleagues regarding social sustainability metrics 
improvements
• Business line network:
–   Taking the lead on engaging the sales organisation within 
the business line to ensure they are aware of all the 
sustainability services that can be offered to customers
–   Working with colleagues globally to help develop our suite 
of sustainability service offerings
–   Help generate new and innovative ways of offering 
sustainability services to our customers
The Sustainability Champions meet monthly to discuss progress 
against our group priorities and share best practice. A newly formed 
Sustainability Operating Committee reports to the Group CEO 
monthly, and provides the Group Executive Management T eam with 
a quarterly update and the Board with an annual update.
Over time we will expand this network to include more countries 
and business lines. Our objective is to enhance engagement 
across our business in sustainability activities, whether this be 
internally, through the work we do for the environment or 
communities in which we operate, or externally through the 
services we provide our customers.
Our people are passionate about their work and are proud to be 
involved in activities which generate a positive impact for society 
and the environment. As each of our countries and business lines 
define their own sustainability agenda, tied to our Group priorities 
but specific to their local operations, the objective of our network 
is to ensure the activities being performed locally are understood 
and we benefit from best practice globally.
RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT
Delivering sustainable returns is a key enabler of our 5x5 
strategy for growth and incorporates Responsible Investment 
('RI'). At Intertek, RI includes the evaluation of Environmental, 
Social & Corporate Governance ('ESG') risks as part of the 
investment process. ESG due diligence forms a key part of our 
acquisition review process as well as when assessing capital 
expenditure decisions on new and innovative ATIC services. We 
ensure that we have identified potential ESG risks, and have in 
place corresponding mitigation plans and remedies. Our 
investment process, in line with our overall Group strategy, 
ensures that we maintain the right balance between 
performance and sustainability. Going forward, acquired 
businesses will be provided access to our Group Environmental 
Data Software and will be required to submit their environmental 
data as part of the ongoing reporting cycle.
STEWARDSHIP AND GOVERNANCE
Sustainability and CSR are integrated into Intertek through 
policy distribution and through our Code of Ethics framework 
at www.intertek.com/investors/governance/code-of-ethics. Our 
operations and support functions are responsible for identifying 
and evaluating risks applicable to their areas of the business and 
the design and operation of suitable internal controls (see 
‘Principal risks and uncertainties’ on pages 32 to 37).

As a global provider of quality solutions, including supply chain 
assurance and modern slavery audits, for its clients, Intertek is 
committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its own 
corporate activities and to ensuring that its own supply chain is 
free from modern slavery. Our 2017 Modern Slavery Statement 
can be found at www.intertek.com/about/corporate-governance. 
The Group analyses its supply chain on an ongoing basis as part 
of its risk, compliance and ethics framework.
We have corporate policies and governance processes to support 
our efforts to address the issues covered by the Modern Slavery 
Act 2015, including: the Code of Ethics (with regular refresher 
training for all employees); a confidential and external hotline on 
which issues can be reported; a labour and human rights policy; 
and clear recruitment policies aimed at fair recruitment and 
treatment of employees. Furthermore, to demonstrate our 
commitment to continued improvements and achieving an 
industry-leading standard in this area, we will work to put in place 
enhanced policies, procedures and due diligence processes for 
suppliers which are aimed more specifically at evaluating the risk 
of, and preventing, modern slavery issues.
SUPPORTING OUR CLIENTS IN SUPPLY CHAIN RISK 
ASSESSMENTS
Our Sustainability value proposition also supports our clients in 
their supply chain risk assessments:
Workplace Conditions Assessment
The Intertek developed Workplace Conditions Assessment (WCA) 
program provides a powerful, cost-effective solution for 
companies and facilities seeking to improve workplace conditions 
efficiently and in accordance with widely accepted industry 
standards and best practices.
Anchored in Intertek’s extensive social compliance expertise, 
WCA has emerged as an industry-leading tool for evaluating, 
benchmarking and continuously improving supplier workplace 
conditions. The program is supported by a web-based platform 
that automates and streamlines the audit process, increasing 
efficiencies for all supply chain partners.
WCA addresses the following and more:
• Labour (Child/Forced Labour, Discrimination, Discipline, 
Harassment/Abuse, Freedom of Association, Labour Contracts)
• Wages and Hours (Wages and Benefits; Working Hours)
• Health and Safety (General Work Facility, Emergency 
Preparedness, Occupational Injury, Machine Safety, Safety 
Hazards, Chemical and Hazardous Material, Dormitory 
and Canteen)
• Management Systems (Documentation and Records, 
Worker Feedback and Participation, Audits and Corrective 
Action Process)
• Environment (Legal Compliance, Environmental Management 
Systems, Waste and Air Emissions)
During 2017 , we carried out our WCA programme for Siemens 
suppliers globally in a number of countries including China, India, 
Germany, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, USA, Brazil and more.
Mill Qualification programme
In the competitive apparel sector, retailers and brands are 
increasingly concerned about the quality of the textiles that 
mills supply. They know it is fundamental to overall garment 
quality. Today, however, they also appreciate the extent to which 
social and environmental performance figures into the value 
equation – especially now that it’s apparent that the most socially 
and environmentally responsible mills deliver more consistently 
on quality excellence. The key challenge becomes one of 
accessing reliable data on mill social and environmental 
performance, including measures related to improved efficiency 
and overall quality.
The Mill Qualification Program (MQP), developed by Intertek, 
provides leading suppliers and brands with a new operating 
environment that integrates sustainability considerations with 
continuous improvement in the quality performance of fabric 
mills. The program employs a unified and standardised approach 
for mill performance measurement in key areas, including social 
considerations, quality assurance, lab certification and 
environmental sustainability. The MQP has emerged as an 
industry-leading tool for evaluating, benchmarking and 
monitoring mills’ performance and ensuring continuous 
improvement. Its focus on collaboration encourages a partnership 
between buyers and suppliers in order to create a better 
understanding of and alignment with sourcing strategies and 
expectations. During 2017 we carried out Supplier In-house Lab 
Certification Programmes for a number of customers, including 
Arcadia and C&A.
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board on 5 March 2018.
By order of the Board.

STRATEGIC REPORT of our strategic and business goals, providing leadership to the 
business on culture, values and ethics, affording strong oversight 
of risk management and making certain there is alignment with 
shareholder interests and effective shareholder relations. 
The aim of this report is to provide shareholders with a clear 
perspective of your Board’s approach to corporate governance, how 
we have complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code ('Code’) 
and the work of the Board and its Committees during 2017 .
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENTS
2017 has been a year of particular focus on corporate 
governance in the UK with scrutiny from businesses, the 
government and the wider public. The Board have paid close 
attention to these developments including the Government’s 
Corporate Governance Green Paper, the BEIS Select Committee 
inquiry into corporate governance and the FRC’s consultation on 
proposed amendments to the Code. We noted the proposals with 
interest and are reviewing these to ensure any changes can be 
implemented in due course and strengthen the governance 
framework as we continue to operate in an ever-evolving 
environment. 
We remain strongly supportive of the principle of boardroom 
diversity and have continued to be mindful of the 
recommendations by the Hampton Alexander Review, which 
builds on the Lord Davies Review into 'Women on Boards'. The 
Group also supports the Parker Review ‘Beyond One by ‘21’ 
recommendation in respect of ethnically diverse director 
representation on boards. More details about the diversity of our 
Board can be found in the report of the Nomination Committee 
on page 74.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
Succession planning has continued to be a key focus for the 
Board. The Nomination Committee maintained its focus on the 
NED refreshment programme and on evaluating the composition 
of the Board and its Committees. We have reviewed the necessary 
skills required to address the evolving and changing needs of our 
business. It is my intention to continue to ensure that we maintain

DEAR SHAREHOLDER
As reported in the Chief Executive Officer’s review, Intertek has 
delivered good results as we have continued to pursue our 
strategy focused on Total Quality Assurance. In line with our 
progressive dividend policy of sustainably growing the dividend 
each year whilst maintaining minimum dividend cover of 2.5 times 
earnings, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 47 .8p 
bringing the total for the year to 71.3p, up 14.3% and increasing 
the dividend payout ratio to circa 50% in 2018.
The Company remains focused on strong free cash flow 
generation with the result that net debt at the year end of 
£544.1m was 26.8% lower than at the end of 2016. With the 
aim of increasing shareholder value, as well as organic growth, 
we continue to pursue a disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
Our strong financial position means we have the flexibility to 
consider strategic acquisition opportunities in new niche and 
emerging areas as well as pursuing acquisitions in the core 
businesses whilst investing in laboratories and equipment to 
support future growth.
T o underpin the successful delivery of long-term sustainable 
growth and shareholder value, your Board is committed to high 
standards of corporate governance. The Board is responsible for

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION
CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION to the Board experience in branded consumer goods, US corporate 
governance, strategic planning and finance. Graham Allan joined the 
Board on 1 October 2017 as our new Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director and as a member of the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees. His background in Asia and consumer 
goods, and particularly food and beverages will prove invaluable.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In the context of the Board changes during the year and in 
accordance with the requirements of the Code, we undertook an 
internally facilitated assessment. I am pleased to report that the 
evaluation concluded that each Director is making significant 
contributions to debate and discussion and that the Board and its 
Committees continue to operate effectively. Further details on the 
outcome of the evaluation and its process can be found on pages 
71 and 72.
CULTURE
Corporate culture is continually moving up the agendas of investors, 
our clients and other stakeholders. As such, we believe that the 
Board should give sufficient time not only to discussing 
performance and results, but also to understanding the culture and 
values that underpin a collaborative culture. We are focused on 
ensuring that our strategy and culture provides our people with the 
right platform to grow and develop their careers, but also allows 
them to be involved in activities which are socially responsible and 
enables them to engage with the communities in which they live 
and work. 
During the year, the CEO and his Executive Management T eam 
spent considerable time and energy on embedding Intertek’s values 
within the organisation, and reinforcing the levels of communication 
and behaviour that are expected of everyone. As an example, the 
values supporting the Group and the new brand identity exercise, 
which was rolled out during the year, were developed using the 
input from the business and, in conjunction with the 5x5 strategy 
for growth, have provided the platform to energise our people to 
enable us to get closer to our customers. The Board will continue to 
focus on our culture and promoting good governance to support 
openness and accountability throughout the business.
More detail can be found in the Strategic report on pages 2 and 3.
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Our engagement with shareholders is outlined on pages 97 and 
98 and also in the Remuneration report in the letter from the 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee on page 81. I am 
interested in hearing the views of our shareholders. Your 
feedback helps us to ensure that the Board takes these into 
account when considering the strategic direction of the Group.
Finally, I would like to thank the Board, our Executive 
Management and all our employees for their endeavours and 
commitment during 2017 .

shareholders and other stakeholders with a comprehensive 
understanding of our governance framework and to meet the 
requirements of the Code, the Listing Rules ('LR') and the 
Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules ('DTR'). A copy of

THE BOARD
The Board has the ultimate responsibility to the Company’s 
shareholders for the proper conduct and success of the business 
through innovative leadership, setting the strategic aims of the 
Company, its values and standards. The Board also decides and 
reviews all key policies and regulations, its strategy, operating 
plans, large acquisitions, corporate governance, major 
investments and disposals, appointment and removal of 
Directors, risk management, financial reporting, audit, 
sustainability, ethics, the environment and people policies. 
The Board reviews and approves the method and approach 
to risk management and internal control systems and the Group’s 
Risk Register. The overall powers of Directors are set out in 
the Company’s Articles of Association (‘Articles’) and may be 
amended by special resolution of the shareholders.
The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
financial and human resources are in place to achieve its long-
term strategy and deliver sustainable performance. Our strategy 
and progress towards delivering these strategic aims is set 
out in the Strategic report on pages 2 to 61.
The Board Approval Matrix formally outlines the matters 
specifically requiring the consent of the full Board. Each of the 
Board’s Committees has received delegated authority to carry 
out the business defined in its respective terms of reference. 
The Board is satisfied that the terms of reference for each 
of these Committees continue to reflect current best practice 
and satisfy the terms of the Code.
The Board also delegates specific responsibilities, subject 
to certain financial limits, to management and this is governed 
by the Authorities Cascade, which is regularly reviewed and 
refreshed to ensure it continues to meet business needs. 
An agreed framework of controls enables strategic aims and 
financial performance to be delivered whilst also allowing 
risk to be assessed and managed.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT Whenever a Director is unable to attend a meeting, they will 
go through the papers, which have been circulated in advance, 
and give feedback and discuss any issues with the Chairman.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors meet regularly 
without the Executive Directors or management being present. 
The Chairman also maintains regular contact with the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director.
BOARD BALANCE & COMPOSITION
As at 31 December 2017 , the Company’s Board comprised the 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and seven Non-Executive 
Directors. Biographical details of individual Directors are set out 
on pages 68 and 69. The Directors are of the view that the Board 
and its Committees consist of Directors with the appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of 
the Group to ensure the business continues to be run effectively 
and the Board's decision-making is not dominated by any one 
specific view or individual.
There continues to be a focus on maintaining an effective 
and complementary Board, whose capability is appropriate 
for the scale, complexity and strategic positioning of the 
Group’s business.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
composition of the Board and its Committees. More detail on 
the process for appointments can be found in the report of the 
Nomination Committee on pages 72 to 74. 
The Chairman is committed to ensuring the Board comprises 
a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors who 
constructively challenge and scrutinise the day-to-day 
management of the business, balanced against the need to 
ensure continuity on the Board.
The Non-Executive Directors are appointed for specified 
terms subject to election and re-election by shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting ('AGM') each year, if the Board, on 
the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, deems it 
appropriate that they remain in office. The Board recognises the 
recommended term within the Code and as such, any term beyond 
six years for a Non-Executive Director is subject to a particularly 
rigorous review to ensure the progressive refreshing of the Board 
meets the evolving needs of the Company.
The letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors, as well 
as the service agreements of Executive Directors, are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office and at the AGM.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT DIRECTORS’ INDUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
There is a formal and extensive induction programme which 
is tailored to meet the needs of new Directors. This is managed 
by the Chairman and the Group Company Secretary. During 
the programme, new Directors receive a wealth of background 
information on the Company and details of Board procedures, 
Directors’ responsibilities and various governance related issues. 
The induction also includes a series of meetings with other 
members of the Board, senior members of management and 
external advisors.
Graham Allan, Gurnek Bains and Jean-Michel Valette all 
undertook their induction programmes during the year. This 
included orientation from relevant senior executives from the 
operations and other functional areas to ensure the development 
of a deeper understanding and knowledge of Intertek. They also 
received information about the business operations, internal 
audit activities, Group risks and management processes.
Gurnek Bains visited various sites in the UK and travelled 
to Germany with Gill Rider and the Chairman where they were 
given a tour of the operations and laboratories and met local 
management in Nuremberg. During Q3, and shortly after 
the Board trip to Singapore, Graham Allan, Gurnek Bains and 
Jean-Michel Valette, accompanied by the Chairman, visited 
Intertek Indonesia’s headquarters in East Jakarta. The Country 
Managing Director of Intertek Indonesia discussed Intertek’s 
business in the region and gave the visiting Directors a guided 
tour of the Minerals, Petroleum, Food and Environmental 
laboratories at the Ciracas Facility.
The newly appointed Non-Executive Directors then went on to 
visit laboratories in China to enable them to see as much of 
the business as possible. On their two-day visit the Directors met 
with representatives of the China management team, receiving 
presentations on the region and their strategic development 
plans. The visit included tours at our Softlines, Hardlines, Food 
and Transportation Technologies facilities.

Transportation Technologies facility in Shanghai.
Earlier in the year, Sir David Reid visited our facilities in Mexico 
City. Intertek+ABC Analitic has become the leading solution in the 
Mexican market for environmental and food testing. Sir David was 
given a tour of the laboratories where the Intertek+ABC Analitic 
team conducts chemical testing for food, water, soil analysis, 
atmospheric/smoke stack emissions and residues. The Chairman 
went on to visit the Environmental, Softlines, Electrical and 
Hardlines laboratories at the Intertek Mexico facilities.
All Directors are kept up to date with information about 
Intertek’s business and there is an ongoing programme of 
information dissemination. It is important that the Directors 
have an appreciation of the business both in the UK and 
overseas. During the year there were presentations from 
senior management to the Board and meetings have been 
held on regional strategy to increase the understanding of 
operations, opportunities and risks.
BOARD VISIT TO SINGAPORE
In October, the Board travelled to Singapore for its annual 
overseas visit. During this trip, they met with the Singapore 
management team as well as the country managers from the 
South-East Asia region, who gave presentations providing an 
in-depth overview of the local operations and opportunities. 
The Board visited the Singapore Technical Centre and were 
taken through the Total Quality Assurance services Intertek 
provides as an independent ATIC partner to the oil & gas supply 
chain. The Board congratulated the Singapore team on their 
technical competence, high operational standards, commitment 
to HSE, and enthusiasm and commitment to providing superior 
customer service with Total Quality Assurance.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
 EFFECTIVENESS DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Board operates a policy to identify, authorise and manage 
any conflicts of interest to assist Directors in complying with 
their duty to avoid actual or potential conflicts. The Directors 
are advised of the process upon appointment and whenever 
any Director considers that he or she is, or may be, interested 
in any contract or arrangement to which the Company is, or 
may be, a party, the Director gives due notice to the Board in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles. 
A formal process is also in place for managing such conflicts 
to ensure no conflicted Director is involved in any decision 
related to their conflict.
The Conflicts of Interest Register is maintained by the Group 
Company Secretary and the Board undertakes an annual review 
of each Director’s interests, if any, including outside the Company. 
Any conflicts of interests are reviewed when a new Director is 
appointed, or if and when a new potential conflict arises. During 
the year, this process operated effectively.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
The effectiveness of the Board and its Committees is reviewed 
annually and an independent externally facilitated review is 
conducted every three years. A full externally facilitated Board 
evaluation exercise was last conducted in 2015 and reported 
on in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts. The next 
externally facilitated Board evaluation will be conducted in 
2018 and reported in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts.

2017 Internal Board and Committee evaluation
The evaluation process was led by the Chairman, with the 
support of the Group Company Secretary and entailed:
• the completion of detailed questionnaires by each 
Board member;
• discussions on the outcomes and recommendations 
with the Chairman and each Board member; and
• following discussion of the results of the evaluation 
with the relevant Committee and the Board as a whole, 
identifying and agreeing areas for improvement – the strategy 
and strategic agenda having already been agreed at the Board.
Last year’s Effective Board Review 2016 was about how the 
Board was actively progressing and implementing the agreed 
strategy and putting in place the strategic initiatives and 
capability to deliver sustainable growth and strong returns for 
our shareholders. 
This year’s Effective Board Review 2017 covers how the Board 
had continued to deliver sustainable growth and strong returns 
for our shareholders through the Total Quality Assurance value 
proposition which forms the core of our 5x5 differentiated 
strategy for growth.
The key findings of this year’s report are very positive:
•  The Board refreshment programme was concluded successfully 
during the year for our Non-Executive Directors.
• The Board has been strengthened by the addition of three new 
members bringing new skills, experience and attributes to bear. 
They have received a good induction into the business. 
• The Board is performing at a high level demonstrating the right 
behaviours, culture and tone.
• The strong leadership of the CEO with the focus on 
performance management is continuing to make a real 
difference. In addition, the leadership have introduced a bold 
new brand covering the world of Intertek known as “Total 
Quality Assurance” thereby engaging all our staff on the 
quality of our service and commitment to our customers to 
deliver our promise for them, with precision, pace and passion.
• Despite the continuing challenges in the cyclical Oil & Gas 
industry, the Group results have delivered a strong 
performance in revenue, earnings and cash. 
• The implementation and delivery of the strategy is working 
well and delivering further value for the business, and as ever 
there is more to do and to deliver with our forward plan.
• The TSR for the year 2017 has increased by 51.4%, a strong 
absolute performance and also strong relative to Intertek’s 
peers. Importantly, our return on invested capital has increased 
in the year to 26.7% from 23.9% at constant rates.
• Governance is seen as strong. There is good engagement with 
shareholders by senior management and the IR team. The 
Chairman received good feedback in January 2018 from his 
discussions with shareholders, who accounted for some 22% 
of the portfolio.
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 71
DIRECTORS’ REPORT •  In 2017 , we again received a strong shareholder vote (96.76%) 
on the approval of our 2016 Remuneration report.
• The enhancement of the risk management and controls 
processes during 2017 , now reporting directly through the CEO, 
have ensured that risk is owned and operated by management 
with comprehensive quarterly reports to the Board.
• The quality and level of information and papers for board 
meetings is good, and the progress on the strategic agenda is 
reviewed and discussed at each meeting and reviewed again 
annually. There is good balance and constructive debate at the 
meetings. There is good communication to the Board between 
meetings and a good example of this is the weekly updates 
received by the Board following the storms in the US until the 
situation had stabilised.
• The Board visit to Intertek’s business in Singapore was 
excellent and gave the Board a thorough review of the region. 
The CEO also encourages Non-Executive Directors to visit 
laboratories and management covering the important 
geographies and business lines.
• Our people continue to be our most important asset and we 
continue to focus on becoming the best-in-class through talent 
mapping, talent development and customer-centricity. We 
believe we can achieve significant competitive advantage as 
we work through our people programme. 
• On sustainability, another area where we are on a journey to 
best-in-class following a detailed review in December 2016, we 
have seen further significant progress in 2017 . We work 
globally with our clients to improve the social, ethical and 
environmental impacts of their services, supply chain and their 
products. We have further exciting plans for 2018, for our 
customers, and all our stakeholders. 
• Lastly on growth, our Board is totally focused on driving 
organic sales growth, together with taking advantage of 
investment and acquisition opportunities. Growth is a key 
driver and will be accompanied by margin-accretive revenue 
growth and delivering good returns on capital invested.
Chairman and Director evaluation
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, conducted a performance review of 
the Chairman. They considered his leadership, performance 
and overall contribution to be of a high standard and he 
continues to have their full support.
The Chairman met with each Director to discuss individual 
contributions and performance, together with training and 
development needs. Following these reviews, the Board 
remains satisfied that, in line with the Code, all Directors are 
able to allocate sufficient time to the Company to enable them 
to discharge their responsibilities as Directors effectively and 
that any current external appointments do not detract from 
the extent or quality of time which the Director is able to 
devote to the Company.
The Board recommends that shareholders should be supportive 
of their election or re-election to the Board at the 2018 AGM.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
Succession planning has been a key focus of the Nomination 
Committee (‘Committee’) during the year. We continued our focus 
on the Non-Executive Director refreshment programme, and the 
ongoing review of the composition of the Board and its 
Committees. In keeping with this, the Committee carried out a 
robust recruitment process resulting in the appointment of 
Gurnek Bains and Jean-Michel Valette in July, and the appointment 
of Graham Allan in October 2017 , further enhancing the range of 
skills, breadth of experience and diversity on our Board. 
MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMITTEE
• Review the structure, size and composition of the Board and 
its Committees.
• Identify, review and nominate candidates to fill Board 
vacancies.

ACTIVITY OF THE COMMITTEE DURING THE YEAR
The Committee’s programme of work for the year was as follows:
• Considered and discussed the results of the internal annual 
review into the effectiveness of the Committee.
• Reviewed and appointed recruitment consultants.
• Reviewed the shortlist of candidates against a revised 
comprehensive and focused requirement of the skills, 
experience and behaviours of our Non-Executive Directors in 
the light of our refreshment programme.
• Reviewed the composition of each Committee and approved 
the appointment of Andrew Martin as a member of the 
Remuneration Committee on 1 July 2017 .
• Reviewed training and development for Non-Executive 
Directors. 
• Recommended to the Board that Gurnek Bains and Jean-Michel

respectively on 1 July 2017 . 
• Recommended to the Board the appointment of Graham Allan 
as the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and a 
member of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees

SUCCESSION PLANNING
As recommended by Provision B.2.3. of the Code, we are 
committed to a progressive refreshing of the Board. We have 
continued our discussions, not just on the qualities and skills 
required on the Board in the short term but also considered the 
importance in understanding the evolving needs of the business 
over the next five to ten years. This is to ensure that the core 
skills and attributes required of future candidates support the 
growth agenda of the Group. The Committee continues to ensure 
that the composition of the Board retains the right balance of 
skills, diversity, experience, industry and technical knowledge to 
provide the quality of leadership necessary, to further implement 
the strategy and achieve the strategic objectives necessary for 
the long-term success of the Company. The Committee also 
ensures plans are in place for orderly succession for appointments 
to the Board, and reviews the succession plans for other senior 
management positions. Responsibility for making senior 
management appointments rests with the CEO.
Last year we reported to you our intention to annually review the 
Board’s effectiveness and composition in relation to long-term 
succession planning. To ensure that the Board comprises a broad 
range of skills, experience and attributes, the Committee 
discusses and reviews extensively the skills and capabilities 
for each Board vacancy as well as outlining the qualities of the 
individual required to ensure the right fit with the culture and 
style of Intertek. The Committee has also developed an 
information pack on Intertek to enable potential candidates to 
gain a thorough understanding of the Group to ensure that this 
is a company that they wish to be part of. 
In the context of the retirements from the Board, the Committee 
initiated a search for new Non-Executive Directors. In addition to 
the specific skills, knowledge and experience deemed necessary, 
the role specification contained criteria such as competency and 
personal qualities that would be required for each of the positions. 
The Committee also paid close attention to ensure that those 
candidates selected exhibited the right behaviours to fit the 
culture, values and ethics of the Group and would also be able 
to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities. The Committee separately engaged Egon 
Zehnder and Russell Reynolds, both external search agencies 
with no other connection to the Company, to assist with the 
different selection processes. Russell Reynolds were specifically 
chosen to assist with the search in the US. 
Following this rigorous selection process, the Committee, having 
considered the relative merits and fit of each candidate, made 
a recommendation to the Board, which was accepted, to appoint 
as independent Non-Executive Directors Gurnek Bains and 
Jean-Michel Valette on 1 July 2017 . Gurnek’s wide-ranging 
experience, working with senior leaders across a range of 
industries internationally, and his thought leadership on culture 
and leadership development, provides a strong addition to the 
current skills on the Board and we extended a warm welcome 
to him as a member of this Committee.
Jean-Michel Valette brings strong US and global management 
experience, especially in consumer branding and luxury goods 
companies, which will broaden the international and customer 
knowledge on our Board. With more than 30 years’ experience in 
management, US public company corporate governance, strategic 
planning and finance he is well placed as a member of the Audit 
Committee which he joined on appointment.
We are also delighted to say that Graham Allan became the 
Company’s Senior Independent Non-Executive Director in 
October 2017 . He brings strong management knowledge 
as a CEO and experience in the pan-Asian market, as well as 
international experience in consumer and retail business, to 
complement the current skills on the Board.
Throughout the year the Committee reviewed the composition 
of each Committee and approved the appointment of Andrew 
Martin as a member of the Remuneration Committee on 1 July 
2017 . To further ensure continuity of knowledge and Board 
dynamics, he also succeeded Michael Wareing as Chair of the 
Audit Committee on 1 March 2017 . 
Biographies for all the Directors are available on pages 68 and 69 
and a resolution for each new Director will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM for their election.
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 73
DIRECTORS’ REPORT DIVERSITY
We remain strongly supportive of the principle of boardroom 
diversity, of which gender is an important, but not the only 
aspect. It is the Company’s policy, in line with the Code, that 
proposed appointments to the Board, and succession planning, 
are based on merit, judged against objective criteria, whilst also 
making the best use of differences in culture, gender, skills, 
background, regional and industry experience and other qualities. 
All of these factors are considered by the Committee in 
determining the composition of the Board and each new 
appointment must complement existing skills, knowledge 
and experience. 
The Board is mindful of the recommendations by both Lord 
Davies in his report 'Women on Boards', and the Hampton 
Alexander Review, which builds on the Davies Review, which 
encourages FTSE 350 companies to achieve at least 33% women 
on boards by 2020. 
As at 31 December 2017 , Intertek had three female members on 
the Board out of ten (representing 30%). Whilst the Board’s wish 
is to return to a level of at least 33% female representation at 
Board level, the need to ensure the progressive refreshing of the 
Board to maintain the correct balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience remains paramount.
The Group also supports and already complies with the Parker 
Review ‘Beyond One by ‘21’ recommendation that FTSE 100 and 
250 company boards should have at least one ethnically diverse 
director by 2021 and 2024 respectively. Gurnek Bains, currently a 
Non-Executive Director, fulfils this criterion.
The Company remains committed to providing equal 
opportunities, eliminating discrimination, and encouraging 
diversity amongst our global workforce. An analysis of the 
diversity of the senior leadership group, their direct reports and 
other employees as at 31 December 2017 is set out on pages 
48 and 49 respectively.
CONCLUSION
As Chairman of the Nomination Committee, I believe we have 
made significant progress in the last six years, and particularly in 
the last three years, in building a strong PLC board at the 
Executive and Non-Executive level as well as within the 
Executive Management Team.
We are a people business and so this will continue to be a key 
focus on an ongoing basis. An example of our commitment to 
People is the recent appointment of Gurnek Bains who is a 
leading expert on “People” and his skills are complementary and 
add value to the Executive Team in terms of attracting, 
developing and retaining good people. He is also a thought leader 
on Leadership Culture. 
Similarly, Jean-Michel Valette's vast experience of US and global 
management and Graham Allan's experience in consumer and 
retail management pan-Asia including China, as well as in the US, 
has added complementary perspectives and insight to the Board. 
These geographies represent over 50% of our global revenues.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
EFFECTIVENESS
continued The Board has established formal and transparent arrangements 
to apply the corporate reporting, risk management and internal 
control principles as set out in the Code. This section outlines the 
Group’s system of internal control and risk management as well 
as the work of our Audit Committee during the year. 
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board is responsible for monitoring the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its 
effectiveness so as to be in line with best practice. Risk 
management and internal controls are embedded in the running 
of each business line, country and support function and oversight 
is provided by divisional, regional and functional risk committees. 
Each risk committee in turn reports to the Group Risk Committee 
('GRC').
The Group identifies and tracks its risk environment using a risk 
register process: the risk committees produce a register of risks 
in their area of responsibility, and these risk registers are then 
consolidated at Group level. The GRC reviews the risks and 
mitigation plans throughout the year and the Board approved the 
final Group Risk Register in December. The Group General Counsel 
presents a quarterly integrated control and compliance risk 
review to the Board covering matters such as the Group risk 
register and mitigation action plans, quarterly action plans to 
address any risk developments and a review of any changes 
to the Group’s risk environment.
COMPLIANCE, WHISTLE-BLOWING AND FRAUD
Intertek is committed to maintaining a culture where issues of 
integrity and professional ethics can be raised and discussed. The 
Group’s key ethics and integrity policies are set out in the Code of 
Ethics and a detailed description of the topics covered by the 
Code of Ethics, its operation during the year and the outcomes of 
these policies are contained in the Sustainability and CSR report 
on pages 44 to 61.
To enable all employees, contractors and others representing 
Intertek to confidentially report suspected breaches of the Code 
of Ethics, a global hotline system is in place. In addition, dedicated 
compliance officers across the Group’s markets undertake 
investigations of issues that arise either from reports to the 
hotline system or from other sources, such as routine compliance 
questions. The Group Compliance function is independent of the 
Group’s operational business and reports directly to the Group 
General Counsel.
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present this year’s Audit 
Committee report. It has been another busy and interesting year 
for the Audit Committee (‘Committee’).
As announced last year, I succeeded Michael Wareing as Chair of 
this Committee on 1 March 2017 and he remained a member until 
30 September 2017 . I wish to thank Michael for his diligent 
handover and his exemplary stewardship of the Committee since 
2012. In July 2017 we also announced the appointment of 
Jean-Michel Valette to the Board and to this Committee. His 
appointment brings a new perspective to the Committee and I am 
pleased to welcome him aboard. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) completed their first full 
audit for the year ended 31 December 2016, following a smooth 
handover from the previous auditor. The audit process continues 
to be effective with PwC establishing positive relationships and 
providing a good level of service to the Company. During 2017 
the Committee’s primary focus centred on the accuracy of the 
Group’s financial reporting, together with improvements in 
internal control activities and risk and compliance matters. This 
built on new developments in corporate governance and 
extensive regulatory change in the UK and EU statutory audit 
reporting, which the Committee had already considered and 
reported on in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts. The new 
legislation introduced mandatory rotation of auditors and tighter 
restrictions on the provision of non-audit services, as well as 
setting out requirements in relation to the responsibilities and 
composition of audit committees. 
This report aims to outline the activities and the responsibilities 
of the Committee, on behalf of the Board, in responding to 
these changes and in scrutinising the conduct of the business, 
its management and auditors to protect the interests of 
our shareholders.

ACCOUNTABILITY
continued SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE
In preparation for each year end, the Committee reviews the 
significant accounting policies, estimates and judgements to 
be applied in the financial statements and discusses their 
application with management. The external auditor also 
considers the appropriateness of these assessments as part 
of the external audit.
In accordance with the Code, the external auditor prepares a 
report for the Committee on both the half-year and full-year 
results, which summarises the approach to key risks in the 
external audit and highlights any issues arising out of their 
work on those risks, or any other work undertaken on the audit. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed and considered the 
following areas of judgement to be exercised in the application of 
the accounting policies:
Claims
From time to time the Group is involved in various claims and 
lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of business. The 
Committee considered the claims provision which reflects the 
estimates of amounts payable in connection with identified 
claims from customers, former employees and others.
The Committee noted that once claims have been notified the 
finance teams liaise with the business to determine whether 
a provision is required, based on IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent 
liabilities and Contingent assets’ (‘IAS 37’).
The level of provision is subsequently reviewed on a regular basis 
with the Group General Counsel, taking into account the advice of 
external legal counsel. The Committee, following assurance from 
management and review of the report presented by the external 
auditor, considered and agreed that the claims provision was 
appropriate given the size and status of claims reported. 
Taxation
The determination of profits subject to tax is calculated 
according to complex laws and regulations, the interpretation 
and application of which can be uncertain. In addition, deferred 
tax assets and liabilities require judgement in determining the 
amounts to be recognised, with consideration given to the timing 
and level of future taxable income. The main areas of judgement 
in the Group tax calculation are the expected central tax 
provisions for the full year and the recognition of the UK 
deferred tax asset. 
Twice a year, the Committee receives a report from management 
providing an evaluation of existing risks and tax provisions which 
is reviewed by the Committee. The Committee also considered 
reports presented by the external auditor before determining 
that the levels of tax provisioning were appropriate.
Restructuring
In reviewing the provision for restructuring, the Committee 
reviewed details of the activities pursued as part of the 
restructuring to ensure that the appropriate level of provision is 
put in place, and that these activities are aligned with the Group's 
strategy. The Committee also sought confirmation from the 
external auditor that the restructuring plan met the criteria for 
recognising a provision under IAS 37 before determining that the 
provision was appropriate.
Accounting for acquisitions
The provisional recognition of goodwill, intangible assets, other 
assets and liabilities and estimates of the fair value of 
consideration transferred for acquisitions made are based on a 
number of assumptions. In 2017 , management concluded its 
final assessment of these assets and liabilities for acquisitions 
made in 2016 and presented an update to the Committee. The 
Committee reviewed management’s final accounting paper on 
acquisitions made in 2016 and 2017 , and took into account the 
report presented by the external auditor, before determining that 
the acquisition accounting is appropriate.
Impairment
The Group’s strategy includes acquisition-led growth to generate 
new services and expand into new locations. These acquisitions, 
being in the service sector, can generate significant goodwill that 
benefits the Group as a whole and specifically the business to which 
the acquisition relates. Goodwill, aggregated at the cash generating 
unit (‘CGU’) level, must be tested annually for impairment under IAS 
36 ‘Impairment’ (‘IAS 36’), or when there are indicators of 
impairment.
The Committee reviewed the impairment consideration and 
calculations prepared by management considering the trading 
assumptions, the discount rates used as well as the sensitivities 
included by management, details of which are contained in 
note 9 to the financial statements. The Committee also took into 
account the work undertaken by the external auditor in respect 
of impairment and is satisfied that no impairment is required 
against any CGU. 
The significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to 
the financial statements were consistent, with the exception of 
restructuring, with those identified by the external auditor in 
their report on pages 157 to 163.

FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE ASSESSMENT
The Code provides that through its financial reporting, the Board 
should provide a fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
of the Company’s prospects. 
At the Board’s request, the Committee reviewed the Annual 
Report and Accounts to determine whether it considered that the 
document, taken as a whole, meets this standard and provides 
the necessary information for shareholders and other readers of 
the Annual Report and Accounts to assess the Group’s position 
and performance for 2017 , its business model and strategy. 
In justifying this statement, the Committee has considered the 
robust process that underpins it, which includes:
• Clear guidance and instruction given to all contributors, 
including at business line level;
• Revisions as a result of regulatory requirements monitored 
on a regular basis;
• Pre year-end discussions held with the external auditor 
in advance of the year-end reporting process;
• Pre year-end input provided by senior management and 
corporate functions;
• A verification process dealing with the factual content 
of the reports to ensure accuracy and consistency;
• Comprehensive review by the senior management team 
to ensure overall consistency and balance;
• Review conducted by external advisors and the external 
auditor on best practice with regard to the content and 
structure of the Annual Report and Accounts;
• Review and consideration of the Annual Report and Accounts 
by the Committee; and
• Final sign-off provided by the Board.
The results are presented to the Committee to ensure compliance 
with the Code. The Committee challenges judgemental 
statements to ensure that they are reasonable within the context 
of the report. This process enabled the Committee, and then the 
Board, to confirm that the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy.

ACCOUNTABILITY
continued EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Statutory Auditors and Third Country Auditors Regulations 
2016, which implement the EU Audit Directive and Audit 
Regulation, has resulted in changes to the Companies Act 2006 
and to the Code. Amongst other things, the Company is now 
required to rotate its auditors every 10 years, to give advance 
notice of any tendering plans and to cap the non-audit fees paid 
to auditors at 70% of the three-year average audit fees at Group 
level, with there being a prohibition on the provision of certain 
non-audit services.
As noted in this report last year, the Group completed 
a transparent and independent audit tender process in 2015. 
Following this process PwC have been the Company’s auditors 
and Ian Chambers the Audit Partner since May 2016. 
In line with current regulation, the Company is required to put its 
external audit process out to tender again in 2025-2026. 
The independence of the external auditor is critical for the 
integrity of the audit. We are satisfied that PwC are fully 
independent from the Company’s management and free from 
conflicts of interest. 
Effectiveness of the external audit
The Committee conducts an annual review to assess the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor and the 
effectiveness of the audit as part of the year-end process. This 
process is conducted in three parts: 
• PwC presents its approach to maintaining audit quality 
annually to the Committee;
• The views of management and the Directors on PwC’s service 
are obtained via a questionnaire/survey and feedback is 
presented to the Committee; and 
• The key findings and recommendations from both processes 
form the basis of the assessment of PwC’s effectiveness 
together with the Committee’s experience of dealing with 
PwC during the year.
The survey assessed the effectiveness of the PwC audit across its 
three main stages; Planning, Fieldwork and Reporting, as well as on 
transition commitments in the first year of their tenure. 
Following this review, the Committee considered in detail the 
feedback received and concluded, at the meeting held in May 2017 , 
that PwC remained independent and provided a service that was 
robust and fit for purpose and that the overall audit process was 
effective. The effectiveness for the 2017 audit of the Group will be 
reviewed by the Committee in May 2018.
Audit and non-audit fees
The Company has set out a policy on the provision of non-audit 
work by the external auditor consistent with the Revised Ethical 
Standard 2016 issued by the FRC and it is designed to ensure 
that the provision of such services does not create a threat to the 
external auditor’s independence and objectivity. 
It identifies certain types of engagement that the external 
auditor shall not undertake, including bookkeeping or other 
services related to accounting records or financial statements; 
financial information systems design and implementation; 
appraisal or valuation services; actuarial services; internal audit 
outsourcing or co-sourcing services; management functions or 
human resources services; broker or dealer, investment advisor 
or investment banking services; legal services which can only be 
provided by a qualified lawyer; expert services unrelated to the 
audit that include advocating Intertek’s interests in litigation, 
regulatory or administrative proceedings not precluding the 
auditors providing factual accounts to explain positions taken 
during the course of their work; tax services in relation to 
marketing, planning, or opining in favour of an aggressive tax 
position or transaction; any other services that, locally, are 
prohibited through regulation; and personal tax compliance 
services to members of the Group’s management who have 
a financial reporting oversight role.
In the event that an engagement for non-audit services arises, 
the policy is designed to ensure that the external auditor is only 
appointed where it is considered to be the most suitable supplier 
of the service and the necessary prior approvals have been given 
in accordance with the policy. 
The Committee annually reviews and reapproves the framework 
of permitted non-audit services as set out in the policy, taking 
into account any changes in legislation and best practice. PwC 
also provide an update on the spend for non-audit services 
against the annual cap twice a year.
A summary of the fees paid for non-audit services is set out 
below and further information is contained in note 4 to the

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
Doing Business the Right Way is at the heart of what we do and 
is a key enabler of our 5x5 strategy for growth. The Intertek Core 
Mandatory Controls (‘CMCs’) are an integral part of Doing 
Business the Right Way, and provide the mechanism by which we 
define, monitor and achieve consistently high standards in our 
control environment throughout the whole organisation. An 
updated set of CMCs (v3.0) has been developed reflecting 
feedback on the existing framework and how the Group’s risk 
environment has evolved during the year. 
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 79
DIRECTORS’ REPORT In order to provide assurance that the Intertek controls and policy 
framework is being adhered to, a self-certification exercise is 
undertaken across the Group’s global operations. This exercise is 
reviewed and refreshed each year to ensure that it encapsulates 
all new areas of risk identified and to support the continued 
development of the Group’s control environment. An online 
questionnaire requesting confirmation of adherence to controls, 
financial and operational, is sent to all Intertek country and 
finance operations. Where corrective actions are needed, the 
country is required to provide an outline and a confirmed timeline. 
These items are monitored closely to ensure timely completion. 
This process is facilitated by the Legal, Risk and Compliance 
function.
A consolidated assessment is made at regional level for senior 
leadership approval. An evaluation is then undertaken with 
Executive Management Team following which a Company-wide 
position is submitted to the CEO and the CFO. A final summary 
assessment is provided to the Committee. The self-assessment 
exercise has been reviewed during the year to ensure global 
coverage and to reflect Intertek’s operational and financial 
structure, and in order to enhance the alignment of the self-
assessment to the assurance process. 
A detailed verification programme also provides assurance to the 
Committee and the Board when checking that all the statements 
made in the Annual Report and Accounts are accurate. Intertek’s 
Manual of Accounting Policies and Procedures is issued to all 
finance staff and gives instructions and guidance on all aspects 
of accounting and reporting that apply to the Group.
The Committee can confirm that it reviewed the Group’s internal 
controls and risk management systems and concluded that there 
was a sound and effective control environment in place across 
the Group during 2017 , and up to the date upon which these 
financial statements were approved. No significant failings or 
weaknesses had been identified.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The annual Internal Audit plan is reviewed and approved by the 
Committee. Where there is no internal expertise to perform 
a specialised audit, a third-party auditor with the requisite skills 
is appointed to undertake the audit, the findings of which are 
reported to the Committee. In its reports to the Committee, 
Internal Audit provided summaries of each audit performed, 
with commentary on the robustness of internal control design 
and operating effectiveness. In 2017 , Internal Audit focused 
on reviews of financial control in a wide range of businesses, 
as well as regular follow-up activities.
As part of its annual programme, the Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit function including 
feedback from key business stakeholders. An independent review 
of Internal Audit effectiveness is conducted every three years, 
with the latest review having been completed in 2016, and the 
Committee reviewed progress against the recommendations.
PRIORITIES FOR 2018
The priorities for the Committee over the next 12 months are 
as follows:
• Continue to monitor the external auditor;
• Continue to facilitate the understanding of the business by 
the external auditor;
• Ensure that the audit continues to evolve and align with the 
changes in the business and strategic objectives;
• Continue to develop and refine the CMCs in line with the 
evolving risk environment of the Company;
• Continue to monitor the impact of external economic factors 
on the Group and its financial position; and
• Monitor any relevant changes in the corporate governance 
and regulatory arena.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources for a period of at least 12 months from the 
date of signing this Annual Report and Accounts, and have 
therefore assessed that the going concern basis of accounting is 
appropriate in preparing the financial statements and that there 
are no material uncertainties to disclose.
This conclusion is based on a review and an assessment of the 
levels of facilities expected to be available to the Group, based 
on levels of cash held, Group Treasury funding projections, and 
the Group’s financial projections for a period to 31 December 
2022. With the exception of $100m of facilities maturing in 
2018, all the current borrowing facilities are expected to be 
available at 31 December 2018.
In making this assessment, management has considered the 
covenants attached to the Group’s borrowing facilities and 
performed downside scenarios on the Group’s financial 
projections of 10% and 20% reduction in EBITDA forecast. 
Even in these circumstances, there is significant headroom on 
the debt covenants.
After making diligent enquiries the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation based upon current financial projections and bank 
facilities available, that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operation. Accordingly they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Group’s financial statements.

continued  REMUNERATION REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I would like to begin this statement by thanking you for the 
support you have given our remuneration matters during 2017 . 
The strength of your vote at the 2017 AGM for our 2016 
Remuneration report signalled to us that we are implementing a 
remuneration policy that clearly aligns your interests with those 
of our business strategy and the leadership team.
Our business continues to have significant opportunities to 
provide our clients with ATIC services across the three broad 
economic sectors – Products, Trade and Resources. The sustained 
focus on Intertek’s 5x5 differentiated strategy for growth in 
2017 has provided our managers and employees across the world 
with the tools they need to deliver on Intertek’s Total Quality 
Assurance Customer Promise. This in turn has allowed us to 
continue improving shareholder returns with our disciplined 
approach to revenue, margin, and cash and capital allocation. 
In 2017 Intertek delivered 7 .9% growth in revenue at actual rates 
(3.0% at constant currency), 14.2% growth in adjusted operating 
profit (10.0% at constant currency) and 280bps improvement in 
ROIC which was 26.7%, against stretching performance targets.
On the structure of remuneration, there were no major changes 
in 2017 . We have continued our approach to the annual incentive, 
using fewer measures, closely aligned to the delivery of our 
growth strategy. Since 1 January 2016 the annual incentive 
structure has been based solely on financial performance with 
three main indicators weighted as shown below:
• 80% – a matrix based on revenue growth and adjusted 
operating profit growth; and
• 2 0% – based on return on invested capital performance.
For the annual bonus, this performance resulted in the 
Remuneration Committee approving an overall payout for Group 
performance of 100% of maximum. As per policy, the proposed 
bonus was subject to a quality of earnings review at the end of 
the year to ensure that the payout was appropriate and 
commensurate with the underlying business performance and 
the Group’s culture and values. 
The performance of the 2015 LTIP , which was measured based 
on EPS and relative TSR performance over the three-year period 
to 31 December 2017 , resulted in a payout of 90.87%.
The salary increase for the CEO in 2018 has been set at an 
inflation-based 2.0%.
As communicated to shareholders in my letter last year, the 
Committee has completed a review of our CFO, Edward Leigh’s 
remuneration. Following his strong performance since 
appointment and given both the substantial support he provides 
to the CEO in delivering our business performance and his 
increased responsibilities, which now also include leading the IT 
services function within the Group, the Committee consulted 
with shareholders during the latter half of 2017 on increasing 
Edward’s base salary to £475,000 (an increase of c.14.1%). The 
Committee acknowledges that such salary increases are not 
common in the current climate, however, given both Edward’s 
performance in role and his increased responsibilities, it was felt 
that the proposed increase was appropriate and in the best 
interests of the business.
With regards to market positioning, whilst noting that this was 
not the driving force behind the proposal, we did undertake a 
detailed review of CFO benchmark data. The increase in base 
salary positions Edward’s base salary at around market median, 
when compared to companies ranked between 31 and 130 in the 
FTSE 350, which is in line with our philosophy for executive 
directors. His total remuneration package (under which incentives 
will remain unchanged as a percentage of salary for 2018) will be 
positioned in line with market practice. 
Having completed the review, we consulted with the majority of 
our shareholders and received strong support on the proposed 
increase. We have therefore implemented the change in his base 
salary from 1 January 2018. 
The elements specifically required to be audited within the 
bordered sections of pages 89 to 93 have been audited by PwC 
LLP in compliance with the requirements of the Regulations.
Finally, I hope you will find that you are able to support the level 
of remuneration we have determined for 2017 as submitted for 
your approval at this year’s AGM. 
Yours sincerely,
Gill Rider

DIRECTORS’ REPORT DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
POLICY REPORT
The section below sets out the Remuneration Policy for Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors, which was approved by a resolution 
of the shareholders and became effective from 25 May 2016, 
the date of the 2016 AGM.
The policy remains unchanged. Where appropriate, tables have 
been updated with current data.
POLICY OVERVIEW
We continue to focus on ensuring that our Remuneration Policy 
is appropriate for the nature, size and complexity of the Group, 
encourages our employees in the development of their careers 
and is directed to deliver continued profitable growth.
Our remuneration strategy is to:
• align and recognise the individual’s contribution to help us 
succeed in achieving our growth strategy and long-term 
business goals;
• attract, engage, motivate and retain the best available people 
by positioning total pay and benefits to be competitive in the 
relevant market and in line with the ability of the business 
to pay;
• reward people equitably for the size of their responsibilities 
and performance; and
• motivate high performers to increase shareholder value 
and share in the Group’s success.
Each year the Committee approves the overall reward strategy 
for the Group and considers the individual remuneration of 
the Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
The Committee reviews the balance between base salary and 
performance-related remuneration against the key objectives 
and targets so as to ensure performance is appropriately rewarded. 
This also ensures outcomes are a fair reflection of the underlying 
performance of the Group.
As a global service business, our success is critically dependent 
on the performance and retention of our key people around the 
world. Employment costs represent the major element of Group 
operating costs. As a global Group our pay arrangements take 
into account both local and international markets and we 
operate a global Remuneration Policy framework to achieve 
our reward strategy.
Our peer groups for the majority of our employees consist of 
international industrial or business service organisations and 
similar-sized businesses. For our more senior executives we 
base our remuneration comparisons on a blend of factors, 
including sector, job complexity, location, responsibilities and 
performance, whilst recognising the Company is listed in the UK.
We believe that a significant proportion of remuneration for 
senior executives should be related to performance, with part 
of that remuneration being deferred in the form of shares and 
subject to continued employment and longer-term performance. 
We also believe that share-based remuneration should form 
a significant element of senior executives’ compensation, 
so that there is a strong link to the sustained future success 
of the Group.

SALARY
To attract and retain high 
performing Executive 
Directors to lead the Group.
The Committee reviews salaries 
annually, taking account of 
the scale of responsibilities, 
the individual’s experience 
and performance.
Whilst the Committee takes 
benchmarking information into 
account, its decisions are based 
primarily on the performance of 
the individual concerned against 
the above factors to ensure 
that there is no unjustified 
upward ratchet in base salary.
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual increase.
The Committee is guided 
by the general increase for 
the employee population 
but on occasions may need 
to recognise other factors 
including, but not limited 
to, development in role, 
change in responsibility  
and/or variance to market 
levels of remuneration.
Individual performance is 
taken into account when 
salary levels are reviewed.
BENEFITS
To provide competitive 
benefits to ensure the 
wellbeing of employees.
Benefits include, but are not 
limited to, annual medicals, 
life assurance cover of up 
to six times base salary, 
allowances in lieu of a company 
car or other benefits, private 
medical insurance (for the 
individual and their dependants) 
and other benefits typically 
provided to senior executives.
Executive Directors can 
participate in the all-employee 
share plans operated by the 
Company on the same basis 
as all other employees.
The total value of these 
benefits (excluding the 
all-employee plans) will 
not exceed 12% of salary.
The maximum opportunity 
under any all-employee 
share plan is in line with all 
other employees and is as 
determined by the prevailing 
HMRC rules.
n/a
PENSION
To provide competitive 
retirement benefits.
Executive Directors can elect 
to join the Company’s defined 
contribution pension scheme, 
receive pension contributions 
into their personal pension 
plan or receive a cash sum in 
lieu of pension contributions.
Up to 30% of salary. n/a
ANNUAL
INCENTIVE 
PLAN (‘AIP’)
To drive the short-term 
strategy and recognise 
annual performance against 
targets which are based 
on business objectives.
Awards are based on Group 
annual financial performance 
targets, with performance 
targets set annually by 
the Committee.
Normally, 50% of any bonus is 
paid in cash and 50% deferred 
into shares which will vest after 
a period of three years subject 
to continued employment.
Accrued dividends on deferred 
shares during the deferral period 
are paid in cash or shares at 
the end of the deferral period.
Not pensionable.
Malus and clawback 
provisions apply.
The maximum opportunity 
is 200% of salary for all 
Executive Directors.
The Committee has the ability 
to reduce bonus payments 
if it believes that short-term 
performance has been achieved 
at the expense of the Group’s 
long-term future success.
The Committee can adjust 
upwards the bonus outturn (up 
to the maximum set out above) 
to recognise very exceptional 
circumstances or to recognise 
that circumstances have 
occurred which were beyond 
the direct responsibility of the 
executive and the executive 
has managed and mitigated 
the impact of any loss.
The annual bonus will be 
measured against a range of 
key Group financial measures.
The current intention is that 
none of the bonus will be subject 
to non-financial measures or 
personal performance measures. 
The Committee, however, retains 
the discretion to introduce such 
measures in the future, up to 
a maximum of 20% of the bonus. 
Were the Committee to introduce 
such measures, it would normally 
consult with the Company’s 
largest institutional 
shareholders.
The stretch targets, when met, 
reward exceptional achievement 
and contribution. There is no 
bonus payout if threshold 
targets are not met.

committed to the Group’s 
affairs and appropriate 
market comparisons.
With the exception of 
benefits-in-kind arising from 
the performance of duties, 
no other benefits are provided, 
other than to the Chairman, 
who receives a car allowance 
of £25,000 per annum.
As for the Executive Directors, 
there is no prescribed maximum 
annual increase. The Committee 
is guided by the general increase 
for the employee population 
but on occasions may need to 
recognise other factors including, 
but not limited to, change in 
responsibility and/or variance to 
market levels of remuneration.

CHANGES TO THE POLICY TABLE
There have been no changes to the policy.
SELECTION OF PERFORMANCE METRICS
The annual bonus is based on performance against a mix of financial measures. The mix of financial measures is aligned to the Group’s 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and is reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they remain appropriate 
to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead. The targets are set for each KPI to encourage continuous improvement 
and challenge the delivery of stretch performance.
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 84
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION REPORT
continued The LTIP is based on EPS growth and TSR performance. EPS is a measure of the Group’s overall financial success and TSR provides 
an external assessment of the Company’s performance against the market. It also aligns the rewards received by executives with the 
returns received by shareholders. A sliding scale of challenging performance targets is set for each measure. The Committee reviews 
the choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance targets prior to each LTIP grant. The Committee 
reserves the discretion to set different targets for future awards, without consulting with shareholders. The targets for awards 
granted under this Remuneration Policy are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
When setting the targets for the annual bonus and the LTIP , the Remuneration Committee takes into account a range of factors, 
including the business plan, prior year performance, market conditions and consensus forecasts.

APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT AND PROMOTIONS
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director – base salary, benefits, pension, annual bonus and long-term incentive awards – 
would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s prevailing approved Remuneration Policy at the time of appointment. 
The Committee may set the base salary at a value to reflect the calibre, experience and earnings potential of a candidate, subject 
to the Committee’s judgement that the level of remuneration is in the Company’s best interest. The maximum level of variable pay 
(annual bonus and long-term incentive awards) which may be awarded to a new Executive Director at or shortly following recruitment 
shall be limited to 450% of salary. These limits exclude buyout awards and are in line with the ‘Remuneration Policy for Directors’ 
set out previously.
The Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving 
the former employer when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company (and therefore shareholders) (‘buyouts’). 
Any such awards would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to the remuneration it is intended 
to replace. Where appropriate, the Committee retains the flexibility to utilise Listing Rule 9.4.2 for the purpose of making an award 
to ‘buy out’ remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses and 
continuing allowances as appropriate. Additionally, in the case of any Executive Director being recruited from overseas, or being 
recruited by the Company to relocate overseas to perform their duties, the Committee may offer expatriate benefits on an ongoing 
basis subject to their aggregate value to the individual not exceeding 50% of salary per annum.
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 85
DIRECTORS’ REPORT For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable 
pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed 
to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take 
into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment 
may continue.
If a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director is appointed, 
remuneration arrangements will be in line with those detailed in 
the Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors set out 
in the ‘Remuneration Policy for Directors’ above.
SERVICE CONTRACTS FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The service agreements of the Executive Directors are not 
fixed-term and are terminable by either the Company or the 
Director on 12 months’ notice and make provision, at the Board’s 
discretion, for early termination by way of payment of salary and 
pension contributions in lieu of 12 months’ notice. In calculating 
the amount payable to a Director on termination of employment, 
the Board would take into account the commercial interests 
of the Company and apply usual common law and contractual 
principles. Any payments in lieu of notice may be paid in a lump 
sum or may be paid in instalments and reduce if the Director finds 
alternative employment. The service contracts are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office. The Committee 
reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to 
ensure these reflect best practice. In summary, the contractual 
provisions are:
PROVISION DETAILED TERMS
Notice period 12 months
Common law and 
contractual principles
Common law and contractual 
principles apply
Remuneration entitlements A bonus may be payable 
(pro-rata where relevant) 
and outstanding Share 
Awards may vest (see below).
Change of control No Executive Director’s 
contract contains provisions 
or additional payments in 
respect of change of control. 
The treatment of bonus 
awards and outstanding Share 
Awards will be treated in line 
with the relevant plan rules.
The annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period 
of the financial year served. Any share-based entitlements 
granted to an Executive Director under the Company’s share 
plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the 2011 LTIP is that any 
outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, 
ill-health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at 
the discretion of the Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may 
be applied.
For good leavers, awards will normally vest on the original 
vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant 
performance conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to 
reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. 
However, the Committee has discretion to determine that awards 
vest at an earlier date and/or to disapply time pro-rating, although 
it is envisaged that this would only be applied in exceptional 
circumstances. Any such incidents, where discretion is applied 
by the Committee in relation to Executive Directors, will be 
disclosed in the following Annual Report on Remuneration.
The default treatment for deferred bonus awards is that 
any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances (as described 
under the 2011 LTIP above), awards will vest in full on the 
original vesting date, unless (as permitted under the plan rules) 
the Committee determines that awards should vest at an 
earlier date.
In determining whether an Executive should be treated as a 
good leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the 
reasons for their departure.
LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The letter of appointment for each Non-Executive Director 
states that they are appointed for an initial period of three years 
and all appointments are terminable by one month’s notice on 
either side. At the end of the initial period and after rigorous 
review the appointment may be renewed for a further period, 
usually three years, if the Company and the Director agree 
and subject to annual re-election at the AGM. Each letter of 
appointment states that if the Company were to terminate 
the appointment, the Director would not be entitled to any 
compensation for loss of office.
The table below sets out the terms for all the current  
Non-Executive Directors of the Board.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION REPORT
continued CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS 
ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY
When setting the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, 
the Remuneration Committee takes into account the pay and 
employment conditions elsewhere within the Group. When 
considering the remuneration arrangements for the Executive 
Directors for the year ahead, the Committee is informed of 
salary increases across the wider group. The Committee also 
approves the overall reward strategy in operation across 
the Group.
The remuneration strategy set out at the beginning of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy report reflects the strategy 
in place across all employees across the Group. Although this 
remuneration strategy applies across the Group, given the size 
of the Group and the geographical spread of its operations, 
the way in which the Remuneration Policy is implemented 
varies across the Group. For example, bonus deferral applies 
at the more senior levels within the Group and participation 
in the LTIP is at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion 
and is typically limited to senior executives employed within 
the Group.
Given the geographical spread of the Group’s operations, 
the Remuneration Committee does not consider it appropriate 
to consult employees on the Remuneration Policy in operation 
for Executive Directors.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Committee takes the views of the Group’s shareholders 
very seriously. The policy that was approved by shareholders 
at the 2016 AGM reflects the extensive discussions with 
shareholders during the consultation process.
LEGACY ARRANGEMENTS
For avoidance of doubt, through this approved Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy Report, authority is given to the Company 
to honour any commitments entered into with current or 
former Directors (such as the vesting of past share awards) 
that were agreed:
(i)  Before the policy set out above, or any previous policy, 
came into effect;
(ii)  At a time when a previous policy approved by shareholders 
was in place provided that the payment is in line with the 
terms of that policy; and
(iii)  At a time when the relevant individual was not a Director 
of the Company and the payment was not in consideration 
for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND MEETING ATTENDANCE
The membership of the Committee at the year end was Gill Rider 
(Committee Chair), Graham Allan, Dame Louise Makin, and Andrew 
Martin. Michael Wareing was a member until 30 September 2017 . 
With effect from 1 January 2018, Dame Louise Makin stepped 
down and Gurnek Bains was appointed to the Committee. 
Meeting attendance is shown on page 65.
Throughout the year, the composition of the Committee was 
in compliance with the Code. All members are independent 
Non-Executive Directors. 
On appointment, new Committee members receive an 
appropriate induction consisting of the review of the terms 
of reference, previous Committee meeting papers, meetings 
with senior personnel and advisors and, as appropriate, 
meetings with shareholders.
The Committee invites the Chairman, CEO and the EVP , Human 
Resources to attend meetings when it deems appropriate, 
except when their own remuneration is discussed. No Director 
is involved in determining his or her own remuneration. None of 
the Committee members has had any personal financial interest, 
except as shareholders, in the matters decided. The Group 
Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
THE ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
On behalf of the Board, the Committee:
• Determines the Company’s policy on the remuneration of the 
Chairman, the Executive Directors and other senior executives;
• Determines the remuneration packages of the above, 
including any compensation on termination of office;
• Reviews the remuneration arrangements for the wider 
employee population and considers issues relating to 
remuneration that may have a significant impact on the Group;
• Provides advice to, and consults with, the CEO on major policy 
issues affecting the remuneration of other executives; and
• Keeps the Remuneration Policy under review in light of 
regulatory and best practice developments and shareholder 
expectations. Due regard is given to the interests of 
shareholders and the requirements of the Listing Rules 
and associated guidance.

ADVISORS
To ensure that the Group’s remuneration practices drive and 
support achievement of strategies and are market competitive, 
the Committee obtains advice from various independent sources.
In 2017 , the Committee received advice from Deloitte LLP 
(‘Deloitte’), who they appointed in 2015 for their particular 
expertise both at a local and global level, due to the worldwide 
operations of the Group and, following review, the Committee 
remains satisfied that their advice is objective and independent. 
Deloitte provided no other services to the Committee during 
the year under review.
Deloitte are members of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and adhere to the Voluntary Code of Conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
The fees paid to Deloitte in the year were £55,107 . The charges 
for services are calculated on the basis of time spent and the 
seniority of the personnel performing the work at their 
respective rates.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
The Company recognises that, during their employment 
with the Company, Executive Directors may be invited to 
become Non-Executive Directors of other companies and 
that such duties can broaden their experience and knowledge. 
Executive Directors may, with the written consent of the 
Company, accept such appointments outside the Company, 
and the policy is that any fees may be retained by the Director.

1. Benefits include allowances in lieu of company car, annual medicals, life assurance and private medical insurance, and the use of a car and driver for the CEO (£51,890). 
Taxable benefits for 2016 have been restated to include benefits received in that year for which the amount was not known at the time. With respect to the Non-
Executive Directors, other than Sir David Reid who receives a car allowance of £25,000 per annum, no other benefits are provided. 
2. Certain expenses relating to the performance of a Director’s duties (not included in the Benefits column above) such as travel to and from Company meetings and 
related accommodation have now been classified as taxable. In such cases, the Company will ensure that the Director is not out of pocket by settling the related 
tax via the PSA. In line with current regulations, these taxable benefits have been disclosed and are shown in the BIK arising from performance of duties column. 
The figures shown are the cost of the taxable benefit.
3. This relates to the payment of the annual bonus and Deferred Bonus Share Award for the financial year end. Further details of this payment are set out on the 
following pages.
4. As reported in previous years, at the time of joining, the Company had bought out André’s existing share awards with his previous employer in two tranches of 91,575 
and 91,574 shares vesting in 2016 and 2017 each at an award price of £28. The tranche that vested in 2017 vested at a share price of £42.95 which represents an 
increase in our Company share price over the two years of over 53%. These awards were one-off awards and are not part of his ongoing remuneration.
5. This relates to the vesting of the 2015 LTIP award. The value shown is based on the share price of £52.01 which was the average share price in the fourth quarter 
of 2017 .
6. The pension contributions for Edward Leigh include the sum of £nil (2016: £17 ,140) which was paid into the Intertek Group Personal Pension Plan, which is a defined 
contribution scheme.
7 . This figure has been updated to show the actual value of the vested LTIP share awards based on the share price of £38.43 on the date of vesting, as the 2016 Report 
included figures based on the share price for the final quarter of 2016 (£33.71). The awards were granted on 10 March 2014 prior to Edward Leigh’s appointment as 
CFO on 1 October 2014.
8. Graham Allan’s fees relate to the period from 1 October 2017 , the date he was appointed to the Board.
9. Gurnek Bains’ fees relate to the period from 1 July 2017 , the date he was appointed to the Board.
10. Alan Brown’s fees relate to the period to 24 May 2017 , the date he stepped down from the Board. 
11. Jean-Michel Valette’s fees relate to the period from 1 July 2017 , the date he was appointed to the Board.
12. Michael Wareing’s fees relate to the period to 30 September 2017 , the date he stepped down from the Board.

The Committee has the discretion to adjust the final bonus outcome downwards if it considers short-term performance has been 
achieved at the expense of long-term future success. Deferred Shares are subject to continued employment for the three-year vesting 
period. The Committee may also adjust the final bonus outcome upwards to recognise exceptional circumstances that were beyond the 
direct responsibility of the Executive Director and the Executive has managed and mitigated the impact of any loss. The Committee 
considered the results and did not exercise any discretion in respect of the above bonus outturn as it felt that the payouts were 
reflective of the underlying performance of the Group. Both the cash and share elements of the bonus are subject to malus and 
clawback. Overpayments may be reclaimed in the event of performance achievements being found to be significantly misstated.

conduct which resulted in (a) significant loss(es) to the Company, failure to meet appropriate standards of fitness and propriety; 
a material failure of management in the Company, a discovery of a material misstatement in the audited consolidated accounts or

during the clawback period which is six years from the date of the award unless extended by the Remuneration Committee prior 
to the expiry of the initial clawback period.
The Committee has the discretion to reduce bonus payments if it believes that short-term performance has been achieved at 
the expense of the Group’s long-term future or vice versa. The Committee also retains the discretion to reduce or reclaim payments 
if the performance achievements are subsequently found to have been significantly misstated.

REMUNERATION DECISIONS TAKEN IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2018
Base salary
Following a review of base salaries, the Remuneration Committee approved a salary increase of 2.0% for the CEO. This is in line with 
the increase provided to UK employees in the Group.
As set out in further detail in the letter from the Remuneration Committee Chair, following consultations with the majority of our 
shareholders, the Remuneration Committee approved a 14.1% increase for the CFO from 1 January 2018. This increase was made to 
recognise his performance in role, the addition of the global IT function to his role, as well as the market benchmarks for his role.
The Executive Directors’ salaries are:

Annual Bonus and LTIP awards to be granted in 2018
For 2018, the annual bonus opportunity expressed as a percentage of base salary will be 200% for the CEO and CFO. The Committee 
has determined that for 2018 the basis for calculating the Annual Bonus will be unchanged from the previous year – 80% will be based 
on a matrix based on revenue and adjusted operating profit growth, and 20% will be based on ROIC.
Annual Bonus will continue to be subject to a quality of earnings review at the end of the year to ensure that payouts are appropriate 
based on the underlying performance of the Group and to ensure that any awards are commensurate with the Group’s culture and values.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items 
which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. In accordance with good governance, the Committee is however committed to 
providing insightful and transparent disclosure to our shareholders. In this regard, and in line with the Investment Association’s position 
regarding bonus target disclosure, the Committee will disclose the performance targets for the annual incentive in the following year.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
continued In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
(‘Act’) and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (‘DTR’) 
of the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’), the following section 
describes the matters that are required for inclusion in the Directors’ 
report and were approved by the Board. Further details of matters 
required to be included in the Directors’ report that are incorporated 
by reference into this report are set out below.
DIRECTORS
The names of the members of the Board, as at the date of this 
report, and their biographical details are set out on pages 68 to 69.
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
The Company’s Articles of Association contain provisions 
relating to the retirement, election and re-election of Directors 
but, in accordance with best practice, all Directors who wish to 
continue to serve will stand for election or re-election at the 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’).
The Articles of Association set out the internal regulation of the 
Company and cover such matters as the rights of shareholders, 
the appointment or removal of Directors and the conduct of the 
Board and general meetings. Copies are available upon request 
from the Group Company Secretary and are available at the 
Company’s AGM. Further powers are granted by members in 
general meeting and those currently in place are set out in 
detail in the appropriate section of this report. 
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Group to 
attract and retain the services of the most able and experienced 
Directors by offering competitive terms of engagement, including 
the granting of indemnities on terms consistent with the 
applicable statutory provisions. In accordance with the Articles of 
Association, the Company has executed deed polls of indemnity 
for the benefit of Directors of the Company. 
These provisions which are deemed to be qualifying third-party 
indemnity provisions (as defined by section 234 of the Act), were 
in force during the financial year ended 31 December 2017 , for 
the benefit of the Directors and, at the date of this report, remain 
in force in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may 
incur (or have incurred) in connection with their duties, powers 
or office.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS
Other than the Directors’ service agreements or letters of 
appointment, none of the Directors of the Company had a personal 
interest in any business transactions of the Company or its 
subsidiaries. The terms of the Directors’ service agreements or 
letters of appointment and the Directors’ interests in shares and 
share awards of the Company, in respect of which transactions 
are notifiable to the Company under Rule 3 of the DTR of the 
FCA, are disclosed in the Remuneration report on pages 81 to 96.
DIRECTORS’ POWERS
The Directors are responsible for the strategic management of 
the Company and their powers to do so are determined by the 
provisions of the Act and the Company’s Articles of Association.
DIVIDEND
The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 47 .8p per 
ordinary share (2016: 43.0p) making a full year dividend of 71.3p 
per ordinary share (2016: 62.4p) which will, if approved at the 
AGM, be paid on 6 June 2018 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 18 May 2018.
SHARE CAPITAL
The issued share capital of the Company and the details of the 
movements in the Company’s share capital during the year are 
shown in note 15 to the financial statements. 
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends 
when declared, to receive the Company’s Annual Report and 
Accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings of the 
Company, to appoint proxies and exercise voting rights. A waiver 
of dividend exists in respect of 541,211 shares held by the 
Intertek Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘Trust’) as at 
31 December 2017 . Details of the shares purchased by the 
Trust during the year are outlined within note 15 to the financial 
statements. There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary 
shares in the Company. 
The rights attached to shares in the Company are provided by 
the Articles of Association, which may be amended or replaced 
by means of a special resolution of the Company in a general 
meeting. The Directors’ powers are conferred on them by UK 
legislation and by the Company’s Articles of Association. 
No ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard to control 
of the Company and there are no restrictions on voting rights 
except that a shareholder has no right to vote in respect of a 
share unless all sums due in respect of that share are fully paid. 
There are no arrangements known to the Company by which 
financial rights carried by any shares in the Company are held by a 
person other than the holder of the shares, nor are there any 
arrangements between holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights 
known to the Company. All issued shares are fully paid. 
Shares are admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange 
and may be traded through the CREST system.
ALLOTMENT OF SHARES
At the AGM held in 2017 , the shareholders generally and 
unconditionally authorised the Directors to allot relevant securities 
up to approximately two-thirds of the nominal amount of issued 
share capital.
It is the Directors’ intention to seek renewal of this authority 
in line with guidance issued by the Investment Association. 
The resolution will be set out in the Notice. 
At the AGM in 2017 the Directors were also empowered by 
the shareholders to allot equity securities, up to 5% of the 
Company’s issued share capital, for cash under section 570 
of the Act. It is intended that this authority be renewed at 
the forthcoming AGM. 
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 99
DIRECTORS’ REPORT OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION It is the Board’s intention, in line with guidance issued by the 
Pre-Emption Group, to also propose the renewal of the additional 
special resolution to allow the Company to allot equity securities 
up to a further 5% of the Company’s issued share capital. This is 
applicable when the Board determines a transaction to be an 
acquisition or other capital investment, as defined by the 
Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles. In the event that 
this additional 5% disapplication of pre-emption right is used, the 
Company will outline the reason for its use and the consultation 
process undertaken within six months of the date that it is used.
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES
Shareholders also approved the authority for the Company 
to buy back up to 10% of its own ordinary shares by market 
purchase until the conclusion of the AGM to be held this year. 
The Directors will seek to renew this authority for up to 10% of 
the Company’s issued share capital at the forthcoming AGM. This 
power will only be exercised if the Directors are satisfied that any 
purchase will increase the earnings per share of the ordinary 
share capital in issue after the purchase and accordingly, that the 
purchase is in the interests of shareholders. The Directors will 
also give careful consideration to gearing levels of the Company 
and its general financial position. Any shares purchased in this 
way may be held in treasury which, the Directors believe, will 
provide the Company with flexibility in the management of its 
share capital. Where treasury shares are used to satisfy Share 
Awards, they will be classed as new issue shares for the purpose 
of the 10% limit on the number of shares that may be issued over 
a 10-year period under the relevant share plan rules.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS – CHANGE OF CONTROL
The Company is not a party to significant agreements which 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following 
a takeover bid apart from a number of credit facilities with banks 
together with certain senior notes issued by the Company. The 
total amount owing under such credit facilities and senior note 
agreements as at 31 December 2017 is shown in note 14 to the 
financial statements. These agreements contain clauses such 
that, in the event of a change of control, the Company can offer 
to or must repay all such borrowings together with accrued 
interest, fees and other sums owing as required by the 
individual agreements. 
The rules of the Company’s incentive plans contain clauses 
relating to a change of control resulting from a takeover and in 
such an event awards would vest subject to the satisfaction of 
any associated performance criteria.

publication of this report, the following disclosures of major 
holdings of voting rights have been made (and have not been 
amended or withdrawn) to the Company pursuant to the

any political party.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 
101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company 
and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Parent Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
Parent Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ report, 
Directors’ Remuneration report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS 
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT
Each of the Directors, whose name and functions are listed on 
pages 68 and 69, confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group and Parent Company financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Company’s 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.
The Directors’ report comprising pages 62 to 102 and the Group 
Strategic report comprising pages 2 to 61 have been approved by 
the Board and signed on its behalf by:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED PRIMARY STATEMENTS
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 1 Significant accounting policies
BASIS OF PREPARATION
Accounting policies applicable to more than one section of the financial statements are shown below. Where accounting policies relate 
to a specific note in the financial statements, they are set out within that note, to provide readers of the financial statements with a 
more useful layout to the financial information presented.
Statement of compliance
Intertek Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Group financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the Group) and include the Group’s interest in associates. The Group financial statements have been prepared 
and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRSs). The Parent 
Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. The Company has 
elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 152 to 156.
IFRSs announced but not yet effective
The following IFRSs have been announced, but are not yet effective, in the preparation of these financial statements. Their adoption is 
not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. Certain of these standards and 
interpretations will, when adopted require addition to, or amendment of, disclosures in the accounts, and are currently still under review.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018) – management has completed its analysis of this standard, and identified the 
following areas of note, though its adoption is not expected to have a material impact. The Group intends to apply the limited 
exemption in IFRS 9, and will elect not to restate comparative information in the year of initial adoption. As a result, the comparative 
information provided will, continue to be accounted for in accordance with the Group’s previous accounting policy.
• Classification and measurement of financial assets – the Group’s financial assets comprise trade receivables, accrued income 
and cash and cash equivalents. The disclosures relating to both trade receivables, accrued income and cash and cash equivalents 
continue to be applicable and will not be affected by the adoption of IFRS 9. There are no changes to the measurement of 
financial assets.
• Impairment of financial assets, by introducing a forward-looking expected loss impairment model – the Group’s primary 
types of financial assets subject to IFRS 9’s new expected credit loss model are trade receivables and accrued income. For trade 
receivables and accrued income, the Group is expecting to apply the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires the 
use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all receivables. There is no material change expected to the impairment provision 
of receivables.
• Hedge accounting – the Group intends to continue to apply its current IAS 39 accounting and will provide the additional IFRS 7 
disclosures required for taking that option.
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers (effective 1 January 2018) – management has completed its analysis of this standard 
and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the timing of revenue recognition based on the Group’s current revenue 
streams. Specifically, the Group’s revenue streams are two-fold:
• Revenue from services rendered on short-term projects is generally recognised in the income statement when the relevant service 
is completed, usually when the report of findings or test/inspection certificate is issued. The adoption of IFRS 15 has no material 
impact on the recognition of such revenue.
• On long-term projects the Group records transactions as revenue on the basis of value of work done, with the corresponding 
amount being included in trade receivables if the customer has been invoiced, or in accrued income if billing has yet to be completed. 
Long-term projects consist of two main types:
 – time incurred is billed at agreed rates on a periodic basis, such as monthly – the current recognition approach is based on 
timesheets evidencing work done – this is consistent with the “over time” recognition criteria under IFRS 15 using those 
timesheets as the input basis; or
 – staged payment invoicing occurs, requiring an assessment of percentage completion, based on services provided and revenue 
accrued accordingly – assessment of percentage completion will continue in the same way – this is in line with the “over time” 
recognition under IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019) – IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments 
and a right-of-use asset for lease contracts, subject to limited exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. 
Management intends to apply the modified retrospective method of transition and will continue to determine the most appropriate 
treatment under that method on a lease-by-lease basis.
The quantitative impact of IFRS 16 on the Group’s net assets and results is in the process of being assessed, and management has 
collated its initial data set to determine the impact on the Group. IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the balance sheet as both 
assets and liabilities will increase, and a material impact on key components within the income statement, as operating lease rental 
charges will be replaced by depreciation and finance costs. Please refer to Note 8 to the financial statements which gives an indication 
of the Group's total operating lease commitments. IFRS 16 will not have any impact on the underlying commercial performance of the 
Group, nor the cash flows generated in the year.

Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except as discussed in the relevant accounting policies.
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency. All information 
presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies set out in these financial statements have been applied consistently to all years presented. A number of 
new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 , 
but do not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Going concern
The Board has reviewed forecasts, including forecasts adjusted for significantly worse economic conditions. The Board has also 
reviewed the Group’s funding requirements and the available debt facilities. As a result of these reviews the Board remains satisfied 
with the Group’s funding and liquidity position and believes that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. 
In addition, on the basis of its forecasts, both base case and stressed, and available facilities, which are described in note 14, the Board 
has concluded that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has power to direct the relevant activities, 
exposure to variable returns from the investee and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of investor 
returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases.
For purchases of non-controlling interest in subsidiaries, the difference between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary 
and the non-controlling interest’s share of the assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position at 
the date of acquisition, is reflected directly in shareholders’ equity.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way 
as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities (for example cash, trade receivables, trade payables) denominated 
in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences 
arising on translation are generally recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. For the policy on hedging 
of foreign currency transactions see note 14.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated 
to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at cumulative average rates of exchange during the year. 
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations are taken directly to equity in the translation reserve. They are 
released to the income statement upon disposal. For the policy on net investment hedging see note 14.

USE OF JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect 
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
During the year, management reassessed its critical estimates and judgements and resolved that the following disclosure was 
no longer considered critical, as management does not expect there to be a significant risk of material change to the carrying value 
of those liabilities within the next year.
Put option over non-controlling interest
The calculation of the fair value of put options over the non-controlling interest in the Group’s businesses in the relevant countries 
required the use of judgement in the application of key assumptions around the future performance of those businesses; the risk-
adjusted discount rate taking into account the risk-free rate and the gross domestic product growth in those countries.
JUDGEMENTS
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact 
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Income and deferred tax
The tax on profits is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations. Where the effect of these laws and regulations is 
unclear, judgements are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised, with consideration 
given to the timing and level of future taxable income. The main areas of judgement in the Group tax calculation are re-assessment 
of the uncertain tax provisions for the full year and re-assessment of the recognition and recoverability of the UK deferred tax asset 
– see note 6.
Basis of consolidation
Judgement is applied when determining if the Group ‘controls’ a subsidiary. In assessing control, the Group considers whether it has the 
power to direct the relevant activities, whether it has exposure to variable returns from the investee and whether it has power over 
the investee to affect the amount of investor returns. Our original assessments are subsequently revisited on a rolling basis – see ‘Basis 
of Consolidation’ policy.
Intangible assets
When the Group makes an acquisition, e.g. KJ Tech Services GmbH and Acumen Security LLC in 2017 , management determines initially 
whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill, and the provisional amounts at which to recognise those 
assets. During the first 12 months of ownership, intangible assets are reviewed to determine whether any additional information 
exists that supports amendments to that original assessment, including new intangible assets. Management has performed this 
subsequent review for FIT Italia SRL, EWA-Canada, Ltd and Laboratorios ABC Quimica, Investigación y Análisis, S.A. de C.V during the 
current year – see note 9.
Restructuring
In making a provision and classifying costs as restructuring, management has used its judgement to assess the specific circumstances 
of each local and regional restructuring proposal as to whether it meets the Group definition of this SDI, including an estimate of future 
costs and the timing of completion – see note 3.
Claims
In making provision for claims, management has used its judgement to assess the circumstances relating to each specific event, 
internal and external legal advice, knowledge of the industries and markets, prevailing commercial terms and legal precedents – 
see note 13.
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 111
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Significant accounting policies (continued)
ESTIMATES
Discussed below are key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that could 
have a risk of causing a significant material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Impairment of goodwill
Following recognition of goodwill as a result of acquisitions, the Group determines, as a minimum on an annual basis, whether goodwill 
is impaired, which requires an estimation of the future cash flows of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated, 
as well as assumptions on long-term growth rates and discount rates – see note 9.
Contingent consideration
When the Group acquires businesses, the total consideration may consist of an amount paid on completion plus further amounts 
payable on agreed post completion dates. These further amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed 
performance targets. At the date of acquisition and at subsequent reporting periods, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts 
for the acquired business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due. Further details and sensitivity 
analysis are included in note 10.
Employee post-retirement benefit obligations
For material defined benefit plans, the actuarial valuation includes assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary 
progression and mortality rates. Further details and sensitivity analysis are included in note 16.
Recoverability of trade receivables
Trade receivables are reflected, net of an estimated provision for impairment losses. This provision considers the past payment 
history and the length of time that the debts have remained unpaid. Further details are included in note 11.

ACCOUNTING POLICY
Revenue
Revenue represents the total amount receivable for services rendered, excluding sales-related taxes and intra-group transactions.
Revenue from services rendered on short-term projects is generally recognised in the income statement when the relevant service 
is completed, usually when the report of findings is issued.
On long-term projects the Group records transactions as sales on the basis of value of work done, with the corresponding amount 
being included in trade receivables if the customer has been invoiced or in accrued income if billing has yet to be completed.  
Long-term projects consist of two main types: (a) time incurred is billed at agreed rates on a periodic basis, such as monthly; or 
(b) staged payment invoicing occurs, requiring an assessment of percentage completion, based on services provided and revenue 
accrued accordingly.
Expenses are recharged to clients where permitted by the contract. Payments received in advance from customers are recognised 
in deferred income where services have not yet been rendered.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Group is organised into business lines, which are the Group’s operating segments and are reported to the CEO, the chief operating 
decision maker. 
These operating segments are aggregated into three divisions, which are the Group’s reportable segments, based on similar nature 
of products and services and mid- to long-term structural growth drivers. The costs of the corporate head office and other costs 
which are not controlled by the three divisions are allocated appropriately.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. There is no significant seasonality in the Group’s operations.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
The performance of the segments is assessed based on adjusted operating profit which is stated before Separately Disclosed Items. 
A reconciliation to operating profit by division and Group profit for the year is included overleaf.
The principal activities of the divisions, and the customers they serve, are as follows:
Products – Our Products division consists of business lines that are focused on ensuring the quality and safety of physical 
components and products, as well as minimising risk through assessing the operating process and quality management systems of 
our customers.
As a trusted partner to the world’s leading retailers, manufacturers and distributors, our Products business lines support a wide range 
of industries including textiles, footwear, toys, hardlines, home appliances, consumer electronics, information and communication 
technology, automotive, aerospace, lighting, building products, industrial and renewable energy products, food and hospitality, 
healthcare and beauty, and pharmaceuticals. 
Across these industries we provide a wide range of ATIC services including laboratory safety, quality and performance testing, 
second-party supplier auditing, sustainability analysis, products assurance, vendor compliance, process performance analysis, 
facility plant & equipment verification and third party certification.
Trade – Our Trade division consists of three Global business lines with differing services and customers, but similar mid- to long-term 
structural growth drivers:
Our Cargo & Analytical Assessment ('Cargo/AA') business provides cargo inspection, analytical assessment, calibration and related 
research and technical services to the world’s petroleum and biofuels industries.
Our Government & Trade Services ('GTS') business provides inspection services to governments and regulatory bodies to support 
trade activities that help the flow of goods across borders, predominantly in the Middle East, Africa and South America.
Our AgriWorld business provides analytical and testing services to global agricultural trading companies and growers.
Resources – Our Resources division consists of two business lines with differing services and customers:
Our Industry Services business uses in-depth knowledge of the oil, gas, nuclear and power industries to provide a diverse range 
of Total Quality Assurance solutions to optimise the use of customers' assets and minimise the risk in their supply chains. Some 
of our key services include technical inspection, asset integrity management, analytical testing and ongoing training services.
Our Minerals business provides a broad range of ATIC service solutions to the mining and minerals exploration industries, 
covering the resource supply chain from exploration and resource development, through to production, shipping and 
commercial settlement.

ACCOUNTING POLICY
Adjusted results
In order to present the performance of the Group in a clear, consistent and comparable format, certain items are disclosed separately 
on the face of the income statement. Separately Disclosed Items are items which by their nature or size, in the opinion of the Directors, 
should be excluded from the adjusted result to provide readers with a clear and consistent view of the business performance of the 
Group and its operating divisions.
When applicable, these items include amortisation of acquisition intangibles; impairment of goodwill and other assets; the profit 
or loss on disposals of businesses or other significant fixed assets; costs of acquiring and integrating acquisitions; the cost of any 
fundamental restructuring; material claims and settlements; significant recycling of amounts from equity to the income statement; 
and unrealised market or fair value gains or losses on financial assets or liabilities, including contingent consideration.
Adjusted operating profit excludes the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, as we do not 
believe that the amortisation charge in the Income Statement provides useful information about the cash costs of running our 
business as these assets will be supported and maintained by the ongoing marketing and promotional expenditure, which is already 
reflected in operating costs. Amortisation of software, however, is included in adjusted operating profit as it is similar in nature to other 
capital expenditure. The costs of any restructuring are excluded from adjusted operating profit where they represent fundamental 
changes in individual operations around the Group identified as part of the Group's strategy that are not expected to recur in those 
operations. The impairment of goodwill and other assets that by their nature or size are not expected to recur; the profit and loss on 
disposals of businesses or other significant assets; and the costs associated with successful, active or aborted acquisitions are 
excluded from adjusted operating profit to provide useful information regarding the underlying performance of the Group’s operations.

ACCOUNTING POLICY
Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the same primary statement as the accounting 
transaction to which it relates.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due. 
Amounts are accrued based on management’s interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement. Where the outcome 
of discussions with tax authorities is different from the amount initially recorded, this difference will impact the tax provisions in the 
period the determination is made.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for:
• recognition of consolidated goodwill;
• the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit; and
• differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interest in joint ventures, the reversal of which is under 
the control of the Group and where it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, for the periods when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on 
different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will 
be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset 
to be utilised.
Any additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the 
related dividend.
TAX EXPENSE
The Group operates across many different tax jurisdictions. Income and profits are earned and taxed in the individual countries in 
which they occur.
The income tax expense for the profit before tax for the 12 months ended 31 December 2017 is £86.9m (2016: £75.5m). The Group’s 
consolidated effective tax rate for the 12 months ended 31 December 2017 is 22.1% (2016: 21.8%).
The income tax expense for the adjusted profit before tax for the 12 months ended 31 December 2017 is £107 .5m (2016: £98.0m).  
The Group’s adjusted consolidated effective tax rate for the 12 months ended 31 December 2017 is 24.5% (2016: 25.3%).
Differences between the consolidated effective tax rate of 22.1% and notional statutory UK rate of 19.25% include, but are not limited 
to: the mix of profits; the effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions; non-deductible expenses; the effect of utilised tax losses; and 
under/over provisions in previous periods.
The Group receives tax incentives in certain jurisdictions, resulting in a lower tax charge to the income statement. Without these 
incentives the adjusted effective tax rate would be 27 .0% (2016: 28.0%). The Group’s tax rate is affected by its financing arrangements 
that are in place to fund business operations in overseas territories. There is no guarantee that these reduced rates will continue to be 
applicable in future years (see note 22).
The new US tax legislation is complex and wide-ranging. Whilst we anticipate that there will be no material effect on the Group’s 
adjusted effective tax rate for the year 31 December 2018 and subsequent years, the impact of the legislation has been estimated at 
31 December 2017 and may be further refined prior to 31 December 2018 and subsequent years. For the year 31 December 2017 , we 
have a one-off benefit on the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangibles and other assets for the change in 
the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. Without this benefit, the adjusted effective tax rate would be 25.5% and the consolidated 
effective tax rate would be 25.3%.

UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

differences, and to calculate the potential deferred tax asset it is necessary to multiply these by the tax rates in each case:

Provisions and other temporary differences 12.3 15.0
Tax losses 65.9 77.8
Total 141.8 187.9
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be 
available in certain jurisdictions against which the Group can utilise the benefits from them.
There is a temporary difference of £240.0m (2016: £296.2m) which relates to unremitted post-acquisition overseas earnings. 
No deferred tax is provided on this amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is 
no intention to either repatriate from, or sell, the associated subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.
7 Earnings per ordinary share
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. Potential ordinary 
shares shall be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share or 
increase loss per share from continuing operations.
In addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33 Earnings Per Share, an adjusted earnings per share has also been calculated and 
is based on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairment and other Separately 
Disclosed Items. It has been calculated to allow shareholders a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group. Details 
of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 8 Property, plant and equipment
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Leased assets
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Where land 
and buildings are held under finance leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. 
Leased assets acquired by way of finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value 
of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Other leases are operating leases
These leased assets are not recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position. 
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and 
equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the expected lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold buildings 50 years
Short leasehold buildings Term of lease 
Fixtures, fittings, plant and equipment 3 to 10 years
Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of assets are reassessed at each reporting date.
Impairment
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated to determine the level of any impairment.

9 Goodwill and other intangible assets
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (‘CGUs’) and is not 
amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010
From 1 January 2010, the Group has prospectively applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised 2008). Business combinations 
are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is obtained.
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) 
of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. 
Costs relating to acquisitions are shown in Separately Disclosed Items.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognised in profit 
or loss.
If at the reporting date the fair values of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be established 
provisionally, then these values are used. Adjustments to the fair values can be made within 12 months of the acquisition date and 
are taken as adjustments to goodwill.
Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009
For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition 
over the Group’s interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the acquiree. 
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection 
with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 and has not restated goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 
2004, the date of transition to IFRS. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised 
under the Group’s previous accounting framework.
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 123
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets (continued)
Other intangible assets
When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible 
assets should be recognised separately from goodwill. If, based on management’s judgement, such an asset is identified, then it is 
valued by discounting the probable future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life of the asset. 
Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation.
Intangible assets arising on acquisitions and computer software are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether 
those rights are separable, and which have finite useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives 
are as follows:
Computer software Up to 7 years
Customer relationships Up to 10 years 
Know-how 
Trade names
Up to 5 years
Up to 5 years 
Licences Contractual life 
Covenants not to compete Contractual life
Impairment
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position may be less than its recoverable amount.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of 
each asset or group of assets, i.e. cash generating unit, to which the goodwill relates. A CGU represents an asset grouping at the lowest 
level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks 
and uncertainties and if different estimates were used this could materially change the projected value of the cash flows. An impairment 
loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.

Impairment review
In order to determine whether impairments are required, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of each operating segment 
or CGU. The calculation is based on projecting future cash flows over a five-year period and using a terminal value to incorporate 
expectations of growth thereafter. A discount factor is applied to obtain a value in use which is the recoverable amount.
Key assumptions
The key assumptions include the rate of revenue and profit growth within each of the territories and business lines in which the Group 
operates. These are based on the Group’s approved budget and five-year Strategic Plan. The long-term growth rate is also key since it is 
used in the perpetuity calculations. Finally, the discount rate used to bring the cash flow back to a present value varies depending on 
the location of the operation and the nature of the operations. The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to long-term growth rates and discount rates. Long-term growth rates predict growth 
beyond the Group’s planning cycle, and range from 1.7% to 2.5% (2016: 1.7% to 2.5%). The discount rate for each CGU reflects the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specific to the CGU. Pre-tax discount rates ranged from 9.6% to 11.9% 
(2016: 9.5% to 12.4%).
Sensitivity analysis
None of the reasonable downside sensitivity scenarios on key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of each CGU to exceed 
its recoverable amount. The sensitivities modelled by management include:
(i)  Assuming revenues decline each year by 1% in 2019 to 2022 from the 2018 budgeted revenues, with margins increasing with 
base assumptions.
(ii) Assuming zero growth in operating profit margins in 2018 to 2022 with revenues increasing per base assumptions.
(iii) Assuming an increase in the discount rates used by 1%.
Management considers that the likelihood of any or all of the above scenarios occurring is low.

On 31 March 2017 , the Group acquired KJ Tech Services GmbH ("KJ Tech"), a leading provider of vehicle, component and fuel testing 
services based in Germany, for an estimated purchase price of £12.8m (£12.5m net of cash acquired), generating goodwill of £7 .6m.
On 8 December 2017 , the Group acquired Acumen Security LLC ("Acumen"), a leading provider of Security Certification solutions for 
products, headquartered in Maryland, USA, for an estimated purchase price of £25.7m (£23.9m net of cash acquired), generating 
goodwill of £23.4m.

Goodwill and intangible assets
The total goodwill arising on acquisitions made during 2017 was £31.0m. Goodwill in respect of 2016 acquisitions decreased by £2.9m. 
The goodwill arising represents the value of the assembled workforce and the benefits the Company expects to gain from increasing 
its presence in the relevant sectors in which the acquired businesses operate. The intangible assets of £6.0m primarily represent the 
value placed on customer relationships and the deferred tax thereon was £2.0m.
Consideration paid
The total cash consideration paid for the acquisitions in the year was £29.5m (2016: £35.5m), with further contingent consideration 
payable of £9.0m which is recognised in note 13. Cash consideration includes cash and debt acquired of £2.1m. The estimated purchase 
price net of cash and debt acquired was £36.4m.
Contribution of acquisitions to revenue and profits
In total acquisitions made during 2017 contributed revenues of £4.8m and a net profit after tax of £0.4m from their respective dates 
of acquisition to 31 December 2017 . The Group revenue and profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 would have been 
£2,775.6m and £308.5m respectively if all the acquisitions were assumed to have been made on 1 January 2017 .
Key assumptions
The key assumptions in deriving the contingent consideration to be recognised include the weighted probability of making a payout 
(assessed as being between 50% to 100%) and the discount rate used to bring the cash flow back to present values. The discount 
rates used for the calculation are aligned with the discount rates used for impairment purposes as set out in Note 9.
Sensitivity analysis
It is estimated that an increase of 1% in the discount rate used to calculate the contingent consideration would have decreased the 
financial liability by £0.3m, and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would have increased the financial liability by £0.3m. It has also been 
estimated that an increase of 10% in the probability used to calculate the contingent consideration would have increased the financial 
liability by £1.5m, whilst a decrease of 10% in the probability used would have decreased the financial liability by £1.7m.

ACQUISITIONS IN 2016
On 3 October 2016, the Group completed the acquisition of EWA-Canada, Ltd, a leading provider of cyber security and assurance 
services for products, equipment and networks across multiple industries, for an estimated purchase price of £25.1m (£25.0m net of 
cash acquired), generating goodwill of £18.8m. 
On 11 November 2016, the Group entered into an agreement with Laboratorios ABC Quimica, Investigación y Análisis, S.A. de C.V ('ABC') 
to form an environmental services Joint Venture in Mexico. ABC is a leading provider of water testing and analytical services. On 
8 January 2016, the Group acquired FIT Italia SRL, an Italian company specialising in providing assurance services to the retail and 
agricultural sectors through food quality and safety assessments. Cash consideration for these two ventures was £17 .9m (£17 .3m net

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11 T rade and other receivables
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered 
recoverable (amortised cost).
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected. Based on historical 
default rates, reflecting the track record of payments by the Group’s customers, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is 
necessary in respect of trade receivables which are less than six months outstanding, unless there are specific circumstances such as 
the bankruptcy of a customer which would render the trade receivable irrecoverable.
The Group provides for trade receivables over 12 months old that are considered likely to be irrecoverable, 25% of balances 6 to 12 
months old and specific provision for known doubtful debts regardless of age. Where recovery is in doubt, a provision is made against 
the specific trade receivable until such time as the Group believes the amount to be irrecoverable, after which the trade receivable is 
written off.

Prepayments and accrued income 120.9 118.9
Fixed assets held for resale – 0.1
Total trade and other receivables 641.7 651.8
Trade receivables are shown net of an allowance for impairment losses of £24.0m (2016: £23.9m) and are all expected to be recovered 
within 12 months. Impairment on trade receivables charged as part of operating costs was £8.8m (2016: £8.6m).
There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other receivables and their fair value, due to their short -term 
duration. There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of customers who 
are internationally dispersed.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was as follows:

Sensitivity analysis
The remaining unprovided amount of receivables is £14.4m for receivables between 6 and 12 months old and £10.7m for receivables 
over 12 months old. The total amount of these receivables was not impaired because, having given consideration to the nature of the 
receivables and their historical collection, recovery of the unprovided amount is expected in due course. 
There were no material individual impairments of trade receivables.

Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier. The carrying value of trade payables is considered 
approximate to fair value.
Put option over non-controlling interest
Put options held by non-controlling interests that arise on acquisition are recognised initially at the present value of the redemption 
amount. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The discount is unwound through 
SDIs as a finance charge.

those businesses; the risk-adjusted discount rate taking into account the risk-free rate and the gross domestic product growth in the 
countries of those underlying businesses.

The maximum contingent consideration, on a discounted basis, that could be paid in relation to acquisitions is £21.7m.
The Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The outcome of such litigation 
and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings. Based on information 
currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely 
to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The provision for claims of £14.0m (2016: £19.5m) represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identified claims 
from customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs. The timing of the cash outflow relating to the 
provisions is uncertain, but is likely to be within one year. Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note 22.
The other provision of £12.6m (2016: £14.5m) includes restructuring provisions. The timing of the cash outflow is uncertain, but 
is likely to be within one year.

1 4 Borrowings and financial instruments
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest expense on borrowings; facility fees; interest receivable on funds invested; net foreign exchange 
gains or losses; interest income and expense relating to pension assets and liabilities; unrealised market or fair value gains or losses on 
financial assets or liabilities, including contingent consideration; and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the 
income statement. Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue using the effective interest rate method.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables. Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost less impairment losses (including bad debt provision).
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
statement of cash flows. Net debt comprises borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Non-derivative financial liabilities
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at their amortised cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-
bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the 
income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
The fair value of put option liabilities over non-controlling interests is calculated using a present value calculation, incorporating observable 
and non-observable inputs. This valuation technique has been adopted as it most closely mirrors the contractual arrangement.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts, to hedge economically 
its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities. In accordance 
with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in 
profit or loss when incurred. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value at each period end is recognised immediately in the income 
statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance 
sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the 
difference between the quoted forward price and the exercise price of the contract.
Hedging
Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities
Where a derivative financial instrument is used economically to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset 
or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement in the 
same caption as the foreign exchange on the related item.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to 
be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. The Group has external borrowings denominated in foreign currencies which are used to hedge the net investment 
in its foreign operations.
Cash flow hedges 
Cash flow hedges comprise derivative financial instruments designated in a hedging relationship to manage interest rate risk to which 
the cash flows of certain assets and liabilities are exposed. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is 
designated and qualifies for hedge accounting is recognised in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the period in which 
the hedged item affects profit or loss. However, where a forecasted transaction results in a non-financial asset or liability, the 
accumulated fair value movements previously deferred in equity are included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.
Impairment
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial 
asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated 
future cash flows of that asset.

FINANCIAL RISKS
Details of the Group’s treasury controls, exposures and the policies and processes for managing capital and credit, liquidity, interest rate 
and currency risk are set out below, and in the Strategic Report – Financial Review that starts on page 38.
Credit risk 
Exposure to credit risk
Credit risks arise mainly from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. The Group monitors 
the creditworthiness of customers on an ongoing basis. The Group’s credit risk is diversified due to the large number of entities, 
industries and regions that make up the Group’s customer base.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. At the reporting date this was as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Trade receivables, net of allowance (note 11) 469.5 472.8
Cash and cash equivalents 135.9 158.8
Total 605.4 631.6
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Asia Pacific 127.1 131.5
Americas 180.6 180.4
Europe, Middle East and Africa 161.8 160.9
Total 469.5 472.8
Counterparty risk
Cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing facilities are at risk in the event that the counterparty is not able to meet its 
obligations in regards to the cash held or facilities available to the Group. The Group also enters into transactions with counterparties  
in relation to derivative financial instruments. If the counterparty was not able to meet its obligations, the Group may be exposed to 
additional foreign currency or interest rate risk.
The Group, wherever possible, enters into arrangements with counterparties who have robust credit standing, which the Group defines 
as a financial institution with a credit rating of at least investment grade. The Group has existing banking relationships with a number 
of ‘relationship banks’ that meet this criterion, and seeks to use their services wherever possible while avoiding excessive concentration 
of credit risk. Given the diverse geographic nature of the Group’s activities, it is not always possible to use a relationship bank. Therefore 
the Group has set limits on the level of deposits to be held at non-relationship banks to minimise the risk to the Group. It is also Group 
policy to remit any excess funds from local entities back to Intertek Group Treasury in the UK. Given the controls in place, and based on a 
current assessment of our banking relationships, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. The Group’s policy is to:
• ensure sufficient liquidity is available to Group companies in the amounts, currencies and locations required to support the Group’s 
operations;
• ensure the Group has adequate available sources of funding to protect against unforeseen internal and external events; and
•  avoid excess liquidity which restricts growth and impacts the cost of financing.
To ensure this policy is met, the Group monitors cash balances on a daily basis, projects cash requirements on a rolling basis and funds 
itself using debt instruments with a range of maturities.

Interest rate risk
The Group’s objective is to manage the risk to the business from movements in interest rates, and to provide stability and predictability 
of the near term (12 month horizon) interest expense. Under the Group’s Treasury policy, management may fix the interest rates on up 
to 80% of the Group’s debt portfolio for the period of the current financial year. The Group’s debt portfolio beyond this period is to be 
managed within the range of a 20%-60% fixed to floating rate ratio. To do this the Group uses hedging instruments where considered 
appropriate. A cash flow hedge is in place in respect of a borrowing that is repayable in 2020.
Sensitivity
At 31 December 2017 , it is estimated that the impact on variable rate net debt of a general increase of 3% in interest rates would  
be a decrease in the Group’s profit before tax of approximately £5.4m (2016: £9.3m). This analysis assumes all other variables  
remain constant.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s objective in managing foreign currency risk is to safeguard the Group’s financial assets from economic loss due to 
fluctuations in foreign currencies, and to protect margins on cross currency contracts and operations. To achieve this, the Group’s policy 
is to hedge its foreign currency exposures where appropriate. 
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Group’s shareholders’ funds and a substantial percentage 
of the Group’s revenue and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling. Because of the high proportion of 
international activity, the Group’s profit is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. Two types of risk arise as a result: (i) translation risk, 
that is, the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into 
sterling and (ii) transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Group’s 
commercial cash flows in various currencies.

date were as follows:

RECOGNISED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign 
currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
HEDGE OF NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES
The Group’s foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Group’s investment in its respective subsidiaries.  
The carrying amount of these loans at 31 December 2017 was £655.1m (2016: £857 .7m).
A foreign exchange gain of £77 .3m (2016: loss £194.1m) was recognised in the translation reserve in equity on translation of these 
loans to sterling.
SENSITIVITY
It is estimated that a general increase of 10% in the value of sterling against the US dollar (the main currency impacting the Group) 
would have decreased the Group’s profit before tax for 2017 by approximately £21.6m (2016: £20.8m). This analysis assumes all other 
variables remain constant.

ACCOUNTING POLICY
Pension schemes
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity 
and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of material defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating 
the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years; that benefit is 
discounted to determine its present value. The fair value of any plan assets are deducted.
In calculating the defined benefit deficit, the discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have 
maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the 
benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the Projected Unit credit method. 
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise from the employees’ services in the accounting period is charged to 
the operating profit in the income statement. The expected return on the schemes’ assets and the interest on the present value of the 
schemes’ liabilities, during the accounting period, are shown as finance income and finance expense respectively.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. In most locations, these are defined contribution 
arrangements. However, there are significant defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Switzerland. The United 
Kingdom Scheme and Hong Kong Scheme are funded, with assets held in separate trustee-administered funds and the Switzerland 
Scheme is an insured scheme. The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants in 2002 and 2000, 
respectively. Other funded defined benefit schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were 
defined contribution schemes.
The Group recognises all actuarial remeasurements in each year in equity through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
In June 2011, the International Accounting Standards Board issued revisions to IAS 19 Employee Benefits (‘IAS 19’) that provide 
changes in the recognition, presentation and disclosure of post-employment benefits. The Group has adopted the revised accounting 
standard from 1 January 2013.

The pension cost for the defined benefit schemes was assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries. The last  
full triennial actuarial valuation of The Intertek Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom (‘United Kingdom Scheme’) was carried out  
as at 1 April 2016, and for IAS 19 accounting purposes has been updated to 31 December 2017 . The last full actuarial valuation of the 
Hong Kong Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2016, for local accounting purposes and has been updated to 31 December 
2017 for IAS 19 purposes. The Switzerland Scheme was valued for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 December 2017 . The average duration of 
the schemes are 20 years, 10 years and 15 years for the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Switzerland schemes respectively.

Company contributions
The Company assessed the triennial actuarial valuation for the United Kingdom Scheme and its impact on the scheme funding plan in 
2018 and future years. In 2018 the Group expects to make normal contributions of £0.8m (2017: £0.8m) and has made a special 
contribution of £2.0m (2017: £2.8m). The next triennial valuation is due to take place as at 1 April 2019 and will include a review of the 
Company's future contribution requirements.
The Hong Kong Scheme has an annual actuarial valuation, identifying the funding requirements for 2018.

Total 114.7 105.9 23.1 21.9
*  Investments are included at fair value. The pooled investment vehicles are held under a managed fund policy in the name of the Scheme. Pooled investment vehicles 
(including the of the Absolute Return Fund / LDI Funds) which are not traded on active markets, but where the investment manager has provided a monthly trading price, 
are valued using the last single price, provided by the investment manager at or before the year end. The Absolute Return Fund aims to provide positive investment 
returns in all conditions over the medium- to long-term. The investment managers have a wide investment remit and look to exploit market inefficiencies through active 
allocation to a diverse range of market positions. The Fund uses a combination of traditional assets and investment strategies based on derivatives and is able to take 
long- and short-term positions in markets. The LDI Fund provides the hedge against adverse movements in inflation and interest rates. It seeks to match the sensitivity of 
the Scheme’s liability cash flow to changes in interest rates and inflation; it is invested in gilts, swaps, futures, repo contracts and money market instruments.
The United Kingdom Scheme had bank account assets of £0.5m as at 31 December 2017 (2016: £0.3m).
The United Kingdom Scheme invested assets comprise both quoted and unquoted assets, whilst all of the invested assets of the Hong 
Kong Scheme are unquoted. The Switzerland Scheme is fully insured.

*  The retirement arrangement in Hong Kong pays a lump sum to members instead of a pension at the point of retirement. Since the amount of the lump sum is not related to 
the life expectancy of the member, the post-retirement mortality is not a relevant assumption for the Hong Kong Scheme.
  The table above shows, for the United Kingdom Scheme, the number of years a male or female is expected to live, assuming they were aged either 40 or 65 at 
31 December. The mortality tables adopted in 2017 for the United Kingdom Scheme are the S2PA projected by year of birth, based on the CMI 2016 mortality projection 
model with a 1.25% long-term annual rate for future improvement. In 2016 the S2PA tables were used, based on the CMI 2015 mortality projection model. For the 
Switzerland Scheme, the mortality table adopted in both 2017 and 2016 is the BVG2015, an industry standard in Switzerland which is based on statistical evidence of 
major Switzerland pension funds.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The table below sets out the sensitivity on the United Kingdom and Hong Kong pension assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2017 
of the two main assumptions:

0.25% fall in inflation 122.6 (5.0) n/a n/a
The United Kingdom Scheme is also subject to the mortality assumption. If the mortality tables used are rated up/down one year, the 
value placed on the liabilities increases by £5.9m and decreases by £5.8m respectively.
FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS 
United Kingdom Scheme
The Trustees use the Projected Unit credit method with a three-year control period. Currently the scheme members pay contributions 
at the rate of 8.5% of salary. The employer pays contributions of 16.4% of salary, plus £0.2m per year to fund scheme expenses, and 
has made an additional contribution of £2.0m in 2018 to reduce the deficit disclosed by the 2016 valuation.
Hong Kong Scheme
The Trustees use the Attained Age funding method. The last actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2016. Scheme members do 
not contribute to the scheme. The employer pays contributions of 11.5% of salaries including 0.6% in respect of scheme expenses.
Funding Risks
The main risks for the schemes are:
Investment return risk: If the assets underperform the returns assumed in setting the funding targets then additional contributions 
may be required at subsequent valuations.
Investment matching risk: The schemes invest significantly in equities, whereas the funding targets are closely related to the returns on 
bonds. If equities fall in value relative to the matching asset of bonds, additional contributions may be required.
Longevity risk: If future improvements in longevity exceed the assumptions made for scheme funding then additional 
contributions may be required.
Role of Third Parties
The United Kingdom Scheme is managed by Trustees on behalf of its members. The Trustees take advice from appropriate third parties 
including investment advisors, actuaries and lawyers as necessary.

ACCOUNTING POLICY
Share-based payment transactions
The share-based compensation plans operated by the Group allow employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of the 
employee services, received in exchange for the grant of shares, is measured at the grant date and is recognised as an expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The charge is calculated using the Monte Carlo method and expensed to the income statement over 
the vesting period of the relevant award. The charge for the Deferred Share Awards is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of 
vesting for service conditions. The expense of the LTIP Share Awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes method and is adjusted for 
the probability of EPS performance conditions being achieved.
The Group has taken advantage of the provisions of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, and has 
recognised an expense only in respect of share awards granted since 7 November 2002.
SHARE PLANS
2011 Long Term Incentive Plan
The Deferred Bonus Plan 2005 was replaced in 2011 with the Intertek 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 'LTIP'). Deferred Share 
Awards (previously Share Awards) and LTIP Share Awards (previously Performance Awards) have been granted under this plan. The first 
awards were granted on 7 April 2006. The awards under these plans vest three years after grant date, subject to fulfilment of the 
performance conditions.

86,243 awards represented a tax liability of £3.2m which was settled in cash on behalf of employees by the Group, of which £2.7m was settled by the Company.
Deferred Share Plan
On 9 March 2015 the Remuneration Committee approved the adoption of the Intertek Deferred Share Plan (the ‘DSP’). Awards may be 
granted under the DSP to employees of the Group (other than the Executive Directors of the Company) selected by the Remuneration 
Committee over existing, issued ordinary shares of the Company only. The DSP was adopted primarily to allow for the deferral of a 
proportion of selected employees annual bonus into shares in the Company, but may also be used for the grant of other awards (such as 
incentive awards and buy out awards for key employees) in circumstances that the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate. The 
initial award under the DSP had a two-year vesting period; any subsequent awards will normally have a three-year vesting period. Awards 
may be made subject to performance conditions and are subject to normal good and bad leaver provisions and malus and clawback.

18 Subsequent events
On 1 February 2018, the parent company received dividend income of £120.0m from subsidiaries further increasing its distributable 
reserves.
19 Capital management
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of Intertek; specifically how much capital is raised from shareholders (equity) 
and how much is borrowed from financial institutions (debt) in order to finance the Group’s activities. These activities include ongoing 
operations as well as acquisitions as described in note 10.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 144 19 Capital management (continued)
The Group’s policy is to maintain a robust capital base (including cash and debt) to ensure the market and key stakeholders retain 
confidence in the capital profile. Debt capital is monitored by Group Treasury assessing the liquidity buffer on a short- and longer-term 
basis as discussed in note 14. The Group uses key performance indicators, including return on invested capital and adjusted diluted 
earnings per share to monitor the capital position of the Group to ensure it is being utilised effectively. The dividend policy also forms 
part of the Board’s capital management policy, and the Board ensures there is appropriate earnings cover for the dividend proposed at 
both the interim and year end.
20 Non-controlling interest
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no 
goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.

LITIGATION
The Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business, including claims for damages, 
negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection and testing, and disputes with employees and former employees. The Group 
is not currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation incidental to the conduct of business. The Group maintains 
appropriate insurance cover to provide protection from the small number of significant claims it is subject to from time to time.
TAX
The Group operates in more than 100 countries and with complex tax laws and regulations. At any point in time it is normal for there to 
be a number of open years which may be subject to enquiry by local authorities. In some jurisdictions the Group receives tax incentives 
(see note 6) which are subject to renewal and review and reduce the amount of tax payable. Where the effect of the laws and 
regulations is unclear, estimates are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid. The Group considers the estimates, 
assumptions and judgements to be reasonable but this can involve complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve. The 
Group is also monitoring developments in relation to the EU State Aid investigation into the UK's Controlled Foreign Company regime. 
The Group does not currently consider any provision is required in relation to EU State Aid.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INTERTEK GROUP PLC – COMPANY STATEMENT  
OF CHANGES IN EQUITY (A) ACCOUNTING POLICIES – COMPANY
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company’s financial statements.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(‘FRS 101’). 
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary in order 
to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. 
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: 
• a Cash Flow Statement and related notes;
• comparative period reconciliations for share capital;
• disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
• disclosures in respect of capital management; 
• the effects of new, but not yet effective, IFRSs; 
• an additional balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following the retrospective change 
in accounting policy; 
• disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel; and
• certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument 
Disclosures on the basis that the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under  
FRS 101 available in respect of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group-settled share-based payments.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and 
loss account.
Following a review of the Company's loan arrangements with Group undertakings, these have been re-presented in the 2016 balance 
sheet as balances due within one year.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
financial statements.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded to the Company’s functional currency, Sterling, using the rate of exchange ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at the balance sheet date. All foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in 
equity or other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition 
of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business 
combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Company’s right to receive payment is established.
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately 
authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the 
notes to the financial statements.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Intercompany financial guarantees
When the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies in the Group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect the Company treats 
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability, until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make 
a payment under the guarantee.
Share-based payments
Intertek Group plc runs a share ownership programme that allows Group employees to acquire shares in the Company. Details of the 
share schemes are given in note 17 of the Group financial statements.

The loss for the financial year, before dividends paid to shareholders of £107 .0m (2016: £88.0m), was £1.6m (2016: £129.4m profit) 
which was mainly in respect of the timing of 2017 Management and Intellectual Property fees and dividend income in relation to 2017 .
The Company has sufficient distributable reserves to pay the 2018 interim dividend and on 1 February 2018, the Company received 
dividend income of £120.0m to further increase is distributable reserves. When required the Company can receive additional dividends

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 
INTERTEK GROUP PLC
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OPINION
In our opinion:
• Intertek Group plc’s group financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for 
the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise:
• the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017;
• the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2017;
• the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended;
• the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
• the Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the Group or the Company.
Other than those disclosed in the Directors’ Report, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the Company in the period 
from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 .
OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Overview
Materiality
• Overall Group materiality: £20.0m (2016: £17 .3m), based on 5% of statutory profit before tax.
• Overall Company materiality: £5.1m (2016: £4.9m), based on 1% of total assets.
Audit scope
• We performed full scope audit procedures over 54 legal entities and performed specified audit procedures on a further 19 entities, 
covering 28 territories in total.
• The Group audit team held regular meetings with component teams, and visited the UK, US, China and United Arab Emirates teams, to 
understand and supervise the work of these local teams and to make sure that we had a full and comprehensive understanding of the 
results of their work, particularly insofar as it related to the identified areas of focus.
• Taken together, the entities over which audit work was performed accounted for 85% of the Group’s revenue and 90% of the Group’s 
statutory profit before tax.
Areas of focus
• Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets (Group).
• Valuation of current and deferred tax balances (Group).
• Completeness of customer claims (Group).
• Presentation and valuation of acquisitions (Group).
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the Company to communicate in our report.

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at areas where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industries in which it operates, and 
considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed audit 
procedures at Group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment 
by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise 
to a material misstatement in the Group and Company financial statements, including, but not limited to, indirect and direct tax laws, 
anti-bribery laws and financial reporting regulations. 
Our tests included, but were not limited to: understanding management’s approach to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations; 
enquiries with local, regional and Group management; meeting with Group and local legal counsel to discuss legal matters; meeting with 
internal audit; obtaining legal confirmations; and focusing testing on balances and transactions, in addition to those listed as key audit 
matters below, that are subject to estimation, such as accrued income. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described 
above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial 
statements, the less likely it is that we would become aware of it. We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, 
including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals 
and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditor's professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditor, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of 
our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Carrying value of goodwill 
and intangible assets
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 77 
and to note 9 in the financial statements.
The Group had £579.6m of goodwill and a further  
£178.2m of intangible assets recognised on the 
balance sheet at 31 December 2017 . The carrying 
values of goodwill and intangibles are contingent 
on future cash flows of the underlying Cash 
Generating Units (“CGUs”) and there is a risk that, 
if these cash flows do not meet the directors’ 
expectations, the assets will be impaired.
Accounting standards require management to 
perform an annual assessment of the carrying 
value of goodwill, and other intangible assets are 
assessed where there are indications that they 
are impaired. As this assessment is based on 
the future value in use, and a significant amount 
of value is based on the value to perpetuity of 
the CGUs, future cash flows must be estimated, 
which can be highly judgemental and could 
significantly impact the carrying value of 
the assets.
We evaluated future cash flow forecasts, and the process by which they 
were drawn up, including comparing them to the latest Board-approved 
budgets, and testing the underlying calculations. We identified no issues 
in this testing.
We used our in-house valuation specialists to evaluate the methodology 
used to calculate the value in use of the CGUs, and key assumptions including:
• the discount rate by comparing the cost of capital for the Group with 
comparable organisations; and
• the long-term growth rates by comparing these to publicly available market 
data on projected growth rates in key territories such as the UK, USA and 
China.
We concluded that they were within the range of reasonable assumptions 
based on this information.
We performed sensitivity analysis around these assumptions. Having 
ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions that either 
individually or collectively would be required for an impairment to arise, 
we considered the likelihood of such a movement occurring.
Our testing did not identify any indicators of impairment, and that the 
assumptions were reasonable and would require significant downside 
changes before any impairment would be triggered.
In addition we assessed the appropriateness of the CGUs used in the 
impairment assessment, the useful economic lives of the intangible assets 
and the related disclosures, and concluded that these were appropriate.

Valuation of current and deferred tax balances
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 77 
and to note 6 in the financial statements.
Provisions in relation to potential tax exposure 
are subject to judgement and require the selection 
of estimation techniques and determination 
of estimates, either of which could influence the 
current or deferred tax positions. The Group operates 
in a large number of jurisdictions, which increases 
the risk of non-compliance with international tax 
legislation and introduces complex transfer 
pricing considerations.
In addition the Group has provisions for uncertain 
tax positions relating to both historical and current 
tax arrangements. The recognition and measurement 
of these items in the financial statements is 
judgemental, and we focused on the directors’ 
forecasts of future profits against which to 
utilise accumulated losses, and the technical 
interpretation of taxation law in respect to 
transactions giving rise to deferred tax assets 
and uncertain tax positions.
We involved our in-house tax specialists in our testing of the appropriateness 
of the techniques, estimates and judgements taken in relation to deferred 
taxation and in respect of uncertain tax positions recognised in the 
financial statements.
In assessing uncertain tax positions, we obtained management’s 
calculations and evaluated the methodology and assumptions used.
In understanding and evaluating the directors’ technical interpretation 
of tax law in respect of specific transactions that gave rise to uncertain 
tax positions we evaluated:
• third party tax advice received by the Group;
• the status of recent and current tax authority audits and enquiries;
• the outturn of previous claims;
• judgemental positions taken in tax returns and current year estimates; and
• changes in tax legislation, in particular the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or 
interpretation of existing legislation by local tax authorities.
In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we considered the 
likelihood of the Group being able to generate sufficient future taxable 
profits against which to offset accumulated losses, and tested:
• key inputs to the calculation including revenue and profit assumptions, 
in line with our work over the carrying value of goodwill; and
• the directors’ ability to accurately forecast future profits where the 
tax assets will not be recoverable in the foreseeable future.
The procedures above did not identify any issues with regards to the 
valuation of deferred tax assets and provisions for uncertain tax positions, 
and we are in agreement with the 1% effect on the current year tax rate of 
the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the resulting disclosure.
Completeness and valuation of customer claims
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 77 and 
to note 13 in the financial statements.
As an assurance provider, the Group can be subject 
to claims from customers and consumers relating 
to its work, and the geographically diverse nature 
of the Group means there is a risk that one or more 
significant claims are omitted from the centrally 
maintained claims register.
Where customer claims may give rise to a future 
liability, the Directors are required to recognise 
either a liability or a contingent liability in the 
financial statements. As the actual cost is often 
unknown, management must exercise their 
judgement in calculating the liability.
Where relevant we obtained confirmations from the Group’s external legal 
counsels of the existence and details of open claims. Confirmations were 
sent to both the lawyers associated with the key claims and also additional 
lawyers who Intertek have interacted with throughout the year.
We met with legal counsel to discuss certain open or threatened claims 
to understand the likelihood of an adverse judgement and the potential 
magnitude of the claim.
We obtained and read the relevant sections of the Group’s insurance 
documents, and confirmed that any liability cap had been appropriately 
applied to the calculation of provision held against those claims.
Through our work, we did not identify any material claims that had not 
been recorded centrally and provided for, or for which the provision was 
not appropriate.

OTHER INFORMATION KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER
Presentation and valuation of acquisitions
Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 77 and 
to note 10 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Group’s strategy is to use acquisitions to 
augment organic revenue growth, and during the 
year made two acquisitions: KJ Tech Services GmbH 
and Acumen Security LLC. In addition, the 12-month 
hindsight period for reassessing the acquisition of FIT 
Italia SRL, EWA-Canada Ltd and Laboratorios ABC 
Quimica, Investigación y Análisis, S.A de C.V. closed 
during the year.
Judgement is required in determining the amount 
of consideration paid and the valuation of assets 
and liabilities acquired. In addition, the disclosure 
requirements in respect of acquisitions are extensive.
For these transactions we obtained and read the sale and purchase 
agreements (“SPAs”) in order to gain an understanding of the key terms 
of each transaction.
In testing acquisitions during the year we:
• tested that the consideration paid by the Group was consistent with 
the terms of the SPAs;
• assessed the appropriateness of the directors’ identification of intangible 
assets acquired by reference to the SPAs, due diligence reports and other 
supporting documentation, to identify any assets listed;
• obtained the directors’ calculation of the fair value of intangible assets 
acquired, and where material corroborated the inputs and assumptions 
to supporting evidence; 
• verified that the accounting treatment for each transaction, and any 
resulting liabilities, is consistent with the accounting standard requirements; 
and
• assessed the reasonableness of the inputs and assumptions used in 
calculating contingent consideration.
We noted no material exceptions through performing these procedures.
For the acquisitions made in 2016, in order to test the directors’ final 
assessment of the purchase price allocation, we:
• obtained evidence from internal and external advisors in relation to the 
fair value of liabilities recognised on acquisition, to evaluate whether the 
valuation remained appropriate, or that any adjustments were supported; 
and
• evaluated whether all fair value adjustments, and any resulting impact, 
had been appropriately recognised and accounted for.
Based on the evidence obtained, we did not identify any indications that 
the fair value adjustments identified by management were inappropriate.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in 
which they operate.
The Group is split into three reporting segments: Products, Trade and Resources and the operations are spread across over 100 
countries and approximately 500 legal entities. The results are not consolidated at a country or regional level, so we determined that 
the most appropriate level at which to scope our audit was the legal entity level.
When determining our scope, the key financial measure used is profit before tax. Due to the disaggregation of the Group’s results 
across the various entities, we identified only two individually financially significant legal entities, both within China. As a result we 
instructed our component team to perform audits of the complete financial information of these entities.
We then considered the 50 countries in which PwC are appointed statutory auditor. Of these, 24 accounted for the majority of 
external profit, and we therefore focused our considerations on these territories. Within these countries, we then excluded any legal 
entities with no external balances, such as intermediary holding companies, and those entities with highly immaterial revenue, leaving 
54 legal entities for which we instructed our local teams to perform audits of the complete financial information for the purpose of the 
Group audit.
In certain territories, notably the US and Brazil, there is no statutory audit requirement and so we considered whether procedures 
needed to be performed to supplement our coverage. We selected 13 entities in the US and Canada and two of the entities in Brazil, 
representing those with the largest contribution to Group profit, over which we performed specified procedures equivalent to audits of the 
complete financial information. We also identified a further four entities in other countries over which we instructed specific audit 
procedures to be performed over revenue and receivables to supplement coverage over these key financial line items.
In total we performed procedures over 73 legal entities in 28 countries, which together accounted for 85% of the Group’s revenue and 
90% of the Group’s profit before tax.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 
INTERTEK GROUP PLC continued
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 160
OTHER INFORMATION INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT During the year, members of the Group audit team visited the US, China, United Arab Emirates and UK component teams, and we held 
planning workshops with 10 of the largest in scope component teams, in order to understand and supervise the audit approach in 
those locations and to inform them of our audit approach and strategy.
This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level (including audit procedures over material head office entities, 
tax, legal claims, impairment assessments and consolidation adjustments), gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Overall materiality £20.0m (2016: £17 .3m). £5.1m (2016: £4.9m).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax. 1% of total assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
We believe that profit before tax is the primary 
measure used by the shareholders in assessing 
the performance of the Group. This is a generally 
accepted benchmark and the users of the 
accounts consider it to be a key measure of 
the performance of the business.
These are a single set of Company accounts for 
an entity which has no external revenue and takes 
advantage of the exemption offered under s408 
of CA 2006 not to present its income statement 
in the Company financial statements, which are 
presented alongside the Group accounts within 
the annual report for Intertek Group plc. As a result, 
the materiality calculation has been based on the 
total assets of this non-trading holding company 
within the Group.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated across components was between £1.20m and £7 .82m. Certain components were audited to a local statutory 
audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £900,000 (Group 
audit) (2016: £900,000) and £900,000 (Company audit) (2016: £900,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
REPORTING OBLIGATION OUTCOME
We are required to report if we have anything material 
to add or draw attention to in respect of the directors’ 
statement in the financial statements about whether 
the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the directors’ identification of 
any material uncertainties to the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a 
guarantee as to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement 
relating to Going Concern in accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
 INTERTEK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 161
OTHER INFORMATION REPORTING ON OTHER INFORMATION
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, 
any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 (CA06), 
ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as 
described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we 
did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
•  The directors’ confirmation on page 33 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 33 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less 
in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and 
considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their 
environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report to you in respect of our responsibility to report when:
• The statement given by the directors, on page 78, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Company obtained in the 
course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 75 to 80 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditor.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. (CA06)

OTHER INFORMATION INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 102 the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
COMPANIES ACT 2006 EXCEPTION REPORTING
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
APPOINTMENT
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the directors on 25 May 2016 to audit the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 
two years, covering the years ended 31 December 2016 to 31 December 2017 .
