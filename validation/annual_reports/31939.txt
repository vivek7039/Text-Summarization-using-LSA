Our work with TCC supports our 
move into the previously unaddressed 
European market, providing even greater 
international reach. Since signing the 
partnership, we have implemented the 
core foundations for a solid working 
relationship and most importantly 
recruited an international team to work 
solely with TCC. The joint proposition is 
now being actively marketed “TCC Digital 
Connect” and taken into TCC’s European 
clients. Excitingly, we are engaged and 
in discussions with multiple retailers 
through the partnership and expect to 
accelerate win ratios across Europe. 
We expect to see this partnership 
develop throughout 2018 and beyond.
We are continuing to explore strategic 
alliances and partnerships that either 
allow us to expedite our win ratio or 
extend our reach in the value chain. 
This is particularly relevant for our 
mid-tier customers who increasingly 
want an end-to-end solution.
Since Tim’s appointment we have 
reviewed our external messaging 
to put the consumer at the heart of 
what we do. With the benefit of his 
retail and consumer experience, our 
product marketing has shifted from 
being solely focused on our technology 
to articulating what we do from the 
consumer’s perspective. A project was 
kicked off in June 2017 to build on the 
work done so far and the new product 
marketing positioning is expected 
to launch in financial H1 2018.
A year of strategic and  
operational progress
The Board is delighted with the 
significant strategic and operational 
progress made during the year. As 
announced in May 2017, revenues in 
the year exceeded our expectations, 
increasing by 71%. This positive 
outcome has been driven by the 
successful execution of our strategy 
to win new customers, increase 
transactions from existing customers 
and deepen our customer relationships. 
Off the back of this increased 
momentum the Company successfully 
completed a placing of new equity in 
June 2017. This raised net proceeds of 
£5.8m which will be used to accelerate 
investments in product development, 
infrastructure and marketing resources 
to take advantage of the market 
opportunity and drive international 
expansion. As demonstrated above, the 
Company has already begun to invest 
these funds in the core areas for growth. 
On behalf of the Board, I want to thank 
the team for their commitment, hard 
work and major steps forward this year 
in terms of contract wins, further 
developing the platform and enhancing 
internal processes to support the next 
stage of growth.
Outlook 
2017 saw us exceed against 
management’s original revenue 
expectations, put in the foundations for 
scale and execute against our growth 
strategy. In the year, we experienced 
increased demand from all sectors, 
resulting in significant new customer 
wins, such as John Lewis. We have 
seen this momentum continue post 
year-end, as demonstrated by the 
two-year contract renewal with 
Asda, announced in July 2017. 
This momentum gives visibility of 
revenue for the first quarter for the 
financial year ending 30 June 2018 
to be at least 32% up on prior year 
comparative period at approximately 
£3.0m. Most importantly, there is an 
expectation that a higher proportion 
of revenue will be generated from 
recurring subscriptions and transaction 
revenue expected to be approximately 
£2.2m, 73% (Q1 FY17: £1.6m, 71%). 
Transaction volumes are expected to 
be in the region of 30.0m (Q1 FY17: 
11.7m) which would represent growth of 
157%. This first quarter has seen early 
benefits from the favourable renewal with 
Asda, John Lewis going live on the AIR 
platform within two months of contract 
signature and an increased number of 
transactions from our F&B clients due to 
exciting issuance partner relationships. 
71
%
INCREASE IN REVENUE
Looking further ahead, there is an 
expectation that the percentage of 
revenue from recurring subscriptions and 
transactions will continue to improve as 
our significant clients begin to transact 
through the platform at scale and the 
impact of new strategic partnerships 
that drive increased transactions. 
From the position of strength having 
raised net proceeds of £5.8m to invest 
in the marketing and operational 
capabilities that support our growth 
plans, the Board is excited and 
confident in Eagle Eye’s capabilities 
to exploit the considerable global 
market opportunities in 2018. 
This level of growth, momentum and 
capital gives the Board confidence 
early in the financial year on delivering 
against management’s expectations. 
Malcolm Wall 
Non-Executive Chairman
Chairman’s statement
In September 2016, I was 
delighted to accept the 
position of Non-Executive 
Chairman of Eagle Eye, with 
Tim Mason appointed as our 
new Chief Executive. 
It was the Board’s belief that Tim would 
drive the business to become “Better, 
Bigger, Faster” as we entered the next 
stage of Eagle Eye’s development. I 
am very pleased to report that under 
Tim’s leadership the Company has 
excelled, with a clear strategy in 
place, accelerated growth, and in a 
strengthened position to capitalise 
on the sizeable market opportunity. 
Better, Bigger, Faster
During the year there have been 
fundamental changes made to ensure 
that the Company is best placed to 
capitalise on the market’s shift to 
digital, where there are clear indicators 
that the consumer now expects 
real-time and personalised reward. 
 
There has been a significant emphasis 
on people during 2017, ensuring that 
the leadership team is geared for 
scale and the culture resonates with 
both our people and our customers. 
In addition to the strengthened Board, 
the executive team has been joined 
by David Aylmer as Chief Operating 
Officer to provide particular focus on 
client delivery, security and scalability 
of our operational capabilities. 
 
During the year we expanded 
internationally in North America with 
Loblaw Inc (“Loblaw”), the Canadian 
food retailer, and in Europe through the 
partnership with TCC Global (“TCC”), 
a global retail marketing company, both 
of which we have continued to develop. 
The North American focus is gaining 
momentum with the Loblaw 
implementation of Eagle Eye AIR now 
under way and the opening of Eagle 
Eye’s first overseas office in Toronto, 
Canada. The new office and operational 
team supports the Loblaw project and 
will act as a hub to capitalise on the 
significant North American market 
opportunity estimated to be worth over 
$84bn (Cadent Consulting Group 2015 
and Raymond James 2016). 
2017 saw us exceed against management’s original 
revenue expectations, put in the foundations for scale 
and execute against our growth strategy. STRATEGIC REPORT

targeting, giving customers much more 
value and offering retailers the chance 
to truly understand their customers, 
rewarding them whilst they are still in 
store, thereby maximising engagement. 
Large retailers can’t shift the dial 
The big retailers have substantial 
analogue schemes which are so 
embedded in the organisation that it is 
a challenge to upgrade and innovate 
their systems. However, with the growing 
importance of digital channels, in order 
to meet consumers’ expectations and 
utilise digital, they must look outside 
of their core schemes to remain 
competitive. This means they are 
looking for alternative routes to get new 
schemes to market quicker presenting 
a sizeable market opportunity for Eagle 
Eye’s innovative loyalty offering.
Measuring the effect of social media
There is increased pressure for 
businesses to measure marketing Return 
on Investment (“ROI”) across social 
media channels and prove that it’s a 
valuable revenue stream. This can be 
solved through real-time redemption 
capability, linking online to offline. 
Brands using Eagle Eye can send 
personalised offers to consumers and 
track redemptions in real-time, enabling 
businesses to invest back into the 
consumer’s social media channels. This 
real-time element ensures campaigns 
can be tracked and optimised to 
maximise success rates, whilst 
delivering genuine value to consumers. 
Through bridging online to offline 
creating digital connections to track 
behaviour, eventually retailers can 
augment the shopping trip beyond 
the internet, and build a richer 
single view of the customer.
We are uniquely placed to address 
these global issues which retailers 
are facing today by helping them 
create an intelligent real-time 
connection with their customers. 
Win, Transact, Deepen
Following my appointment in September 
2016 our focus has been on building 
on our strategy to become a global 
digital marketing leader. To achieve 
this we aspire to be “Better, Bigger, 
Faster” by improving in three core 
areas of customer interaction: “Win” 
(bringing more customers onto the 
Eagle Eye AIR platform); “Transact” 
(driving higher redemption volumes 
through the platform); and “Deepen” 
(building relationships with customers 
as the breadth of our product portfolio 
becomes more developed). 
1. Win
We made continued progress adding 
new retailers and brands to the AIR 
platform in the year. At the end of the 
year, Eagle Eye had 233 live users, 
including 74 FMCG brands, up from 
219 users with 70 brands at the end 
of 2016. At the start of the year we 
set out to increase the number of 
redemption points to the network; new 
retailer signings included the Society 
of London Theatres, English Heritage 
and additional Mitchells & Butlers 
(“M&B”) brands: Chicken Society, 
Son of Steak and Stonehouse. 
In addition, in May 2017, the Company 
signed a three-year contract with 
John Lewis PLC (“John Lewis”) for the 
deployment of AIR to deliver improved 
digital customer marketing. Since 
the financial year end the Company 
announced the two-year renewal 
of its contract with Toshiba Global 
Commerce Solutions for the use of 
the AIR platform within Asda that 
integrates with existing Asda-Walmart 
POS solutions across Asda stores. Both 
these UK contract announcements 
reinforce the clear competitive benefits 
our solutions deliver to leading retailers.
In March 2017, the Company signed 
a strategic partnership with TCC, a 
world leader in creating retail marketing 
programmes and long-term loyalty 
schemes, allowing Eagle Eye to 
extend its digital promotions offer into 
the European loyalty market. TCC 
works with many of Europe’s largest 
retailers, making them a valuable 
partner, and enabling the Company 
to accelerate growth outside the UK.
2. Transact
Redemption volumes, which are a 
key measure of usage of the AIR 
platform and of the success of our 
“transact” strategy, have grown by 
58% year-on-year to 60.4m (2016: 
38.4m). Volume growth was primarily 
driven by the full year benefit of Asda 
volumes, the first phase roll-out for 
Sainsbury’s in the fourth quarter of 
2017 and increased brand activity 
through redemption outlets.
Using Asda as a nationwide redemption 
channel, from July 2016 to October 
2016, Coke Zero Sugar ran a 
promotional campaign across the AIR 
platform that generated a redemption 
rate of over 10%, compared to the 
typical redemption rate of a traditional 
analogue campaign of 0.5%–2% 
(Shopper Technology Institute/Juniper 
Research). This meaningful uplift in 
redemptions is proof that Eagle Eye can 
successfully drive higher redemption 
rates through the power of digital. 
As part of this campaign, Eagle Eye 
formed a new partnership with the 
life cycle social advertising company, 
Driftrock. This unique partnership 
now enables the success rate of 
advertising on social media channels to 
be measured through to redemption. 
During the year we have successfully 
powered digital campaigns for leading 
drinks brands through the food and 
beverage network. These brands 
include Diageo, AB InBev, Pernod 
Ricard, Heineken and Suntory. Working 
with each brand and their media 
agency the Company has coordinated 
a number of promotions targeted by 
region using a combination of web 
landing pages, programmatic display, 
traditional advertising, game and 
dating apps plus social media lead 
ads. The redemption outlets benefited 
from the increased footfall and spend 
per head and fraud is reduced as all 
the campaigns have used unique 
Chief Executive’s review
I was delighted to take 
the opportunity to become 
the Company’s CEO in 
September 2016. I had 
already spent a significant 
part of my career looking 
at how data can change 
consumer marketing, and 
immediately recognised the 
great potential for Eagle Eye 
to revolutionise the way that 
businesses engage with 
consumers. 
Traditional and analogue forms of 
promotions, rewards and loyalty 
programmes have lost their lustre 
with consumers who are increasingly 
looking for relevant, timely and 
personalised rewards that offer 
genuine value. It is Eagle Eye’s 
mission to meet this changing 
consumer demand, and I believe the 
Company has the proven, scalable 
technology to transform an industry. 
In this past year, we have established 
a new structure and ways of working 
internally to ensure we can deliver 
optimum results for both the Company 
and our customers. We have gained 
significant momentum, driven by our 
ambition to be “Better, Bigger, Faster.” 
We now have a clear vision and strategy 
in place and delivered results ahead 
of our expectations during the year.
Growing market opportunity
There are three critical themes currently 
affecting the marketplace which present 
a significant opportunity for Eagle Eye.
Loyalty and the need for  
real-time engagement
We are seeing a transition from 
the classic plastic card to digital 
distribution. Traditional methods which 
give 1% discounts and a “rear view” 
perspective on purchase behaviour are 
being replaced by digital alternatives. 
Real-time offers enable highly relevant 
The business is now more nimble, robust and able to 
clearly engage with our customers and the market… 
I am looking forward to this next stage of growth and 
the opportunity we have to be market leaders in the 
digital marketing space.

With extensive experience with 
system providers and clients, David 
has a thorough understanding of 
customer service and delivery. The 
Group will leverage his experience 
to ensure first class operations and 
delivery across Eagle Eye’s network 
of customers. We have also seen 
significant development within the sales 
team and a clear focus on the sales 
process led by Helen Slaven, having 
joined as Sales Director in May 2016. 
The past 12 months has seen rapid 
growth in our team. The average 
headcount increased from 73 to 
100, as a new office was opened in 
Toronto, Canada and as there was 
further investment in people across the 
business. We have introduced a new 
life skills training workshop based on 
the fundamental philosophy that people 
can benefit from understanding more 
about themselves, how they perform at 
their best and what triggers sub-optimal 
performance. A key way for us to be a 
stand out employer and a great place to 
work is to be able to provide benefits for 
our people benefiting them in all parts of 
their lives. Furthermore, our investment 
in people improves the capability and 
competency of the staff in the business. 
The values that we have in place 
shape our behaviour, reinforce our 
culture and determine our approach 
to recruitment. This is what we 
now call The Purple Standard. 
The skill, dedication and talent of our 
people are fundamental to the continued 
success of our growing business. 
We have made great progress over 
the last 12 months and will continue 
to make improvements to ensure we 
attract and retain the best talent. 
Looking ahead 
This past year we have recorded great 
progress against our objectives. The 
business is now more nimble, robust 
and able to clearly engage with our 
customers and the market. We have 
successfully laid the foundations for a 
great year ahead. I am looking forward 
to this next stage of growth and the 
opportunity we have to be market 
leaders in the digital marketing space. 
Tim Mason
Chief Executive Officer 
Our beliefs and values
The values that we have in place shape our 
behaviour, reinforce our culture and determine our 
approach to recruitment. This is what we now call 
The Purple Standard.
Chief Executive’s review continued
“one use only” codes. Real-time 
results have given the brand owners 
a previously unknown insight into 
which media, types of visuals and 
offers give the best ROI/ROS across 
any given campaign, allowing the 
brand owner to “dial up” or “dial 
down” on media and change or 
adapt the campaign accordingly. 
In messaging services, despite the 
Public Health England Stoptober 
campaign not including an SMS element 
this year, SMS volumes still increased 
10% to 44.4m (2016: 40.3m), as a result 
of messaging for Asurion and the cross 
selling of messaging services to the 
existing client base.
3. Deepen
We have made significant progress in 
deepening our Tier 1 client relationships 
during the year with 53% of revenue, 
£5.9m (2016: 33%, £2.1m) the result of 
an extension of our service offering with 
major clients. The embedding of Eagle 
Eye’s technology within these clients is 
a clear demonstration of the capability 
and reliability of our technology 
as a digital marketing platform. 
During the year our Tier 1 customers 
further adopted our range of 
products to drive their customer 
focused agendas and accelerate 
their digital ambitions in order to gain 
competitive advantage. This will help 
to drive meaningful transactional 
revenue growth in future periods.
Further progress in the established 
F&B sector increased revenue by 20% 
to £1.8m (2016: £1.5m). This increase 
has been driven as existing clients 
onboarded additional brands (including 
Las Iguanas and La Tasca along with 
new M&B concepts, Chicken Society 
and Son of Steak) to the AIR platform 
as well as utilising more of our services.
Casual Dining Group and Prezzo have 
expanded their capabilities through 
the implementation of staff discount 
schemes and we also enriched our 
white label mobile app across the M&B 
estate through the integration of Flypay 
to enable pay at table. Our relationship 
with Tesco Clubcard was also enhanced 
through the addition of English Heritage 
and RAC to the platform to allow 
customers to part pay for membership 
in points and top up with cash. 
Furthermore, we’ve also added 
the AA as an issuance partner to 
deliver offers to their customers 
for redemption in M&B outlets.
Revenue generated from client 
subscription fees and transactions 
over the network represented 68% 
of total revenue (2016: 80%). This 
reflects the progress we are making 
in deepening Eagle Eye’s system 
capability within major accounts, which 
will open up recurring transactional 
revenues in future periods.
Product development
In 2017 we continued to innovate and 
enhance our software platform to 
meet the demands of our customers 
and evolving consumer trends. 
Performance improvements were 
made to support our growing Tier 1 
grocery volumes, while we extended 
reporting and relationship management 
capabilities for issuance partners. 
With the addition of supplier funding 
functionality, we have created the 
ability for brands to interact with 
retailers’ loyalty schemes through 
holding buckets of points or value for 
discount that can be used in targeted 
promotions to end consumers, all 
redeemable in store or online through 
direct integration with the point of sale. 
Our enhanced wallet capabilities add 
flexibility to retailers’ loyalty offering, 
allowing consumers to be targeted 
with specific promotions. AIR has now 
been integrated to both Android and 
Apple Pay to enable payments, offers 
and rewards to be saved directly. 
We also invested in the integration of 
AIR with social platforms including 
Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, 
through partners such as Driftrock 
to drive audience numbers for 
brands and retailers. The partnership 
with Driftrock allows Eagle Eye 
to track promotional activity from 
social media to store redemptions 
and extends the Company’s 
offering along the value chain.
Financial results
Group revenue increased by 71% 
to £11.1m (2016: £6.5m) for the year. 
Of total revenue, 85% (£9.4m) was 
contributed from the core AIR platform 
(2016: 72%, £4.6m). 
The Group’s gross profit was £9.8m, 
representing a gross margin of 88% 
(2016: £5.1m, 79%). The increased gross 
profits were reinvested to drive future 
growth, meaning that adjusted EBITDA 
loss was held at £1.8m (2016: £1.8m 
loss). To provide a better guide to the 
underlying business performance, 
adjusted EBITDA excludes share-based 
payment charges along with 
depreciation, amortisation, interest 
and tax from the measure of profit. 
Following the successful placing 
completed in June 2017 which raised 
£5.8m (net of costs), the Group had net 
assets of £8.9m as at 30 June 2017 
(2016: £5.9m) including cash and cash 
equivalents of £3.7m (2016: £1.3m). 
During the year the Group extended its 
currently unutilised three year revolving 
loan facility with Barclays Bank PLC to 
£3.0m (2016: £1.5m) which together 
with the funds raised in the placing 
strengthens the Group’s balance sheet. 
People 
In addition to the Board changes at the 
beginning of the year, the management 
team has been further strengthened by 
the recruitment of a new Chief Operating 
Officer, David Aylmer, in May 2017.  STRATEGIC REPORT

1 Adjusted EBITDA loss excludes share-based payment charges along with depreciation, amortisation,  
interest and tax from the measure of profit.
Overall, £7.5m of revenue generated 
from subscription fees and transactions 
over the network represented 68% 
of total revenue (2016: 80%, £5.2m). 
The balance, £3.5m, relates to 
implementation fees for new customers 
and new services and represents 
32% of total revenue (2016: 20%, 
£1.3m). This increase in value and 
share for implementation fees reflects 
the progress made in deepening the 
Group’s product offering within major 
accounts, particularly for our UK and 
international Tier 1 grocer clients where 
implementation fees were £2.8m (2016: 
£0.7m). These implementations open 
up recurring transactional revenues 
which benefit future periods.
Although message volumes increased 
10% in the year to 44.4m (2016: 
40.3m), messaging revenue fell to 
£1.6m for the year (2016: £1.8m). This 
reduction reflects the increasingly 
competitive messaging market. The 
Group renewed two key contracts 
during and after the year, for UK 
Power Networks and Paragon, and 
has seen increases in transactional 
volumes following those renewals. 
Gross profit
The gross margin increased to 88% 
(2016: 79%) as gross profit grew to 
£9.8m (2016: £5.1m). The core AIR 
gross margin carries a significantly 
higher margin than the messaging 
business, and has continued to 
improve during the year to 96% (2016: 
92%). This increase, together with the 
increase in core AIR revenue which 
now accounts for 85% of total revenue, 
has driven the improved margin.
Adjusted operating costs
Adjusted operating costs of £11.5m 
(2016: £6.9m) represent sales and 
marketing, product development (net 
of capitalised costs), operational IT, 
general and administration costs. 
The overall increase was in line with 
management’s expectations and 
plans for strategic growth, including 
supporting the international activity 
for Loblaw in Canada. The investment 
in people is the main driver of this 
growth, with the average headcount 
for the year increasing to 100 
(2016: 73). During the year the Group’s 
infrastructure was also enhanced with 
both an operational and a disaster 
recovery data centre in North America 
having been established, in addition 
to the existing facilities in the UK.
Within staff costs gross expenditure 
on product development increased 
69% to £2.9m (2016: £1.7m) reflecting 
investment in enhancing the capacity, 
features and speed of the AIR platform. 
Capitalised product development 
costs were £1.5m (2016: £1.2m) whilst 
amortisation of capitalised development 
costs was £1.5m (2016: £1.6m). 
EBITDA 
Reflecting the strategic re-investment 
of increased gross profits, adjusted 
EBITDA loss for the year was held at 
£1.8m (2016: loss £1.8m). To provide a 
better guide to the underlying business 
performance, adjusted EBITDA excludes 
share-based payment charges along 
with depreciation, amortisation, interest 
and tax from the measure of profit. 
The GAAP measure of loss before 
interest and tax improved to £3.8m 
(2016: £4.1m) reflecting a reduction in 
the non-cash share-based payment 
charge to £0.4m (2016: £0.6m).
EPS and dividend
Following receipt of £0.3m research 
and development tax credit 
(2016: £0.4m), reported basic and 
diluted loss per share was 15.73p 
(2016: loss per share 16.36p). 
The Board does not feel it appropriate at 
this time to commence paying dividends.
Group statement of financial 
position
Following the successful placing 
completed in June 2017 which raised 
£5.8m (net of costs), the Group had 
net assets of £8.9m at 30 June 2017 
(2016: £5.9m), including capitalised 
intellectual property of £2.2m (2016: 
£2.2m) and cash of £3.7m (2016: 
£1.3m). The increase in net assets 
reflects the proceeds of the placing 
offset by the loss made in the year. 
Cash flow and net cash 
Cash at the end of the year had 
increased to £3.7m (2016: £1.3m). The 
main components to the gross cash 
increase of £2.4m for the year (2016: 
£3.0m decrease) were the proceeds 
from the placing of £5.8m, offset by an 
operating cash outflow of £2.0m (2016: 
£1.5m) and capital investment in the 
AIR platform of £1.5m (2016: £1.2m).
Banking facility
During the year the Group extended 
its three-year revolving loan facility 
with Barclays Bank plc (first arranged 
in June 2016) to £3.0m (2016: 
£1.5m) that is currently undrawn and 
together with the funds raised in the 
placing means that the Group is well 
positioned to capitalise on recent 
momentum in the business and to 
pursue identified growth opportunities. 
Financial review
Redemption volumes, a key measure of usage of the 
AIR platform, grew by 58% year-on-year to 60.4m for 
the year (2016: 38.4m). In addition, loyalty interactions 
totalled 1.1m (2016: 0.1m).
Group results
Revenue
Revenue growth for the Group was up 
38ppts to 71% for the year (2016: 33%), 
with revenue increasing to £11.1m (2016: 
£6.5m). The Group is continuing to grow 
half-by-half and H2 2017 revenue 
accounted for £6.0m (H1 2017: £5.1m), 
representing growth of 18% on H1 2017 
(H1 2016 to H2 2016: 19%).
This growth has been driven by 
increased revenue from the AIR 
platform which now represents 85% 
of total revenue, £9.4m (2016: 72%, 
£4.6m). This increase was largely as 
a result of the Group’s success with 
Tier 1 grocer clients; Asda, Sainsbury’s 
and Loblaw. Revenue from Tier 1 
clients in the UK increased by 92% 
to £3.3m (2016: £1.7m). This growth 
was also supported by new business 
wins such as John Lewis and Society 
of London Theatres and deepening 
relationships with existing clients, thus 
increasing redemption volumes. 
Of the AIR platform revenue stream, the 
element specifically linked to recurring 
subscriptions and transactions saw a 
69% increase to £5.9m (2016: £3.5m), 
aided specifically by increased licence 
fees for the Tier 1 clients and the full 
year effect on transactions of the 
national roll out of the AIR platform 
across all Asda stores. This Tier 1 AIR 
revenue growth is also supported by 
growth from F&B clients (20%) and 
other retail clients (69%) in the year. 
Redemption volumes, a key measure 
of usage of the AIR platform, grew 
by 58% year-on-year to 60.4m for 
the year (2016: 38.4m) driven by the 
full year impact of our solution for 
Asda’s coupon counting going fully 
live in the prior year, initial Sainsbury’s 
transactions and increased volumes 
from existing F&B and other retail 
clients. In addition, loyalty interactions 
totalled 1.1m (2016: 0.1m) reflecting 
the adoption of our loyalty solution by 
Greggs and M&B during the year. STRATEGIC REPORT

Product risk
The Group’s business involves providing 
customers with highly reliable software 
and services. If the software or services 
contain undetected defects when first 
introduced or enhanced, the Group may 
fail to meet its customers’ performance 
requirements or otherwise satisfy the 
contract specifications. As a result, it 
may lose customers and/or may become 
liable to them for damages. Whilst the 
Group has liability insurance in place 
and endeavours to negotiate limitations 
on its liability in its customer contracts, 
this is not always commercially possible. 
Additionally, the Group is committed to 
developing products for its customers 
on a set timeline. However, the pace of 
progress of the development projects 
may not be as expected and the Group 
could fail to meet its customers’ timing 
or performance requirements. As a 
result of these risks, the Group may 
lose customers, may become liable 
to those customers for damages and 
may suffer damage to its reputation.
The Group has service level commitment 
obligations with some of its customers 
in which it provides various guarantees 
regarding levels of service. The Group 
may not be able to meet these levels 
of service due to a variety of factors, 
both inside and outside the Group’s 
control. If the Group fails to provide 
the levels of service required by the 
agreements, such customers may be 
entitled to terminate their contracts or 
may choose not to enter into new work 
orders with the Group and this may also 
damage the Group’s reputation and 
reduce the confidence of the Group’s 
customers in its software and services, 
impairing its ability to retain existing 
customers and attract new customers.
Online security breaches,  
data loss and fraud
Security breach and fraud remain key 
concerns in the online payments world 
and any security breach or fraud event 
might deter consumers from purchasing 
goods via online voucher and offer 
content. Any move away from the mobile 
channel for purchasing goods could 
have a negative impact on the Group’s 
growth prospects and revenues. 
Security breach and fraud may also 
lead to regulatory investigations, 
sanctions (including fines) and litigation 
with clients and consumers. Any 
regulatory investigation or litigation 
may be costly and may divert efforts 
and attention of the Group’s key 
management and other personnel 
and resources, may cause wider 
reputational damage to the Group and 
may result in existing clients terminating 
contracts and deter potential new 
clients from becoming actual clients.
Any compromise of the Group’s 
systems, security breaches or data loss 
may result in the temporary inability of 
the Group to operate its services and 
clients’ mobile sites and applications 
and therefore may have a detrimental 
impact on the Group’s revenues, 
both directly through the inability of 
the Group’s clients to trade or of the 
Group to authenticate offers, and 
indirectly through loss of confidence in 
the security of the Group’s platform. 
In line with its ISO 27001 accredited 
procedures, the Group uses a third party 
security and data compliance service to 
monitor and mitigate against this risk in 
addition to client specific security testing.
Dependence on key customers 
The Group is dependent on a 
number of key contracts and partner 
relationships for its current and future 
growth and development. A limited 
number of clients account for a large 
percentage of the Group’s revenue. 
Whilst the Group endeavours to enter 
and renew long-term agreements with 
its clients, there can be no assurance 
that clients will continue to be secured 
on acceptable terms and conditions.
 
Financial review continued
Principal risks and uncertainties
Evolution of the market
The Group operates in an evolving 
market and there is a possibility that the 
rate of growth in mobile commerce will 
not match independent predictions or 
that users of mobile devices will change 
their behaviour with respect to mobile 
commerce. The Group’s services are 
new and evolving and it is difficult to 
predict the future growth rates, if any, 
and the size of these markets. Even if 
the market for the Group’s products 
develops as anticipated, the Group 
may face severe competition from other 
businesses offering similar products 
and services and there can therefore 
be no assurance that the Group will 
be able to secure customers for its 
products and services on acceptable 
terms and conditions, or successfully 
adjust the Group’s strategy to meet 
the changing market dynamics. 
The Group is also entering new 
international markets and not all of 
these markets may be at the same 
stage of development. The Group 
may face competition from other local 
businesses in those territories offering 
similar products and services and there 
can therefore be no assurance that the 
Group will be able to secure customers 
for its services on acceptable terms and 
conditions, or successfully adjust the 
Group’s strategy to meet the different 
dynamics of these new markets. 
These risks are mitigated by the 
strength and experience of the 
Group’s management team.
Technological changes could 
overtake the products being 
developed by the Group
The Group’s business is dependent 
upon technology which could be 
superseded by superior technology, 
more competitively priced technology 
or a shift in retail practices which could 
affect both the potential profitability 
and the saleability of the Group’s 
product offering. Staying abreast of 
technological changes may require 
substantial investment. The Group’s 
existing software products need to 
develop continually in order to meet 
customer requirements. The Group may 
encounter delays and incur additional 
development and production costs 
and expenses, over and above those 
expected by the Directors, in order 
to develop suitable technologies and 
products. The technology used in the 
Group’s products is still evolving and 
is highly complex and may change 
rapidly. Research and development by 
other companies may render any of 
the Group’s products in development, 
or currently available, obsolete. This 
risk is primarily mitigated by the quality 
of the technical staff recruited.
Protection of intellectual property
The Group’s success and ability 
to compete effectively are in large 
part dependent upon exploitation of 
proprietary technologies and products 
that the Group has developed internally, 
the Group’s ability to protect and enforce 
its intellectual property rights so as to 
preserve its exclusive rights in respect of 
those technologies and products, and its 
ability to preserve the confidentiality of 
its know-how. The Group relies primarily 
on enforcement of its pending and 
granted patents under applicable patent 
laws and non-disclosure agreements to 
protect its intellectual property rights. 
No assurance can be given that the 
Group will develop further technologies 
or products which are patentable, that 
patents will be sufficiently broad in 
their scope to provide protection for 
the Group’s intellectual property rights 
against third parties, or that patents 
will have been granted in all new 
territories which the Group enters.
Patents pending or future patent 
applications may not be granted and 
the lack of any such patents may 
have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s ability to develop and market 
its proposed products. Where patents 
have been granted the Group may not 
have the resources to protect any such 
issued patent from infringement. There 
is a significant delay between the time of 
filing of a patent application and the time 
its contents are made public, and others 
may have filed patent applications for 
subject matter covered by the Group’s 
pending patent applications without the 
Group being aware of those applications. 
The Group’s patent applications may 
not have priority over patent applications 
of others and its pending patent 
applications may not result in issued 
patents. Even if the Group obtains 
patents, they may not be valid or 
enforceable against others. Moreover, 
even if the Group receives patent 
protection for some or all of its products, 
those patents may not give the Group 
an advantage over competitors with 
similar products. Furthermore, the Group 
cannot patent much of the technology 
that is important to its business. If the 
Group fails to obtain adequate access 
to, or protection for, the intellectual 
property required to pursue its strategy, 
the Group’s competitors may be able 
to take advantage of the Group’s 
research and development efforts.
Once granted, a patent can be 
challenged both in the patent office 
and in the courts by third parties. 
Third parties can bring material and 
arguments which the patent office 
granting the patent may not have seen. 
Therefore, issued patents may be 
found by a court of law or by the patent 
office to be invalid or unenforceable 
or in need of further restriction. STRATEGIC REPORT

Financial review continued
Staff recruitment and retention
The ability to continue to attract and 
retain employees with the appropriate 
expertise and skills cannot be 
guaranteed. Finding and hiring any 
additional personnel and replacements 
could be costly and might require the 
Group to grant significant equity awards 
or other incentive compensation, which 
could adversely impact its financial 
results. The Group’s future development 
and prospects depend to a significant 
degree on the experience, performance 
and continued service of its senior 
management team. Effective product 
development and innovation, upon which 
the Group’s success is dependent, 
is in turn dependent upon attracting 
and retaining talented technical and 
marketing personnel, who represent a 
significant asset and serve as the source 
of the Group’s technological and product 
innovations. In addition, to continue to 
expand the Group’s customer base, 
increase sales and achieve growth 
generally, the Group will need to hire 
additional qualified sales personnel 
as well as recruit further personnel in 
administrative and operational support 
functions. If the Group is unable to hire, 
train and retain such personnel in a 
timely manner an undue burden could 
be placed on existing personnel, the 
development and introduction of the 
Group’s products could be delayed 
and its ability to sell its products and 
otherwise to grow its business could 
be impaired and the delay and inability 
may have a detrimental effect upon 
the performance of the Group.
Changes in applicable  
laws and regulations
Laws and regulations governing internet-
based services, related communication 
services and information technology, 
e-commerce, the processing of personal 
data (including the introduction of the 
General Data Protection Regulation 
in 2018), the processing of payment 
card data and mobile commerce in 
the UK and other territories continue 
to evolve and, depending on the 
evolution of such regulations, may 
adversely affect the Group’s business.
Exit of UK from European Union
The UK has voted in an advisory 
referendum to leave the European Union 
(commonly referred to as “Brexit”). 
The impact of the referendum and 
consequent triggering of Article 50 of the 
Lisbon Treaty is not yet clear, but it may 
significantly affect the fiscal, monetary 
and regulatory landscape in the UK, and 
could have a material impact on its 
economy and the future growth of its 
various industries. Depending on the exit 
terms negotiated between EU Member 
States and the UK following Brexit, the 
UK could lose access to the single 
European Union market and the global 
trade deals negotiated by the European 
Union on behalf of its members. Such a 
change in trade terms could affect 
the attractiveness of the UK as an 
investment centre and, as a result, 
could have a detrimental effect on UK 
companies. This may impact the Group’s 
ability to access funding in the future, 
and its prospects. Although it is not 
possible at this point in time to predict 
fully the effects of an exit of the UK from 
the European Union, it could have a 
material effect on the Group’s business, 
financial condition and results of 
operations. In particular, it may impact 
the Group’s ability to recruit suitably 
skilled staff for its UK-based operations.
Exchange rate risk
As its international operations grow, 
exchange rate fluctuations could 
have a material adverse effect on 
the Group’s profitability or the price 
competitiveness of its services. There 
can be no assurance that the Group 
would be able to compensate or 
hedge against such adverse effects 
and therefore negative exchange rate 
movements could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, 
prospects and financial performance.
Corporate social responsibility
The Group embraces working in a 
way that delivers financial, socially 
responsible and environmentally 
sustainable business performance 
and ensures adherence to the law and 
conducts its affairs to the highest ethical 
standards. We expect our customers 
and suppliers to embrace these same 
principles. The Group values teamwork, 
taking personal responsibility, positive 
attitudes and working hard to deliver 
positive outcomes for all our stakeholders 
– customers, staff and shareholders 
alike. We encourage the personal 
learning, growth and development of our 
team and voluntarily try to eliminate 
practices that harm the environment.

Corporate governance 
Principles of corporate governance
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate 
governance and confirm that although compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code is not compulsory for AIM 
companies, the Group is complying with the QCA Corporate 
Governance Code (as devised by the QCA in consultation with 
a number of significant institutional small company investors) to 
the extent appropriate and practical for a group of its nature 
and size. 
Board structure
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper 
management of the Group. A statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities is set out on page 24.
The Non-Executive Directors have a particular responsibility to 
ensure that the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors 
are fully considered.
The Board comprises of the Non-Executive Chairman, who 
was independent at the time of appointment, three Executive 
Directors and three other Non-Executive Directors. Of the 
Non-Executive Directors, the Board considers two to be 
independent Directors. All Non-Executive Directors receive 
a fixed fee for their services, other than Bill Currie.
The Board holds regular meetings and is responsible for 
formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, 
budgets and corporate actions and overseeing the Group’s 
progress towards its goals. 
 
Board committees
The Board has two committees with clearly defined terms 
of reference which are set by the Board. The role, work and 
members of the committees are outlined below:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Drew Thomson 
and consists of two Non-Executive Directors, Drew Thomson 
and Malcolm Wall. It is expected to meet no less than twice a 
year. Executive Directors may attend meetings at the 
Committee’s invitation. It is responsible for establishing a formal 
and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive 
remuneration and setting the remuneration packages of 
individual Directors. This includes agreeing with the Board the 
framework for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and 
such other members of the executive management of the 
Group as it is designated to consider. It is furthermore 
responsible for determining the total individual remuneration 
packages of each individual Director including, where 
appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the 
Board. No Director may be involved in any decision as to their 
own remuneration.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Bill Currie, and consists of 
two Non-Executive Directors, Bill Currie and Malcolm Wall. The 
Committee assists the Board in meeting its responsibilities in 
respect of corporate governance, external financial reporting 
and internal controls, including, amongst other things, 
reviewing the Group’s annual financial statements, reviewing 
and monitoring the extent of the non-audit services undertaken 
by external auditors, advising on the appointment of external 
auditors and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and risk management systems. The Audit Committee 
meets formally not less than three times every year and 
otherwise as required.
Internal control and risk management
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
controls and reviewing its effectiveness. 
Although, no system of internal control can completely 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives or 
provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss, the Group’s controls are designed to provide reasonable 
assurance over the reliability of financial information and the 
Group’s assets. 
The key controls are as follows:
• The Executive Directors have a close involvement with the 
day-to-day operations and, with the involvement of staff, 
identify business risks and monitor controls; 
• A risk register is maintained and reviewed by the Executive 
Directors on a regular basis; any high risks are mitigated by 
embedded controls; and
• There is a comprehensive process of financial reporting 
based on the annual budget that is approved by the Board. 
Monthly financial results are reported with analysis of key 
variances against expectations. 
There is currently no internal audit function as the Board 
considers that given the Group’s current stage of development, 
it is not necessary but this will be reviewed annually as the 
Group evolves. 
 
Relations with shareholders
Meetings with analysts and institutional shareholders are  
held following the interim and full year results and on an  
ad hoc basis. These meetings are usually held by the CEO  
and the CFO.
The Group’s informative website contains information to be of 
interest to new and existing investors. In addition, the Group 
retains the services of a financial PR consultancy, providing 
an additional contact avenue for investors.
There is an opportunity at the Annual General Meeting for 
individual shareholders to raise general business matters. 
Notice of the Annual General Meeting is provided at least  
21 days in advance of the meeting being held. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Eagle Eye Solutions Group plc
Annual Report 2017
Independent auditor’s report to the members of 
Eagle Eye Solutions Group plc
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Eagle Eye 
Solutions Group plc (the “parent company”) and its 
subsidiaries (the “group”) for the year ended 30 June 
2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of total 
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of 
financial position, the consolidated statement of changes in 
equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows and notes to 
the consolidated financial statements, including a summary 
of significant accounting policies, the company statement 
of financial position, the company statement of changes 
in equity and notes to the company financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the group financial statements is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements is applicable law 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including 
Financial Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland” 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
30 June 2017 and of the group’s loss for the year then 
ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the group and the parent company in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard as applied to SME listed entities and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you 
where:
• the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in the preparation of the financial statements is not 
appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements 
any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the group’s or the parent company’s ability to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
for a period of at least 12 months from the date when the 
financial statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or 
not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the 
greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue recognition 
(Refer to page 34 regarding the accounting policy in respect of 
revenue recognition, page 37 in respect of critical judgements 
and estimates applied by the Directors and note 3 to the 
financial statements on page 38)
The risk 
Appropriate and accurate income recognition is required 
to be applied by the Directors to ensure that revenue is 
recognised in accordance with IAS 18 “Revenue” within the 
financial statements. There is a risk that revenue could be 
inappropriately recognised depending on the stage of service 
delivery. In the year to 30 June 2017 revenue recognised 
amounted to £11,058k (2016: £6,458k).
Our response
We have conducted analytical work on revenue streams, 
performed additional cut-off testing on key revenue streams 
in order to identify any areas of material misstatement and 
challenged the appropriateness of judgments made by the 
Board regarding the revenue recognition criteria for key 
customer contracts.
Carrying values of intangibles and capitalisation of 
development costs
(Refer to page 35 regarding the accounting policy in respect of 
Internally-generated development intangible assets, page 37 
in respect of critical judgements and estimates applied by the 
Directors and note 9 to the financial statements on page 41.)
The risk
The capitalisation of development costs as an intangible asset 
requires the Board of Directors to demonstrate that six criteria 
as defined within IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” have all been met. 
At the 30 June 2017, there is £2,174k of intellectual property 
capitalised (2016: £2,174k) in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position.
The risk that the capitalisation of development costs may not 
be appropriate and may not adhere to the IAS 38 criteria is 
considered to be one of the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement due to its judgemental nature and the 
assessment the Board are required to make. Furthermore, the 
Board are required to establish a useful economic life for the 
assets in question and consider the carrying values of these 
assets, on an annual basis for any indicators of impairment.

Eagle Eye Solutions Group plc
Annual Report 2017
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are 
required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have elected under company law to prepare 
the Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and 
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the 
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c. for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the EU and for 
the Company financial statements state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the Company financial statements;
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the  
Group’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.

Our response
We have obtained an analysis of the constituent components 
of the capitalised development costs at the reporting date and 
re-performed the calculation of costs capitalised on a sample 
basis. We have also obtained an analysis of the new projects 
capitalised in the year and challenged the judgements made 
by the Board in their assessment of the capitalisation criteria.
In addition, we have challenged the assumptions over the 
remaining useful economic lives, and considered whether there 
are any indicators of impairment in light of our understanding of 
the projects undertaken and the business as a whole.
Carrying value of goodwill
(Refer to page 34 regarding the accounting policy in respect 
of goodwill, page 37 in respect of critical judgements and 
estimates applied by the Directors and note 9 to the financial 
statements on page 41.)
The risk
The Board of Directors are required to undertake an annual 
impairment review in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment 
of assets”.
This impairment review requires judgment in determining the 
cash generating units (“CGUs”) and estimating the value in use 
of the CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the 
value in use requires an assessment of the future cash flows of 
the cash generating units and discounting at an appropriate 
discount rate. At the 30 June 2017, there is £2,664k of goodwill 
capitalised (2016: £2,664k) in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position.
Our response 
As part of our procedures we challenged the Director’s 
rationale for changing the basis for identification of CGU’s 
compared to those identified in the previous period. In addition, 
we assessed the assumptions in relation to revenue and profit 
growth rates by considering historical trading performance, 
latest market expectations and considering probable and 
possible income streams taking into account current contracts, 
those that are in negotiation and additional potential growth. 
We also challenged the applied discount rate by considering 
the weighted average cost of capital for the Group, discount 
rates applied to other similar listed businesses, the rationale 
as to why it had reduced from the previous period and the 
sensitivity of the carrying value of the CGU to impairment 
should the discount rate be increased.
Share options
(Refer to page 36 regarding the accounting policy in respect 
of share-based payments, page 37 in respect of critical 
judgements and estimates applied by the Directors and 
note 17 to the financial statements on pages 47 to 48.)
The risk 
The calculation of the annual charge in accordance with IFRS 2 
“Share-based payment” to account for the share options that 
have been issued to certain members of Group staff requires 
estimates made by the Board. In the year to 30 June 2017 
there is a charge of £431k (2016: £632k) recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Total Comprehensive Income.
In accounting for share based payments there is a risk that 
the model applied is not appropriate and inputs subject to 
estimation are inappropriate.
Our response
We have considered the appropriateness of the models used 
and applied scepticism to the inputs used in the assessment 
of the share-based compensation charge through consultation 
with our internal valuation team.
In addition, we have further challenged the assertions made 
in the model in respect of employee service and performance 
vesting conditions and sensitised a range of alternative 
scenarios for these along with other assumptions used in 
the model.
Our application of materiality
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we set certain 
thresholds which help us to determine the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effects 
of misstatements, both individually and on the financial 
statements as a whole. During planning we determined a 
magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judge 
would be material for the financial statements as a whole 
(FSM). During planning FSM was calculated as £133,500, 
which was not changed during the course of our audit. We 
agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them all unadjusted differences in excess of £10,000, as 
well as differences below those thresholds that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group’s two significant components were subject to full 
scope audit procedures for group and statutory reporting 
purposes. We did not rely on the work of any component 
auditors. As part of our planning we assessed the risk of 
material misstatement including those that required significant 
auditor consideration at the component and group level. 
Procedures were then performed to address the risk identified 
and for the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement, the procedures performed are outlined 
above in the key audit matters section of this report.
As part of our planning we assessed the risk of material 
misstatement including those that required significant auditor 
consideration at the component and group level. Procedures 
were then performed to address the risk identified and for the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement, the 
procedures performed are outlined above in the key audit 
matters section of this report.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. 
The other information comprises the information included 
in the annual report, other than the financial statements and 
our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, except 
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or 
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in 
this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by  
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group 
and the parent company and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified material 
misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities 
statement set out on page 24, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal 
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of  
the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: http://www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our 
auditor’s report.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, and 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU and the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) that 
are effective or issued and early adopted as at the date of these financial statements and in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The loss before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and share-based payment charge is presented in the income statement as 
the Directors consider this performance measure provides a more accurate indication of the underlying performance of the Group 
and is commonly used by City analysts and investors.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying accounting 
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
financial information, are disclosed in note 2.
The presentational and functional currency of the Group is Sterling. Results in these financial statements have been prepared to 
the nearest £1,000.
New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 
1 July 2016 and not early adopted
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with effective dates as noted below:
Standard Key requirements
Effective date (for annual 
periods beginning on or after)
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments The standard is the first standard issued as part of a wider project to replace 
IAS 39. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and 
measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be 
classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value 
and those measured at amortised cost. The classification depends on the 
entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the 
instrument. The guidance in IAS 39 on impairment of financial assets and 
hedge accounting continues to apply. Having reviewed the nature of the 
Group’s financial instruments, the Directors do not expect adoption of this 
standard to have any impact on the results of the Group.
1 January 2018
IFRS 15, Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers 
The standard specifies how and when a company will recognise revenue as 
well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements with 
more informative, relevant disclosures. The standard provides a single, 
principles based, five-step model to be applied to all contracts with 
customers. The Directors have commenced initial reviews of the Group’s 
material contracts with Tier 1 grocers, applying the five-step model, and are 
considering the Group’s other customer contracts however have not yet 
concluded whether the adoption of this standard will have any impact on the 
revenue reported by the Group.
1 January 2018
IFRS 16, Leases The standard requires lessees to account for leases under a single on-
balance sheet model in a similar way to finance leases under IAS 17. At the 
commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make 
lease payments and an asset representing the right to use the underlying 
asset during the lease term. Lessees will be required to separately recognise 
the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on 
the right of use asset. The Group’s leases primarily relate to its office 
accommodation. The Directors expect that the adoption of this standard will 
increase the Group’s non-current assets, current and long-term liabilities in 
the statement of financial position. In the income statement, operating 
expenses will be reduced, amortisation and interest expense will be 
increased. This amount has not yet been quantified.
1 January 2019
Standard Key requirements
Effective date (for annual 
periods beginning on or after)
Amendments to IAS 7, 
Disclosure Initiative 
The amendments require additional disclosures to be made regarding 
changes in liabilities arising from financing activities to enable users of 
financial statements to better understand changes in the Group’s debt. 
Having reviewed the Group’s liabilities, the Directors do not expect adoption 
of these amendments to have a material impact on the Group.
1 January 2017
Amendments to IAS 12, 
Recognition of Deferred Tax 
The amendments clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law 
restricts the sources of taxable profits against which it may make deductions 
on the reversal of unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair 
value. As the Group currently has no debt instruments measured at fair value, 
the Directors do not expect adoption of these amendments to have an 
impact on the Group.
1 January 2017
IFRIC 22, Foreign Currency 
Transactions and Advance 
Consideration
The interpretation clarifies that in determining the spot exchange rate to use 
on initial recognition of a related asset, expense or income on the 
derecognition of a non-monetary asset or liability relating to advance 
consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which an entity 
initially recognises the non-monetary asset or liability arising from the 
advance consideration. As the Group has not been involved in any 
transactions including advance consideration in foreign currencies, the 
Directors do not expect adoption of this interpretation to have an impact on 
the Group.
1 January 2018
Annual improvements to 
IFRSs 2014-2016
The 2016 Annual improvements cycle covered amendments to IFRS 1 
First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 28 
Investments in Associated and Joint Ventures and IFRS 12 Disclosure of 
Interests in Other Entities. The Directors do not expect adoption of these 
amendments to have an impact on the Group.
1 January 2019
There are no other IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations or amendments that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material 
impact on the Group.
Going concern
As part of their going concern review the Directors have followed the guidelines published by the Financial Reporting Council 
entitled “Guidance on Risk Management and Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting”.
The Directors have prepared detailed financial forecasts and cash flows looking beyond 12 months from the date of approval of 
these consolidated financial statements. In developing these forecasts the Directors have made assumptions based upon their 
view of the current and future economic conditions that will prevail over the forecast period.
On the basis of the above projections, the Directors are confident that the Group has sufficient working capital to honour all of its 
obligations to creditors as and when they fall due. In reaching this conclusion, the Directors have considered the forecast cash 
headroom, the resources available to the Group and the potential impact of changes in forecast growth and other assumptions, 
including the potential to avoid or defer certain costs and to reduce discretionary spend as mitigating actions in the event of such 
changes. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial 
statements.
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 June 
each year. Subsidiaries are entities where the Company has: power over the entity; exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity; and the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of its returns. The Group generally 
obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
The results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated from the date on which control passed under the acquisition method. This 
involves the recognition at fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the acquisition date. These 
fair values are also used as the bases for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

1 Accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of the Group’s services, excluding 
VAT, and is recognised at the point that the services have been delivered. Revenue is recognised when the amount of revenue can 
be reliably measured, when it is probable that future economic benefits can flow to the Group and when specific criteria have been 
met for each of the activities as described below:
Development and set up fees are recognised on a percentage of completion basis using estimates. A development project can 
take a number of months and where such a project spans a period end, the Group recognises accrued income on the statement 
of financial position to reflect the service provided on a stage of completion basis. 
Subscription fees are recognised on a monthly basis and are invoiced on a monthly, quarterly, bi-annual or annual basis. Where 
invoices are raised in advance, a portion is recognised in deferred income in the statement of financial position. 
Transactional fees are linked to transactional volumes and are recognised as the transactions occur. 
Operating loss
Operating loss comprises the Group’s revenue for the provision of services, less the costs of providing those services and 
administrative overheads, including depreciation and amortisation of the Group’s non-current assets. 
Accounting for joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities which are jointly controlled. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of 
accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is originally recognised at cost and the carrying amount is increased or 
decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit and loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s 
investment in joint ventures includes any goodwill to the extent identified on acquisition.
If the ownership interest in a joint venture is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the income statement where appropriate.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the 
investment. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, including any 
other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is 
impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount 
of the joint venture and its carrying amount and recognises the impairment in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Purchased property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment 
losses. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition 
for its intended use. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the costs of assets over their estimated useful lives, on the 
following bases:
Computer equipment  2 to 4 years, straight-line
Office furniture and fittings  3 to 5 years, straight-line
The economic lives of assets are reviewed by the Directors on at least an annual basis and are amended as appropriate.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on business combinations represents the difference between the consideration for a business acquisition and the 
fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, less any accumulated impairment losses. The consideration for a business 
acquisition represents the fair value of assets given and equity instruments issued in return for the assets acquired. Goodwill is not 
amortised but is subject to an impairment review which is performed at least annually.
Assets acquired as part of a business combination
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is deemed to have a 
cost to the Group of its fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value of the intangible assets reflects expectations about the 
probability that future economic benefits from the asset will flow to the Group. These costs are amortised on a straight-line basis 
based upon the Directors’ estimate of their useful economic lives of three years.
Internally-generated development intangible assets
An internally-generated development intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development is recognised if, and only if, 
the Group can demonstrate all of the following:
• the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale
• its intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it
• its ability to use or sell the intangible asset
• how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits
• the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the 
intangible asset
• its ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development
Internally-generated development intangible assets are amortised as an administrative cost on a straight-line basis over their useful 
lives of three years.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, research and development expenditure is recognised as an 
expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets annually to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, 
the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. In the case of a cash-generating unit, any 
impairment loss is charged first to any goodwill in the cash-generating unit and then pro rata to the other assets of the cash-
generating unit.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are de-recognised when the contracted rights to the cash 
flows from the financial asset expire or when the contracted rights to those assets are transferred. Financial liabilities are de-
recognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. 
Financial assets
(a) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value. Appropriate provisions for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when there is objective evidence that the assets are impaired. Trade and 
other receivables are shown in note 15 as “loans and receivables”.
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits held on call with banks. Cash and cash equivalents are 
shown in note 15 as “loans and receivables”. 
Financial liabilities and equity 
(c) Trade and other payables
Trade payables are recognised at their fair value. Trade and other payables are shown in note 15 as “other financial liabilities”. 
(d) Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of issue costs. 
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to profit or loss on a 
straight-line basis over the expected period of the lease.

1 Accounting policies continued
Employee benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution auto-enrolment pension scheme for employees of the Group. The assets of the 
scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. The pension costs charged in the 
income statement are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Current and deferred income tax
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit or loss for the year in each territory. Taxable profit or loss differs from the profit 
or loss for the financial year as reported in the statement of total comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The 
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees as consideration for services. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments 
granted. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is recognised as an expense over the 
vesting period on a straight-line basis, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of instruments that will eventually vest with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity. The expected life used in the valuation is adjusted, based on the Directors’ best estimate, for 
the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Non-vesting and market vesting conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the options at grant date. 
Service and non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of options expected to vest at each 
reporting date.
When the options are exercised the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors that makes strategic decisions.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
• Share capital, representing the nominal value of shares of the Company;
• Share premium, representing the excess over the nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for shares, net of 
expenses of the share issue;
• Merger reserve, representing the excess of the Company’s investment over the nominal value of Eagle Eye Solutions Limited’s 
shares acquired using the principles of merger accounting;
• Share option reserve, representing the cost of equity-settled share-based payments until such share options are 
exercised or lapse; and
• Retained losses.
2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements and estimates that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at each reporting date and the reported amounts of revenue during the reporting 
periods. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these 
estimates. Information about such judgements and estimations are contained in individual accounting policies. The key 
judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty that could cause an adjustment to be required to the carrying amount of assets 
or liabilities within the next accounting period are outlined below:
Impairment of internally-generated intangible assets
An impairment review of the Group’s development costs is undertaken at least annually. This review involves the use of judgement 
to consider the future projected income streams that will result from the aforementioned costs. The expected future cash flows are 
modelled and discounted over the expected life of the assets in order to test for impairment. In the years represented in these 
consolidated financial statements no impairment charge was recognised as a result of these reviews. 
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill arising on acquisitions is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation 
of the “value in use” of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value in use amount requires the 
Directors to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
The Group’s patented, proprietary technology and service offering are unique and there are therefore no direct competitors 
against whom forecast growth and discount rates can be compared. Therefore the growth and discount rates are selected based 
on comparison with those of the Group’s partners and those companies that the Group is compared with by City analysts and 
investors. 
The actual cash flows may be different from the Directors’ estimates, which could impact the carrying value of the goodwill and 
therefore operating results negatively. The value of goodwill at 30 June 2017 is £2.7m (2016: £2.7m).
Revenue recognition
Where the Group is providing material development services, development fees are recognised in line with percentage completion 
of work performed towards milestones. Percentage completion is determined based on completion of individual deliverables 
within the entire project or relevant milestone as appropriate on the basis of planned work associated with that deliverable. 
Milestones and the Directors’ estimate of percentage completion may differ, which could impact operating results positively or 
negatively. At 30 June 2017, unbilled but contracted revenue of £148,000 (2016: £161,000) has been recognised for development 
fees recognised on a percentage completion basis.
Share-based payment charge
The Group issues share options to certain employees. The Black-Scholes and Binomial models are used to calculate the 
appropriate charge for these options. The choice and use of these models to calculate a charge involves using a number of 
estimates and judgements to establish the appropriate inputs to be entered into the model, covering areas such as the use of an 
appropriate interest rate and dividend rate, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. A significant element of 
judgement is therefore involved in the calculation of the charge.
The total charge recognised in the year to 30 June 2017 is £431,000 (2016: £632,000). Further information on share options can 
be found in note 17.
Deferred tax asset recognition
The Directors’ judgement is required to determine the amount of tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing 
and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. The carrying value of 
the unrecognised tax losses at 30 June 2017 was £22.6m (2016: £17.7m). Although the tax losses carried forward are not 
expected to expire, given the Group’s history of recent losses and continued investment for growth, recovery of any element of 
this asset is expected to be at least two years from the date of these financial statements and therefore in the judgement of the 
Directors the tax losses carried forward do not meet the “probable” definition criteria for an asset within IAS 12. The value of the 
deferred tax asset not recognised at 30 June 2017 was £4.3m (2016: £3.5m) Further information on the Group’s deferred tax 
position can be found in note 14.

8 Loss per share
The calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is based on the result attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number of shares for the purpose of 
calculating the basic and diluted measures is the same. This is because the outstanding share options would have the effect of 
reducing the loss per ordinary share and therefore would be anti-dilutive. Basic and diluted loss per share from continuing 
operations is calculated as follows:

The Group’s intellectual property relates to its internally developed AIR platform and the acquired intellectual property of 2ergo 
Limited which consisted of a then stand-alone messaging platform and an app and customer interface loyalty solution, both of 
which have now been integrated within the AIR platform.
The Group’s goodwill relates to its acquisition of 2ergo Limited on 16 April 2014. Following the successful integration of the 
acquired 2ergo business, the Group has one identifiable cash-generating unit in the UK. An annual impairment review of the 
goodwill arising on the 2ergo acquisition has therefore been performed for the UK cash-generating unit. The recoverable value of 
the unit has been based on its value in use. The cash flow projections, which were based on three-year forecasts approved by the 
Directors and then extended to cover a five-year period with a terminal value assumed, supported the carrying value of goodwill 
and the Group’s intellectual property with no impairment required.

In the prior year the acquired 2ergo business was not fully integrated and therefore it was possible to identify a separate 
messaging cash-generating unit. With messaging now fully integrated the smallest cash-generating unit which the goodwill relates 
to is the UK cash-generating unit.
The key assumptions underlying the forecast are the continued success in winning new business and the discount rate applied. 
These assumptions are based on management’s experience and the historical success of the cash-generating unit. As the 
Group’s SaaS AIR platform is a unique solution in the marketplace there are no directly comparable companies to compare 
against when estimating the discount and growth rates to be applied. The rates chosen are estimated considering those used 
by the Group’s partners and other entities that the Group is compared with by City analysts and investors.
The forecast for the unit provides sufficient headroom over the value of goodwill and intangible assets attributed to the  
cash-generating unit. The Group has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill.

11 Investments
Investment in joint ventures
The Group holds an interest in the ordinary share capital of Australian company Eagle Eye Solutions (Asia Pacific) Pty Limited of 
51%. The company was established in order to sell the Eagle Eye AIR platform in the Asia Pacific market and was granted a 
licence by Eagle Eye Solutions Limited in order to sell the platform in these territories, under which an income stream based on 
sales was due to Eagle Eye Solutions Limited. The Group has not provided any funding to Eagle Eye Solutions (Asia Pacific) Pty 
Limited since its original investment in the share capital of £51 and due to the losses made, has not invoiced the company for 
revenue due to it under the terms of the licence agreement. As the Group is not required to fund any losses made by Eagle Eye 
Solutions (Asia Pacific) Pty Limited the Directors believe that they are unable to evidence that they have the power over the entity, 
nor have rights or exposure to variable returns from the entity nor have the ability to use power over the entity to affect the amount 
of returns. As such and in accordance with IFRS 11: Joint Arrangements, the Directors have treated this investment as a joint 
venture and have accounted for this interest as a jointly controlled entity using the principles of equity accounting as set out below:

In the year ended 30 June 2012, the Directors reviewed the losses made and determined that the investment in Eagle Eye 
Solutions (Asia Pacific) Pty Limited was impaired, writing it down to £nil. Having reviewed the performance of Eagle Eye Solutions 
(Asia Pacific) Pty Limited the Directors have determined that this treatment remains appropriate.

the aim of minimising the Group’s exposure to bad debts. The Group has reviewed in detail all items comprising the above not 
past due and overdue but not impaired trade receivables to ensure that no impairment exists. As at 30 June 2017, trade 
receivables of £22,000 (2016: £31,000) were impaired and provided for, all of which were more than two months old (2016: more 
than two months old). The amount of the provision was £18,000 as at 30 June 2017 (2016: £26,000). Movements on the provision

15 Financial instruments and financial risk management
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign 
exchange risk and capital risk. 
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group from which financial instrument risk arises are as follows:
• Trade and other receivables
• Cash and cash equivalents
• Trade and other payables

Other financial liabilities
Trade and other payables 2,828 1,690
Disclosures in respect of the Group’s financial risks are set out below:
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to credit, liquidity and foreign exchange risks. The Group’s overall risk management programme 
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial 
performance.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from trade receivables from customers and cash deposits with financial institutions. 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. Credit checks are 
performed on new and potential customers and receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the aim of minimising 
the Group’s exposure to bad debt. The Directors consider the above measures to be sufficient to control the credit risk exposure.
The Group gives careful consideration to which organisations it uses for its banking services in order to minimise credit risk. At the 
reporting date, the Group’s cash held on short-term deposit with Barclays Bank plc in the United Kingdom was £3,717,000 (2016: 
£28,000) and with HSBC Bank plc in the United Kingdom was £7,000 (2016: £1,294,000).
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements represents the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk without taking into account the value of any collateral obtained. In the Directors’ opinion there have been no 
impairments of financial assets in the period, other than in relation to trade receivables written off of £4,000 (2016: £26,000).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages its 
cash flows to ensure that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or damage to the Group’s reputation.
During the year the Group extended its three year revolving loan facility with Barclays to £3.0m (2016: £1.5m), secured on the 
Group’s assets. At 30 June 2017 this facility is not currently utilised.
The Directors manage liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the Group’s cash requirements by reference to short-term cash flow 
forecasts and medium-term working capital projections prepared by management.

15 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued
Foreign exchange risk
The vast majority of the Group’s revenues and costs are in Sterling (the Company’s functional currency) and involve no currency 
risk. Activities in currencies other than Sterling are funded as much as possible through operating cash flows, mitigating foreign 
exchange risk. The Group has the following cash and cash equivalent deposits:
2017 
£000
2016 
£000
Sterling 3,674 1,136
Canadian Dollars 50 186
3,724 1,322
The gross value of receivables and payables by currency is disclosed in notes 12 and 13 respectively. The Group has the following 
net other financial instruments:
2017 
£000
2016 
£000
Sterling (131) (382)
Canadian Dollars 301 244
170 (138)
A 5% change in the currency translation rate between Sterling and Canadian Dollars would have the following effect on the 
Group’s net assets and loss before tax:
2017 
£000
2016 
£000
Net assets 21 15
Loss before tax 48 14
Maturity of financial assets and liabilities
All of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities at each reporting date are either receivable or payable within one year.
Capital management 
The Group’s capital structure is comprised entirely of shareholders’ equity. The objective of the Group when managing capital is to 
maintain adequate financial flexibility to preserve its ability to meet financial obligations, both current and long term. The capital 
structure is managed and adjusted to reflect changes in economic conditions. The Group funds its expenditures on commitments 
from existing cash and cash equivalent balances, primarily received from operating cash flows, issuances of shareholders’ equity 
and from the revolving credit facility with Barclays. There are no externally imposed capital requirements. Financing decisions are 
made by the Directors based on forecasts of the expected timing and level of capital and operating expenditure required to meet 
the Group’s commitments and development plans.

1p ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of employee share options. The total number of shares issued on these dates was 
511,374.
On 12 June 2017 the Company issued 2,666,667 1p ordinary shares pursuant to a placing of its shares on AIM, to build on UK 
success achieved to date, target expansion in Canada and North America from the Group’s existing relationship and to capitalise 
on the opportunity in Europe.
Merger reserve
The acquisition of its principal subsidiary by the Group in 2014 did not meet the definition of a business combination and therefore 
fell outside the scope of IFRS 3. The acquisition was therefore accounted for in accordance with the principles of merger 
accounting as set out in Financial Reporting Standard 6 – Acquisitions and Mergers.
The consideration paid to the shareholders of Eagle Eye Solutions Limited was 13,641,384 ordinary shares of 1p each. A merger 
reserve arises on consolidation being the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued on acquisition and the net 
assets acquired.
17 Share option schemes
The Company has a share option scheme for certain employees and Directors of the Group. Options are generally exercisable at a 
price equal to the market price of the Company’s shares on the day immediately prior to the date of grant. Options are forfeited if 
the employee or Director leaves the Group before the options vest. The service and performance criteria relating to the options are 
the continuing employment of the holder and the achievement of certain earnings based performance criteria and in the case of 
the LTIP Share Option Scheme, the performance of the Company’s share price.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, and in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. These financial statements conform to FRS 102.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying accounting 
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
financial information, are disclosed in note 2.
In accordance with FRS 102, the Company has taken advantage of the exemptions from the following disclosure requirements;
• Section 7 “Statement of Cash Flows” – Presentation of a Statement of Cash Flow and related notes and disclosures
• Section 11 “Basic Financial Instruments” and Section 12 “Other Financial Instrument Issues” – Carrying amounts, interest 
income/expense and net gains/losses for each category of financial instrument; basis of determining fair values; details of 
collateral, loan defaults or breaches, details of hedges, hedging fair value changes recognised in profit or loss and in other 
comprehensive income.
• Section 26 “Share-based Payment” – Sections 26.18(b), 26.18 and 26.23
• Section 33 “Related Party Disclosures” – Compensation for key management personnel
The presentational and functional currency of the Company is Sterling. Results in these financial statements have been prepared 
to the nearest £1,000.
Going concern
As part of their going concern review the Directors have followed the guidelines published by the Financial Reporting Council 
entitled “Guidance on Risk Management and Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting”.
The Directors have prepared detailed financial forecasts and cash flows looking beyond 12 months from the date of approval of 
these financial statements. In developing these forecasts the Directors have made assumptions based upon their view of the 
current and future economic conditions that will prevail over the forecast period.
On the basis of the above projections, the Directors are confident that the Company has sufficient working capital to honour all of 
its obligations to creditors as and when they fall due. In reaching this conclusion, the Directors have considered the forecast cash 
headroom, the resources available to the Company and the potential impact of changes in forecast growth and other assumptions, 
including the potential to avoid or defer certain costs and to reduce discretionary spend as mitigating actions in the event of such 
changes. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Investments
Investments held by the Company are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in the Company’s financial statements.
Impairment of investments
The Company reviews the carrying values of its investments annually to determine whether there is any indication that those 
investments have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the investment is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the investment for 
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an investment is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the investment 
is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Company becomes party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are de-recognised when the contracted rights to the cash flows from 
the financial asset expire or when the contracted rights to those assets are transferred. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when 
the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.

1 Accounting policies continued
Financial assets
(a) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value. Appropriate provisions for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when there is objective evidence that the assets are impaired. 
(b) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits held on call with banks. 
Financial liabilities and equity 
(c) Trade and other payables
Trade payables are recognised at their fair value. 
(d) Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of issue costs. 
Current income tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable loss for the year. Taxable loss differs from the loss for the financial year as reported 
in the statement of total comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in 
other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees of the Group as consideration for services. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments granted. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is recognised as an 
expense for employees of the Company, or as an investment in the subsidiary entity employing the relevant employees otherwise, 
over the vesting period on a straight-line basis, based on the Directors’ estimate of the number of instruments that will eventually 
vest with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The expected life used in the valuation is adjusted, based on the Directors’ best 
estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Non-vesting and market vesting conditions are taken into account when estimating the fair value of the options at grant date. 
Service and non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of options expected to vest at each 
reporting date.
When the options are exercised the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
• Share capital, representing the nominal value of shares of the Company;
• Share premium, representing the excess over the nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for shares, net of 
expenses of the share issue;
• Share option reserve, representing the cost of equity-settled share-based payments until such share options are exercised 
or lapse; and
• Retained losses.
2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of these financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements and estimates that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at each reporting date. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Information about such judgements and estimations are 
contained in individual accounting policies. The key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty that could cause an 
adjustment to be required to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities within the next accounting period are outlined over:
Impairment of investments
An impairment review of the Company’s investments in its subsidiaries is undertaken at least annually. This review involves the 
use of judgement to consider the future projected income streams that will result from those investments. The expected future 
cash flows are modelled and discounted over the expected life of the investments in order to test for impairment. In the years 
represented in these financial statements no impairment charge was recognised as a result of these reviews. 
Share-based payment charge
The Company issues share options to certain employees of the Group. The Black-Scholes and Binomial models are used to 
calculate the appropriate charge for these options. The use of these models to calculate a charge involves using a number of 
estimates and judgements to establish the appropriate inputs to be entered into the model, covering areas such as the use of 
an appropriate interest rate and dividend rate, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. A significant element of 
judgement is therefore involved in the calculation of the charge.
The total charge recognised by the Company in the year to 30 June 2017 is £43,000 (2016: £199,000) with a capital contribution 
in a subsidiary company of £388,000 (2016: £433,000). Further information on share options can be found in note 17 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
3 Loss of the parent company
The Company has not presented its own income statement as permitted by section 408 (4) of the Companies Act 2006. The loss 
for the financial year dealt with in the accounts of the Company is £490,000 (2016: £519,000).
4 Particulars of staff
The Company had no staff during the year or the prior year, other than Directors. Details of Directors’ remuneration are contained

may cast), members must be registered in the register of members of the Company at 6.30 p.m. on 7 November 2017 (or, in the 
event of any adjournment, no later than 6.30 p.m. on the date which is two days before the time of the adjourned meeting 
(weekends and public holidays excluded)). Changes to the register of members after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded 
in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
7. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint 
holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
8. If a member submits more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt 
of proxies will take precedence.
9. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
