chairman’s statement
The Board is pleased to report on a busy and successful year for the Group, which saw the business undergo a complete 
transformation to a Managed Services provider, delivering against our stated strategic objectives for the 2017 financial year. 
At the same time the Group achieved impressive growth in line with market expectations, delivering an increase in Group 
revenue of 65.1%, including 19.8% organic growth. 
The Group’s transformation consisted of the acquisition of Systems Professional Limited (“Sys-Pro”) in early July, 
complementing the Group’s existing managed services business, and an associated re-branding of the business from 
Daily Internet Plc to SysGroup Plc. This, combined with the subsequent disposal of the Company’s legacy, non-core 
SME Mass Market hosting division, resulted in the formation of a business focused exclusively on servicing the high value 
managed services market, with a strong focus on cloud.  
To facilitate the funding of the Sys-Pro, the Group completed an oversubscribed placing in July raising £5.0m gross and 
bringing a number of new institutional shareholders onto the Company’s register. In conjunction with the placing and 
acquisition, the Company also undertook a 40 for 1 share consolidation and sought court approval for the cancellation of 
its share premium account, leaving the parent company able to pay dividends in the future should it be appropriate to do 
so (see note 22).
In order to support the new business composition and operational focus, a number of organisational changes were 
implemented to restructure the Group, including the appointment of Julian Llewellyn as CFO and Amy Yateman-Smith as 
Non-Executive Director. I would like to welcome both Julian and Amy to the Board and I look forward to working with them 
as we continue to execute our growth strategy. 
The Board believes the Group now has in place the right platform, expertise and focused service offering to capitalise on a 
substantial market opportunity. The Managed Services market continues to evolve and remains highly fragmented, and the 
Board believes that a strategy of organic growth and targeted acquisitions, supported by the Group’s strong gross cash 
position of £3.5m and unutilised £2.5m acquisition facility, will deliver sustained, long-term value for shareholders. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their commitment and dedication to the business. We 
have started the new financial year with an improved operational structure and strong financial footing, which, combined 
with increasing levels of recurring revenue, leaves me optimistic for the Group’s growth prospects ahead.

chief executive officer’s report
Introduction
The year to 31 March 2017 has been a year of both significant progress and change for SysGroup plc.
The acquisition of System Professional Ltd (“Sys-Pro”) in July 2016 and subsequent disposal of the SME Mass Market 
business unit in the same month marked the firm transition to a Cloud and Managed Services business.
These were large undertakings for our business as firstly we acquired a business which had higher revenue and staff 
numbers than ourselves and then disposed of a business which represented almost half of the Group’s size, before the 
acquisition of Sys-Pro.
Subsequent to the transactions, we reorganised the combined businesses and made several changes to the management 
team.  We have created internal teams for managing the integration and have created liaisons between teams to maximise 
the cross-selling opportunity to customers to take advantage of the increased range of services from our growing product 
portfolio.
Not only did this work to create a business that is now focused on Managed Services with a cloud bias but it allowed us to 
put in place the foundations to better take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves in this growing market.
The above corporate activity was in line with the Board’s stated strategy to exit from a light-touch, low margin and high 
volume mass hosting market, which was largely commoditised and subject to high customer churn, to a business focused 
exclusively on providing higher value Managed Services.
Notwithstanding the management time that was involved in this, we maintained focus on the core business and delivered 
results in line with market expectations for FY 2017.
Our revenues (from continuing and discontinued operations) in the year were £7.87m, an increase of 65.3% on the 
previous year (2016: £4.76m).  Our adjusted EBITDA (from continuing and discontinued operations) increased by 22.7% to 
£0.81m (2016: £0.66m) and our adjusted profit before tax increased from £0.31m in 2016 to £0.45m representing a 45.2% 
increase. At the year-end, we had a healthy net cash position of £3.07m.
We believe that the foundations are now firmly laid for us to capture growth in our chosen markets and complement these 
with carefully considered acquisitions.
Market
The market for managed and cloud services is large and long term, driven by the structural move to cloud delivered 
solutions and IT outsourcing in general. IT is no longer seen as a cost base but is something which can really help drive 
profits and efficiencies in businesses, and corporations are embracing technologies that will put them at a commercial 
advantage compared with a competitor.
This desire to embrace the best of breed technologies which can drive these efficiencies means that knowledge of 
better, more cost effective, reliable and secure solutions in a changing environment drives customers to partner with us 
as we help guide and advise them along their journey.  We become part of our customers’ IT function and our close and 
increasing engagement with them is demonstrated by an overall net increase in customer spend year on year for the past 
three years.
strategic report SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 10
Our Managed Service offerings include all forms of Cloud hosting (private, public and hybrid) but also outsourced service 
desk and various IT consulting services including public cloud (Azure and AWS services).  Our Managed Services revenue 
is predominantly derived from Cloud and this element of our service is growing at the fastest rate, with organic growth of 
19.8% in 2017.
Strategy
SysGroup’s clear focus is to expand its position as a trusted provider of managed services and expert IT consultancy 
to clients in the UK and Ireland. We have positioned the Group as an extension to a customer’s existing IT department 
guiding them through the complexities and developments in the market.
Our target market is servicing the UK corporate sector that has traditionally managed and housed their own IT 
infrastructure on premise.  We operate in a variety of vertical sectors but have weighting in not for profit, education, health 
services, financial services, insurance, technology and merchant and distribution sectors with a variety of well-known 
clients in these verticals.
Being a Visa Level 1 PCI-DSS service provider (highest level) and with our ISO9001 and ISO27001 credentials we are an 
attractive partner to anyone who wishes to ensure platforms are built and maintained to the highest of security standards.
Our IT consulting services often result in customers taking Cloud services from us, and the legacy VAR (Value Added 
Reseller) element of the Sys-Pro business provides a feeder of cloud and managed service opportunities as customers 
favour OPEX over CAPEX models and the flexibilities that offers.
Along with seeking to engage with larger spending customers who have a specific need for a large custom built cloud 
platform we also seek to engage with customers in our chosen markets who are at different stages of their IT journey.  
This can initially be by partnering with us for functions like our monitoring services, remote service desk, backup and 
disaster recovery services.  As our customers develop, the opportunity grows and results in more of their services 
being outsourced to us. The result is that these customers can be very sticky in nature as the increased level of services 
provided by the Group creates a greater reliance on the Group and significant barrier to entry for competitors. Customers 
typically sign up for a contract period of one to three years, with larger contracts tending to be three years.
We intend to supplement our organic growth with carefully considered acquisitions.
Acquisitions
In July 2016 the Group acquired Sys-Pro for an initial consideration of £4.0m, paid 85% cash and 15% in new ordinary 
shares at 60 pence per share,  funded by way of a placing raising £5.0m gross. There have been certain operational 
challenges at Sys-Pro since its acquisition but overall integration of the business into the Group is continuing and was 
accelerated just prior to the year end, with a number of important milestones already reached.
During the period the Group secured new banking facilities with Santander UK plc. The facilities comprise a £2.5m 
Revolving Credit Term Loan Facility to finance acquisitions alongside a £0.5 million overdraft facility and a £0.5m finance 
leasing facility.  
In line with the Group’s stated growth strategy, the Board remains alert to strategic acquisition opportunities to supplement 
organic growth. In a fragmented market, we believe we are well placed to make further astute acquisitions given our size 
and funding availability.  SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 11
Disposal
On 22 July 2016 the Group announced the disposal of its SME Mass Market business for a total consideration of £2.7m in 
cash, less an amount of £0.5m in respect of advance receipts/payments.
As this business was based in the Group’s former head office in Nottingham a necessary reorganisation occurred and a 
new finance function was established in the Liverpool office of the Group.  
Operational Review
All of the Group’s activities relate to delivering IT Managed Services with a Cloud bias along with consulting.  The Group 
is segmented into Managed Services, VAR and SME Mass Market.  The SME Mass Market division was discontinued 
following completion of the disposal of this division on 18 July 2016, and is therefore shown as discontinued in the table 
below.  Managed Services segment consists of all the activities of Netplan Internet Solutions Ltd and that of Sys-Pro but 
excluding its VAR business.
The SME Mass Market and System Professional Ltd businesses are included in the results to their respective date of 
disposal or acquisition.
We have introduced a new operating segment of VAR. This is legacy activity from which Sys-Pro built its business.  
Traditionally Sys-Pro was a provider of hardware and software but has followed the transformation to Cloud and IT 
Managed Services and was at the beginning but established level of the curve in converting its traditional ‘on premise’ 
customers to Cloud delivered solutions.  We continue our work educating our traditional customers of the benefits of Cloud 
delivered services and the concept of moving from a CAPEX to an OPEX model.  Market drivers and overall trend underline 
the substantial opportunity to us in this base.  We expect the VAR segment to decrease as customers continue to shift to 
Managed Services.

Key Performance Indicator Review
Revenue Growth 2017 2016
Revenue (continuing) £7.165m £2.515m
Growth 184.9% 22.0%
Revenue from continuing operations grew by 184.9% driven by Managed Services and the acquisition of System 
Professional Ltd.  SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 12
Adjusted EBITDA (including discontinued activities) improved 22.7% to £0.81m (2016: £0.66m).
The growth in Adjusted EBITDA is a combination of improved performance from the Netplan business unit and from 
contribution from Sys-Pro (acquired in the period)
Performance Review
Group revenue for the year grew by 65.3% to £7.865m for the year to 31 March 2017 (2016: £4.764m). Revenue growth 
was driven by the Managed Services division, which consists of the Netplan brand (incorporating Q4Ex) and the System 
Professional brand (acquired in the year), contributing revenues of £7.165m (2016: £2.52m).  The SME Mass Market division 
generated revenues of £0.7m (2016: £2.2m) before being divested. 
We continue to have good visibility of future revenues as the vast majority of our customers have entered into multi-year 
contracts. As at 31 March 2017 there is £0.47m of deferred revenue (2016: £0.71m) which will be released to profit in future 
periods. 
Gross profit for the year on continuing and discontinued operations was £4.82m (2016: £3.01m) representing a gross 
margin of 61.3% (2016: 63.2%). The reduction in gross margin is attributable to the change of sales mix during the year and 
the slower conversion of Sys-Pro VAR customers into Managed Services revenue. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) for the year to 31 March 2017 is 
£0.81m (2016: £0.67m).  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated after excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, share based 
payment costs and fair value adjustments.  The Directors consider that an adjusted EBITDA figure is a more appropriate 
measure of the underlying performance of the business.
Balance Sheet
Net cash inflow from operating activities during the year amounted to £1.22m (2016: £0.65m). Cash at bank at 31 March 
2017 was £3.47m (2016: £0.51m).
 
Payables falling due within one year are reported at £2.36m (2016: £1.64m). This figure includes an amount of £0.47m 
(2016: £0.71m) for deferred revenue which will be released to profit in future years. 
Contingent consideration payable on the System Professional Ltd acquisition of £0.69m (2016: nil), which is the fair value of 
the amounts payable in shares, is included within liabilities falling due after more than one year. Contingent consideration 
on the acquisition of Q4Ex Ltd has now been fully settled given all performance criteria were satisfied.
Based on certain performance criteria, the vendors of Sys-Pro could be due further consideration of up to £1.865m. At 
the year-end the fair value of the contingent consideration stood at £0.69m.  Post period end however this has now been 
settled by a one-off payment of £150,000.  This is a post balance sheet event and has also removed some operational 
challenges by removing certain approval processes required with the vendors allowing for integration to be accelerated 
and is explained in more detail in note 24.
The Directors are confident there is sufficient working capital within the Group.  The Group also has surplus cash, is 
cash generative and has £3.0m of committed but undrawn banking facilities (which includes a £2.5m acquisition facility).  
However, should accretive acquisitions become available to the Group that cannot be met from existing resources (or with 
enough headroom comfort), the Group may seek to raise additional finance either through debt, equity or a mixture of the 
two. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 13
Our People
Our people are very highly valued and the Directors place considerable emphasis on employees sharing in the success of 
the Group. This is achieved through the participation in share option schemes. Due to the nature and size of the business, 
employees are constantly encouraged to communicate with the Group’s senior management to discuss business issues 
and potential improvements.
It is the policy of the Group that there should be no unfair discrimination in recruiting and promoting staff, including 
applicants who are disabled. The Directors are committed to maintaining and developing communication and consultation 
processes with employees, who in turn are encouraged to develop an awareness of the issues affecting the Group.

Infrastructure and Technology
During the year, we invested in our capabilities and have begun deploying Cloud services from a newly fitted out location 
on our network in a datacentre in Manchester.  We are utilising ‘hyper-scale’ technologies that the likes of Facebook, 
Microsoft and Amazon utilise, such as software defined networking and continuous integration.  These technologies allow 
us to automatically roll-out a whole network deployment and virtual machine build in minutes whilst continuous integration 
means we can test changes in a virtual environment before pushing these to a live environment, minimising ‘change 
control’ risks.
Our work and contribution to the CEPH OpenSource community gained us recognition for the development of an industry 
leading low cost storage solution which lead us to become the first VEEAM accredited service partner in the UK.  We will 
continue our R&D efforts and bring new and interesting services to our customers.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
In line with the nature, size and complexity of the business the senior management team work very closely to identify and 
evaluate areas of risk whilst developing and monitoring action plans to deal with any potential threats.  SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 14
All outcomes are reported to the Board and support is given as necessary to ensure actions are carried out.
Identifiable areas of risk include:
• Dependency on key suppliers – the Group is dependent on certain key suppliers for the continued operation of its 
business, the most significant of which are the supply of third party software and datacentre services. If any of these 
suppliers fail in the provision of their services it may have an adverse effect on the Group’s ability to provide services 
to its customers. However, the Group continually assess suppliers for both price competitiveness and technical 
innovation and are confident that alternative providers could be found.
• Customer retention – the Group provides an essential service to its customers. Any diminution in service levels could 
impact customer retention levels. However, the Group constantly monitors service levels and the low level of customer 
attrition is evidence of the Group’s ability to provide the level of service required.
• Network – the datacentres we utilise are linked by fibre that we lease.  Should the network fail there would be an 
adverse impact on the service provided to our customers.  The Group has designed its network to have no single 
point of failure, it connects with transit providers at different geographical locations.
• Employees – the Group is a service organisation and as such, is dependent on the skills, knowledge and commitment 
of its staff. The performance of the Group is dependent on retaining its staff. We mitigate this risk by offering 
competitive reward packages.
• Search engine optimisation – a significant amount of the Group’s sales revenues are generated from customers using 
internet search engines.  Should the Group’s search engine optimisation performance deteriorate, this could have an 
adverse impact on Group revenue.  The Group continually monitors the position of its websites with respect to these 
search engines.  The Group has experienced staff that work with specialist agencies to maintain or enhance the 
position of its websites for inclusion in search results.
• Acquisitions – the Group has stated that its strategy is to continue to make acquisitions to strengthen its growth. 
The risk is that we may not be able to find suitable acquisition targets. We mitigate this risk by regularly conducting 
searches for targets and also retain advisers who introduce targets.
Summary and Outlook
We are pleased with our results, delivered in a year of both significant progress and change for the Group. We have 
achieved our objectives of fundamentally transforming the business to focus on high growth managed services whilst 
delivering enhanced profitability and results in line with market expectations, while at the same time integrating a large 
acquisition. Our sales pipeline has grown by 28.8% from 30 September 2016 to £3.49m at 31 March 2017, showing the 
tangible impact of our growth strategy. 
Due to operational challenges at Sys-Pro since its acquisition the Group expects growth to be slower than originally 
expected for FY 2018. The Board have taken the necessary remedial steps and following entry into the deed of variation 
with the vendors of Sys- Pro, the management team has the ability to accelerate the integration process. 
Our new management structure and internal teams will support further organic and acquisitive growth and given our 
healthy levels of recurring revenue and long term contracts with key customers, coupled with our cash generation, we are 
well placed to capture market opportunity.
We look forward to the future with confidence.
This Strategic Report was approved and signed by order of the board.

directors’ report
The Directors present their Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Principal Activities
The principal activities of the business are the provision of IT Managed Services and are explained in detail in the strategic 
report.
Business Review and Future Developments
A review of the Group’s operations and performance during the financial year, setting out the position at the year-end, 
significant changes in the year and providing an indication of the outlook for the future is contained in the Strategic report 
on pages 8 to 14.
Results and Dividends
The Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year is set out on page 34. The Directors do not propose 
the payment of a Dividend for the year ended 31 March 2017.
Financial Instruments
The Group uses various financial instruments. These include revolving credit facilities, bank loans, finance leases, cash 
and various items (such as trade receivables and trade payables) that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose 
of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The existence of these financial instruments 
exposes the Group to a number of financial risks, which are described in more detail below.
Liquidity Risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to 
invest cash assets safely and profitably.  Short-term flexibility is achieved through available cash balances and its revolving 
credit facility.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of revolving credit facilities, bank loans, finance leases and the placing 
of new ordinary shares. The Group’s loan and revolving credit facilities were undrawn at the year end. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 19
Credit Risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash, and trade and other receivables. These balances are actively monitored 
to avoid significant concentrations of credit risk however the total of the cash balances and trade and other receivables 
represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.
In order to manage credit risk, the agreement with the customer states preferred collection by direct debit and limits are 
set for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits are reviewed 
by the credit control team on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. For hosting services, 
the Group predominantly invoices in advance and the agreement with the customer states preferred collection by direct 
debit, therefore the financial risk in respect of these debtors is limited.
Directors
The Directors of the Company who held office during the year are as follows:

The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and each Director has taken all the 
steps that ought to have been taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

corporate governance 
report SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 26
corporate governance report
Introduction
The Directors recognise the importance of, and are committed to, high standards of corporate governance. Although 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code is not compulsory for AIM companies, and therefore the Directors 
do not claim compliance with the code, the Directors intend to apply the principles as they consider appropriate to a public 
company of the size of SysGroup plc quoted on AIM, taking into account the recommendations contained in the QCA 
Guidelines. 
Board of Directors
The Board comprises five Directors - two Executives and three Non-Executives - and reflects a blend of different 
experience and backgrounds. The roles of Chairman (which is a Non-Executive position) and Chief Executive have been 
split by the Board and there is a clear division of responsibility between the two. The Board considers Michael Edelson, 
Robert Khalastchy and Amy Yateman-Smith to be independent in character and judgement notwithstanding their 
shareholding and/or share options in the Group. The Board, through the Chairman and the Non-Executive Director as 
well as the Executive Directors, maintains regular contact with its advisers and seeks to ensure that the Board develops 
an understanding of the views of the major shareholders about the Company. The Board meets regularly throughout the 
year and is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Company’s strategy, financial activities and operating 
performance. Day-to-day management is delegated to the Executive Directors who are charged with consulting the 
Board on all significant matters. Consequently, decisions are made promptly following consultation amongst the Directors 
concerned where necessary and appropriate. All necessary information is supplied to the Directors on a timely basis to 
enable them to discharge their duties effectively and all Directors have access to independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, as and when required. The Chairman is available to meet with institutional shareholders to discuss 
any issues and concerns regarding the Group’s governance. The participation of the private and institutional investors at 
the AGM is welcomed by the Board. 
Internal Controls
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Company’s and the Group’s systems of internal controls, which are 
designed to safeguard the assets of the Group and ensure the reliability of financial information for both internal use and 
external publication. Overall control is achieved by a regular detailed reporting system covering both technical progress of 
a project and the state of the Group’s financial affairs. Any system of internal controls can provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will be detected or that risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
is eliminated. 
The Directors consider that the system of internal controls operated effectively throughout the financial year and up to the 
date the financial statements were signed. Based on the size and complexity of the Group, the Board of Directors do not 
consider that there is a need for any internal audit function. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 27
Committees 
Audit Committee
The Company has established an Audit Committee that comprises of Michael Edelson, Robert Khalastchy and Amy 
Yateman-Smith. Michael Edelson is the Chairman of this Committee. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year 
and is responsible for reviewing the integrity of the financial statements of the Group, the Group’s compliance with legal 
and regulatory requirements, and the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial controls and risk 
management processes including the extent to which internal audit review is required. It reviews the external auditors’ 
performance and independence and makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of the auditors. 
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee that comprises Michael Edelson, Robert Khalastchy and 
Amy Yateman-Smith. Michael Edelson is the Chairman. The Committee meets at least twice a year and is responsible 
for determining and reviewing with the Board the policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and such other 
members of the executive management it is designated to consider. Within the terms of the agreed policy, it determines 
the total individual remuneration of the Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee also approves the design of, and 
determines targets for, any performance related pay schemes, reviews the design of any share incentive plans, determines 
the awards to the Executive Directors and determines the policy for, and scope, of pension arrangements for each 
Executive Director.
Rule 21 of The AIM Rules for Companies and MAR (“Market Abuse Regulation”)
The Group will comply with Rule 21 of the AIM Rules (as amended to incorporate the provisions of MAR) relating to dealing 
during close periods.  The Group has a reasonable and effective dealing policy in place.  All employees are notified when 
the company enters and exits close periods but the dealing code in any event requires that an employee seek permission 
from certain designated people before trading in the shares of the Group. The Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) came into 
effect on 3 July 2016. It aims to increase market integrity and investor protection, enhancing the attractiveness of securities 
markets for capital raising.
Human Resources
The Group endeavours to appoint employees with appropriate skills, knowledge and experience for the roles they 
undertake. The Group has a range of polices which are aimed at retaining and providing incentives for key staff. Objectives 
are set for departments and employees that are derived from the Group’s business objectives. The Group has a clear and 
well-understood organisational structure and each employee knows his or her line of accountability. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 28
statement of directors’ 
responsibilities SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 29
statement of directors’ 
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report of the Directors and the Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The Directors are also required to prepare financial statements in 
accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on Alternative Investment 
Market.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and 
enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the Financial Statements are made available on a website.  
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility 
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  Our responsibility is to audit and express

course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

notes to the consolidated  
financial statements
1. Accounting Policies
SysGroup Plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The company’s registered 
office is at Walker House, Exchange Flags, Liverpool, L2 3YL. These consolidated financial statements comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’).
Statement of Compliance
These Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations) as endorsed by the European Union (“endorsed IFRS”) and with those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under endorsed IFRS.
Basis of Preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial liabilities which have been 
valued in accordance with IAS 39.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The 
areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the Financial Statements and their effect 
are disclosed in note 2. The financial statements are presented in pounds’ sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand, 
unless otherwise stated. 
Going Concern
The Directors have prepared the Financial Statements on a going concern basis which assumes that the Group and the 
company will continue to meet liabilities as they fall due.
The directors have reviewed forecasts prepared for the period ending 31 March 2018 and considered the projected trading 
forecasts and resultant cash flows together with confirmed loan facilities and other sources of finance.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that 
the Group can continue to operate within the current facilities available to it.
The Directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements.
for the year ended 31 march 2017 SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 53
New Standards and Interpretations Not yet Adopted
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), have been adopted for the first time by the Group with no significant 
impact on its consolidated results or financial position:
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2012–2014 Cycle)
• Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 1
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued during the year ended 31 
March 2017 but are not yet effective, and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group:
• Amendments to IAS12 ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses’ have not yet been endorsed but the 
IASB effective date will be 1 January 2017. 
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is effective from 2018. This standard will simplify the classification of financial assets for 
measurement purposes, but is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is effective after 1 January 2018. This standard will change how 
revenue is recognised based on a framework. The potential impact on the Group has not yet been fully assessed by 
management.
• IFRS 16 Leases is expected to be applicable after 1 January 2019. If endorsed, this standard will affect the 
presentation of the Group financial statements with all leases apart from short term leases being recognised as on-
balance sheet finance leases with a corresponding liability being the present value of lease payments. The potential 
impact on the Group has not yet been assessed by management.
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed 
by the European Union and require adoption by the Group in future reporting periods.
The adoption of these standards in future periods may have an impact on the results and net assets of the Group, however 
it is too early to quantify this.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow 
into the Group. Revenue represents the fair value of amounts received or receivable for goods and services provided net 
of trade discounts and VAT. Revenue from the sale of domain name registrations is recognised when the domain name 
is registered or renewed. Revenue from value added resale is recognised as these products or services are delivered. 
Revenue from managed services is taken to deferred income on the balance sheet and recognised over the life of each 
contract.
Basis of Consolidation
Where the company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The company controls an investee if all 
three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee; and 
the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is re-assessed whenever facts and 
circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they 
formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method.  SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 54
In the statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially 
recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on 
which control ceases.
Business Combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. On acquisition, all the subsidiaries’ assets 
and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting the conditions at that date. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired in the period are included in the income statement from the date on which control is 
obtained.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the total acquisition date fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is capitalised as an intangible 
asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the market value of equity at the date of 
completion, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based on the expected future cashflows based on whether the 
directors believe performance conditions will be met and thus the extent to which the further consideration will be payable. 
Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the 
excess is credited in full to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on the acquisition date.
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually 
at the financial year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on 
the asset’s cash-generating unit (i.e. the lowest Group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separable 
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from the other assets or Groups of assets). Goodwill 
is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash 
flows have not been adjusted.
Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The results of foreign subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from the group’s presentation currency are 
translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that have a functional 
currency different from the group’s presentation currency, are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance 
sheet date. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries and their opening net 
assets are recognised as a separate component of equity. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 55
Segment Reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker. The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.
Financial Instruments
Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as 
either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Financial Assets
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the 
consolidated statement of financial position. Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value and an impairment 
provision will be recognised if there is evidence that the amount is irrecoverable and will be shown in administrative 
expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, 
deposits held at call with banks. 
Share Capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of 
a financial liability or financial asset. The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments and are recorded at 
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial Liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which it was acquired. 
The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
• Fair Value Through Profit or Loss – This category comprises only contingent consideration. They are carried in 
the statement of financial position at fair values with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income 
statement.
• Other Financial Liabilities – Other financial liabilities include trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, 
which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method.
Fair Value Measurement Hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires certain disclosures which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at 
fair value to reflect the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy has 
the following levels:
a. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)
b. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) (Level 2); and
c. Inputs from the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (Level 3)
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorised is determined on the 
basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
classified in their entirety into only one of the three levels. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 56
Share Based Payments
The fair value of employee options granted is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the 
Black Scholes pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.  
Leases
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised as tangible assets and depreciated over 
the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Obligations under such agreements are included in payables net of 
the finance charge allocated to future periods. The finance element of the rental payment is charged to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding 
in each period. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term.
Property Plant and Equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is provided at annual rates 
calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows:
IT hardware 20% - 33.3% both reducing balance and straight line
Furniture and fittings 20% – 33.3% reducing balance
Investment in Subsidiaries
Fixed asset investments in the Parent Company are shown at cost less any provision for impairment as necessary.
Research and Development
Research expenditure is written off to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the year in which the 
expenditure occurs. Development expenditure is treated in the same way unless the directors are satisfied as to the 
technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects, there is an intention to complete and sell the product and 
the costs can be easily measurable. In this situation, the expenditure is capitalised and amortised expense is included in 
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the years during which the Group 
is to benefit.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to 
other contractual / legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation 
techniques (see section related to critical estimates and judgements below).
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their estimated useful economic lives and the methods used to 
determine the cost of intangibles acquired in business combinations are as follows:
Intangible asset Customer relationships
Estimated UEL 5-7 years
Valuation method Estimated discounted cash flow SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 57
Deferred Taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated 
statement of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: 
• the initial recognition of goodwill; 
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and 
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of 
the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is highly probable that relief against taxable 
profit will be available. 
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered). 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: 
• the same taxable Group company; or 
• different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on intangible assets and other temporary differences recognised in business 
combinations.
2. Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of this financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities at the period end date and the amounts reported for revenues and 
expenses during each period. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those 
estimates. The key sources of estimation that have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities are 
discussed below.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles
The Group tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in line with the accounting policy noted above. This involves 
judgement regarding the future development of the business and the estimation of the level of future profitability and cash 
flows to support the carrying value of goodwill. An impairment review has been performed at the reporting date and no 
impairment has been identified. More details including carrying values are included in note 13.
Impairment of Other Assets
The Group reviews the carrying value of all other assets for indications of impairment at each period end. If indicators 
of impairment exist, the carrying value of the asset is subject to further testing to determine whether its carrying value 
exceeds its recoverable amount.  SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 58
Valuation of Intangibles Acquired in Business Combinations
Determining the fair value of customer relationships acquired in business combinations requires estimation of the value 
of the cash flows related to those relationships and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. More 
details including carrying values are included in note 13.
Valuation of Contingent Consideration
When valuing the contingent consideration still payable on acquisitions, the Group considers various factors including the 
performance of the acquired entity since acquisition together with its expected performance to the end of the earn-out 
period. Following the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised) – Business Combinations, contingent consideration is recognised at, and 
carried thereafter at, fair value. All changes in fair value (other than measurement period adjustments) are reflected in the 
income statement. 
Useful Economic Lives of Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives. Useful lives are based on management’s estimates of 
the period over which the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. 
Changes to estimates can result in changes in the carrying values and hence amounts charged to the income statement in 
particular periods which could be significant.
3. Financial Instruments – Risk Management
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade receivables and 
trade payables that arise directly from its operations. There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods. The 
Group’s objective is to ensure adequate funding for continued growth and expansion. 
All the Group’s financial instruments are carried at amortised cost with the exception of contingent consideration.  There is 
no material difference between the carrying and fair value of its financial instruments, in the current or prior year, due to the 
instruments bearing interest at fixed rates or being of short term nature.

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on 
its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s policy is to prepare periodic working capital forecasts, allowing an assessment of the cash requirements of 
the Group and Company, to manage liquidity risk. Cash resources are managed in accordance with planned expenditure 
forecasts and the Directors have regard to the maintenance of sufficient cash resources to fund the Group and Company’s 
immediate operating requirements and capital expenditure. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 60

Interest Rate Risk
The Group seeks to minimise exposure to interest rate risk by borrowing at fixed interest rates.
Credit Risk
The Group generally gives 30 day credit terms on its continuing business and provides against doubtful debts only when 
recoverability is considered to be at risk. For cash and cash equivalents, the Group only uses recognised banks with high 
credit ratings.
Capital Disclosures
The Group monitors “adjusted capital” which comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium and 
retained earnings).
The Group’s objective when maintaining capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders in future 
periods and benefits for other stakeholders, and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital it requires in proportion to risk. The Group manages its capital structure and makes 
adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
4. Segmental Analysis
The chief operating decision maker for the Group is the Board of Directors. The Group reports in three segments:
• SME Mass Market – this segment provides a range of VPS, shared hosting, email and domain registration services to 
individuals and SME’s. This business was divested during the year.
• Managed Services – this segment provides all forms of Managed Services to customers. This segment was created 
on the acquisition of Netplan in November 2013 and has been further expanded with the acquisition of Q4Ex Ltd and 
System Professional Ltd. This segment was previously referred to as Managed Hosting.
• Value Added Resale (VAR) of products/services – this segment provides all forms of VAR sales where the business is 
acting as a reseller. This segment was created following the acquisition of System Professional Ltd
Information regarding the operation of the reportable segments is included below. The performance of each operating 
segment is based on revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) before any 
allocation of Group overheads, share based payments, fair value adjustments or acquisition costs, as the Board believe 
this is the best measure for performance. The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA has been calculated after deducting Group 
overheads which include the cost of the Board, Group marketing, legal and professional fees, share based payments, fair 
value adjustments and acquisition costs.
Assets and liabilities are not reviewed on a segmental basis. All segments are continuing operations. The accounting 
policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. 
Transactions between segments are accounted for using an arm’s length commercial basis. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 62

price at granting 50p, annual risk free rate 0.5%, and volatility 20%. No provision has been made for the convertible loan 
note warrants in shared based payments.
10. Acquisitions
There has been one acquisition during the period.  The Board strategically expect acquisitions to be a common 
component of growth in the future.
Acquisitions made during the year to 31 March 2017 were:
System Professional Ltd
The Group acquired 100% of the share capital of System Professional Ltd (Sys-Pro) on 4 July 2016. Sys-Pro provides 
managed services, cloud hosting, value added resale services, and IT consultancy support.
During the year to 31 March 2017 the Group incurred £414,000 of costs in relation to this acquisition. These costs are 
included in administrative expenses in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 
March 2017.
The amount of identifiable net assets assumed at the acquisition date is shown below:

Contingent consideration                      621
Total consideration 4,670
The fair value of acquired customer relationships intangible asset has been estimated using a discounted cashflow 
method, based on the estimated level of profit to be generated from them. A post tax discount rate of 19% was used in 
the valuation. Customer relationships are being amortised over an estimated useful life of 5 years. The acquisition of Sys-
Pro included a contingent consideration which is payable 85% in cash and 15% in shares at 60p (resulting in the issue of 
975,000 consideration shares in respect of the 15%). The contingent consideration payable is based on delivering certain 
performance criteria and is capped at £1.865m. The earn out period is to 31 March 2018 (unless achieved in 31 March 
2017). If EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) of less than £714k in the year ended 31 March 2018 then no consideration 
is payable, there is a ratchet mechanism and a set of ranges. Achieving the maximum potential consideration would require 
Sys-Pro to deliver £1.3m or more of EBIT for the respective full financial year.
 
Since the acquisition date to 31 March 2017, System Professional Limited has contributed £4,058,034 to Group revenue 
and £331,472 to Group EBITDA. Had the acquisition taken place on 1 April 2016, the contribution to Group revenue would 
have been £5,208,639 and £911,283 to Group EBITDA.

Basic earnings per share £0.0190 £0.0205
Diluted earnings per share £0.0187 £0.0205
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding treasury shares which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year is adjusted to 
include the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential 
ordinary shares into ordinary shares. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 69

The Company held no intangible assets at 31 March 2017 or 31 March 2016.
All amortisation and impairment charges are included in the depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial 
assets classification, which is disclosed as administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income.
During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”. No impairment 
charges arose as a result of this review.
The recoverable amount is determined based on a discounted cash flow basis and is allocated to individual cash 
generating units. The calculation uses pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board 
covering a two year period. Cash flows beyond the two year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates 
stated below. The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and the 
experience of growth rates.
The carrying value of each CGU is as follows:

£’000
SME Mass Market (divested in year) - 620
Netplan 5,348 4,977
System Professional 4,585 -
Total 9,932 5,597
The assumptions used for the impairment reviews are as follows:
System
Professional Netplan
Discount rate 19% 19%
Growth rate year 2 to year 5 10% 10%
Terminal growth rate 5% 5%
Forecast period for which cashflows are estimated 2 years 2 years
The Group had no contractual liability for development costs at 31st March 2017. As a result of the impairment testing 
carried out on the basis of these estimates and assumptions, no impairment provisions are required.
The recoverable amount for the Netplan and System Professional businesses exceeds the carrying value of the total net 
assets by £2.8m. A 1% increase in the discount rate would reduce the recoverable amount by approximately £0.5m. A 4% 
reduction in the growth rate would reduce the recoverable amount by approximately £0.27m. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 72

1. Following a 1 for 40 share consolidation each block of 40 shares with a nominal value of 0.5p share became one single share of 20 pence, then 
following a capital reduction became 1p (one pence), this is further set-out in the note below.
On 15 June 2016 the Group announced the proposed acquisition of Sys-Pro and a placing of 8,333,334 new ordinary 
shares at 60 pence per share to raise £5.0 million gross.  The Group also announced a share consolidation and a capital 
reduction.
As at the date of that announcement, the Company had 510,379,335 existing Ordinary Shares in issue and the mid-market 
price of each existing ordinary share as at the close of business on 14 June 2016 was £0.0165 (1.65 pence). The Directors 
considered that the share consolidation was necessary in order to increase the marketability of the Company’s shares 
through the creation of a higher price per share.
 
Shareholder approval was granted at the General Meeting (“GM”) held on 5 July 2016 with 40 existing ordinary shares 
becoming one new ordinary share.
The Share Consolidation reduced the number of existing ordinary shares in issue from 510,379,360 (after the issue to the 
Company Secretary of an additional 25 existing ordinary shares for the purpose of effecting the share consolidation, given 
that the number of existing ordinary shares in issue is not divisible by 40) to new ordinary shares 12,759,484 and increased 
the nominal value of the Company’s shares from £0.005 (0.5 pence) to £0.20 (20 pence).  SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 79
The nominal share capital of each new ordinary share was then reduced to £0.01 (1 pence), following a Court sanctioned 
capital reduction. This capital reduction was approved at the same GM and became effective following the registration of 
the Court Order with Companies House on 4 August 2016.
The Capital Reduction, as approved by the Court, created realised profits of £10,250,042 which was applied in eliminating 
the accumulated deficit on the Company’s profit and loss account.
The Group now has distributable reserves and so is in a position to pay a dividend in the future if appropriate. When 
appropriate a progressive dividend policy will be adopted.
23. Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations relate to the SME Mass Market business. The trade and assets of this business were disposed 
of on 22 July 2016 for a total cash consideration of £2,735,727 (less an initial amount of £465,519 in respect of advance 
receipts/payments). 
The following table summarises the results of the SME Mass Market segment included in discontinued operations in the 
Consolidated statement of income:

Profit on disposal is calculated as the fair value of consideration received less the fair value of assets and liabilities 
disposed. Earnings per share for discontinued activities is £0.076
24. Post Balance Sheet Event
On 06 June 2017, the Group entered into a Deed of Variation with the Vendors of System Professional Ltd. In consideration 
of payment by SysGroup plc of £150,000 and various legal waivers to the Vendors of System Professional Ltd the earn-
out was considered satisfied and the Group released from various “Sellers Protections” allowing for the business to be 
integrated at a faster rate and allowed for the exit of certain of the vendor management team and for other changes to be 
made within the business. SysGroup Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2017 80

or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange; and
b. the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to resolutions 7(a) above) of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £23,103.

require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of 
any such offer or agreement notwithstanding that the power conferred by this resolution has expired.
This resolution revokes and replaces all unexercised powers previously granted to the Directors to allot equity 
securities as if section 561(1) of the 2006 Act did not apply but without prejudice to any allotment of equity securities 
already made or agreed to be made pursuant to such authorities.
