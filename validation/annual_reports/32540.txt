HTG 
POISED FOR GROWTH 
 
In FY2017, HTG experienced a mixed performance against challenging market conditions. 
Revenue was too low to cover the fixed cost base that had been geared-up to service 
significantly higher revenue. However, the Group is now poised for growth based on entering 
FY2018 with a record order book, significant investments already made and the proposed 
acquisition by Avingtrans plc. 
 
Record Order Book 
The Group had a record order book of £49.8 million at 31 March 2017 (FY2016: £36.1 million) 
 
Investment in the Business 
The Group has completed the major investment in its world-class Centre of Excellence for 
specialist motor manufacture, has continued to rebuild accreditations and customer 
relationships at Peter Brotherhood and further invested in the continuous improvement of its 
people, processes and products 
 
Acquisition by Avingtrans plc 
The proposed acquisition of the Company by Avingtrans plc gives the Group access to a 
strong balance sheet and a supportive shareholder base to be able to continue to invest in 
both Hayward Tyler and Peter Brotherhood and support the Group’s longer term growth plans  Hayward Tyler Group PLC

Our Vision 
Energy in motion 
 
With the world’s population forecast to exceed 9 billion people by 2050 demand for food, 
clean water and energy continues to grow.   From an energy perspective this is creating even 
greater challenges across all energy sources and a growing demand for clean energy too. 
The energy industry needs solutions to answer these global challenges – venturing into 
evermore extreme and harsh environments, further offshore and deeper underwater and into 
even more remote and inhospitable locations. 
 
HTG is responding to these challenges. We are working to transform existing technologies 
and innovate new technologies. To develop new products and solutions, to generate new 
ideas and new thinking.  
 
We call this energy in motion.

Energy Overview 
Market studies project an increasing demand for 
energy: 
 
 World GDP is projected to almost 
double in the period to 2035 driven by 
fast-growing emerging economies, as 
more than two billion people are lifted 
from low incomes;  
 This rising prosperity is predicted to 
drive an increase in global energy 
demand by around 30%;  
 The fuel mix is expected to continue to 
adjust, although oil and gas together 
with coal, remain dominant;  
 Renewables, including nuclear, is 
predicted to provide half of the additional 
energy required out to 2035;   
 Gas is projected to grow more quickly than 
oil and coal, led by US shale gas and a 
rapid expansion of LNG is likely to lead to a globally integrated gas market, anchored 
by US gas prices;  
 Global coal consumption looks set to peak, as the continuing reform of China’s 
economy causes growth in its demand for coal (and energy) to slow sharply, although 
China is expected to remain the largest growth market for energy;  
 Renewables are projected to be the fastest growing fuel source, quadrupling over the 
next 20 years, supported by continuing gains in competitiveness; and

 The world economy is expected to continue to electrify, with nearly two-thirds of the 
increase in global energy going into the power sector.   
 
Power Generation – Centralised and Localised 
As a result of this electrification, the share of energy used for power generation is predicted to 
rise from 42% in 2015 to 47% by 2035.  
 
It also reflects a strong catch-up process, with energy consumption per head in developing 
economies expected to increase rapidly towards OECD levels as prosperity rises. It is 
estimated that over one billion people currently do not have access to electricity, mainly in 
Africa, India and other parts of developing Asia.  
 
 
 Source: BP Energy Outlook 2017 Edition, January 2017 
 
Power Generation – Centralised – Fossil Fuels 
Gas is expected to be the fastest growing fuel (1.6% p.a.), with its share in primary energy 
increasing as it overtakes coal to be the second-largest fuel source by 2035. The growth of 
coal is projected to decline sharply: 0.2% p.a. compared with 2.7% p.a. over the past 20 years 
– coal consumption is expected to peak in the mid-2020s. 
 
Power Generation – Centralised – Fossil Fuels (Coal and Oil) 
Key market drivers include the continued pursuit of larger, more efficient coal-fired plant and 
use of economisers to enhance the economic viability of ageing plants while also helping to 
meet emission targets. Market studies project an 
increasing demand for coal: 
  
 China is expected to remain the world’s 
largest market for coal, accounting for 
nearly half of global coal consumption in 
2035;   
 India is predicted to be the largest growth 
market, with its share of world coal 
demand doubling from around 10% in 
2015 to 20% in 2035. Over two-thirds of 
India’s projected increased demand for 
coal is anticipated to feed into the power 
sector; and   
 Coal consumption in the OECD is 
predicted to fall by over 40% as the share 
of coal within the power sector is crowded 
out by renewables and natural gas.

Hayward Tyler operates in the large scale power market of 300MW and above with the 
largest installed base of boiler circulating pumps (“BCPs”) worldwide with more than 2,300 
units supplied, mainly to coal-fired power stations. With coal plants typically operating for 40+ 
years (from an original design life of 25 years) opportunities arise from renewing and 
upgrading of equipment to extending the operating life of existing power plants.  
 
Power Generation – Centralised – Fossil Fuels (Gas) 
Key market drivers include the price of natural gas, the speed and ease of construction of gas 
fired power plants, reduced carbon emissions relative to coal and oil and the need to “fill the 
gap” as the zero carbon energy sources (nuclear and renewables) continue to face economic 
challenges. Market studies project an increasing demand for gas: 
 
 Natural gas use across all sectors is predicted to grow faster than both oil and coal, 
growing by 1.6% p.a. between 2015 and 2035; and 
 The main centres of demand growth are expected to be China, with gas gaining share 
in industry and power, the Middle East and the USA, where increased availability of 
gas is anticipated to help boost demand within the power sector. 
 
Peter Brotherhood operates in the natural gas market through reciprocating compressors for 
applications like fuel gas boosting, as well as steam turbines for both power generation on 
small plants of less than 50MW and drivers for equipment like boiler feed pumps on the larger 
combined cycle plants. With gas plants typically operating for 40+ years (from an original 
design life of 25 years) opportunities arise from renewing and upgrading of equipment to 
extend the operating life of existing power plants.  
 
Power Generation – Centralised – Renewables  
Renewables are expected to be the fastest growing fuel source, quadrupling over the next 20 
years, supported by continuing gains in competitiveness. Driven by commitments from 
COP21 it is predicted that carbon emissions from energy grow at less than a third of the rate 
of the past 20 years, reflecting gains in energy efficiency and the changing fuel mix. 
  
 
 
Renewables are projected to account for 40% of the growth in power generation, causing 
their share of global power to increase from 7% in 2015 to nearly 20% by 2035. The EU is 
expected to continue to lead the way in terms of the penetration of renewables, with the share 
of renewables within the EU power sector doubling over the next 20 years to reach almost 
40% by 2035. However, China is predicted to show the highest growth over the next 20 years, 
adding more renewable power than the EU and US combined.

Power Generation – Centralised – Renewables (Solar / Wind) 
Growth in solar is driven primarily by photovoltaic (PV) technology and wind is being driven by 
large wind turbines, both onshore and offshore. HTG does not currently have a competitive 
product offering in either of these technologies, however, concentrated solar plant (CSP) 
technology has been demonstrated successfully and is set to take a share of the renewable 
market, for example: 
 
 U.S. concentrated solar power market share is expected to see growth, of over 8% by 
2025. Federal Government initiatives including tax rebate, financial assistance and 
net metering will complement the industry outlook; 
 Chile concentrated solar power market revenue is set to witness strong growth of 
over 25% over the forecast timeframe. Favourable climatic conditions with strong 
pipeline projects will boost the business. Morocco is set to exceed USD5 billion by 
2025; Spain concentrated solar power market size was valued at over USD15 billion 
in 2015. The Spanish Government’s policy to replace conventional fossil fuel 
technology with efficient clean energy technology will augment the industry 
landscape, and China concentrated solar power market is predicted to exceed 7GW 
by 2025. The Government of China in its thirteenth five year plan aims to install 
110GW of solar power plants, of which 5GW is expected to be provided by CSP.  
 
Hayward Tyler’s BCP technology is readily adaptable to the CSP market. With China taking a 
prominent role in wide scale deployment of the technology, Hayward Tyler with its footprint in 
China and long-established product expertise is well placed to secure market share. 
 
Power Generation – Centralised – Renewables (Hydro) 
Hydropower generates the largest share of electricity from renewable energy sources. The 
overall share is currently about 40%. Of this, greater than 95% comes from large scale 
hydropower plants with the balance from tidal, wave and other sources. 
   
The UK Government estimates that wave and tidal stream energy combined has the potential 
to deliver around 20 per cent of the UK’s current electricity needs, which equates to an 
installed capacity of around 30GW to 50GW. Although the market is at the early development 
stage, Hayward Tyler’s submersible motor expertise is ideal to develop reliable submersible 
generator technologies for wave and tidal schemes. Hayward Tyler is currently working in 
partnership with several universities and private developers to position itself as an industry 
leader in this growing technology space and its recent announcement on the C-Gen Neptune 
generator project is testament to this. 
 
Power Generation – Centralised – Nuclear 
 
 
 
EIA's International Energy Outlook projects that total global nuclear generation will increase by 
73% through 2040, from 2.6 trillion kilowatt-hours in 2015 to 4.5 trillion kilowatt-hours in 2040. 
Countries that are not a part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

11 
 
(non-OECD countries) account for 86% of this increase, with China alone making up more 
than 54% of total growth. China's growing nuclear fleet is expected to produce more than 1.2 
trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually by 2040. 
 
Outside of Asia the most significant nuclear new build programme is in the UK, where 16GW 
of new nuclear power is planned with funding and developers from France, Japan, USA and 
China. The Hinkley Point C project is now fully funded and has begun construction whereas 
the subsequent projects are at various stages of approval and planning. After much 
uncertainty it is now clear that the UK nuclear new build programme is moving ahead to 
address potential energy shortfalls and to support carbon emission targets. 
 
Small Modular Reactors (SMR), Generation IV (Gen IV) reactors and Fusion reactor 
technologies are all also under development to support a global shift from high carbon 
technologies and to make nuclear more affordable, safer and accessible to a wider range of 
countries other than the established nuclear nations. 
 
As of April 2017, 30 countries worldwide are operating 449 nuclear reactors for electricity 
generation and 60 new nuclear plants are under construction in 15 countries. Nuclear power 
plants provided 11 per cent of the world's electricity production in 2014. In 2016, 13 countries 
relied on nuclear energy to supply at least one-quarter of their total electricity. 
 
 
Hayward Tyler continues to enjoy a stable position in the nuclear supply chain servicing its 
existing installed base as well as taking orders for new units, both of which result from the key 
accreditations of our US and UK businesses. With 75% of the 438 operational reactors 
worldwide currently over 25 years old, growth opportunities for aftermarket parts and services 
will continue to be realised in the European, South Korean and USA markets. 
  
Our Hayward Tyler Colchester facility holds the ASME B&PV ‘N’, ‘NPT’ and ‘NA’ stamps as 
well as the ‘NS’ certificate, all key accreditations in the nuclear market that represent 
significant barriers to entry for other businesses. Hayward Tyler’s canned motor technology 
provides nuclear plants with a robust product for increased life cycle and reduced 
maintenance costs. Hayward Tyler Colchester continues to support its significant installed 
base as well as to provide new units and, in addition, it is leveraging its technology for 
opportunities on Fusion, SMR and Gen IV technologies in both the USA, France, UK and 
China. 
   
Hayward Tyler Luton continues its development as a strategic supplier to the UK nuclear new 
build programme having achieved ‘Fit for Nuclear’ in FY2017 and working towards ISO19443 
in FY2018. With a blend of technology, some transferred from Hayward Tyler Colchester, and 
some heritage Luton product, each large scale reactor design represents on average £5 
million to £15 million of potential sales. With three opportunities at the later stages of

negotiation for Hinkley Point C and early engagement on the subsequent projects Hayward 
Tyler is well placed to capitalise on these opportunities.  
 
Strategic partnering for the UK and Chinese nuclear markets will play a major role in Hayward 
Tyler’s step change position in this sector and ongoing dialogue with complementary 
businesses will develop through the first half of FY2018. 
 
Building off the expertise of manufacturing steam turbines for the nuclear submarine fleet 
Peter Brotherhood is well placed to support a sub-set of the SMR market, such as the 
NuScale technology which could see twelve modular 50MW reactors being built on one site. 
NuScale are in the process of applying for a Design Certificate from the US NRC and are one 
of the companies in discussion with the UK Government for the £250 million of funding to 
support SMR localisation and deployment in the UK. 
 
Power Generation – Distributed  
Distributed generation is typified by systems which are small-scale power generation or 
storage technologies (typically in the range of 1kW to 10,000kW) used to provide an 
alternative to, or an enhancement of, the traditional electric power system. Peter Brotherhood 
offers two solutions into this market place, Combined Heat and Power (“CHP”) and Gas to 
Power (“GTP”). 
 
CHP is an efficient means of producing electric power and useful thermal energy from a 
single fuel source. It uses less fuel than the alternative methods of separately generating heat 
by conventional boilers and power stations. With a significant pedigree in this field, Peter 
Brotherhood has positioned itself to re-enter the UK CHP market, which is expected to grow 
to 18GW by 2020. 
 
On a typical day inputs to the UK national grid need to meet a demand of around 38.3GW. A 
potential supply gap of 40% to 50% could arise as demand grows, older coal and nuclear 
power stations are taken offline and renewables are unable to provide an on-demand service. 
As part of an overall strategy aimed at bridging the gap, the UK Government is promoting a 
Short Term Operating Reserve (“STOR”) market to add 2.5GW additional capacity by 2020. 
Peter Brotherhood’s GTP packaged 1MW units are designed specifically to address the 
STOR market. 
 
Oil and Gas – Upstream and Downstream 
Much of the oil and gas industry has survived an especially tough few years with weak 
demand and low prices. Accordingly, for businesses operating in the sector it has been 
difficult to make strategic 
decisions and plan for the future. 
Only now is the sector beginning 
to emerge from its upheaval. 
  
In the near future, the recent oil 
price gains – which are due to a 
rebalancing of supply and 
demand fundamentals, partly 
accelerated by OPEC’s decision 
to cut production – are expected 
to remain in place. That 
expectation lies behind a 
number of positive industry 
forecasts. For example, 
according to Barclays’s latest 
E&P Spending Survey, oil and 
gas industry capital expenditures are expected to increase by as 
much as 7% in 2017. In addition, global rig counts, particularly in 
the USA, have been on the rise since the middle of 2016, according to Baker Hughes.

Oil & Gas – Upstream 
Global liquids demand (oil, biofuels and other liquid fuels) is projected to increase by around 
15Mb/d, to reach 110Mb/d by 2035. All of this demand growth is expected to come from 
emerging economies, as rising prosperity leads to increased oil demand, with China expected 
to account for half of the growth. In contrast, OECD oil demand is projected to continue its 
trend decline (-8Mb/d). 
 
The upstream sector (exploration and production) is expected to be most buoyant in the 
Middle East and in Europe with visible capital expenditure approaching USD900 billion either 
in the planning phase or currently active. 
 
Hayward Tyler provides reliable motor solutions to the 
topside and subsea offshore oil and gas market whilst 
Peter Brotherhood offers offshore power generation units 
including those on FPSO, FLNG and FSRU. 
 
Hayward Tyler provides a complete range of submersible 
seawater lift and firewater motors to customers as part of 
an integrated pump package. Whilst short-term demand for 
this product group remains fairly flat, ten units were 
secured in conjunction with our strategic partner, Eureka 
Pumps AS, and with an installed base of more than 250 
high-power motors offshore there are additional aftermarket 
opportunities across key markets.  
  
 
 
 
 
Oil majors see subsea processing as a 
means of improving the economics of oil 
recovery by reducing hardware costs (by 
around 50% through standardisation) 
and extending an oilfield’s life, estimated 
to be 5-6 years in the case of the North 
Sea. Accordingly, spending on subsea 
trees is expected to increase by around 
12% year-on-year to 2018. This demand 
is driven by the need of over 1,000

candidate fields to either optimise production or minimise the topside investment burden for 
multiple wellheads. It is also driven by the need to find an alternative to oil-filled subsea 
systems and Electro-Submersible Pumps in-well artificial lift systems with their inherent 
constraints and reliability concerns. Hayward Tyler is well placed to capitalise on this trend as 
it is one of only a handful of motor suppliers worldwide that have the required wet wound 
motor expertise, global standards capability, existing approvals and operational reference list. 
This is evidenced by the strategic production alliance with TechnipFMC plc that resulted in 
five additional units that are currently being manufactured in the Centre of Excellence. 
 
The market for FPSOs appears to have bottomed in 2016 (during which no orders were 
placed globally) and it is expected to recover in 2017, although at a much lower level than in 
the past. The Peter Brotherhood steam turbine generators are well positioned for this market 
and work continued through the year to support early engineering and project engagement for 
opportunities in Singapore that will close in FY2018. 
 
Oil & Gas – Downstream 
Downstream operations are oil and gas operations that take place after the production phase, 
through to the point of sale. Downstream operations can include refining crude oil and 
distributing the by-products, such as gasoline, natural gas liquids, diesel and a variety of other 
energy sources. 
 
The downstream sector is most buoyant in the Middle East, Asia and North America with 
visible capital expenditure approaching USD1.2 trillion either in the planning phase or 
currently active. 
 
Peter Brotherhood supplies steam turbine generators and steam turbine drivers to various 
applications in the downstream market and in FY2017 delivered a steam turbine generator to 
an S-Oil refinery in South Korea. The 22.6MW extraction back-pressure steam turbine 
generator was designed, manufactured and tested in accordance with American Petroleum 
Institute (API) 612 standards. In addition, the reciprocating gas compressors offered by Peter 
Brotherhood have a wide application in the downstream market. New equipment opportunities 
are focused mainly in the Middle East, however, there are significant upgrade opportunities 
based on the global installed base as many refineries respond to new operational 
requirements or changing regulations. 
 
Water and Industrial – Municipal Water, General Industrial and Chemical 
The water and industrial sector, in all its 
forms, is the largest consumer of energy 
globally and although energy consumption 
in this sector softened slightly in recent 
years continued steady growth is predicted.  
 
The Company’s continued growth in the 
wider industrial markets reflects the 
Company’s strategic plan to diversify and 
maximise the potential for all of its products 
in the future. 
 
Water and Industrial – Municipal Water 
Hayward Tyler was successful in delivering 
its first order for a high-demand water 
management project in the USA through its 
collaboration with Japanese pump 
manufacturer, Ebara Corporation. This is the 
first opportunity to utilise the high-voltage 
high-power submersible motor, previously 
used in the oil and gas market, for a different 
application.

Water and Industrial – Industrial 
Hayward Tyler Group provides engineered solutions for applications across a wide range of 
other industrial sectors to provide longer life and superior performance as well as to reduce 
the lifetime cost of ownership, a key feature for our customers.  
  
The Peter Brotherhood steam turbines have applications beyond the energy markets. In 
choosing a steam turbine, either as a generator or as a driver, key considerations for 
customers are safety, availability, reliability and maintainability. This generates a wide range 
of applications, which include process industries such as sugar refining.  With both on-going 
original equipment opportunities and a constant demand for through life support the industrial 
markets, in all their forms, present good opportunities. 
 
Water and Industrial – Chemical 
Hayward Tyler’s technologies are satisfying the needs of many processes in the chemical 
industry, including Butanediol. With an established brand and proven products, in China and 
South Korea respectively, these technologies provide additional growth opportunities. 
Hayward Tyler canned motor pumps and retrofits are used extensively for high pressure, high 
temperature and difficult to handle fluid applications. The seal-less design eliminates the need 
for a dynamic seal and utilises the process fluid as a coolant with no need for an external fan. 
Industrial chemical plants see this technology as a safer and more reliable alternative to 
traditional products and the trend is to use canned motor retrofits to replace these products. 
Hayward Tyler’s reputation and experience has positioned the business as a key supplier for 
these applications. 
 
The Peter Brotherhood steam turbines and reciprocating gas compressors also have a range 
of applications in the chemical markets. 
 
Defence – UK Submarine Programme 
Dreadnought is the replacement programme for the Royal Navy’s Trident missile Vanguard-
class submarines, which form the UK’s nuclear deterrent. 
  
The continuous at sea 
deterrent (CASD) has 
provided the United 
Kingdom’s ultimate 
security insurance policy 
every day for the last 46 
years. 
 
As part of the UK Ministry 
of Defence £178 billion 
equipment plan, the 
programme will be 
supported by a defence 
budget that will rise every 
year until the end of the 
decade, meeting the 
commitment to NATO to 
spend two per cent of 
GDP on defence. Since 
1992, the four boats of the Vanguard-class have maintained CASD, ensuring that at least one 
submarine is deployed at all times. As the Vanguard-class submarines progress to the end of 
their lifespan, the UK is building the next generation of submarines to carry forward the vital 
role. 
 
Hayward Tyler and Peter Brotherhood have supported the UK nuclear submarine programme 
since the first boat, Dreadnought, launched 56 years ago. Since then the submarine 
programme has provided both original equipment opportunities and secure aftermarket 
business, which is critical to maintaining CASD. Currently both Peter Brotherhood and 
Hayward Tyler are completing contracts for the Astute-class submarine programme.

Chairman’s Statement 
A DEMANDING YEAR “The second half provides 
the platform for growth”  
 
A mixed performance against challenging market 
conditions 
 
“The Group had a mixed trading year based on a weak first half being offset by a 
strong second half performance and record order book entering the new financial 
year” 
 
The Board 
Key areas of focus for the Board in FY2018 
These areas include inter alia: 
 Evolution of our marketing and sales strategy;  
 Further development of our people; 
 Utilising the Centre of Excellence to its full potential; 
 Enhancing the position of Peter Brotherhood in its end markets; and 
 Completion of the announced transaction with Avingtrans plc. 
 
Dear Shareholder 
I am sorry to report on a mixed trading year albeit mitigated by a record order book as 
we move into the new financial year FY2018.  Acknowledging the demanding trading 
period I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Executive Directors and all the 
team, on your behalf, for their contribution in a very challenging market and their 
tireless devotion in ensuring the long-term security of both Hayward Tyler and Peter 
Brotherhood. 
 
Results Overview 
The results for the year reflect a steady performance from the Hayward Tyler and Peter 
Brotherhood businesses at the gross contribution level but a lack of revenue particularly in the 
first half of FY2017 ultimately meant that we only achieved breakeven at the trading
1
 EBITDA 
level for the full year, which generated a reported loss for the year of £3.9 million (FY2016: 
profit of £2.4 million). 
 
Against a backdrop of challenging end markets and continuing uncertain economic times, 
Hayward Tyler’s performance was dampened in 1H2017 before recovering strongly in 
2H2017 and we expect it to strengthen in FY2018. This strengthening will come from amongst 
other things; the improving prospects for Peter Brotherhood and the beneficial impact of the 
Centre of Excellence, which when utilised more fully will drive greater profitability. The major 
focus for HTG looking forward continues to be the development of the order pipeline and 
order book to create a significantly higher revenue business.    
 
Further details of the trading performance are set out in the Chief Executive’s Business 
Review and the Financial Review. 
 
Dividend 
Given the announced proposed acquisition of the Company by Avingtrans plc we do not 
intend to recommend the payment of a final dividend for FY2017.  We understand that 
Avingtrans plc has a progressive dividend policy.

Outlook 
The expansion of the Group through the acquisition of Peter Brotherhood together with the 
continued focus on developing our Hayward Tyler business, by expanding our production 
capabilities and investing in research and development, means that the Group remains well 
placed to achieve the Board’s growth ambitions provided it has the right capital structure in 
place.  
 
This external driven growth is dependent inter alia on positive market conditions which we 
anticipate will improve during the current year. With a record order book as we enter FY2018 
the Board remains confident in the underlying profitability, our ability to take excess cost out 
of the Group and the longer term prospects for the business. 
 
It is clear that these prospects are well understood and appreciated by the directors of 
Avingtrans plc who have now made an offer to acquire the entire share capital of the 
Company. 
 
Yours faithfully

Chief Executive’s Business Review 
 
Investing through the cycle 
for the long-term 
“With the investments 
made, this is now a 
business poised for 
growth” 
 
 
“With the benefit of another year’s worth of investment in Peter Brotherhood, the 
completion of our Centre of Excellence and the early signs of improvements in our end 
markets the Group is well positioned to capitalise on potential growth opportunities” 
 
Setting HTG’s priorities 
Our FY2017 focus 
 Continue to focus on implementing our strategy for growth through product and 
market development; 
 Continue to increase order intake through improvements to the ‘win-order’ process 
across all markets; 
 Re-establish Peter Brotherhood and embed the business in the Group; and 
 Continue to look for wider opportunities to develop and grow the Group. 
Achievements 
 Ended the year with a record order book and a clear strategy of how to drive 
further growth in order intake going into the new fiscal year;  
 Continued to rebuild accreditations and customer relationships at Peter 
Brotherhood with our first major order won and first significant order 
shipped; 
 Created a new Group Commercial role, recruited a new person to the role 
and put in place a new structure to support the ‘win-order’ process; 
 Completed the major investment in our world-class Centre of Excellence for 
specialist motor manufacture; and 
 Welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to open our new facility and 
present us with the Queen’s Award for Export (International Trade). 
Priorities for FY2018 
 Secure a suitable funding structure to support the long-term future of the Group to 
take advantage of the opportunities for both Peter Brotherhood and Hayward Tyler; 
 Drive further growth in order intake reflecting the improving market conditions and 
the Group’s competitiveness; 
 Cut the Group’s cost base to support a more flexible and profitable business; and 
 Continue to deliver the operational improvements supported by the increased order 
book.  
 
Introduction 
When I wrote in last year’s review that “provided recent economic and political uncertainty 
does not affect general industrial activity, the outlook for HTG is positive” I perhaps did not 
appreciate how prescient that comment might be.    
 
From a financial perspective the year can be characterised using the sporting analogy, “a 
game of two halves”. The first half was disappointing but our second half was much more in  Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017

line with previous periods and more representative of the underlying Group and its future 
prospects. We increased the run rate on an annualised basis to over £80.0 million of 
revenues and over £8.0 million of EBITDA and achieved a record order book entering the 
current fiscal year. However, the loss in the first half combined with the order intake not 
happening quick enough to be fully reflected in second half revenue and profit meant that for 
the first time as Hayward Tyler Group PLC we were not able to either meet or beat market 
expectations.  
  
Win-Order Process – Ready to Deliver 
Looking beyond the numbers the Group continued to make significant progress in positioning 
itself for the anticipated improvement in its end markets. A huge amount of time, effort and 
investment has gone into the ‘front-end’ of the business focused on marketing, sales and the 
‘win-order’ process. Key to this action was the appointment of Dr Colin Elcoate to the newly 
created position of Chief Commercial Officer with responsibility for global commercial activity 
across the Group. Colin joined from Clyde Union Pumps and has previously held senior 
positions at Babcock and Rolls Royce. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers 
and a nuclear expert with over 25 years’ experience, so it is great to have him on board at 
such an important time. Already positive changes have been made to the organisational and 
commercial structure to support our growth plans including: 
 
 Specific roles for sales, business development, product management and marketing 
communications; 
 Tightened bid/no-bid and contract review processes; and 
 Salesforce.com roll-out and linking to our ERP systems. 
 
The resurrection of the Peter Brotherhood name and brand has continued apace during the 
year with the re-engagement of past customers and the identification of our installed base 
being key. There is no doubt that the removal of the Peter Brotherhood name from the market 
and associated approved vendor lists by the previous owner of the business has made the 
challenge of resurrection more difficult but it is a gradual process and one to which the 
employees and wider stakeholders are responding well. In the past 12 months over forty 
customer approvals have been achieved, the first major order won and first significant order 
shipped so there is no doubt that the former pedigree of Peter Brotherhood is being brought 
back to life. Peter Brotherhood still has an enviable reputation in specific market niches and 
the challenge is to strengthen and broaden it. As an example, in the floating vessels market 
Peter Brotherhood has more steam turbine gensets on FPSOs than all of its competition 
combined. This clearly stands Peter Brotherhood in good stead when the anticipated pick-up 
in the floating vessels new build/retrofit market recovers. Peter Brotherhood also remains a 
key strategic supplier to Rolls Royce and ultimately the Royal Navy in the UK having provided 
all of the steam turbine gensets to the Astute boats. One of Peter Brotherhood’s advantages 
is that it remains an ‘independent’ supplier and as such can be more flexible in terms of 
product offering and response times than its larger, global rivals. 
 
The Group has continued to invest in numerous exhibitions globally to broaden the reach, 
particularly of Peter Brotherhood, to try to expand the brand to a wider global population.   
Over the past twelve months this has resulted in exhibitions and conferences in South Africa, 
the USA, China, India and the UK.  
 
Order Intake and Order Book 
Order intake increased by 11% to £68.3 million, helped by a full year’s contribution from Peter 
Brotherhood, which contributed £16.2 million thus meaning that overall our order intake KPI 
target of 1.1x (ratio of order intake to historical revenue) was achieved. Hayward Tyler’s order 
intake actually declined slightly by 4% to £52.1 million reflecting a slowdown in its end 
markets both in terms of new units but also, in particular, a slowdown in the shop-service 
activities of our US business as outages were postponed. 
 
The strong second half order intake contributed to a record order book as at 31 March 2017 
which stood at £49.8 million, an increase of 38% over the prior year. This represented an 
increase in both Hayward Tyler of 36% (from £26.7 million to £36.2 million) and Peter 
Brotherhood of 45% (from £9.4 million to £13.6 million). So despite the downturn in the  Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017  
   
20 
 
Group’s end markets there was still a healthy split between both geography and sector. Key 
order wins for the period included KHNP in South Korea for nuclear replacement units, 
Eureka for submersible motors for offshore topside deployment, numerous power contract 
wins with key customers in China and India, and strategically important contracts with new 
customers in Peter Brotherhood. 
 
Pipeline 
Whilst the Group achieved its KPI target for order intake during the year the key challenge 
looking forward is how to maintain, develop and grow a greater level of order intake to ‘feed’ 
the newly invested and improved facilities.   
 
Part of the investment made in the ‘win-order’ process highlighted above has been to pull 
together a universal and consistent approach to the pipeline of opportunities across the Group 
(both in terms of customer, market segment and geography). This has highlighted a pipeline 
of over £500 million worth of opportunities which has been ranked according to whether it is at 
the research, pre-bid, bid or negotiation stage. To support this constantly evolving pipeline 
specific opportunities are then highlighted and an active account-based marketing approach 
applied aimed at increasing the chances of conversion from pipeline to order intake. 
 
Development and Future Growth 
We continued to invest in research and development (“R&D”) during the year spending £0.6 
million of which £0.3 million was capitalised. Our focus has been on the development of the 
next generation of products and services in order to expand the potential addressable 
markets into which both Hayward Tyler and Peter Brotherhood can sell. Numerous projects 
are therefore on-going across both businesses but simplistically they can be split into the 
following growth categories: 
 
 Product development – looking at opportunities to provide a ‘motor above pump’ 
package to increase our scope of supply to the offshore oil industry; 
 Market development – developing and extending our range of compressors for the 
downstream refining market; and 
 Diversification – developing our wet-wound motors to provide a generator for tidal 
applications. 
 
Analysis of the expansion into new markets, new products and a combination of both opens 
up further opportunities for the Group’s niche offerings by a significant factor representing 
billions of pounds worth of opportunity, addressable over the medium to long-term. Specific 
examples include: 
 
 Partnership with the University of Edinburgh 
Hayward Tyler has been working with the University of Edinburgh, to develop a 
generator to harness wave energy and convert it to power. The C-Gen Neptune 
generator has been developed to a working prototype and Hayward Tyler has now 
secured over £0.7 million of funding to support the manufacture and development of 
this technology at the recently completed Centre of Excellence. 
 
 Development of alliance agreement with FSubsea 
Hayward Tyler’s motor and qualified penetrator technology has been selected for 
adoption to support the subsea deployment of the FSubsea Omnirise system. The 
prototype won this year's OTC Spotlight on New Technology Award and is due to be 
tested as a full-scale prototype of the world's most autonomous boosting system. This 
system has the potential to unlock single and multi-phase boosting solutions for a far 
wider number of subsea wells than can currently be economically accessed using 
existing technologies thus creating significant opportunities for Hayward Tyler. 
 
The Smart Factory 
Operationally we continued to drive improvements through all our facilities focused on the key 
headline metrics of right first time (“RFT”) and on time in full (“OTIF”). Our Peter Brotherhood 
facility in Peterborough is world-class and primed ready to support the anticipated uptick in 
the FPSO and steam turbine mechanical drive market. Our facility in Hayward Tyler,  Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017  
   
21 
 
Colchester, has made significant strides along its lean journey over the past five years driving 
down lead times in its service value stream from over 25 weeks to less than 7 weeks whilst 
doubling on-time delivery to over 90%. In our Luton-based Centre of Excellence we were 
particularly proud to have recently won the UK prestigious “Smart Factory” of the year award 
(having already been shortlisted for World-Class Manufacturing) ahead of the likes of Ricardo 
UK Ltd and Siemens plc. This is testament to the significant investment made in our ability to 
ship OTIF and RFT once we have won the orders. The Smart Factory represents the twenty-
first century approach to linking seamlessly marketing and sales and operational planning. 
The linking of the process from customer order through design, manufacture, engineering, 
assembly, test, despatch and back through support, monitoring and full lifecycle maintenance 
and management, will continue to provide a real differentiator for the Group going forward. 
 
Working Together, Succeeding Together 
In addition to the focus on win-order and operational improvements the Group has also had a 
busy year in terms of gaining recognition amongst its peer group for its long-term 
development plans. At the recent Manufacturer MX Awards (supported by the UK’s Institution 
of Mechanical Engineers), Hayward Tyler was shortlisted for the Apprentice of the Year, for 
People and Skills and for World-Class Manufacturing and was successful in winning both the 
Smart Factory Award as mentioned above and also the Leadership & Strategy Award.   
 
We were also delighted to welcome the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in August 2016 to 
open the Centre of Excellence and formally present the Queen’s Award for Enterprise 
(International Trade). Over 350 employees, family members, customers and local dignitaries 
joined us for this very prestigious and historic occasion and it marked another milestone in 
Hayward Tyler’s long and rich history. 
 
Against some challenging market conditions these successes underpin the strength of the 
Hayward Tyler and Peter Brotherhood businesses, both of whom compete against some 
much larger corporations on a global scale. Their respective abilities to ‘punch above their 
weight’ is testament to the employees we have and our shared set of values which are; Pride, 
Innovation, Pace and Excellence (see Corporate Social Responsibility). These shared values 
go to the heart of what unites us as an ever expanding Group. For this and for our employees’ 
continued fortitude, good humour and patience I thank-you with all sincerity for being part of 
two great engineering brands. 
 
Outlook 
I’ve written previously about the long-term nature of our growth plans and the market 
conditions which we’ve witnessed over the past year highlight how important it is to be able to 
invest through the cycle. Over the past five years we’ve seen the Group grow (both 
organically and through the acquisition of the Peter Brotherhood operations) from a revenue 
run rate of £32 million to over £80 million and increase in size to over 500 highly skilled, 
educated and motivated employees. We’ve seen the transformation of the main Luton facility 
into a world-class Centre of Excellence, the resurrection of the Peter Brotherhood name into a 
business that is getting back its ‘mojo’ and is hungry for growth and increased investment in 
our apprentice, graduate and employee training schemes. 
 
This is why it is great to be able to confirm the recommended acquisition of the Group by 
Avingtrans plc, another UK AIM-listed engineering group that has the balance sheet strength 
and supportive shareholder base to be able to continue to invest in both Hayward Tyler and 
Peter Brotherhood and support the Group’s longer term growth plans.

Introduction 
Revenue in FY2017 was too low to cover all of our fixed cost base, which had been geared-
up to service significantly higher revenue. That led to breakeven trading EBITDA and a 
reported loss of £3.9 million (FY2016: profit of £2.4 million). That loss together with major 
capital expenditure and an increase in working capital led to substantially higher net debt, 
which has been a significant challenge to the Group despite a strong recovery in EBITDA in 
the second half of the year.

Trading Operating Results 
Revenue 
We continue to operate two service lines within Hayward Tyler and Peter Brotherhood to 
deliver our products and services. These lines are original equipment manufacturing (“OE”) 
and aftermarket services (“AM”). OE revenue was lower across Hayward Tyler and Peter 
Brotherhood, however, there was a strong increase in AM revenue from Hayward Tyler, 
Colchester, driven by the Nuclear market, and Peter Brotherhood, driven by a full-year 
contribution
1
 and the reinvigoration of the brand. These changes generated a revenue mix 
from OE and AM in FY2017 of 30%:70% (FY2016: 44%:56%).  
 
Overall Group revenue was slightly higher at £62.7 million (FY2016: £61.6 million) with the 
increase due to a full-year’s contribution
1
 from Peter Brotherhood. Our broad geographical 
coverage and diversity of markets whilst providing us with a degree of resilience were not 
enough to offset the adverse market conditions in Oil and Gas, the US aftermarket for Power 
and the China and India new build Power markets, which led to lower than expected order 
intake and thereby lower revenue. Hayward Tyler revenue was £46.5 million (FY2016: £49.1 
million) and Peter Brotherhood revenue was £16.2 million (FY2016: £12.5 million), the 
increase resulting from a full year’s contribution
1
 from Peter Brotherhood. 
 
In terms of the total Group, Power was the largest sector at 44% of revenue (FY2016: 51%), 
down on prior year due to lower revenue from China, whilst both Nuclear and Oil and Gas 
were stronger. Nuclear represented 26% of revenue (FY2016: 21%), driven by OE and AM 
revenue from KHNP in South Korea, and Oil and Gas was 15% of revenue (FY2016: 11%) 
reflecting turnover from Peter Brotherhood and Hayward Tyler’s subsea units. Revenue from 
other markets that include chemical, defence, industrial and renewables was more or less 
level at 16% (FY2016: 17%). The largest geographical market was Asia Pacific (excluding 
China) at 32% of revenue (FY2016: 25%), of which South Korea was the single largest 
market reflecting Nuclear sales. China was 6% (FY2016: 13%) reflecting sales of BCP new 
units and aftermarket services. The USA accounted for 24% of revenue (FY2016: 22%) 
followed by the UK at 13% of revenue (FY2016: 19%) and Europe excluding the UK 12% 
(FY2016: 10%). 
 
Profit and Profit Margin 
We increased the size of the Group in anticipation of achieving significantly higher revenues, 
however, revenue of £62.7 million for the year was too low to cover all of our factory 
overheads including labour, rent and utilities. This led to a gross profit margin of 28% 
(FY2016: 33%). See Table 1. 
 
Table 1: Reported Gross Profit Margin 
 
However, I am encouraged to report that the underlying gross profit margin
2
 was strong at 
43% (FY2016: 41%) noticeably ahead of our KPI target of 35% indicating that we are 
maintaining or improving our underlying profit margins. The underlying gross profit margin of 
Hayward Tyler’s OE business was 34% continuing the upward trend of the last few years and 
a testament to the process of continuous improvement (particularly in operations) 
implemented throughout the Group. Peter Brotherhood’s OE business delivered an underlying 
gross loss margin of 7% as a result of a lack of work and therefore the tendency to ‘over-
burden’ a small number of contracts with excess cost. The underlying gross profit margin in 
the AM business of Hayward Tyler and Peter Brotherhood were strong at 52% and 51% 
respectively. See Table 2.

 operating charges in the year excluding depreciation and amortisation were £17.3 
million (FY2016: £13.2 million), of which Peter Brotherhood represented £2.8 million (FY2016: 
£1.2 million) and Hayward Tyler was £14.5 million (FY2016: £12.0 million). The increased 
charges in Peter Brotherhood were driven by the inclusion of a full-year
1
 of costs whilst the 
increase in Hayward Tyler in FY2017 mainly reflects increased payroll costs, travel expenses 
and foreign exchange losses on cash flow hedges established prior to the Brexit vote and the 
resulting weakening of sterling. Taken together with the gross profit of £17.3 million that 
delivered an overall breakeven trading EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation) in FY2017 (FY2016: £7.2 million).  
 
Depreciation and amortisation was higher at £2.5 million (FY2016: £1.4 million) reflecting 
inclusion of a full-year
1
 of Peter Brotherhood and the start of depreciation on the Centre of 
Excellence following the opening of the manufacturing facility in August 2016. As a result 
there was a trading operating loss of £2.5 million (FY2016: profit of £5.8 million).  Trading
3
 
loss before tax was £3.7 million (FY2016: profit of £5.1 million).  
 
The Group is exposed to the US Dollar through its operating business in the USA and from 
UK exports to China. On a constant exchange rate
4
 basis revenue and operating profit in 
FY2016 would have been higher by £4.4 million and £1.9 million respectively. 
 
Non-Trading
5
 Operating Results 
Non-trading other income was £0.5 million (FY2016: £nil), which resulted from a positive legal 
settlement relating to the building contractor in Luton, and non-trading operating charges were 
£0.1 million (FY2016: £1.8 million), which represent the amortisation of the Peter Brotherhood 
order book and the final costs arising from the acquisition of that business. 
 
Finance Charges 
Trading finance costs in the year were £1.2 million (FY2016: £0.6 million) mainly reflecting 
higher debt levels during the year. Non-trading finance costs were £nil (FY2016: £0.4 million). 
 
Tax 
There was a trading tax charge for the year of £0.2 million (FY2016: £0.6 million), which 
represents tax payable on profits in the USA and China of £1.2 million (FY2016: £0.7 million) 
offset by £1.0 million tax credit on losses in the UK. The tax credit in the UK includes an 
additional benefit from research and development tax incentives together with the annual 
investment allowance deduction granted by HMRC. There was a non-trading tax charge of 
£0.4 million (FY2016: £41,000) representing a reduction in the deferred tax asset following 
the change in UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% (£292,000) together with a tax charge 
on the non-trading other income and operating charges (£75,000). 
 
Net Profit 
The loss for the year was £3.9 million (FY2016: profit of £2.4 million), which delivered a basic 
loss per share of 7.07 pence per share (FY2016: earnings per share of 4.89 pence) and 
diluted loss per share of 6.93 pence (FY2016: earning per share of 4.89 pence).

Dividends 
The Group paid its interim dividend of 0.58 pence per share in February 2017 at a total cost of 
£0.3 million. Given the announced proposed acquisition of the Company by Avingtrans plc we 
do not intend to recommend the payment of a final dividend for FY2017.   
 
Capital Expenditure 
Purchase of fixed assets and investment in research and development was £6.4 million in the 
year (FY2016: £11.6 million), of which £3.7 million (FY2016: £9.8 million) was invested in the 
Centre of Excellence, £1.7million (FY2016: £0.7 million) relates to expenditure in HT 
Colchester on new plant and equipment together with a revised layout of the shop floor to 
increase capacity, and £0.3 million (FY2016: £0.8 million) relates to capitalised development 
costs. In addition, the net expense on the Centre of Excellence was £1.6 million (FY2016: 
£0.9 million) representing costs of £1.9 million (FY2016: £1.2 million), which mainly related to 
depreciation and lease interest relating to the capital expenditure together with research, 
development and training, offset by RGF grant income of £0.3 million (FY2016: £0.3 million). 
 
Further details of the accounting treatment of the RGF programme are given in note 2.24 to 
these financial statements. 
 
Peter Brotherhood Acquisition 
On 30 October 2015 the Group acquired the trade and assets of Peter Brotherhood for a total 
consideration of £10.1 million (USD15.4 million) following an adjustment for working capital. 
Under IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) a buyer is required to consider the fair value of the 
assets and liabilities that it purchased during the first 12 months of ownership and, in the case 
of Peter Brotherhood the provisional fair value was determined to be £9.8 million, which gave 
rise to goodwill on acquisition of over £0.3 million. The final fair value was confirmed as £9.8 
million during FY2017. 
 
Cash Generation and Working Capital 
Net cash used in operating activities was £5.4 million (FY2016: net cash generated £5.1 
million). This use mainly reflects the net change in working capital.  
 
Net working capital increased from £7.2 million at 31 March 2016 to £12.0 million at 31 March 
2017 driven by high revenues in March that led to an increase of £3.5 million in trade 
receivables. This, together with capital expenditure in the year of £6.4 million led to a 
reduction in undrawn borrowing facilities to £1.7 million (FY2016: £5.1 million). Details of 
cash, borrowings and related interest rates are given in notes 23 and 29 to these financial 
statements.  
 
Funding 
During FY2017 we arranged a number of borrowing and ancillary facilities to support the 
Group’s on-going business including: 
 A £2.4 million short-term increase to the UK committed revolving credit facility; 
 A £3.0 million increase in equipment finance leases to help fund the purchase of new 
plant and machinery; and 
 A £2.7 million increase in drawings under the loan note programme to replace short-
term borrowings that had been used to fund the completion of the Centre of 
Excellence.  
 
The relationship that we have with our banking partners and the support that they have given 
the Group have been very valuable. The Group continues to have constructive discussions 
with its bank, Royal Bank of Scotland ("RBS"), regarding a suitable long-term financing 
structure to support the prospects of the business. RBS has granted four 30-day extensions 
with respect to repayment of the £2.4 million short-term increase in facilities noted above and 
the annualised measurement of the financial covenants, both of which have most recently 
been extended from 30 June 2017 to 28 July 2017. The Directors have therefore been 
seeking a longer term funding solution that can deliver the record order book and underpin 
the longer term prospects for the Group and remove the short-term uncertainty surrounding 
the capital structure. Accordingly, it is encouraging to report that the proposed acquisition of  Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017  
   
29 
 
the Group by Avingtrans plc provides the balance sheet strength and funding capacity to 
support the future growth of the Group. 
 
Borrowings  
Net debt increased from £8.6 million at 31 March 2016 to £22.1 million at 31 March 2017 
mainly driven by breakeven EBITDA, capital expenditure and the increase in working capital.  
 
At 31 March 2017 net debt comprised: 
 Term borrowings of £8.2 million (FY2016: £5.9 million); 
 Finance leases of £3.6 million (FY2016: £1.6 million); and  
 Drawings under revolving credit facilities of £11.5 million (FY2016: £6.2 million) offset 
by cash £1.2 million (FY2016: £5.1 million).  
 
Going Concern 
The Directors have considered: 
 The Group’s budget for the coming year and its projections through to 2020; 
 The likelihood that the proposed acquisition of the Company by Avingtrans plc (the 
“Avingtrans Transaction”) will complete;  
 The Group’s long-term financing arrangements as part of an enlarged group 
following the Avingtrans Transaction; and 
 In the unlikely event that the Avingtrans Transaction does not complete, the 
alternative funding solutions available to the Group and the Company,  
the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the 
Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the Company continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017. More detail on Going 
Concern is contained in Note 2.1 of the financial statements. 
 
Pensions 
Within the UK, the Group operates a defined benefit plan, with benefits linked to final salary, 
and a defined contribution plan (“DCP”). With effect from 1 June 2003 the defined benefit plan 
was closed to future service accruals and new UK employees offered membership of the 
DCP. A full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit plan is produced every three years, the 
last one being as at 1 January 2014. The next full actuarial valuation as at 1 January 2017 is 
due by 31 March 2018 at the latest.  
 
A valuation is prepared at each financial year end for the purposes of the report and accounts 
by independent qualified actuaries. The net surplus increased during the financial year to £1.0 
million at 31 March 2017 (FY2016: £0.2 million) mainly due to higher investment returns and 
contributions by the Company exceeding the increase in scheme liabilities as a result of 
actuarial assumptions. 
 
Details of pensions and employee obligations are given in note 28 to the financial statements. 
 
Statement of Financial Position 
Total equity reduced by £3.4 million to £22.4 million mainly as a result of the loss of £3.9 
million and the payment of dividends in the year of £0.8 million offset by the gain on the 
translation of overseas subsidiaries of £0.8 million and the net gain in value of the pension 
scheme of £0.5 million.

Outlook 
I would mirror Ewan’s view that the last few years have been very fulfilling as we have led the 
transformation of the business into a Group capable of achieving a considerable role in its 
chosen markets. With that in mind I am encouraged by the proposed acquisition of the 
Company by Avingtrans plc, the strength of whose balance sheet presents the opportunity for 
significant growth in shareholder value, based on the performance of Hayward Tyler and 
Peter Brotherhood, as well as being in the interests of all our stakeholders.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
 
The Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material 
impact on its performance and financial position.  
 
“Our approach to risk is intended to protect the interests of our shareholders and other 
stakeholders whilst allowing sensible risk taking that is critical to growth.” 
 
Managing Risk 
Identifying, assessing and managing risk is the responsibility of the Board. Our 
approach to risk is intended to protect the interests of our shareholders and other 
stakeholders whilst allowing the business to develop and to grow. Our risk appetite 
depends on the nature of an individual risk and it is considered in Board discussions 
as the need arises but also as part of our regular risk review process in the Audit 
Committee. From time to time we obtain advice from third party experts in a cost 
effective manner to complement and supplement in-house knowledge. 
 
The long-term success of the Group relies, in part, on managing the risks to our business. 
Whilst the Group has long-established risk management policies and practices in place, which 
address and monitor risk, we endeavour to develop those practices each year. The Chief 
Financial Officer is responsible for risk management on behalf of the Board and the Audit 
Committee reviews the risk register on a regular basis. Ultimately our aim is to ensure that 
risk management is embedded within the core processes of our business units.  
 
Risk Management Process 
The Group uses a risk register to help coordinate its risk management process. The risk 
register identifies the key business risks and documents the policies and practices in place to 
mitigate those risks. In addition, the risks are assessed as to their probability and their impact 
in order to determine a risk score.  
 
Principal Risks 
We classify the risks to the business into three groups, namely, strategic risk, operational risk 
and financial risk. The principal risks identified by the Directors under these groups are set out 
in the table below. The risks considered during the Group-wide risk management process 
cover a wider range of issues than the top 10 that are listed in this table.

Risk Potential Impact Mitigation 
Strategic Risk   
A. Growth Strategy 
and Competition 
Part 1 – Growth 
 
A fundamental part of the 
Group’s strategy is growth from 
both OE and AM and as part of 
that strategy the Group has 
geared-up its fixed cost base to 
be able to turnover £80 million or 
more in a year. The growth is 
reliant on our markets. These 
markets demonstrate long-term 
growth but remain highly 
competitive. 
 
Failure to generate sufficient 
order intake and revenue to cover 
the fixed cost base could give 
rise to lower profit and cash 
generation that constrains the 
Group. 
 
Failure to keep-up with 
technological change could give 
rise to the Group’s products, 
services and technologies 
becoming less competitive. 
 
 
The Group is a specialist business providing niche 
engineering solutions for the global energy sector. It 
has an excellent market profile (quality, reliability and 
customer relationships), which results in inclusion on 
sector bid/quote opportunities. 
 
The Group has invested, and is investing, in key 
aspects to maintain and improve the Group’s 
competitive position including:  
 employees (see E below) including 
appointment of a Chief Commercial Officer with 
significant experience in the sector on 1 
January 2017; 
 supply chain (see F below); 
 developing and maintaining strong 
relationships with key customers; 
 capital expenditure on the Centre of Excellence 
and plant and equipment;  
 research and development of products and 
processes (see Strategy in Action); and 
 aftermarket initiatives including supporting end-
of-life extension programmes. 
 
Following the result for FY2017 the Group is 
implementing a programme to reduce its fixed cost 
base to lower its operational gearing. 
 
B. Growth Strategy 
and Competition 
Part 2 – 
Acquisition Risk 
 
The Group acquired a new 
subsidiary on 30 October 2015, 
Peter Brotherhood (“PBL”), the 
former Peterborough operations 
of Dresser-Rand. 
 
Failure to re-establish this 
business could (1) absorb a 
disproportionate part of 
management resource at the 
expense of other parts of the 
Group and (2) reduce the 
Group’s profitability. 
 
The Group completed the following actions to mitigate 
this risk: 
 pre-deal due diligence; 
 achieving a balance between attractive 
purchase price and business purchase 
agreement terms and conditions; 
 appropriate funding of the acquisition and on-
going business followed by de-leveraging the 
business; 
 establishing a senior management team 
complemented by experienced executives from 
Hayward Tyler: 
 development of employees; 
 focusing on marketing and sales including 
growing its AM business; and 
 re-organising the business on the basis of 
process flow lines. 
 
C. Execution 
 
The Group designs, 
manufactures and services highly 
technical products that are 
mission critical to the end user.  
 
Failure to satisfy contractual 
obligations could give rise to 
significant losses (e.g. warranty 
claims), cash constraints, lost 
future orders and adverse impact 
on the Group’s reputation.  
 
The Group continues to invest heavily in its people, 
processes and products to maintain and improve 
lead times and product innovation. These steps 
include inter alia enhanced customer relationship 
management, sales and operational planning, 
process flow mapping, increased research and 
development, product standardisation and enhancing 
process capability. 
 
The Group also seeks to minimise the impact of 
execution risk through its terms of trade such as (1) 
limiting the undertakings it gives to pay liquidated 
damages and (2) avoiding consequential damages 
altogether.

Risk Potential Impact Mitigation 
Strategic Risk   
D. Global Economic 
Activity 
 
The Group operates in global 
energy, industrial and defence 
markets. A slowdown in those 
markets including the possible 
impact from on-going economic 
and political uncertainty may 
adversely impact order intake, 
liquidity needs, terms of trade 
and the financial performance of 
the Group. 
 
For the year being reported, local senior management 
were responsible for monitoring and responding to 
changes in their markets. From 1 April 2017 this 
responsibility has transferred to the Chief Commercial 
Officer. 
 
The Group has a diversified geographical and sector 
spread that reduces the impact of localised economic 
trends and activities. In addition, the Group is 
investing in research and development to develop 
new products or adapt existing products for use in 
other applications in order to broaden its product 
offering to reduce the risk. 
 
E. Employees 
 
Attracting and retaining our 
talented people is a Group 
priority to ensure our continued 
success. The Group prides itself 
on the skilled and highly trained 
and qualified employees who 
demonstrate their commitment to 
the Group through the continuous 
improvement of our products, 
processes and procedures which 
impacts on the Group’s 
performance. 
 
Failure to attract the right talent, 
including highly trained and 
qualified engineering staff, could 
inhibit the rate of product and 
process development as well as 
impact on the Group’s 
performance. 
 
 
Recruitment and retention of employees remains a 
key focus for the Group to ensure its continued 
success.  
 
Group mitigating actions include: 
 continuing the significant investment in training  
and development;  
 personal development reviews;  
 career path and mobility conversations to 
support individuals career aspirations and 
enhance the Group’s secondment 
opportunities;  
 succession planning;  
 outreach to Universities, Colleges and Local 
Schools;  
 monitoring pay and benchmarking;  
 maintaining the very successful graduate and  
apprentice programmes;  
 stepping-up overall employee engagement;  
 embedding the gain-share programme into 
employee remuneration packages to 
incentivise performance;  
 introduction of the Agility system to ensure 
suitably qualified experienced persons and 
monitored and developed to identify and 
reduce business risks; and 
 utilisation of external and Group resource to 
offset the absence of key personnel. 
 
Operational Risk   
F. Supply Chain 
 
The Group has an increasing 
dependence on its supply chain 
as part of its aim to improve 
throughput and minimise stock. 
 
Failure of that supply chain can 
result in operational disruption 
and delays to shipments to 
customers leading to potential 
loss of profit and damage to 
customer relationships. 
A strategic sourcing policy was implemented in 
FY2013. As part of the Group’s programme of 
continuous improvement the implementation of this 
policy is being reinvigorated.  
 
Mitigating actions include: 
 sourcing strategies to avoid single point 
dependence for any key commodity and 
standardisation to support possible stock 
holdings; 
 identifying in-house capability and focused 
investment in related capital expenditure;  
 exception reporting, daily operational planning 
and review processes support the early 
identification of risk and where necessary 
action; 
 monitoring of supplier performance; 
 a reduced number of suppliers with strategic, 
long-term partnerships on key components; 
 strengthening of supply chain teams; and 
 continuous supply chain benchmarking and 
development.

Financial Risk   
G. Funding 
 
The Group is dependent on its 
ability to service its debts and 
refinance existing borrowings 
when they fall due as well as to 
fund working capital, capital 
expenditure, and research and 
development.  
 
If the Group fails to generate 
profits and cash it could face 
funding constraints that impact 
the business cycle. 
 
The Group manages its capital to continue as a going 
concern and maintain its liquidity. The Group 
continually reforecasts its borrowing requirements, 
which include: 
 an 8-week rolling cash flow forecast produced 
each day; 
 a 15-week cash flow forecast produced each 
month; and 
 a 12-month rolling profit and loss, balance 
sheet and cash flow forecast each quarter 
to ensure that funding is available to support its 
operations and its compliance with borrowing 
covenants.  
 
The Group maintains committed UK bank credit 
facilities augmented by specific funding to support the 
investment in the Centre of Excellence and a bonding 
facility. In addition, the Group maintains an active 
bank relationship programme and close relationship 
with UK Export Finance to help to safeguard its ability 
to fund its needs. 
 
New funding arrangements were established during 
FY2017 to support the Group’s working capital needs, 
including a temporary £2.4 million extension to the UK 
revolving credit facility and a £2.7 million increase to 
the loan note programme, however, lower revenue, 
profit and cash generation has constrained the Group 
in 2H2017. 
 
H. Working 
Capital 
 
As a fundamental part of the 
Group’s strategy is growth the 
Group is exposed to a potential 
increase in its working capital 
requirement that absorbs cash. If 
the Group fails to keep this 
increase under control it could 
face cash constraints that impact 
the business cycle. 
The Group is seeking to mitigate this risk through the 
following means: 
 standard terms and conditions of 
manufacturing contracts require a customer to 
make stage payments to fund working capital 
on the contract. Where stage payments cannot 
be achieved by the Group it may be possible to 
augment borrowing and bonding lines through 
use of the short-term funding schemes 
provided by UK Export Finance with whom the 
Group has a close relationship; 
 a Group-wide initiative to reduce stock; 
 increased manufacturing velocity through 
workflow re-engineering to reduce working 
capital requirements per unit of revenue; 
 through active management of accounts 
receivable and accounts payable; and 
 linking employee remuneration to the control of 
cash and working capital. 
 
I. Currency  The Group operates and sells in 
overseas markets that may utilise 
currencies other than those in 
which its principal costs are 
denominated. The exposure to 
foreign exchange rate 
fluctuations may, as a result, 
affect the Group’s cash flow. The 
principal risk is US Dollar income. 
 
The Group’s policy is to hedge its transaction 
exposures (i.e. cash flows) on a rolling 12 month 
basis and build a foundation of cover for non-
contracted flows in the 12 to 24 month period. As at 
31 March 2017, 76% of estimated USD net inflows 
into the UK over the following 12 months were 
hedged. 
 
Currency hedging lines are available from two 
providers.

J.  Pension 
Scheme 
 
 
The Group maintains a defined 
benefit pension scheme. 
 
The Group could be required to 
increase its contributions to cover 
funding shortfalls caused by poor 
investment performance of 
scheme assets, a deterioration in 
the discount rate or inflation rate 
applied and changes in life 
expectancy of members of the 
scheme. 
 
The scheme is closed to new members and to future 
benefit improvements. The performance of the 
investment advisers is monitored closely by the 
Company and pension trustees and action taken 
where that is not satisfactory. The assumptions used 
to determine the pension deficit/surplus are based on 
recommendations of the actuary to the scheme. The 
Directors discuss the pension scheme at each Board 
meeting and there is regular contact with the pension 
fund trustees. 
 
The aim is to strengthen the financial position of 
Hayward Tyler Ltd, the sponsor company, through its 
underlying performance, which assures stakeholders 
and helps to maintain or reduce contributions to cover 
any funding shortfall. 
 
The plan trustees have selected a liability driven 
investment strategy and glide path aimed at reducing 
interest and inflation rate risks and providing a return 
that matches or exceeds the growth in projected 
pension plan liabilities.

Corporate Social Responsibility 
 
We lead our business responsibly to meet our stakeholders’ needs and we are driving 
improvements to our corporate social responsibility as part of our programme of 
continuous improvement. 
 
“We are rightly proud of our long history of 
working with and supporting our local 
communities both directly and indirectly 
through the actions of our employees” 
 
 
Leadership on corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) matters is provided by the 
Board. CSR is managed by our business units and it forms an integral part of their day-
to-day operations.  
 
Our key areas of focus  
As an employer and manufacturer, HTG focuses on five key areas: 
 Our People and Values 
 Safety 
 Environment 
 Society 
 Celebrating Our Success 
The year to 31 March 2017 continued to see increased focus on these key areas, with a 
number of new initiatives aimed at enhancing existing, and developing new, activities and 
procedures. 
 
A shared set of values: 
PRIDE in what we do 
INNOVATION in thought, process and product 
PACE getting things done 
EXCELLENCE in everything we do 
 
People and Values 
The success of the Group is linked to the vision, performance and success of our people. We 
look at every new hire strategically as an opportunity to continuously develop a pipeline of 
talented individuals and ensure we have succession plans in place to support our people’s 
career aspirations. We provide an environment that encourages innovation and supports 
internal career progression. 
 
We continue to work in partnership with local Schools, Colleges and Universities developing 
constructive working relationships. Hayward Tyler Luton has been collaborating with the 
University of Bedfordshire supporting approximately 120 MBA students providing ‘live’ 
business projects that the students work on as part of their MBA programme. Peter 
Brotherhood welcomed a number of the MBA students to its Peterborough site to see how the 
projects were being implemented and supporting our business strategies. Hayward Tyler 
Colchester has further nurtured its relationship with Universities, especially the University of 
Vermont, by leading tours of the facility and giving presentations on campus. 
 
We know the importance of continued professional development (CPD) to enhance our 
people’s knowledge, skills and experience and we provide technical and soft skills training, on 
the job development, mentoring and coaching from senior management to improve their 
performance and prepare our people for career progression. We invest in our people and 
Peter Brotherhood have already undertaken 2,200 hours of personal development to give 
them new tools, skills and competencies to enhance their productivity and performance, 
which has been welcomed by our Peter Brotherhood employees. Hayward Tyler Luton has 
undertaken a further 9,000 hours of development during 2016 building upon a significant 
investment in our people’s continued professional development.

In December 2016 we invited 48 of our long service award employees to a celebratory lunch 
at a local hotel, the Luton Hoo. We have many employees who have remained loyal to 
Hayward Tyler or Peter Brotherhood, with 20, 30 and even 40 years continuous service and 
this event recognised their commitment and provided an opportunity to reward our employees 
and celebrate in their success. 
 
We know a healthy workforce is a productive workforce and our employees’ well-being is as 
important to us providing competitive salaries and an exceptional benefits plan and we 
encourage our employees to take advantage of discounted gym membership in the UK and 
free gym membership in the USA. We operate the Bike2Work scheme and our employees 
engage in many social activities such as golf, football, cycling and fishing events coordinated 
through our active Social Clubs. Additionally our USA employees enjoy a Wellness bonus of 
$100 to spend on any healthy activity or product of their choosing, such as running shoes, 
race entries, snowshoes etc.  
 
Teamwork is an important aspect of our company culture and you will find a near constant 
stream of employee-led events, such as company parties, celebrations, chili and barbecue 
cook-off competitions and celebrations of everything from National Pizza day to National 
Sundae day. 
 
As highlighted above, we operate with a shared set of values across the Group. Referred to 
as PIPE (Pride, Innovation, Pace and Excellence) their purpose is to further develop our 
culture of customer service and continuous improvement underpinned by these values. 
Integrity forms an important part of these values, which encompass our dealings with all our 
stakeholders including inter alia customers, suppliers and each other. These values are 
promoted in our employee handbook, contracts of employment, internal policies such as 
compliance with the UK Bribery Act 2010 and is fundamental to our performance 
development review programme. 
 
Safety  
The Group prioritises the safety of its employees above all else. Safety is managed and 
reported on visual display boards, including relevant KPIs, so that all employees are aware of 
the safety performance and the personal impact that they have both individually and 
collectively. 
 
We lead our business responsibly to meet our stakeholders’ needs and we are driving 
improvements to our corporate social responsibility as part of our programme of continuous 
improvement. 
 
All employees are encouraged to report any accident, near miss or safety observation across 
all sites. All relevant information is recorded daily and displayed on visual display boards 
located in each production area as well as in office-based departments. Safety is discussed in 
daily production meetings as well as at management’s monthly review meetings with each 
business unit and at each monthly board meeting. This commitment to health and safety has 
seen a reduction in incidents, which can be attributed to the vast amount of work carried out 
over the past year to enhance our health and safety procedures from risk assessments to 
accident reporting as part of our continuous improvement programme. For example, the 
introduction of a ground-level dynamic and moveable workstations capable of carrying loads 
of up to 15 tonnes, known as Cruser™ trolleys, in the Hayward Tyler Luton production line 
have drastically reduced crane and forklift truck usage. That step has resulted in 60% less 
crane-usage and the elimination of forklift trucks thereby reducing risks significantly. The plan 
is to roll-out Crusers™ around the whole of the Group.  
 
Further evidence of our commitment to health and safety is that Hayward Tyler Colchester 
received the Governor’s Award for Outstanding Workplace Safety in 2016, an award which 
shines a light on this commitment to continuously improving our safety culture.

Environment  
At HTG we have a commitment to comply with regulatory statutes and requirements and to 
drive towards a minimal environmental impact. This commitment has included among other 
things the following: 
 Hayward Tyler Colchester, Luton and Peter Brotherhood replaced their lighting with 
energy efficient, long-lasting LED bulbs and installed motion sensors;  
 Hayward Tyler Colchester has instituted a programme by which scrap copper is sold 
and the proceeds are utilised to help with emergency personal or family needs as part 
of an employee assistance programme; 
 Hayward Tyler Luton has a new gas heating system installed in the factory, which 
should see a reduction in total usage in excess of 10% and the installation of 50kw 
solar panels across the factory should generate a £100,000 saving during their 
lifetime;  
 Hayward Tyler Luton removed over 200 skips of scrap from the site, thereby creating 
a more ergonomic work environment, and reinvested the proceeds from its sale in 
further process improvements. The Finance department has achieved a paperless 
environment saving in excess of 15,000 sheets of paper a year and other business 
units are now striving to operate in a paperless environment to create a leaner and 
more productive work environment. Similarly an employee suggestion at Hayward 
Tyler Colchester to change printer default settings to print ‘double sided’ has resulted 
in saving multiple thousands of sheets of paper and other sites have implemented this 
initiative to further reduce our environmental footprint. In addition, Hayward Tyler 
Luton is re-cladding the walls and replacing the roof of its existing building as well as 
installing 0.5MW of solar panels on the roof as part of the development of the Centre 
of Excellence. These steps will improve the environmental footprint of the business 
and reduce its energy usage substantially;  
 Peter Brotherhood has a long-term plan in place to reduce its environmental impact. 
This plan includes a continued commitment to tracking its environmental impact, for 
example, annual reduction in paper usage, and have recently installed a new water 
heater system, designed by Peter Brotherhood staff, that saves nearly 50,000kWh 
per annum. That saving equates to around a 40% cost reduction. From 2015 no 
waste has been sent to landfill, rather it is being recycled, reused or sent for energy 
regeneration;  
 Combining the values of responsibility for the environment and society, employees of 
Hayward Tyler Colchester volunteered to organise a local ‘green-up’ day. As part of 
this day, over 20 employees have cleaned-up four miles of local roads as an annual 
spring event; 
 Hayward Tyler East Kilbride holds both ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification, which 
have contributed to a significant reduction in the business unit’s impact on the 
environment from projects such as reducing landfill waste, improving energy 
efficiency on site and manufacturing without using hazardous, toxic or scarce 
materials. In addition, Hayward Tyler East Kilbride is currently working on projects to 
meet the new requirements of both these standards prior to their introduction in 2018; 
 Hayward Tyler East Kilbride worked tirelessly to ensure on-going compliance with all 
relevant health and safety legislation and related standards culminating in a 
successful Lloyds audit and certification to OHSAS 18001. Hayward Tyler Colchester 
and Peter Brotherhood have also both achieved OHSAS 18001 certification;  
 Hayward Tyler East Kilbride is undertaking a “Transformation Project” to achieve 
ISO9 and Fit4Nuclear status supported by Scottish Enterprise. This transformation 
project will ensure our systems, processes, procedures, infrastructure, machinery and 
our people are prepared for future growth. Rhona Alison, Head of Business 
Development at Scottish Enterprise joined the team for a Mega 5S event and 
acknowledged the commitment from the senior leadership team to transform the 
capability of Hayward Tyler East Kilbride.  Already through consolidation of all 
traditional manufacturing techniques into bays 1 and 2, the business has brought 
bays 3 and 4 up to ISO9 and Fit4Nuclear particulate level compliance. This will 
enable Hayward Tyler East Kilbride to provide parts for subsea, nuclear and oil and 
gas components to the same standard as the Centre of Excellence.

Society 
As part of our Employee Well Being programme we continue to support our employees in 
their charitable contributions to the local community and this year we have matched donations 
to charities such as:  
 Peter Brotherhood celebrated its 150
th
 anniversary and will be hosting a number of 
events throughout 2017, including an Open Day for current and past employees and 
their families with local dignitaries and the press in attendance. Peter Brotherhood 
began in 1867 and a cycle ride is planned commencing on the original premises and 
finishing at our modern facility in Peterborough to raise money for a number of 
charitable causes; 
 Hayward Tyler Colchester has a long history of supporting community events, such 
as Colchester High School’s Project Graduation and the Colchester Community 
Winter Carnival. One particular tradition that continues at Hayward Tyler Colchester is 
our annual Green-Up Day. This year more than a third of our employees volunteered 
their time to pick up roadside litter in and around our local community; 
 Hayward Tyler Luton provided Christmas hampers to the homeless and continues to 
be active each week supporting our homeless community. Charitable activities such 
as fund raising casino nights and running the marathon, as well as sponsoring the 
Luton food bank means we remain active within our local area. We are proud of 
relationships with partners such as the Chamber of Commerce, the EEF Regional  
Advisory Board, Engineering Development Trust, Luton Borough Council, various 
universities to mention a small number where we support local initiatives such as 
Women in Engineering and Widening Participation schemes; 
 We have a policy of matching employee donations to charities giving our on-going 
support to causes such as: Special Olympics, a local children’s charity, British Heart 
Foundation, The Lullaby Trust, CHUMS Bereavement, Macmillan Cancer Support, 
Alzheimer’s Society, The American Heart Association, The American Cancer Society, 
the Rotary Club and Human Relief Foundation. In addition, amongst other good 
causes, we have sponsored a local little league baseball team;  
 Hayward Tyler Colchester employees continue to mentor the STEM/Nova group in 
the local scout pack, discussing topics in science, technology, engineering and 
maths. This engagement includes welcoming the scouts to visit the facility to see 
engineering in action. Additionally, we are proud to have the first ever Hayward Tyler 
Robotics Lego League take home the grand prize in a local competition. We also 
have given several tours of our facilities and discussed the nature of our work with 
university and high school groups. In addition, we donate to various groups such as 
Technology for Tomorrow, which helps local, underserved communities with 
technology access and training; and 
 The Group continues to maintain strong links with a growing network of local and 
national universities, attending careers fairs, sponsoring project awards and running a 
mentoring scheme with both university students and final year school pupils. 
 
Celebrating Our Success  
On 24 August 2016, Hayward Tyler was delighted to welcome the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge to its Centre of Excellence to formally open the facility and to present Hayward 
Tyler with the most prestigious Queen’s Award for Enterprise: International Trade. It was a 
pleasure to have many of our customers, stakeholders and employees and their families 
witness the Royal visit and see the outcome of all the hard work we have delivered over the 
past few years. It was an honour to showcase our new facility to our strategic partners and 
loyal customers who will benefit from our enhanced capabilities. 
 
In addition, Hayward Tyler’s achievements were recognised by its peers at The Manufacturer 
MX Awards in 2016, with recognition for Dr Ewan Lloyd-Baker, Dave Murray and Michael 
Williams receiving the Top 100 UK role models award. The annual awards, which are 
delivered by The Manufacturer magazine in association with the Institution of Mechanical 
Engineers inspire, recognise and reward the best of UK manufacturing. They are the biggest 
annual celebration in the industry’s calendar, attracting more than 1,000 attendees to a gala 
ceremony and represent the culmination of a rigorous judging programme designed to 
provide valuable business improvement advice and feedback from an expert panel of judges.   Hayward Tyler Group PLC

developing graduates and employees”. Shak Choudhury, June 2017

Corporate Governance 
 
Structure of the report 
This report sets out how HTG is governed and the key 
activities of the Board of Directors in promoting 
effective governance during FY2017. 
 
“In this report I set out the work and operation of the Board of Directors of the 
Company and the governance framework that we use to lead, manage and control the 
Group and report on its performance.” 
 
The Directors recognise the value of the principles of good corporate governance, as 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the QCA Corporate Governance 
Code for Smaller Quoted Companies. We do not comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code but we are committed to applying and maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance so far as is practicable and appropriate for a public 
company quoted on AIM of the size and nature of the Company. We believe that such 
standards are in the best interests of all shareholders and stakeholders as outlined in 
later sections of this report. Set out below is a summary of how, at 31 March 2017, the 
Group was dealing with corporate governance issues. 
 
The Board 
The Board is responsible for delivering corporate governance within the Group. Our objective 
is to create sustained shareholder value. Key to ensuring our success is to provide 
leadership, including our values and standards, and proper management of the Group. This 
approach includes setting our strategic objectives, providing the resources to enable the 
Group to achieve those objectives, managing risk, establishing an effective control framework 
and holding the Executive Directors to account. 
 
The Board’s key responsibilities include inter alia determination of Group strategy, approval of 
reported financial statements and budget, setting risk management strategy, funding and 
M&A activity. 
 
Setting Hayward Tyler’s Priorities for Corporate Governance  
The key achievements of the Board in FY2017 were: 
 We continued to extend our risk management processes with a focus on contract 
risk in relation to suppliers; 
 We maintained our corporate governance in line with, or ahead of, best practice for 
smaller quoted companies;; and 
 We maintained an active investor relations programme. 
The Board’s key priorities for FY2018 are: 
 Appoint an additional Non-Executive Director, which we had planned to do in 
FY2017; 
 Further the implementation of a more formal performance evaluation programme 
for the Directors, the Board and each committee of the Board; and 
 Maintain the investor relations programme.

Directors and Directors’ Independence 
The Board comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, one Non-Executive Director and two 
Executive Directors. The Chairman and Non-Executive Director are not employees of the 
Group. From time to time I meet the Non-Executive Director for one-to-one discussions. 
The names of the Directors are set out in Board of Directors together with their biographical 
details, which identify the diverse skills and experience that the Directors bring to the Board. 
Maurice Critchley, who joined us in early 2014, does not meet the test of independence under 
the UK Corporate Governance Code in view of his shareholding in the Company, however, 
the Board considers that he is independent in character and judgement. In particular, Maurice 
has extensive experience in manufacturing, marketing and sales, and international markets in 
a larger company together with knowledge of the offshore oil and gas market. This experience 
provides him with the objectivity to challenge and inspire the Board. 
 
We have previously indicated our intention to appoint an additional Non-Executive Director at 
the appropriate time to provide greater diversity and independence without overburdening the 
Company with additional overhead. Our intention was to commence the appointment process 
during FY2017. The Board have discussed the possibility of another Non-Executive Director 
joining the during the year but have not formally implemented a selection and appointment 
procedure. This still remains a target for the Board for FY2018, albeit with the announced 
proposed acquisition by Avingtrans plc this will no longer be necessary. 
 
Information and Meetings 
The Board meets regularly to review performance and to determine strategy. Ad hoc 
meetings are arranged where an issue arises that requires attention. In advance of each 
meeting the Board is supplied with an agenda and information on financial, business and 
corporate matters to be considered at the meeting. The financial information includes a report 
against the Group’s budget, which is set at the start of the year, and the forecast for the year, 
which is updated each quarter.

Twelve regular Board meetings were held during the year, all of which were attended by the 
whole Board. A number of additional meetings were held to consider and to approve other 
matters including funding arrangements and the Royal visit in the year by HRH the Duke of 
Cambridge and HRH the Duchess of Cambridge. 
 
From time to time senior management from the operating businesses of the Group attend the 
Board meetings to present matters of strategic importance, their annual budgets and actual 
performance. In addition, the Company’s advisers may attend a meeting to brief the Board on 
a matter of law, market guideline or corporate finance. As and when required appropriate 
training is given to Board members and there are also procedures in place for a Non-
Executive Director to obtain independent legal or other professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. 
 
Conflicts 
A Director has a duty to avoid a situation in which he has or can have a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts or may conflict with the interests of the Company. The Board considers 
each Director’s conflicts of interest and only those Directors that have no interest in the matter 
under consideration take the relevant decision. 
 
Committees 
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee. For further 
details of these committees see the Audit Committee Report and Directors’ Report on 
Remuneration. 
 
At present given the Group’s size, the Board has decided not to delegate responsibility for 
considering the composition and structure of the Board to a separate nominations committee. 
The Board has retained responsibility for developing further the corporate governance policy 
and practices in the Group rather than forming a separate committee for this purpose. 
 
Relations with Shareholders 
The Board remains fully committed to maintaining regular communication with its 
shareholders. Communication is achieved through press releases, interviews, information 
posted on its website www.htg.global and through the Interim and Annual Reports. The Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer hold regular meetings with major shareholders, 
analysts and the financial press, in particular following the announcements of the interim and 
full year results. From time to time the Company hosts an “investor day” at one of its 
operating units for analysts and shareholders to see the business at first hand and to meet 
operational management. The Board receives a briefing from its broker of each major 
shareholder’s view of the Company and the effectiveness of the Executive Directors. The 
major concern raised by shareholders during the period under review related to the slow 
down in orders being placed that could be shipped in the year and the subsequent negative 
impact on trading. 
 
The Board welcomes shareholders to attend its annual general meeting at the Group’s Luton 
facility, which in particular provides an opportunity to communicate with private investors. This 
gives shareholders an opportunity to ask questions and to discuss issues with the Directors 
after the formal proceedings have concluded.  
 
Performance Evaluation 
In the past, performance evaluation of the Directors has been carried out in determining the 
Executive Directors’ bonus entitlement against performance related targets.  
 
Internal Control and Risk Management 
The Board has the responsibility for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of 
internal controls and reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system, however, is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The 
procedures which include inter alia, financial, operational and compliance matters and risk 
management are reviewed on an on-going basis. The Board approves the annual budget and 
performance against budget is monitored and reported to the Board. The Board has  Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017  
   
49 
 
considered the guidance published by the Institute of Chartered Accounts in England & Wales 
concerning the internal control requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and has 
established an on-going process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group. Further details of the management of risk are set out in Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties. 
 
Business Conduct 
The Board is responsible for setting the values and standards in the Group. The Board 
requires that the Directors, senior executives and employees maintain a high ethical standard 
and conduct themselves with the utmost integrity. This approach to business is set out in the 
staff handbooks and employment contracts.  
 
Another aspect of Group’s conduct of business is to ensure that all affected employees 
understand and comply with the UK Bribery Act 2010 (the “Act”). Affected employees receive 
an initial briefing on the Act and an update from time to time. In addition, each affected 
employee is required to certify their compliance on an annual basis.

The Audit Committee responsibilities 
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include: 
 To monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and any formal 
announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance, reviewing significant 
financial reporting judgements contained in them and ensuring that the accounts 
present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s 
position and prospects;  
 To make recommendations to the Board, for it to put to the shareholders for their 
approval in general meeting, relating to the appointment, re-appointment and 
removal of the external auditor and to approve the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditor and to develop and implement policy on the 
engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services; 
 To discuss and agree on the nature and scope of the annual audit and interim 
review with the external auditor;  
 To review and monitor the external auditor’s independence and objectivity together 
with the effectiveness and quality of the audit process, taking into consideration 
relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements;  
 To review arrangements by which employees may, in confidence, raise concerns 
about specified matters that are in the public interest and ensure that 
arrangements are in place for proportionate, independent and immediate 
investigation of such matters; 
 To review the Group’s internal control and risk management systems, which 
includes (1) meeting the external auditor and reviewing the reports from the 
external auditor relating to accounts and internal control systems and (2) reviewing 
the risk register and agreeing on further actions, where relevant, to help mitigate 
risk;  
 To report to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities; and 
 To communicate effectively to shareholders the extent of the Audit Committee’s 
activities. 
 
Composition and Governance 
The Board established an Audit Committee (1) to apply corporate reporting, risk management 
and internal control principles and (2) to maintain an appropriate relationship with the 
Company’s external auditor. The Audit Committee comprises the Non-Executive Director, 
Maurice Critchley, together with the Non-Executive Chairman, John May, who serves as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. Collectively the members of the committee have the 
experience and skills to fulfil the duties of the Audit Committee. In particular, both John May 
and Maurice Critchley satisfy the requirement of recent and relevant financial experience from 
past and current roles. 
   Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017  
   
51 
 
In general, the Chief Financial Officer is invited to join all or part of the Audit Committee 
meetings. The external auditor has direct access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
outside of formal meetings. 
 
The external auditor provides a written report of their findings and recommendations from the 
annual audit. Fees for audit and non-audit work are pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
 
Activities in FY2017 
The Audit Committee met formally two times during the financial year. The purpose of these 
meetings included: 
 To consider the findings from last year’s audit including the adequacy of the internal 
control systems; 
 To consider any significant issues relating to the report and accounts for the year 
ended 31 March 2016, of which there were none;  
 To determine that the report and accounts for that period were fair, balanced and 
understandable; 
 To discuss matters relating to the review of the interim statement for the six months 
ended 30 September 2016 with the external auditor; and 
 To consider the risk register and agree on further actions to mitigate risk.  
 
In addition to the formal meetings of the Audit Committee, the members held a number of 
discussions. These discussions included agreeing on the audit approach for FY2017, the 
scope of the review by the external auditor of the interim results and various matters relating 
to the external auditor, which covered the external auditor’s independence and objectivity, re-
appointment and fees. 
 
External Auditor 
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate relationship is 
maintained between the Company and the external auditor, including the provision of non-
audit services. In late 2011 a separate firm was appointed to provide taxation compliance 
services to the Group. From time to time at the Company’s request, the external auditor 
provided informal advice relating to financial, accounting and capital structuring matters. 
 
Grant Thornton were first appointed as external auditor to the original Group headed by 
Southbank UK PLC in 2006. Following the reverse acquisition in 2010, Grant Thornton were 
also appointed as the external auditor to the Group headed by Hayward Tyler Group PLC. In 
line with its policy to ensure continued independence, Grant Thornton routinely confirms the 
position of all team members as part of each audit process having taken account of 
appropriate ethical guidance. Paul Naylor is our engagement partner and we would like to 
thank Paul and his team for their guidance and support over the last 12 months.  
 
Any decision to open the audit to tender is taken on recommendation of the committee. The 
Audit Committee will recommend to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting that Grant 
Thornton be reappointed as the external auditor for a further year. 
 
Internal Audit 
Given the Group’s size and the nature of its business, the Board does not consider it would 
be appropriate for the Group to have its own internal audit function. The audit of internal 
financial controls forms part of the responsibilities of the Group’s finance function. This work 
includes inter alia quarterly balance sheet reviews, completion of internal control 
questionnaires with business unit management and follow-up of external audit review points. 
 
Risk 
The Group does not have a designated risk committee. The Audit Committee addresses all 
aspects of risk through its review of the risk register, internal control systems and regular 
review of financial information. This approach helps to determine the nature and scope of the 
external audit and review work to be undertaken by Grant Thornton. The Audit Committee 
reviews the risk register with the Executive Directors, which includes a discussion of the risks, 
the actions being taken to mitigate the risk and, where relevant, further proposed actions to 
address the risks.  Hayward Tyler Group PLC

Details of the risk register are discussed in more detail in Principal Risks and Uncertainties. 
 
Activities in FY2018 
Since 31 March 2017 the Audit Committee has determined and agreed (1) the scope of the 
audit for the year ended 31 March 2017 and (2) the fees payable to the external auditor 
therefor. In addition, the Audit Committee has reviewed the outcome of the audit of the Report 
and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2017.

The Remuneration Committee, having due regard to the interests of shareholders, is 
responsible for: 
 Reviewing the performance of the Executive Directors and senior employees; and 
 Setting the scale of their remuneration including performance related bonus and 
long-term incentive plans. 
 
Directors’ Report on Remuneration 
This report describes how the Board has applied the principles of good governance relating to 
a Director’s remuneration. The report is split into three sections: 
 Annual Statement, which sets out the scope and make-up of the Remuneration 
Committee and its activities in the year; 
 Policy Report, which sets out the Group’s policy for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors; and  
 Annual Remuneration Report, which sets out the implementation of the policy in 
FY2017 and the plans for FY2018. 
 
Composition and Governance 
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, John May, together 
with the Non-Executive Director, Maurice Critchley, who serves as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
 
The Remuneration Committee is authorised to seek external advice and to secure the 
attendance of third parties with relevant expertise, if considered necessary, but shall ensure 
that all its activities are cost effective for the Company with the pre-approval of the Board. 
 
Activities in FY2017 
The Remuneration Committee met formally two times during the year to set the scale of the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and to implement the long-term incentive plan 
discussed in last year’s report. In addition, the members of the Remuneration Committee held 
a number of discussions to consider remuneration related matters. 
 
Remuneration Policy Report  
 
Policy Objectives 
The policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors includes three key objectives: 
 To provide remuneration to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and 
senior management of the calibre to run the Company successfully; 
 To ensure that there is a strong link between such remuneration and the Company’s 
strategy; and 
 To align the Executive Directors’ interest with those of shareholders.

Remuneration Components 
The remuneration of the Executive Directors has three components, which are: 
 A base salary including any benefits and pension; 
 An annual performance related bonus (non-pensionable); and 
 A long-term incentive plan (LTIP). 
 
This policy is summarised in the adjacent table.

Notes 
1. None of the Directors participate in the Group’s defined benefit scheme. Pension contributions represent 
payment of part of the director’s base salary to a personal pension arrangement 
2. Employer’s National Insurance Contributions made relating to Directors’ emoluments in the period were 
£57,498 (FY2016: £80,630) 
       
Performance Related Annual Bonus 
The remuneration of the Executive Directors has been structured to incorporate a variable 
element (up to 50% of base salary) linked to the achievement of performance related targets 
approved by the Remuneration Committee each year. These metrics are designed to align 
the Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders.  
 
As previously reported, the Executive Directors decided to waive their right to receive 
bonuses in respect of the performance in FY2016. Accordingly, no bonuses were received by 
the Executive Directors in FY2017. 
 
In relation to the performance in FY2017, the metrics used were chosen to be aligned to the 
Group’s objectives of growth, increased profitability and enhanced financial strength (see 
KPIs) and, for the Chief Financial Officer, risk management. In the case of the Chief Financial 
Officer, these metrics were achieved in part, however, the Chief Financial Officer has decided 
to waive his right to receive a bonus in respect of FY2017.  
 
Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The Hayward Tyler Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) is the Group’s primary long-term 
incentive arrangement and it was established in June 2015. Prior to that no share options 
existed. The LTIP has been established to incentivise the Executive Directors and certain 
senior managers (the "Executives") to deliver long-term value creation for shareholders. To 
date two awards have been issued under the scheme; TSR LTIP and PBL LTIP. These 
awards share the same characteristics other than their performance conditions. 
 
Under TSR LTIP the Company has awarded the Executives either nominal options or 
restricted shares for which the participant pays only the nominal value of the shares. 
The nominal options vest three years from the date of grant, subject to continued service and 
the achievement of a performance target. The restricted shares are subject to clawback under 
the same performance conditions. The grants can be made for up to a maximum of the share 
equivalent of 200% of an Executive's annual salary each year. An award under TSR LTIP will 
vest only if the total shareholder return ("TSR") achieved by the Company over the three year 
vesting period is greater or equal to the TSR of the median company in a defined comparator 
group of companies over that period. The percentage of the award that vests operates on a 
sliding scale with 0% below the median, 20% at the median and 100% in the upper quartile.   Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017  
   
56 
 
Options which have vested may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. An initial 
grant was made to the Executive Directors on 23 June 2015 that represented 100% of their 
salary as at the mid-closing price of the Company on 22 June 2015 (85 pence) representing 
294,118 shares in the case of Ewan Lloyd-Baker and 215,153 shares in respect of Nick 
Flanagan. In addition, aggregate awards of 211,764 shares were made to three senior 
managers in the Group. 
 
Under PBL LTIP the Company has awarded the Executives either nominal options or 
restricted shares for which the participant pays only the nominal value of the shares. 
The nominal options will vest 18 months from the date of grant, subject to continued service 
and the achievement of certain performance conditions attached to the successful 
development and growth of the Peter Brotherhood business. The restricted shares are subject 
to clawback under the same performance conditions. A grant was made to the Executive 
Directors on 19 November 2015 that represented 250,000 shares in the case of Ewan Lloyd-
Baker and 110,000 shares in respect of Nick Flanagan. In addition, aggregate awards of 
140,000 shares were made to three senior managers in the Group. 
 
In the year under review the performance conditions attached to the PBL LTIP were not met. 
Accordingly, the nominal options and restricted shares that had been awarded to the 
Executives lapsed and in the case of the restricted shares it is intended that they will be 
clawed back by the Company and cancelled.  
 
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) 
The Hayward Tyler Company Share Option Plan (“CSOP”) is the Group’s share option 
scheme for employees and it was established in June 2015. The CSOP has been established 
to incentivise the Executive Directors and certain senior managers (the "Executives") to 
deliver long-term value creation for shareholders. It aligns the interests of the Executives with 
those of shareholders and encourages share ownership. To date one award has been made 
under the scheme. 
 
Under the CSOP the Company has awarded the Executives nominal options for which the 
participant pays an exercise price for the shares. These options vest three years from the 
date of grant and are subject to continued service. There is no performance target and the 
exercise price is 79.5 pence per share. 
 
Details of share-based employee remuneration are given in note 8 to the financial statements.

achieving various financial targets and, in the case of the Chief Financial Officer, certain risk 
management criteria.

 The Group’s budget for the coming year and its projections through to 2020; 
 The likelihood that the proposed acquisition of the Company by Avingtrans plc (the 
“Avingtrans Transaction”) will complete;  
 The Group’s long-term financing arrangements as part of an enlarged group 
following the Avingtrans Transaction; and 
 In the unlikely event that the Avingtrans Transaction does not complete, the 
alternative funding solutions available to the Group and the Company,  
the Directors confirm that they have determined that the working capital available to the 
Group will be sufficient for the foreseeable future and at least the next 12 months. 
Accordingly, the Company continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report including the strategic report, 
the report on governance and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.  
   
Isle of Man company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared Group 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
as adopted by the European Union. Under Isle of Man company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:  
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;  
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  
 state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and 
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the Group and the Company will continue in business. 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Director’s Report on 
Remuneration comply with the Companies Acts 1931 to 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.  
  
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Hayward Tyler 
Group website (www.htg.global).  
 
Legislation in the Isle of Man governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
 
In so far as the Directors are aware:  
 there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware; and  
 the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of 
that information.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of 
Hayward Tyler Group PLC  
 
We have audited the financial statements of Hayward Tyler Group PLC for the year ended 31 
March 2017 which comprise the Group and Company Statements of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Group and Company Cash 
Flow Statements and the related notes to the financial statements. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (as adopted by the European Union).  
  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance (Section 
80C(2) of the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that 
we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.  
  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor   
As explained more fully in Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities as set out on the previous 
page, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements which give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
  
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Report and Accounts 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our 
report.  
 
Opinion on financial statements   
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and  
Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended in 
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (as adopted by the 
European Union).

2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
 
2.1  Going concern   
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The 
Directors have taken note of the guidance issued by The Financial Reporting Council on Going 
Concern Assessments in determining that this is the appropriate basis of preparation of the 
financial statements and have considered a number of factors. 
 
After making due enquiry, and having considered: 
 The Group’s budget for the coming year and its projections through to 2020; 
 The likelihood that the proposed acquisition of the Company by Avingtrans plc (the 
“Avingtrans Transaction”) will complete;  
 The Group’s long-term financing arrangements as part of an enlarged group following 
the Avingtrans Transaction; and 
 In the unlikely event that the Avingtrans Transaction does not complete, the alternative 
funding solutions available to the Group and the Company,  
the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Further detail can be found in the significant management judgments in section 4. Accordingly, 
the Company continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
 
2.2  Basis of preparation  
The company and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and the requirements of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1931-
2006. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis for the 
purposes of inclusion in this document with the exception of some financial instruments which 
are carried at fair value (see note 31) and freehold properties which are held at revalued 
amounts (see note 19). The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied 
to all the periods presented.  In accordance with the exemption provided by the Isle of Man 
Companies Act 2006 no separate Income Statement or Statement of Comprehensive Income 
is presented for the Company.  
 
2.3 Basis of consolidation  
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all of its subsidiaries as 
of 31 March 2017. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement, and has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the subsidiary in accordance with IFRS10 – Consolidated Financial Statements. 
All transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, 
including unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies. Where 
unrealised losses on intra-group asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the underlying 
asset is also tested for impairment from a group perspective.  Amounts reported in the financial 
statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
accounting policies adopted by the Group. Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of 
subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from the effective date of 
acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal as applicable. 
 
2.4 Business combinations  
For business combinations occurring since 1 January 2010, the requirements of IFRS 3R have 
been applied. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is 
calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred 
and the equity interests issued by the Group, which includes the fair value of any asset or 
liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed 
as incurred. 
 
    
 
 
Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017

The Group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business 
combination regardless of whether they have been previously recognised in the acquiree's 
financial statements prior to the acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are 
measured at their acquisition-date fair values. 
 
Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as 
the excess of the sum of (a) fair value of consideration transferred, (b) the recognised amount 
of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and (c) acquisition-date fair value of any existing 
equity interest in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets. If 
the fair values of identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated above, the excess amount 
(i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) is recognised in profit or loss immediately. 
 
2.5 Trading and non-trading 
The consolidated income statement reports the results for the year under the headings Trading 
and Non-trading. Trading represents the underlying performance of Hayward Tyler and Peter 
Brotherhood together with head office costs. Non-trading represents non-recurring items. There 
was non-trading other income in the year of £0.5 million which relates to a compensation claim 
relating to damage to equipment in the Centre of Excellence. There were also non-trading 
operating charges in the year of £0.2 million. These charges relate to cost of the acquisition of 
the Peter Brotherhood business and amortisation of the Peter Brotherhood order book. Non-
trading tax charges of £0.4 million relate to a reduction in the deferred tax asset of £0.3 million 
following the change in the enacted UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 17% plus a tax charge 
on non-trading other income and operating charges of £0.1 million. 
 
2.6 Segmental reporting 
In identifying its operating segments, management follows the Group's service lines, which 
represent the main products and services provided by the Group. The activities undertaken by 
the original equipment manufacturing segment (“OE”) includes the design and manufacture of 
motors, pumps and steam generators. The aftermarket segment (“AM”) provides a 
comprehensive range of aftermarket services and spares supporting the Group’s own product 
range as well as those of other original equipment manufacturers. Each of these operating 
segments is managed separately as they require different resources and have a different 
customer base, including sales and marketing approach. All inter-segment transfers are carried 
out at arm's length prices. 
 
The measurement policies the Group uses for segment reporting under IFRS 8 are the same 
as those used in its financial statements, except that: 
 Centre of Excellence expenses net of grant income 
 expenses relating to share-based payments; and 
 unallocated central costs   
are not included in arriving at the operating profit of the operating segments. In addition, 
corporate assets which are not directly attributable to the business activities of any operating 
segment are not allocated to a segment. There have been no changes from prior periods in the 
measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss. 
 
2.7  Foreign currency translation 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is the 
Company’s functional currency. 
 
(a) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured 
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
(the "functional currency"). In the Group’s financial statements, all assets, liabilities and 
transactions of the Group entities, with a functional currency other than the Pound 
Sterling (the Group’s presentation currency) are translated into Pounds Sterling upon 
consolidation. The functional currencies of the entities in the Group have remained 
unchanged during the reporting period. 
   
 
 
Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 
   
 
73 
 
(b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the 
respective Group entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation of year-end exchange rates of monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss. 
 
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date of the transaction (not re-translated). Non-monetary items measured 
at fair value are translated using the exchange rates at the date when fair value was 
determined. 
 
(c) Foreign subsidiaries 
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and related 
goodwill are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date.  Income and 
expenses are translated at the average rate. The exchange differences arising from 
the re-translation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the "Foreign Currency Translation 
Reserve" in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation 
differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss when the gain or loss on 
disposal is recognised. 
 
2.8 Property, plant and equipment 
Land held for use in production or administration is stated at historical cost. As land is 
considered to have an unlimited useful life, related carrying amounts are not depreciated.  
Buildings for use in production or administration are initially recognised at acquisition cost and 
subsequently measured using the cost model, cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.  
 
Property and equipment held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, 
plant and equipment. Such assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over their expected 
useful lives (determined by reference to comparable owned assets) or over the term of the 
lease, if shorter. Buildings are stated at cost or revaluation less depreciation and impairment 
losses. Equipment, furniture and fittings are stated at cost less depreciation and impairment 
losses. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or revaluation of fixed 
assets, less their estimated residual value, over their expected useful lives. The following useful 
lives are applied: 
 
Buildings   - 25 years 
Plant and machinery  - 5-10 years 
Fixtures and fittings  - 3-5 years  
Short leasehold improvements - over period of lease 
 
Material residual value estimates and estimates of the useful life are updated as required, but 
at least annually, whether or not the asset is revalued. 
 
Gains or losses arising on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined as the 
difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets and are 
recognised in profit or loss within ”other income” or ”other expenses”. 
 
2.9 Leased assets 
The economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee if the lessee bears 
substantially all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the leased asset. The related 
asset is then recognised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if 
lower, the present value of the lease payments plus incidental payments, if any. A 
corresponding amount is recognised as a finance leasing liability. Leases of land and buildings 
are classified separately and are split into a land and a building element, in accordance with 
the relative fair values of the leasehold interests at the date the asset is recognised initially.   
 
 
Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 
   
 
74 
 
 
Depreciation methods and useful lives for assets held under finance lease agreements 
correspond to those applied to comparable assets which are legally owned by the Group. The 
corresponding finance leasing liability is reduced by lease payments, less finance charges, 
which are expensed as part of finance costs. 
 
The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital 
balance outstanding and is charged to profit or loss over the period of the lease. 
 
All other leases are treated as operating leases. Payments on operating lease agreements are 
recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Associated costs, such 
as maintenance and insurance, are expensed as incurred. 
 
2.10 Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination that are 
not individually identified and separately recognised. Goodwill is carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life. Refer 
to Note 2.12 for a description of impairment testing procedures. 
 
2.11  Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets include capitalised development costs of the Hayward Tyler businesses 
incurred in the development of new pump and motor technology and product and process 
development. They are accounted for using the cost model whereby capitalised costs are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Management assess the 
useful life of group intangible assets to be in the range of five to ten years.  
 
Costs that are directly attributable to the development phase of technology are recognised as 
an intangible asset, provided they meet the following recognition requirements: 
 completion of the intangible asset to the end of the development phase is technically 
feasible, so that it will be available for use or sale; 
 the Group intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; 
 the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset; 
 the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other 
things, this requires that there be a market for the output from the intangible asset or 
for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally, the asset will be used in 
generating such benefits; 
 there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the 
development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and 
 the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be 
measured reliably. 
Development costs not meeting these criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. 
 
Directly attributable costs include employee costs incurred on the development along with an 
appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Development costs recognised as an intangible 
asset are subject to the same subsequent measurement method. However, until completion of 
the development project, the assets are subject to impairment testing only as described below 
in the note on impairments.  
 
In addition, other intangible assets include the fair value of intangible assets acquired in a 
business combination at their acquisition date less any amortisation of such assets. In the case 
of Peter Brotherhood, these assets include the value of the order book at the acquisition date 
less the value of the orders that had traded during the period from the acquisition date to 31 
March 2017.

2.12 Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment 
For impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are 
tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill 
is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of a 
related business combination and represent the lowest level within the Group at which 
management monitors goodwill. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated 
(determined by the Group’s management as equivalent to its operating segments) are tested 
for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested 
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. 
 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s (or cash-generating 
unit’s) carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less 
costs of disposal and value-in-use. To determine the value-in-use, management estimates 
expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and determines a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The data used for impairment 
testing procedures are directly linked to the Group’s latest approved budget, adjusted as 
necessary to exclude the effects of future reorganisations and asset enhancements. Discount 
factors are determined individually for each cash-generating unit and reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and asset-specific risk factors. 
 
Impairment losses for cash-generating units reduce first the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to that cash-generating unit. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the 
other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are 
subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no 
longer exist. An impairment loss is reversed if the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable 
amount exceeds its carrying amount. 
 
2.13 Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at fair value of consideration paid less impairment. 
 
2.14 Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises the direct 
purchase price, including all expenses directly attributable to the manufacturing process as well 
as suitable portions of related production overheads, based on normal operating capacity. 
Costs are assigned using the first in, first out cost formula. Net realisable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable variable selling expenses. 
 
2.15 Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other 
short-term, highly liquid investments maturing within 90 days from the date of acquisition that 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value. 
 
2.16 Equity, reserves and dividend payments 
Share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued. 
 
Share premium includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transaction 
costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium, net of any related 
income tax benefits. 
 
The foreign currency translation reserve represents differences arising on the re-translation of 
net investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings, based on the rate of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date.

The merger reserve of £14.5 million includes £9.9 million arising as a result of the acquisition 
of Southbank in January 2010. The merger reserve represents the difference between the 
nominal value of the share capital issued by Hayward Tyler Group PLC and its fair value at 20 
January 2010, the date of the acquisition. 
 
Treasury stock reserve represents the cost of stock issued and subsequently reacquired. 
 
The reverse acquisition reserve arises as a result of the method of accounting for the acquisition 
of Southbank by Hayward Tyler Group PLC. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
(Revised 2008) the acquisition has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition. 
 
Share based payment reserve comprises the fair value of options and restricted shares 
recognised as an expense less the nominal value of restricted shares which is presented in 
share capital. Upon exercise of options or performance share rights, any proceeds received are 
credited to share capital. 
 
Retained earnings include all current and prior period retained profits. 
 
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in “other liabilities” when the 
dividends have been approved in a general meeting prior to the reporting date. 
 
2.17 Taxation 
Tax expense recognised in profit or loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Calculation of current tax is 
based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of 
the reporting period. Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the underlying tax loss 
or deductible temporary difference will be utilised against future taxable income. This is 
assessed based on the Group’s forecast of future operating results, adjusted for significant non-
taxable income and expenses and specific limits on the use of any unused tax loss or credit.  
 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised in full, although IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ specifies 
limited exemptions. As a result of these exemptions the Group does not recognise deferred tax 
on temporary differences relating to goodwill, or to its investments in subsidiaries. 
 
2.18 Post-employment benefits, short-term employee benefits and share-based 
employee remuneration 
Post employee benefits 
The Group provides post-employment benefits through defined benefit plans as well as various 
defined contribution plans. 
 
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions 
into an independent entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further 
contributions after its payment of the fixed contribution. The contributions are recognised as an 
employee benefit expense when they are due. 
 
Plans that do not meet the definition of a defined contribution plan are defined benefit plans. 
Under the Group’s defined benefit plans, the amount of pension benefit that an employee will 
receive on retirement is defined by reference to the employee’s length of service and final 
salary. The legal obligation for any benefits remains with the Group, even if plan assets for 
funding the defined benefit plan have been set aside. Plan assets may include assets 
specifically designated to a long-term benefit fund as well as qualifying insurance policies.  
 
The asset recognised in the statement of financial position for defined benefit plans is the 
present value of the fair value of plan assets less the defined benefit obligation (DBO) at the 
reporting date. The net surplus at the end of the year is £1.0 million (FY2016: £0.2 million). 
   
 
 
Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 
   
 
77 
 
Management estimates the DBO annually with the assistance of independent actuaries. This 
is based on standard rates of inflation, salary growth rate and mortality. Discount factors are 
determined close to each year-end by reference to high quality corporate bonds that are 
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity 
approximating the terms of the related pension liability.  
 
Service cost on the Group’s defined benefit plan is included in employee benefits expense. 
Employee contributions, all of which are independent of the number of years of service, are 
treated as a reduction of service cost. Net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability 
is included in finance costs. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurements of the net defined 
benefit liability are included in other comprehensive income. 
 
Short-term benefits 
Short-term employee benefits, including holiday entitlement, are current liabilities included in 
pension and other employee obligations, measured at the undiscounted amount that the Group 
expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement. 
 
Share-based employee remuneration 
The Group operates equity-settled share-based remuneration plans for its key management 
personnel. None of the Group’s plans are cash-settled. 
 
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are 
measured at their fair values. 
 
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair value of employees’ 
services is determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. 
This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions. 
 
All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in the income statement 
with a corresponding credit to share-based payment reserve. If vesting periods or other vesting 
conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available 
estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. 
 
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that 
are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any 
indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. 
Any adjustment to cumulative share-based compensation resulting from a revision is 
recognised in the current period.        
  
The number of vested options ultimately exercised by holders does not impact the expense 
recorded in any period.          
          
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs, are allocated to share capital up to the nominal (or par) value of the shares 
issued with any excess being recorded as share premium. 
      
2.19 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets 
Provisions are recognised when present obligations as a result of a past event will probably 
lead to an outflow of economic resources from the Group and amounts can be estimated 
reliably. Timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. A present obligation arises from 
the presence of a legal or constructive commitment that has resulted from past events, for 
example, product warranties granted to a customer, legal disputes or onerous contracts. 
Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, 
based on the most reliable evidence available at the reporting date, including the risks and 
uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Where there are a number of similar 
obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by   
 
 
Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 
   
 
78 
 
considering the class of obligations as a whole. Provisions are discounted to their present 
values, where the time value of money is material. 
 
Any reimbursement that the Group can be virtually certain to collect from a third party with 
respect to the obligation is recognised as a separate asset. However, this asset may not exceed 
the amount of the related provision.  
 
No liability is recognised if an outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations 
is not probable. Such situations are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the outflow of 
resources is remote. 
 
2.20 Revenue recognition 
Revenue comprises revenue from the sale of goods and the rendering of services. 
 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents 
amounts obtained through trading activities, net of value added tax and trade discounts. The 
Group applies the revenue recognition criteria set out below to each separately identifiable 
component of the sales or service transaction in order to reflect the substance of the 
transaction. The consideration received from these transactions is allocated to the separately 
identifiable component by taking into account the relative fair value of each component. 
 
Revenue is recognised when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable 
that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity, the costs 
incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably, and when the criteria for each of the 
Group’s different activities has been met. These activity-specific recognition criteria are based 
on the goods or solutions provided to the customer and the contract conditions in each case, 
and are described below. 
 
(a) Original equipment manufacture 
The Group provides pumps, motors, turbo gen-sets, compressors and steam turbines 
specifically customised to each customer. The contracts for the sale of these goods 
specify a fixed price for their development and installation.  
 
When the outcome can be assessed reliably, contract revenue and associated costs are 
recognised as revenue and expenses respectively by reference to the stage of 
completion of the contract activity at the reporting date. Revenue is measured at the fair 
value of consideration received or receivable in relation to that activity.  
 
When the Group cannot measure the outcome of a contract reliably, revenue is 
recognised only to the extent of the contract costs incurred and to the extent that such 
costs are recoverable. Contract costs are recognised in the period in which they are 
incurred. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, 
the total expected loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
The stage of completion of any contract is assessed by management by taking into 
consideration all information available at the reporting date. The percentage of 
completion is calculated by comparing costs incurred to date with the total estimated 
costs of the contract. The gross amount due from customers for contract work is 
presented as an asset within ”trade and other receivables” for all contracts in progress 
for which costs incurred plus recognised profits (less recognised losses) exceeds 
progress billings. The gross amount due to customers for contract work is presented as 
a liability within ”trade and other payables” for all contracts in progress for which progress 
billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits (less losses).

(b) Aftermarket 
Revenue comprises the sale of spare parts and other aftermarket services, which is 
recognised when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership of the goods and services supplied. Significant risks and rewards are 
generally considered to be transferred to the buyer when the customer has taken 
undisputed delivery of the goods and services. 
 
(c) Interest income 
Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.  
 
2.21 Operating expenses 
Operating expenses are recognised in profit or loss upon utilisation of the service or at the date 
of their origin. Expenditure for warranties is recognised and charged against the associated 
provision when the related revenue is recognised. 
 
2.22 Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs primarily comprise interest on the Group’s borrowings. Borrowing costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, are 
capitalised as part of the cost of that asset when it is probable that they will result in future 
economic benefits and the costs can be measured reliably. All other borrowing costs are 
expensed in the period in which they are incurred and reported within “finance costs”. 
 
2.23 Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
 
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial asset expire or when the financial asset and all substantial risks and rewards are 
transferred. 
 
A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value plus transactions 
costs, except for financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or 
loss, which are measured initially at fair value. 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured subsequently as described below. 
 
Financial assets 
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into the following 
categories upon initial recognition - loans and receivables. 
 
The category determines subsequent measurement and whether any resulting income and 
expense is recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income. 
All financial assets except for those at fair value through profit or loss are subject to review for 
impairment at least at each reporting date. Financial assets are impaired when there is any 
objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Different 
criteria to determine impairment are applied for each category of financial assets, which are 
described below. 
 
All income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognised in profit or loss are 
presented within ”finance costs” or ”finance income”, except for impairment of trade receivables, 
which is presented within ”other expenses”.

Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
that are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition these are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Discounting is omitted 
where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group's cash and cash equivalents and trade 
and most other receivables fall into this category of financial instruments. 
 
Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or 
when other objective evidence is received that a specific counterparty will default. Receivables 
that are not considered to be individually impaired are reviewed for impairment in groups, which 
are determined by reference to the industry and region of a counterparty and other available 
features of shared credit risk characteristics. The impairment loss is then based on recent 
historical counterparty default rates for each identified group. 
 
Financial liabilities 
The Group's financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables and derivative 
financial instruments. 
 
Financial liabilities other than derivatives are measured subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, except for financial liabilities held for trading or designated at fair 
value through profit or loss, that are carried subsequently at fair value with gains or losses 
recognised in profit or loss. 
 
All interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument's fair value that are 
reported in profit or loss are included within “finance costs” or “finance income”. 
 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives are financial assets or financial liabilities classified as held for trading and recorded 
at fair value through profit and loss. 
 
Due to certain customer contracts being settled in foreign currencies, the Group enters into 
forward exchange contracts and swaps in order to reduce the exposure to foreign currency risk. 
 
2.24 Government Grants  
A government grant is recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that (a) the Group 
will comply with any conditions attached to the grant and (b) the grant will be received.  
 
A grant is recognised as income in the income statement over the period necessary to match it 
with the expense, to which it relates, on a systematic basis. For reporting purposes the grant 
income is deducted from the related expense. A grant relating to assets is presented as 
deferred income in the consolidated statement of financial position, and released over the life 
of the asset in line with depreciation. 
 
In the year ended 31 March 2015, Hayward Tyler Limited (“HTL”), based in Luton, UK, was 
awarded a £3.5 million grant from the Regional Growth Fund (“RGF”). In the year ended 31 
March 2017 the Group has concluded that there is reasonable assurance that it will be able to 
comply with the RGF grant conditions. The grant is conditional upon HTL achieving a job target 
of 231 full time jobs at the Luton business by 2024 and defraying £21.6 million on eligible 
spending by 2020. This eligible spending relates to the extension to the existing factory, plant 
and machinery, training, and research and development. Failure to hit either target could result 
in the repayment of part of the grant. Accordingly, at inception of the grant the Group recognised 
a receivable for the full grant amount of £3.5 million, presented as an other debtor, and a 
deferred income liability of £3.5 million, presented as an other creditor. In the year ended 31 
March 2017 the group received the remaining debtor of £0.2 million (2016: £1.9 million). Also 
in the year ended 31 March 2017, the deferred income liability was reduced to £2.6 million by 
£0.3 million of grant income (2016: £0.3 million) that is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement. This grant income is included in operating charges as a deduction from related 
research, development and training expenses.

3  Changes in accounting policies 
 
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet 
effective and have not been adopted early by the Group 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, and 
amendments to existing standards have been published by the IASB that are not yet effective, 
and have not been adopted early by the Group. Information on those expected to be relevant 
to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. 
 
Management anticipates that all relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s 
accounting policies for the first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. 
New standards, interpretations and amendments not either adopted or listed below are not 
expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
The new standard for financial instruments (IFRS 9) introduces extensive changes to IAS 39’s 
guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets and introduces a new 
‘expected credit loss’ model for the impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also provides new 
guidance on the application of hedge accounting. 
 
Management has started to assess the impact of IFRS 9 but is not yet in a position to provide 
quantified information. At this stage the main areas of expected impact are as follows: 
 
 the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets will need to be 
reviewed based on the new criteria that considers the assets’ contractual cash flows 
and the business model in which they are managed;  
 an expected credit loss-based impairment will need to be recognised on the Group’s 
trade receivables; 
 it will no longer be possible to measure equity investments at cost less impairment and 
all such investments will instead be measured at fair value. Changes in fair value will 
be presented in profit or loss unless the Group makes an irrevocable designation to 
present them in other comprehensive income; and 
 if the Group continues to elect the fair value option for certain financial liabilities, fair 
value movements will be presented in other comprehensive income to the extent those 
changes relate to the Group’s own credit risk. 
 
The Group has no financial liabilities classified as ‘Available for Sale or Held to Maturity’ 
 
IFRS 9 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
IFRS 15 presents new requirements for the recognition of revenue, replacing IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, 
IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and several revenue-related Interpretations. The new standard 
establishes a control-based revenue recognition model and provides additional guidance in 
many areas not covered in detail under existing IFRSs, including how to account for 
arrangements with multiple performance obligations, variable pricing, customer refund rights, 
supplier repurchase options and other common complexities. 
 
During the year, the Group performed a preliminary assessment of IFRS 15, which is subject 
to changes arising from more detailed ongoing analysis. Furthermore, the Group is considering 
the clarifications issued by the IASB in April 2016 and will monitor any further developments. 
Presently contract revenues and expenses are recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of contract activity where the outcome can be estimated reliably, otherwise revenue 
is recognised only to the extent of recoverable contract costs incurred. Current guidance 
indicates the Group is only able to recognise revenue over time where an entity’s performance 
does not create an asset with an alternative use and the entity has an enforceable right to 
payment for performance. Due to the bespoke nature of contracts the Group will continue

82 
 
recognising contract revenue and expenses over time, however, IFRS 15 criteria will be taken 
into consideration when identifying the correct treatment for each new contract. 
 
The Group, from the preliminary assessment undertaken, considers that the impact of IFRS 15 
will not result in a significant change in the revenue and margin recognised for each accounting 
period when compared with the current application of IAS 18 and IAS 11. 
 
IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 and three related Interpretations. It completes the IASB’s long-
running project to overhaul lease accounting. Leases will be recorded on the statement of 
financial position in the form of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. 
 
IFRS 16 is effective from periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Management is yet to 
fully assess the impact of the Standard and therefore is unable to provide quantified information. 
However, in order to determine the impact the Group is in the process of: 
 performing a full review of all agreements to assess whether any additional contracts 
will now become a lease under IFRS 16’s new definition; 
 deciding which transitional provision to adopt; either full retrospective application or 
partial retrospective application (which means comparatives do not need to be 
restated). The partial application method also provides optional relief from reassessing 
whether contracts in place are, or contain, a lease, as well as other reliefs. Deciding 
which of these practical expedients to adopt is important as they are one-off choices; 
 assessing its current disclosures for finance leases (Note 27) and operating leases 
(Note 27) as these are likely to form the basis of the amounts to be capitalised and 
become right-of-use assets; 
 determining which optional accounting simplifications apply to its lease portfolio and if 
it is going to use these exemptions; 
 considering the IT system requirements and whether a new leasing system is needed. 
This is being considered in line with implementing IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 so the Group 
only has to undergo one set of system changes; and 
 assessing the additional disclosures that will be required. 
 
 
4 Significant management judgements in applying accounting policies 
The following are significant management judgements in applying accounting policies of the 
Group that have the most effect on the financial statements.   
 
Going concern 
The Group’s principal bank borrowing facilities and loan notes contain change of control clauses 
that are activated by an acquisition of the Company, which provide the lender with the 
opportunity to be prepaid or continue to lend to the Company. The proposed acquisition of the 
Company by Avingtrans plc (“Avingtrans Transaction”) is expected to activate these clauses.  
 
Management has considered, together with its advisers, the likelihood that the Avingtrans 
Transaction will take place, and has determined that they have a reasonable expectation that 
it will complete. Such considerations include the level of support for the Avingtrans Transaction 
received from the shareholders of the Company and the shareholders of Avingtrans plc: 
 In the case of the Company, more than 50% in number of the shareholders attending 
a meeting to approve the Avingtrans Transaction representing 75% or more in nominal 
value of the shares held by those shareholders need to approve it. Irrevocable 
undertakings and letters of intent to vote in favour of the Avingtrans Transaction have 
been received from shareholders representing 42% of the Company’s share capital 
and, in addition, shareholders representing a further 9.2% have indicated an intention 
to vote in favour of the Avingtrans Transaction; and

83 
 
 In the case of Avingtrans plc, shareholders representing more than 50% in nominal 
value of the shares held by those shareholders attending the meeting to approve the 
Avingtrans Transaction need to approve it. Irrevocable undertakings to vote in favour 
of the Avingtrans Transaction have been received from shareholders representing 
31.7% of Avingtrans plc’s share capital and, in addition, shareholders representing a 
further 13.4% have indicated an intention to vote in favour of the Avingtrans 
Transaction. 
 
In addition, Management has considered, together with the executive directors of Avingtrans 
plc, the funding arrangements of the enlarged group created by the Avingtrans Transaction and 
the working capital report prepared by independent reporting accountants, and has determined 
that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Such considerations 
include the strength of Avingtrans plc’s balance sheet, which included £26.2 million net cash at 
31 May 2017, and the advanced state of negotiations with lenders to provide facilities to the 
enlarged group. 
 
Internally generated development costs 
Management monitors progress of internal research and development projects by using a 
project management system. Significant judgement is required in distinguishing research from 
the development phase. Development costs are recognised as an asset when all the criteria 
are met, whereas research costs are expensed as incurred.  
 
To distinguish any research-type project phase from the development phase, it is the Group's 
accounting policy to require a detailed forecast of sales or cost savings expected to be 
generated by the intangible asset. The forecast is incorporated into the Group's overall budget 
forecast as the capitalisation of development costs commences. This ensures that managerial 
accounting, impairment testing procedures and accounting for internally-generated intangible 
assets is based on the same data. 
 
The Group's management also monitors whether the recognition requirements for development 
costs continue to be met and an assessment made of its recoverability. This is necessary as 
the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future 
technical problems after the time of recognition. Further information on intangible assets is 
contained in note 17. 
 
Revenue recognition – original equipment manufacture 
The stage of completion of a contract is assessed by management taking into consideration all 
information available at the reporting date. In this process management carries out significant 
judgements about milestones, actual work performed and the estimated costs to complete the 
work. Further information on the Group's accounting policy for contracts is contained in note 
2.20. 
  
Deferred tax assets 
The assessment of the probability of future taxable income in which deferred tax assets can be 
utilised is based on the Group's latest approved budget forecast, which is adjusted for 
significant non-taxable income and expenses and specific limits to the use of any unused tax 
loss or credit. The tax rules in the numerous jurisdictions in which the Group operates are also 
carefully taken into consideration. If a positive forecast of taxable income indicates the probable 
use of a deferred tax asset, especially when it can be utilised without a time limit, that deferred 
tax asset is usually recognised in full. The recognition of deferred tax assets that are subject to 
certain legal or economic limits or uncertainties is assessed individually by management based 
on the specific facts and circumstances. All unused tax losses and credits have been 
recognised in the year as management believes that use of the deferred tax asset created is 
probable.

Leases 
In applying the classification of leases in IAS 17, management considers its leases of 
equipment as finance lease arrangements. In some cases, the lease transaction is not always 
conclusive and management uses judgement in determining whether the lease is a finance 
lease arrangement that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. 
Further information on the Group’s leases are contained in note 27. 
 
Property leases are spilt between land and the building to assess whether they are operating 
or finance leases. Land is almost always an operating lease due to its long life but judgment is 
required to assess the classification between operating and finance lease for buildings which 
are assessed individually against the criteria in IAS 17.10.  
 
 
5 Estimation uncertainty 
When preparing financial statements management undertakes a number of judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses. 
 
The actual results may differ from the judgements, estimates and assumptions made by 
management, and will seldom equal the estimated results. 
 
Information about estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on 
recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses is provided below. 
Actual results may be substantially different. 
 
Original equipment revenue 
The stage of completion of any contract is assessed by management by taking into 
consideration all information available at the reporting date. In this process management 
formulates estimates regarding actual work performed and the estimated costs to complete the 
work.  
 
Deferred tax asset – refer to note 22 
The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the 
probability that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and tax loss carry-forwards can be utilised. In addition, significant judgement is 
required in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties in various tax 
jurisdictions. 
 
Defined benefit pension liability – refer to note 28 
Management estimates the defined benefit pension liability annually with the assistance of 
independent actuaries; however, the actual outcome may vary due to estimation uncertainties. 
The estimate of its defined benefit pension gross liability of £13.8 million (FY2016: £13.2 million) 
is based on standard rates of inflation and mortality. The estimate does not include anticipation 
of future salary increases as there are no members with benefits related to future salary 
progression. Discount factors are determined close to each period end by reference to high 
quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid 
and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
Estimation uncertainties exist particularly with regard to medical cost trends, which may vary 
significantly in future appraisals of the Group's defined benefit pension obligations. The value 
of the defined benefit pension asset at 31 March 2017 was £1.0 million (FY2016: £0.2 million). 
 
Provisions – refer to note 26 
The amount recognised for warranties for which customers are covered for the cost of repairs 
is estimated based on management's past experience, current knowledge and future 
expectation that defects may arise. The value of warranty provisions at 31 March 2017 was 
£0.9 million (FY2016: £0.8 million).

The amount recognised for restoration is a management estimate in relation to the estimated 
cost to restore the property to the agreed condition set out in the lease rental agreement for 
Peter Brotherhood’s Peterborough property. 
 
Goodwill – refer to note 16 
Management carry out impairment tests at each reporting date and indicate present values of 
future cash flows in respect of both the OE and AM divisions are far in excess of the carrying 
values of the associated assets including goodwill such that management considers the 
likelihood of any impairment arising to be remote.

None of the Directors participate in the Group’s defined benefit plan. Details of related party

Share-based employee remuneration 
As at 31 March 2017, the Group maintained three share-based payment schemes as long-term 
incentive plans that align management’s interest with those of shareholders. The plans are the 
Total Shareholder Return Long-Term Incentive Plan (“TSR LTIP”), the Peter Brotherhood 
Limited Long-Term Incentive Plan (“PBL LTIP”), and the Company Share Option Plan (CSOP). 
All the schemes will be settled in equity.  
 
In both LTIP schemes there are options and restricted shares. Participants awarded restricted 
shares pay only the nominal value of the shares and the shares are subject to claw back if 
performance conditions are not met. The dates and performance conditions are identical on 
restricted shares and options, however on vesting, only restricted shares are entitled to receive 
any accrued dividends on the underlying shares during the vesting period. Those granted 
restricted shares are required to pay the nominal value of the shares at the commencement of 
the vesting period creating share capital. Subsequently, the accounting treatment for the 
restricted shares is the same as the share options.  
 
In total, £38,000 (2016: £106,000) of employee remuneration expense (all of which related to 
equity-settled share-based payment transactions) net of related deferred tax has been included 
in the income statement and credited to share-based payment reserve.

TSR LTIP 
The TSR LTIP is part of the remuneration package of the Executive Directors and certain senior 
managers (“Executives”). Options and restricted shares under this programme will vest only if 
the total shareholder return achieved by the Company over the three year vesting period is 
greater or equal to the TSR of the median company in a defined comparator group of companies 
over that period. The percentage of the award that vests operates on a sliding scale with 0% 
below the median, 20% at the median and 100% in the upper quartile. In addition, participants 
in this programme have to be employed until the end of the agreed vesting period. Upon vesting, 
each option allows the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a nominal value of £0.01 up to 
10 years from the grant date. Total expense included in the income statement relating to the 
TSR LTIP is £69,000 (2016: £53,000). 
 
The TSR LTIP options and restricted shares together with their related exercise prices were as

PBL LTIP 
The PBL LTIP is part of the remuneration package of the Group’s Executives. Options and 
restricted shares under this programme were to vest only if Peter Brotherhood Limited (a 
subsidiary of Hayward Tyler Group PLC) delivered an operating profit (before intercompany 
charges) of £1.6 million or higher, and/or revenues of £27.5 million or higher, in its audited 
results for the year ended 31 March 2017. At present, Management do not believe Peter 
Brotherhood will achieve the requisite vesting conditions and the options and restricted shares 
will be forfeited upon signing of the statutory accounts. Failure to achieve the vesting conditions 
resulted in a credit in the period of £53,000 (2016: expense of £53,000).

Company Share Option Plan 
The CSOP is part of the remuneration package of the Executive Directors and certain senior 
managers (“Executives”). Options under this programme will vest if individuals remain 
employees of the Group 3 years from the option grant date. Upon vesting, each option allows 
the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of £0.795 for up to 10 years from the grant 
date. Total expense included in the income statement relating to the CSOP is £22,000 (2016: 
£nil).

14 Earnings per share 
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. 
 
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted 
to allow for the issue of shares and the post-tax effect of dividends and/or interest, on the 
assumed conversion of all dilutive options and other dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Impairment testing 
For the purpose of annual impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the operating segments 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combinations in which the goodwill rises, 
as follows: 
 At 
31 March  
2017 
At 
31 March 
2016 
 £000 £000

Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017

The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on value-in-use calculations, 
covering a detailed three-year forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows for 
the remaining useful lives using a declining growth rate determined by management. The 
recoverable amount of each operating segment is set below:- 
 
 At 
31 March  
2017 
At 
31 March  
2016 
 £000 £000 
   
OE  19,231 23,539 
AM 125,861 94,467 
 
 
The key assumptions used in the calculations were: 
 the forecast operating cash flows for the next three years and a terminal value of such 
flows based on approved budgets and plans. These budgets and plans are based on 
past performance, the strength of the order book at 31 March 2017, the strength of the 
pipeline of future orders and expectations for the market development of the CGU, 
taking into account the current economic climate and forecast assumptions (both 
internal and external where appropriate) around the relevant product markets; 
 an estimate of the long-term growth rate for the CGU representing management’s best 
estimate of future long-term growth in the respective divisions, taking into account both 
internal and external projections for the markets in which they operate. The growth rate 
used for the first three years was 10% for OE and 10% for AM which has been based 
on forecasts provided by each of the business units. The terminal growth rate used was 
2%, which is based on the UK’s long-term consumer price index growth rate; and 
 a discount rate of 9.97% was used to discount future cash flows and reflects 
management’s estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of the Group. 
 
Impairment tests are carried out at each reporting date and indicate present values of future 
cash flows in respect of both the OE and AM divisions are far in excess of the carrying values 
of the associated assets including goodwill. In the case of OE, the result of the impairment test 
is sensitive to a change in the assumptions made. Despite its relatively low carrying value, OE 
has significant intrinsic value to the AM division, which derives most of its revenue from original 
equipment that has been designed and manufactured by the Group. Taking all of these 
elements together, including the close alignment of AM to OE, management considers the 
likelihood of any impairment arising to be remote.

The category “Assets in course of construction” in the fixed asset table relates to the work being 
carried out at the Centre of Excellence in Luton. The work for phase one was completed during 
FY2017.  A valuation of the freehold land and buildings relating to the Luton property will be 
carried out by an independent valuer once the phase two construction is completed. 
 
The Group’s freehold land and buildings were valued by independent valuers for the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 and an impairment charge was made at that 
date. The Directors believe that there has been no further impairment of the property since that 
date. Fair value of freehold land and buildings do not have quoted prices and have been 
determined based on professional appraisals that would be classified as Level 3 of the fair 
value hierarchy as defined in IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”.    
 
If the cost model had been used, the carrying amount of land and buildings would be £6,020,824 
(FY2016: £6,165,105). Revaluation previously has only ever resulted in a decrease arising, as

The Directors believe that the carrying amounts of trade and other receivables approximate 
their fair values. The receivables are short-term and non-interest bearing in the Group. 
Receivables are long-term interest bearing loans to subsidiaries in the Company.

All of the Group's trade and other receivables have been reviewed for indicators of impairment. 
Certain trade receivables were found to be impaired and an allowance for credit losses of £0.2 
million (FY2016: £0.2 million) has been made.  
The movement in the provision for credit losses can be reconciled as follows:

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available in future against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. This is 
assessed based on the Group’s forecast of future operating results and the future projected 
profitability of the Group. There are no losses for which a deferred tax asset has not been 
recognised (FY2016: nil).

28 Pensions and other employee obligations 
Within the UK the Group operates a defined benefit plan with benefits linked to final salary and 
a defined contribution plan.  
 
The defined benefit pension arrangement, called the Hayward Tyler Pension Plan (the “Plan”), 
provides benefits based on final salary and length of service on retirement, leaving service or 
death. With effect from 1 June 2003 the Plan was closed to new UK employees and to future 
service accrued for existing members who are offered membership of the defined contribution 
plan. The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements. The method 
used in assessing the Plan liabilities is the projected unit method. A full valuation of the Plan is 
produced every three years (the next one being as at 1 January 2017, which is due by 31 March 
2018) and updated annually to 31 March 2017 by independent qualified actuaries. 
 
 
The Plan is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004. A valuation 
of the Plan is carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory 
Funding Objective is being met. As part of the process the Company must agree with the 
trustees of the Plan the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory 
Funding Objective. The Statutory Funding Objective does not currently impact on the 
recognition of the Plan in these accounts. 
 
The Plan is managed by a board of trustees appointed in part by the Company and in part from 
elections by members of the Plan. The board of trustees includes a professional trustee 
(Independent Trustee Services Limited). The trustees have responsibility for obtaining 
valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing the Plan’s assets. The 
trustees delegate some of these functions to their professional advisers where appropriate. 
 
The Plan exposes the Company to a number of risks: 
 
 Investment risk 
The Plan holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile 
market values and, while these assets are expected to provide the real returns over 
the long-term, the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if a 
deficit emerges; 
 Interest rate risk  
The Plan’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds 
to discount the liabilities. As the Plan holds assets such as equities the value of the 
assets and liabilities may not move in the same way; 
 Inflation risk  
A significant proportion of the benefits under the Plan are linked to inflation. Although 
the Plan’s assets are expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long-
term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging; 
 Longevity risk  
In the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Plan; 
and 
 Concentration risk  
A significant proportion of the Plan’s liabilities are in respect of a single pensioner 
member. The development of the liabilities over time will therefore depend heavily on 
the actual experience in respect of this member.

There were no plan amendments, curtailments or settlements during the period. The Group’s 
defined benefit obligations and plan assets may be reconciled to the amounts presented on the

For determination of the pension obligation, the following actuarial assumptions were used: 
 
Group At  
31 March  
2017 
At 
31 March 
2016 
   
Discount rate 2.50% 3.35% 
Expected rate of pension increases 2.25% 2.00% 
Inflation assumption 3.25% 2.80% 
Mortality assumption 
 
S2PXA CMI S2PXA CMI 
S2PXA CMI – for males and females projected on a year of birth basis using CMI (2016) 
projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum with a plus 2 year age 
rating. The mortality assumptions imply the following life expectancies: 
 Male retiring at age 65 in 2017  20.4 
 Female retiring at age 65 in 2017 22.2 
 Male retiring at age 65 in 2037  21.8 
 Female retiring at age 65 in 2037 23.7 
 
These assumptions were developed by management under consideration of expert advice 
provided by Barnett Waddingham, independent actuarial appraisers. These assumptions have 
led to the amounts determined as the Group’s defined benefit obligations for the reporting 
periods under review and should be regarded as management’s best estimate. However, the 
actual outcome may vary.

No assumption is made with regard to the expected rate of salary increases as there are no 
members with benefits related to future salary progression. 
 
Scheme assets 
The assets held by the pension fund can be reconciled from the opening balance to the 
reporting date as follows: 
 
 At  
31 March

At  
31 March  
2016 
Group £000 £000

Fair value of plan assets at end of year 14,897 13,371 
   
Actual return on plan assets 2,474 144 
 
The Group expects to pay contributions of £232,000 in the year to 31 March 2018 and the 
weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is around 14 years. 
 
Plan assets do not include any investment in shares of the Company. Plan assets can be 
broken down into the following major categories of investments: 
 
Group At 31 March 2017 At 31 March 2016 
 £000 % £000 % 
     
     
     
Diversified growth funds 9,311 62.5 8,959 67

Liquid funds 164 1 - - 
Total value of assets 14,897 100 13,371 100 
 
All equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). Fair values of 
real estate investments do not have quoted prices and have been determined based on 
professional appraisals that would be classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined 
in IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’. Level 3 valuations are sensitive to unobservable inputs. 
 
Scheme expenses 
Net interest income resulting from the Group’s defined benefit plans was £9,000 (FY2016: 
£2,000 expense). The employee benefits expense for the period is £nil (FY2016: £nil). In the 
period the actual return on plan assets was £2,474,000 (FY2016: £144,000).

Risk mitigation strategies 
The trustees invest the Plan’s assets in combination of Liability-Sensitive assets and Return-
Generating assets. The Liability-Sensitive assets are invested in a variety of LDI (Liability-
Driven Investment) Funds. These funds invest in a combination of interest rate and inflation 
rate swaps in order to mimic the movement in expected cashflows of the Plan caused by 
changes in interest and inflation rates. 
 
Effect of the Plan on Company’s future cashflows 
The most recent comprehensive actuarial valuation was carried out as at 1 January 2014. The 
actuarial valuation as at 1 January 2017 is currently underway. The result of the 2014 valuation 
were updated to 31 March 2017 by allowing for cashflows in and out of the Plan and changes 
to assumptions over the period. In the event that the valuation reveals a larger deficit than 
expected the Company may be required to increase contributions above those set out in the 
existing schedule of contributions. Conversely, if the position is better than expected 
contributions may be reduced.

29 Risk management objectives and policies 
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks; foreign currency risk, credit risk, 
liquidity risk, cash flow risk and interest rate risk. The Group's overall risk management 
programmes focus on both credit risk and the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. 
 
The Group's risk management is co-ordinated at its headquarters, in close co-operation with 
the Board of Directors, and focuses on actively securing the Group's and the Company’s short 
to medium-term cash flows by minimising the exposure to financial markets.   
 
While the Group does use derivatives in order to economically hedge its exposure to foreign 
currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk (see below) it does not engage in the trading of 
derivatives for speculative purposes nor does it write options. The most significant financial 
risks to which the Group and the Company are exposed are described below.   
 
The Group is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and specifically to 
currency risk, interest rate risk and certain other price risks, which result from both its operating 
and investing activities. 
 
Foreign currency sensitivity 
The Group operates in overseas markets and is subject to currency exposures of transactions 
undertaken during the period. Management’s overarching objective is to minimise the extent of 
the Group’s exposure to currency risk. In respect of transactional foreign currency risk the 
Group maintains a policy that all exposures on material committed transactions should be 
economically hedged as far as possible. The Group prepares rolling 12 month currency cash 
flow forecasts to enable currency exposures to be identified and then subsequently hedged. 
 
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact on receipts and payments of 
the volatility in exchange rates of US Dollar and Euro to Pound Sterling. The notional principal 
amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 March 2017 were £8.5 
million (FY2016: £5.9 million). Hedge accounting is not applied in respect of these hedged 
transactions. 
 
Derivative contracts are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position with 
movements in that fair value being recognised in profit or loss. 
 
Currency exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that 
are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved. The significant 
currency risk arises from contracts raised in US Dollars.  
 
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change 
in the US Dollar/Pound Sterling exchange rate of +/-10%. These changes are considered to be 
reasonably possible based on observation of recent volatility in the currency markets. The 
calculations are based on a change in average US Dollar/Pound Sterling exchange rate for 
each period and the foreign currency denominated financial instruments held at each reporting 
date that are sensitive to changes in the US Dollar/Pound Sterling exchange rate. All other 
variables are held constant.

There is no impact on equity arising from foreign exchange fluctuations as the Group does not 
use hedge accounting. Exposures to foreign exchange rates vary during the year depending 
on the volume of overseas transactions. Nonetheless, the analysis above is considered to be 
representative of the Group’s exposure to currency risk. 
 
The Company does not have any currency exposures. 
 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The Group’s borrowings include loans that carry variable rates of interest and thus expose the 
Group to cash flow risk. The Group’s policy is to minimise interest costs and changes in the 
market value of debt. Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable 
and fixed rate borrowing is appropriate for the Group. The Group has chosen to maintain the 
majority of its borrowings as floating in order to benefit from low current interest rates. 
 
The Group has term borrowings of £9.2 million that have an effective fixed rate of interest.  
These borrowings relate to finance lease agreements (£3.6 million) and loan notes (£5.6 
million). The remaining term borrowings of £12.9 million have a floating rate of interest based 
on LIBOR.   
 
The Group's policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on long-term financing.  
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group at 31 March 2017 is 
as follows:

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change 
in interest rates of +/-0.5%. These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on 
observation of current market conditions. The calculations are based on a change in average 
market interest rate for each period and the financial instruments held at each reporting date 
that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (i.e. net floating rate debt). All other variables are 
held constant.

The Company has minimal exposure to interest rate risk. It has interest bearing liabilities that 
are matched with interest bearing assets. It is exposed to interest rate risk on its financial assets 
being its cash at bank balances. The interest rate receivable on these balances is less than 
0.5%. The Company gave careful consideration to which organisation it should use for its 
banking services and interest rates available was one aspect of the decision. The Directors 
currently believe that interest rate risk is at an acceptable level. 
 
Credit risk analysis 
The Group continuously monitors defaults of customers and other counterparties, identified 
either individually or by group, and incorporates this information into credit risk controls.  Where 
available at reasonable cost, external credit ratings and/or reports on customers and other 
counterparties are obtained and used. The Group's policy is to deal only with creditworthy 
counterparties.  
 
The Group’s most significant exposure to credit risk is in respect of the possibility of any 
individual customer being unable to settle their debts as they fall due or as a result of changes 
in the political landscape that impact the Group’s ability to collect debts from an individual 
jurisdiction. The credit risk associated with customers and jurisdictions is considered as part of 
the tender review process and is addressed initially via contract payment terms and, where 
appropriate, payment security. In certain circumstances it may lead to a decision by the Group 
to cease trading with individual customers or customers from certain jurisdictions. 
 
The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial 
assets recognised at the reporting date, as summarised below:

Classes of financial assets – carrying amounts   
Trade and other receivables 23,311 20,414 
Cash and cash equivalents 1,235 5,135 
 
The Group's management considers that all the above financial assets that are not impaired or 
past due for each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit quality. None of the 
Group's financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.  
 
Some of the unimpaired trade receivables are past due as at the reporting date. Financial 
assets past due but not impaired can be shown as follows:

In respect of trade and other receivables, the Group is not exposed to any significant credit risk 
exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers in various industries 
and geographical areas. Based on historical information about customer default rates   
 
 
Hayward Tyler Group PLC 
Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017

management consider the credit quality of trade receivables that are not past due or impaired 
to be good. 
 
The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents is considered to be negligible since the 
counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.  
 
The Company’s credit risk arises principally from the Company’s cash balances and the 
balances due to it from other Group undertakings. An allowance for impairment is made where 
there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction 
in the recoverability of the cash flows. The concentration of the Company’s credit risk is 
considered by counterparty, geography and currency. During the year ended and as at 31 
March 2017 the Company held minimal cash balances. In addition, as at 31 March 2017 the 
Company had provided long-term intercompany funding to its subsidiaries of £14.2 million 
(FY2016: £14.6 million), the Company’s management consider that these financial assets that 
are not impaired are of good credit quality. 
 
Liquidity risk analysis 
The Group, together with the Company, manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring 
scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term liabilities as well as forecast cash inflows and 
outflows due in day-to-day business. Liquidity needs are monitored in various time bands, on a 
day-to-day and week-to-week basis as well as on the basis of a rolling 60-day forecast and a 
rolling 15-week projection. Long-term liquidity needs for a 365-day lookout period are identified 
quarterly. Net cash requirements are compared to available borrowing facilities in order to 
determine headroom or any shortfalls.   
 
The Group and the Company maintain cash and headroom to meet their liquidity requirements 
for 60-day periods at a minimum. Funding for long-term liquidity needs is additionally secured 
by an adequate amount of credit facilities and the ability to sell long-term investment in 
subsidiaries. 
 
As at 31 March 2017, the liabilities that have contractual maturities (including interest payments 
where applicable) are summarised below:

when an amount is paid the liability has been included on the earliest date on which payment 
can be required. The Directors are of the view that the fair value of borrowings approximate to 
their carrying value. 
 
 
30 Capital management objectives 
The Group’s capital management objectives are: 
 to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern; and 
 to provide an adequate return to shareholders 
by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk. The Group funds itself 
through equity and debt, which is defined as bank borrowings, loan notes and finance leases. 
 
The Group’s capital is represented by the carrying amount of equity as presented on the face 
of the statement of financial position. The Group’s long-term goal in capital management is to 
maintain a balance of capital to overall financing in the range 40% to 60% while maintaining 
net debt to trading EBITDA below the Group’s target KPI of less than 2.0:1. At 31 March 2017 
capital represented 50% of overall financing (FY2016: 75%) and the Board will continue to 
monitor developments in the Group’s capital over FY2018. The capital and overall financing for 
the reporting periods under review is summarised as follows:
