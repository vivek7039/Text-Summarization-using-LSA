Extended Outlook
How much have we returned to shareholders?
The Group’s dividend history speaks for itself as do its 
longstanding relationships with supportive institutional 
investors. The Group remains committed to delivering 
compelling value to shareholders as demonstrated by 
the recent doubling of the annual dividend payout. 
What is the Group worth?
Stobart Group is listed on the London Stock Exchange 
and, based on the share price of 222.75p on 5 May 
2017, has a market capitalisation of £789.3m. 
Considering the Group’s proven history of value 
creation, realisation and returns to shareholders, 
coupled with the promise of future stable, long-term 
and predictable increased cash and profit generation 
as the Energy and Aviation divisions mature, it is easy 
to see how the market would ascribe this valuation 
and higher valuations to the Group in the future. 
What to look forward to in the Group’s  
next chapter?
Following the substantial realisation of our investment 
in Eddie Stobart Logistics subsequent to the year 
end, and having taken full ownership of our airline 
and aircraft leasing businesses during the year, the 
Group is entering an exciting new era. We are in 
control of our own destiny and whilst rightly proud 
of our logistics heritage, we look forward to taking 
our Energy, Aviation and Rail divisions to the next 
level, delivering further returns for shareholders. Our 
short and medium-term targets are clear; watch 
this space as we deliver on those and develop 
further stretching long-term targets and evolve our 
strategy for sustainable success and succession. 06

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Success and succession
We have made further solid 
progress across all our 
divisions at Stobart Group this 
year including taking full 
ownership of our airline, 
Stobart Air, and aircraft leasing 
business, Propius, and 
increasing the number of 
routes from London Southend 
Airport. Our key biomass 
processing sites are up and 
running and we continue to 
realise outstanding value from 
the property and investment 
portfolios. We remain confident 
we can achieve our published 
objectives for each division.
Strategy and Delivery
Our Group’s strategy for our five divisions 
is well established and good progress 
has been made during the year. Please 
refer to the Strategic Framework on 
pages 2-3, and the Operational Review 
on pages 14-26 to read about our 
strategy and progress.
T o take one example, our Eddie Stobart 
Logistics investment, of which we now 
own 12.5%, has yielded a great return 
with the promise of further returns to 
come. The recent IPO realised cash for 
the Group of £113.3m from the sale of 
36.5% of the Group’s original 49% 
investment. The company, known as 
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc, has 
announced the intention to pay a 2017 
dividend and implement a progressive 
dividend policy. The decision to hold 49% 
after the 2014 realisation has proved to 
be a good one and we anticipate our 
remaining 12.5% investment, worth 
£71.5m at the date of the IPO, will 
continue to grow in value.
Board Stability and Succession
We have had a very stable Board 
in recent years with no changes 
to the Non-Executive Directors 
since the current members were 
appointed in 2013 and 2014.
Andrew Tinkler founded Stobart 
Group, and has been the CEO since 
its flotation in 2007. During this time, 
he has been an entrepreneurial driving 
force, initially transforming the fortunes 
of the Eddie Stobart business and 
then setting the strategy of the Group 
today, which includes the fast-growing 
Energy and Aviation businesses. 
He has also overseen the value 
improvement and realisation of the 
Group’s property portfolio delivering 
consistent returns to shareholders.
In December 2016, we announced that 
Warwick Brady would be joining the 
Group as Deputy Group CEO, having 
previously been COO of easyJet plc. 
Warwick’s recruitment provided the 
Group with further aviation expertise 
and broader management capability. 
Also, earlier in July 2016, we announced 
that Ben Whawell was to step down 
from the Board and become the CEO 
GOOD GOVERNANCE
Allied to entrepreneurial flair, 
strong governance is critical for 
success at Stobart. I am pleased 
that the Board has been stable 
and fully compliant with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 
over the last financial year. 
Board and governance achievements 
in the last 18 months:
  Set out strategy following the  
partial disposal of the Transport 
and Distribution business.
  Held full strategy review 
meetings with the divisional 
management in  
September 2016.
  Completed Board evaluation 
and set an action plan.

STATEMENTS
of Stobart’s Energy division, providing 
strong, experienced and dedicated 
leadership at a very important phase of 
its development. These appointments 
meant that the Group has strong 
leadership in place in key positions, 
and allowed the Board to further 
develop plans for succession and long 
term value creation. We are pleased 
to announce that Warwick will join 
the Board and be appointed as the 
Group’s CEO following June’s AGM.
Andrew will continue as an Executive 
Board member, giving the Board 
continued access to his input at Group 
level. He will also Chair a newly formed 
independent business, Stobart Capital, 
which will be at the heart of the Group’s 
new value creation unit (see below). 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank Andrew for his unique and tireless 
contribution to the Board and to the 
Group over the past ten years, and I 
look forward to working with Andrew 
and Warwick in their new roles.
Richard Butcher, Executive Director and 
CEO of Stobart Infrastructure, will not offer 
himself for re-election and will step down 
from the Board at the AGM. Richard’s role 
has evolved as the number of properties 
remaining in the Group portfolio has 
reduced. He will continue to manage 
the portfolio and implement the Group’s 
realisation strategy in his role as CEO 
of Stobart Infrastructure. I would like to 
thank Richard for his valued contribution 
to the Group over many years.
Mark Adams was appointed as interim 
CFO in November 2016 and has assisted 
the Group through the extension of 
the bank facility, the acquisitions of 
the airline and Propius, and the sale 
and leaseback of the Propius aircraft 
post year end. With these transactions 
now complete, Mark will step down 
from his position at 31 May 2017 and 
I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank him for his contribution to 
the Group. We will make a further 
announcement regarding the leadership 
of the finance function in due course.
Stobart Capital
Stobart Group has a strong track record 
of entrepreneurialism, growth and 
investment. The Group has decided to 
formally bring this expertise together 
within a new dedicated value creation 
unit, to be headed by Andrew Tinkler 
and supported by Ian Soanes, a 
long-standing advisor to the Group. 
This will enable the management 
teams of the Group’s core Energy, 
Aviation, Rail and Infrastructure 
operations to focus on driving the 
value of their existing businesses.
Stobart Capital will operate independently 
of the Group, with access to external 
capital and expertise, but working 
closely with the Group’s management 
team. Investment opportunities will 
be presented to a new Value Creation 
Board, a sub-committee of the Stobart 
Group Board, for evaluation.

Results for the Year
I am pleased to report another year 
delivering growth in both revenue and 
underlying EBITDA
1
 in spite of challenges 
due to delays in the expected operational 
date of biomass plants in the Energy 
division, and slow progress in delivering 
capacity growth at London Southend 
Airport impacted by a brief hiatus 
following the Brexit vote.
After a net non-cash goodwill write-off of 
£21.6m and other non-underlying costs of 
£13.8m, there was a loss before tax for 
the year of £8.0m.
Compounding Returns to 
Shareholders
During the year to 28 February 2017, 
£34.7m was returned to shareholders 
through dividends. The Board is 
proposing a final dividend of 4.5p (2016: 
4.0p) per ordinary share totalling £15.9m 
(2016: £13.8m paid on 8 July) and giving 
an increased total dividend payable for 
the year of 13.5p (2016: 6.0p) comprising 
of three interim dividends of 3.0p and a 
final dividend of 4.5p. We expect to 
maintain the quarterly dividend at this 
increased level. We will continue to 
support the funding of the dividend from 
proceeds of property asset disposals and 
investment realisations in the short-term 
and the Board will consider additional 
returns to shareholders should there be 
surplus funds generated.
As the Board and I look forward to the 
next 12 months, I am confident that 
Stobart’s strengths will continue to prevail 
as we all work together to achieve our 
clear objectives.

Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Driving the value
I have been CEO of Stobart 
Group for almost 10 years and 
during that time we have 
generated a compound 
shareholder return of around 
10% p.a. We have also 
developed Energy and Aviation 
platforms to deliver our targets 
to 2018 and beyond. The Group 
is now uniquely placed as an 
entrepreneurial public limited 
company that creates value, 
supported by its strong heritage 
in logistics and systems and 
with a real focus on delivering 
great customer service. With a 
market capitalisation of close to 
£800m, a strong balance sheet 
and a progressive dividend 
policy, the Group is well placed 
to continue to deliver strong 
returns to shareholders for the 
foreseeable future.
Highlights and  
History of Stobart Group
2004: Purchased Eddie Stobart Limited 
for £2m – previously losing £10m per 
annum in 2003.
2007: Stobart Group Limited listed on 
the London Stock Exchange through a 
£138m reverse takeover of Westbury 
Property Fund, creating a leading road 
transport and rail business. 
2008: Created a platform for a 
multimodal logistics business.
2009: Invested in London Southend 
Airport with its 45 minute rail link to 
London.
2010: Purchased initial 50% of Stobart 
Energy, subsequently increased to 
100%, that has now become the 
leading supplier of biomass in the UK.
2012: Invested in Stobart Air, a 
Dublin-based regional airline that now 
operates under the Aer Lingus brand, 
and an aircraft leasing business.
2012: Purchase of Moneypenny 
property portfolio, which subsequently 
delivered a 22.5% IRR.
2012: Autologic acquired for £12m and 
since realised 6x money multiple.
2014: Reconstituted the Stobart Group 
Board under the chairmanship of Iain 
Ferguson CBE (ex Unilever and CEO  
of T ate & Lyle plc). 
2014: Sale of 51% of Eddie Stobart 
Logistics (ESL) when the Group had a 
market capitalisation c.£475m, realising 
£196m of cash to reduce debt levels 
and strengthen the balance sheet. 
2017: ESL floated on AIM with a market 
capitalisation of £573m delivering a 
return of 4.2x since the sale of 51% in 
2014, creating significant value for 
shareholders. ESL being transformed 
from a road transport to a logistics and 
distribution business operating across 
a broad range of sectors underpinned 
by blue chip customers.
Where are we today? 
Stobart Group now comprises three core 
operating divisions in sectors with real 
growth opportunities. Our Energy, Aviation 
and Rail civil engineering businesses are 
all well placed for profitable growth over 
the next five years. Our Infrastructure 
and Investments divisions continue their 
programme of divestment, creating 
further value for shareholders. 
Energy – this year has been about 
establishing the foundations of 
infrastructure, logistics and people 
to ensure our ability to deliver on our 
long-term fuel supply contracts into 
over 20 biomass plants around the UK. 
Widnes and Tilbury storage processing 
sites are now up and running and 
those plants are progressing towards 
commissioning. Development of other 
processing sites at Port Clarence 
and Rotherham is also underway. 
A full management team is now in 
place, focused on professionalising 
the industry to deliver long-term 
sustainable supply and management 
of predominantly recycled wood under 
long-term index-linked contracts. 
Aviation – a significant year for the 
Aviation division with continued 
development of our airport, London 
Southend, which we believe will play a 
key part in providing capacity for the 
constrained London air travel market. 
A London airport that has technical 
capacity to handle 10m+ passengers, 
45 minutes from London, will over time 
be a very valuable asset for the Group. 
We have consolidated our regional 
airline and aircraft leasing businesses, 
taking full ownership, and will continue 
to develop our valuable long-term 
franchise with Aer Lingus as well as 
support Flybe in the Isle of Man and 
from our London Southend Airport.  11

Rail and Non-Rail Civil Engineering – 
our Rail business continues to support 
speciality work for Network Rail as well 
as being a tier 2 supplier to the industry. 
We expect to see continued growth under 
the Stobart brand. The non-rail business 
has also supported infrastructure projects 
in our Energy and Aviation divisions by 
providing an efficient low-cost value 
engineering construction solution. 
Infrastructure – our plan to divest non-
core infrastructure assets continues and 
we have delivered against our plan this 
year. The business is also very good at 
providing asset management initiatives 
working alongside our Rail division, 
and delivering on-time and to budget. 
Investments – the post year-end IPO of 
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc valued the 
Group’s 49% investment at £184.8m, 
significantly ahead of the year-end 
carrying value of £58.4m and realised 
cash of £113.3m. This is a great example 
of how we have created significant value 
for the Group and our shareholders. 
People
One of my personal business 
beliefs is to employ people that are 
better than yourself and I see this 
as a strength from a shareholder 
perspective as well as CEO. 
Working together with our new Group 
CEO, Warwick Brady, whom I have known 
for several years and worked closely 
alongside for the last six months, I believe 
that we can bring extensive value to the 
Group. I am strongly of the view that 
Warwick’s industry-wide knowledge and 
experience will help grow and support 
the entire Group. I am confident that his 
business experience and entrepreneurial 
approach will be a key part in the next 
chapter of Stobart Group’s value creation.
Energy – headed by Ben Whawell, CEO 
Stobart Energy and the ex-Group CFO. 
We have worked together for the last 
17 years and I am confident that he has 
the skills and experience to move the 
Energy business to the next level and 
create significant shareholder value.
Aviation – this division includes 
airports, a regional airline and an aircraft 
leasing company. These businesses 
all have potential and are supported 
by our proven logistics expertise. 
The teams within this division, led 
by Glyn Jones, will support Warwick 
in delivery of our objectives.
Rail – Managing Director Kirk T aylor, of 
our Rail and non-rail civil engineering 
business, has worked with me since 
1994. He is diligent and passionate 
about our business and can grow Rail 
to be the number one specialist provider 
to the rail and construction industry, 
as well as supporting the Group in any 
value-adding infrastructure projects.
Whilst I am handing over the reins to 
lead and run Stobart Group to Warwick, 
Ben, Glyn and Kirk, as the third largest 
shareholder, I believe that we are now 
on the next stage of our journey that 
will realise the significant potential of 
the Group over the coming years. 
As a key founder of Stobart Group, I am 
committed to remaining on the Board for 
the foreseeable future and to supporting 
Warwick’s transition to Group CEO. I 
will support the Executive Management 
team and the Board by devoting 50% of 
my time to the Group and the delivery 
of further significant shareholder value. 
The remainder of my time will be 
spent working with Richard Butcher to 
deliver value in our Infrastructure and 
Investments divisions and, in particular in 
launching and developing Stobart Capital, 
bringing together the Group’s investment 
activities under a new value creation unit. 
This will be a platform, working alongside 
external professionals and exploiting my 
entrepreneurial skills and experience, 
to bring investment opportunities to the 
Group that complement the strategy, 
and have the potential to create 
further returns for shareholders.
I would like to thank Richard for his 
valued contribution to the business over 
many years and also thank Mark for his 
work as interim CFO over recent months.

Stobart Value Wheel – 28 February 2017

Stobart Value Wheel – Proforma
2 12
Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
I am delighted to join 
Stobart Group at an exciting 
time when the foundations 
in Energy, Aviation and Rail 
are ripe for further 
development and growth. 
I have worked with the 
Group since 2009 during the 
early stages of developing 
London Southend Airport 
when I was Chief Operating 
Officer at easyJet. My 
experience working with this 
entrepreneurial team gave 
me insights into the value 
being created. This sparked 
my interest and led me to 
follow the Group’s progress 
over recent years.
Over the years, I have forged a good 
working relationship with Andrew Tinkler 
and once I left easyJet in September 
2016, I spent three months working very 
closely with Andrew and the Stobart 
Group Board to understand the value of 
the Group but moreover, to see if I could 
use my international experience from my 
early days in Private Equity, through to my 
extensive aviation experience in Europe, 
to support and lead the next chapter for 
the Stobart Group.
I am particularly impressed by how the 
Group applies its heritage in logistics 
and distribution across all the divisions 
as well as how it embraces the customer 
service ethos. When combined with 
being very entrepreneurial, culturally the 
Group fits with my ambitions. I expect to 
use the foundations in Energy, Aviation 
and Rail to continue creating value for 
shareholders over the long-term.
Over the last six months I have very 
much enjoyed working with the Board 
and Andrew but moreover believe there 
is a lot of unlocked value and growth 
potential across our core divisions 
that has yet to be realised. Whilst the 
foundations have been laid in each 
division, with investment and a clear 
strategic direction, the business can 
continue to grow. The Group has all 
the resources available to support 
accelerated growth and then over time 
the operating businesses will underpin 
the value creation for our shareholders. 
Energy
Having now toured several of the 
Group’s processing sites and plants, 
as well as spending time working with 
Ben and the team, I can see that this 
business is all about logistics and 
distribution so fits very well with the core 
expertise of the Group. With several 
of the large energy plants coming on 
stream over the next 12 months there 
will inevitably be a few challenges but I 
am confident that the team will deliver 
on the overall targets. I expect we will 
deliver 60% of the market’s fuel supply 
into biomass plants and this will underpin 
the financial returns for the next 20 
years or so. I also see opportunities to 
grow the business through operating 
and managing the energy plants and 
extending into other forms of fuel that 
can leverage our current specialist 
transport and logistics operation. 
Aviation
Airport – The key to value creation is 
our London airport becoming part of 
the answer to supporting London’s 
travel growth within the airport systems. 
The on-going London airport capacity 
constraints will mean our London airport, 
with its great train links 45 minutes 
from London, will be an opportunity 
for the capital’s travel market to grow. 
London Southend Airport is London’s 
best airport and the infrastructure can 
support 10m+ passengers per year. The 
other differentiator is that Stobart Group 
provides all the services across the 
airport from operating the railway station, 
owning and operating our 4* hotel under 
the Holiday Inn brand, our food and 
beverage outlets, car parking and solar 
farm. These all create additional value for 
the Group and will be an important part of 
further developing London’s best airport. 
There is also a lot of space to develop 
our property assets at the airport which 
could be used for maintenance and 
other businesses. It is truly remarkable 
that we will be able to create a London 
airport capable of delivering 10m+ 
passengers per year for under £200m, 
so the capital efficiency is impressive. 
Airline and Aircraft Leasing – Our regional 
airline, Stobart Air, based in Dublin, 
operates under a long-term franchise 
with Aer Lingus which we believe will be 
an important support for International 
Airlines Group’s focus on growing its 
transatlantic traffic through the Dublin 
hub. Stobart Air also operates for Flybe 
and, in the future, will operate regional 
jets under the Flybe brand to support 
the growth of our London airport. Our 
aircraft leasing business, Propius, 
supports Stobart Air and together they 
will be developed to create more value 
for the Group. From my perspective, 
the UK and Europe’s regional airline 
market would benefit from some type 
of consolidation to ensure the capacity 
supports profitable regional connectivity. 13

Ground Handling and Support Services 
– The Group already provides ground 
handling services and given its 
expertise in logistics, distribution and 
customer services, we plan to grow 
this business in the UK and Europe.
 
Stobart Exec Jet Centre – With c.100,000 
private jet movements into the London 
market per year, our Exec Jet Centre is 
well placed to offer a great service by 
connecting product into London. With 
a clear plan to grow this business, we 
believe over time it will become a key part 
of London’s executive aviation offering. 
The Group is well set-up for growing 
these small but established businesses 
and capitalising on the current 
opportunities in the market. 
Rail and Non-Rail Civil  
Engineering
Our Stobart Rail team is highly regarded 
in the Industry and provides valuable tier 
2 specialist services to Network Rail and 
its tier 1 partners. Its real competitive 
advantage is the team’s innovative 
approach to developing equipment, 
systems and people to deliver significant 
value to the customer. Stobart Rail is 
renowned for operating strongly under 
critical time constraints and delivering 
quality work on time and to budget.
On the non-rail side, the team are 
specialists in building distribution centres, 
airports, racecourses etc. T ogether with 
an innovative approach, design capability, 
planning and low cost execution, they 
provide value engineering across the 
Group. They have supported the Group 
by building processing sites for Stobart 
Energy as well as providing specialist 
infrastructure projects at the airport 
including taxiways, runway works etc. 
This provides the Group with a real 
competitive advantage by being able to 
deliver infrastructure at competitive costs. 
Overall, after a lot of due diligence and 
time spent within Stobart Group, I see 
an opportunity to use the foundations 
to grow the Group over the next few 
years. We will aim to remain a very 
entrepreneurial team with Andrew  
Tinkler supporting as an Executive 
Director to ensure we do not lose 
our “founders mentality” of creating 
value and operating in an agile way. 
This will ensure that we continue 
to grow the business to deliver 
sustainable and progressive returns 
for shareholders for years to come.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
STOBART ENERGY
Putting the foundations in 
place for future growth
Mission Statement:  
To keep the lights on by 
supplying the right quality 
biomass, on time and at  
the best possible margin.
Stobart Energy is the number 
one supplier of biomass in the 
UK, sourcing and supplying 
fuel to renewable energy plants 
under a mix of short and 
long-term contracts.
What has been the key objective for 
the business over the last 12 months?
The success of this division is based 
on our ability to source, process 
and deliver the right quality of fuel 
when our customers require it. 
Having already secured contracts to 
supply over 2.0mt p.a. of waste wood fuel 
to customers by calendar year 2018, the 
key objective for the business over the 
last 12 months has been to invest in the 
infrastructure to ensure that we deliver on 
our obligations under these contracts as 
well as to deliver on our stated goal 
of £10 EBITDA per tonne by calendar 
year 2018.
During the year, we had to manage the 
loss of volume when a UK renewable 
energy plant went into administration. In 
addition, we commenced the strategic 
reduction of export volumes in readiness 
for new UK plants. These impacted 
on both tonnes supplied and revenue; 
however, the impact on EBITDA was 
mitigated by tight cost control.
How has the business invested in 
its infrastructure?
We have made significant progress 
during the year, building the infrastructure 
required to achieve our long-term plan.
T o ensure a secure, sustainable 
supply chain, we increased the 
size of our procurement team and 
focused on building long-term, 
contractual relationships with 
suppliers of unprocessed wood, 
including European suppliers.
We commenced operations at the 
Widnes and Tilbury wood processing 
sites, investing in the latest wood 
processing equipment, and ensured 
we have adequate space to store 
unprocessed wood to mitigate against 
seasonal imbalances in supply and 
demand. In the final quarter of the  15

On average, the operational dates of plants have been delayed by three months.  
This represents a delay of approximately 380,000 tonnes, not a loss of 380,000 tonnes,  
as our contractual period of supply will only start from the revised dates.

DIVISIONAL KPIs
financial year, Stobart Group purchased 
a site in Rotherham which will be 
developed into a wood processing site 
and we are currently evaluating a further 
site at T eesside. We are on course 
to process around 50% of the total 
volume required by our customers. 
We recognised the importance of 
building and maintaining effective 
working relationships with our customers, 
given the length and financial value of 
the contracts in place. As a result, we 
established a contract management 
team which is responsible for these 
relationships on a day-to-day basis 
and ensures that we are meeting 
our contractual obligations.
 
Finally, we have expanded our quality 
control team and invested in the latest 
testing equipment to ensure that the 
processed product we supply meets the 
contractual specification and that we can 
audit our supply chain from start to finish.
What are the key challenges facing 
the business?
Given the infrastructure of supply chain, 
wood processing sites, transport network, 
contract management and quality control 
that are required to service these sizable 
contracts, a change to the timing of when 
a key biomass plant becomes fully 
operational presents a significant 
challenge to our business. We incurred 
significant and excess costs at our 
Widnes processing site based on a delay 
of two months in the renewable energy 
plant requiring fuel. Furthermore, once 
burning fuel, the plant experienced a 
number of operational issues which meant 
the Widnes processing site was not 
operating at the expected levels for 
commissioning. These excess costs, and 
other contract set-up costs totalling £3.0m, 
of which £1.0m relates to prior years, have 
been disclosed as non-underlying. 
Though we recognise these movements 
represent key challenges in the interim, 
we do not expect these delays to impact 
on our stated goals of supplying 2m 
tonnes and £10 EBITDA per tonne by the 
end of calendar year 2018.
At the start of the year, we also reduced 
the size of our transport fleet by 10% in 
light of network changes. At this point, 
we decided against further reducing 
the size of the fleet due to the future 
demand from new contracts. As a result, 
the business carried significant excess 
costs of under-utilised trucks during the 
current financial year which have been 
included in non-underlying costs. 
Finally, the extent of regulatory 
requirements in relation to transporting 
waste product and operating wood 
processing sites represents a significant 
challenge to our business, as well as the 
industry as a whole. We have mitigated 
this through the strength of our processes 
and procedures, and by maintaining 
regular and effective communication with 
regulatory bodies.
Our focus over the next 12 months 
will be to ensure that we minimise 
the risk of incurring unnecessary 
costs, whilst ensuring we are ready 
to service renewable energy plants 
as and when they come online.
What are the key drivers for growth?
Growth will be driven by leveraging 
our position in the market to source 
unprocessed wood at the most 
competitive rate, by maximising 
operational efficiency within our transport 
network and at our wood processing 
sites, and by ensuring that we produce 
the best possible specification biomass 
product for our customers. 
A further key driver of growth will be 
to utilise our existing infrastructure to 
increase our involvement in other waste 
fuel such as Refuse Derived Fuel and 
Solid Recovered Fuel.

SUPPLY CHAIN SPECIFIC TO TILBURY
• Created a secure, sustainable supply 
chain capable of providing waste 
wood volumes to meet contractual 
biomass fuel volumes.
• Seasonal changes in supply and 
demand mitigated by long-term 
contracts with waste wood suppliers 
and a dedicated waste wood 
procurement team for the plant. 
 
TRANSPORT
• Aveley and Sittingbourne operations 
were relocated to Tilbury in order to 
collect waste wood from the London 
area and deliver into the plant.
• Provision to park up to 50 vehicles  
on site.
 
OPERATIONS
• Due to a delay caused by failure of the 
renewable energy plant to hand over 
the processing site on time, we 
invested, at additional cost, in a 
short-term mobile processing facility  
for the Fort Road site whilst a fixed 
processing facility at the renewable 
energy plant is being built (expected 
completion July 2017). 
• Once the plant is completed, Fort Road 
will become a storage site, holding 
waste wood to ensure sufficient supply 
to meet plant demand.

Ready for take off 
MEDIUM-TERM PLAN
 Develop London Southend Airport to an annualised 2.5m 
passengers in 2018 and significantly more beyond that as  
London capacity becomes increasingly scarce. 
 Develop and grow our private executive jet centre to become 
London’s ‘best airport’ for private aviation customer service.
 Grow EBITDA to £8 per passenger in 2018.
 Establish Carlisle Lake District Airport for commercial operations.
 Continue to deliver the best customer service in the market.
 Strengthen relationship with Aer Lingus, Stobart Air’s key 
franchise partner.
PROGRESS WITH THE PLAN
 London Southend Airport 
(LSA) offers a unique 
combination of peak airport 
capacity in a very constrained 
London airport system, easy 
access, efficient operations 
driving a low-cost base and 
an exceptional customer 
experience. The combination 
of these factors is attractive to 
both airlines and passengers. 
We are therefore optimistic 
that growth at LSA will come 
from regional, low-cost and 
full-service operators 
especially from the UK, 
particularly London, but with 
strong support from inbound 
passengers coming from 
mainland Europe.
 LSA was once again 
recognised by the Airport 
Operators Association as the 
best airport in Britain in 2016 
for its category, having also 
won the title in 2015. The task 
of raising awareness of the 
benefits of LSA is well 
understood and marketing 
plans developed in 2016 are 
already in deployment, with 
significantly heavier weight 
than in previous years. 
 The acquisition of additional 
capacity with Flybe, 
combined with easyJet 
growth announced in 2016, 
will take LSA’s passenger 
numbers during 2017/18 to 
1.2m. Furthermore, 
discussions with several 
airlines about material 
capacity growth for 2017/18 
are well advanced, despite a 
brief hiatus following the 
Brexit vote. Thus, we remain 
confident in our expectation of 
reaching 2.5m passengers by 
the end of calendar year 2018. 
 In addition to the above, 
Carlisle Lake District Airport 
(CLDA) has received 
confirmation of funding from 
Cumbria Local Enterprise 
Partnership for development 
in 2017/18 and planning for 
the development of the airport 
is at an advanced stage.

STATEMENTS
We aim to develop and grow the value, 
centred around our London airport and 
the associated businesses, using the 
Group’s expertise in logistics and 
customer service. As well as LSA and 
CLDA, the Aviation division also includes 
full ownership of our regional airline 
Stobart Air, operating under the Aer 
Lingus and Flybe brands, as well as our 
aircraft leasing business, Propius 
Holdings Limited. 
How do we leverage our assets to 
support the growth of LSA and the 
division to maximise value for 
shareholders? 
Regional Airline – Stobart Air
Stobart Air (SA) is an important part 
of the Stobart Aviation division. It is 
a respected regional airline currently 
operating under both the Aer Lingus 
and Flybe brands with 17 modern ATR 
aircraft carrying c.2m customers per 
annum. The valuable franchise with 
Aer Lingus, within International Airline 
Group (IAG), provides high-quality, 
competitive, punctual, and responsive 
scheduled services, delivering a third of 
the point-to-point traffic between the UK 
and Ireland. The airline provides integral 
support to the transatlantic growth of IAG 
through its provision of feeding traffic 
into the Dublin Hub which has seen 
considerable growth in recent years. In 
addition, SA operates a successful wet 
lease operation for Flybe in the Isle of 
Man, with two dedicated ATR aircraft.
 
In summary, Stobart Air is a well-run, 
competitive, regional airline, that has the 
capacity to operate more franchise 
agreements as part of creating additional 
value for the Group.
Stobart Aviation also plans to use Stobart 
Air to directly support activities at London 
Southend Airport, delivering up to 
300,000 additional passengers through 
the airport by 2018.
Leasing Business – Propius
During the year, Stobart Group acquired 
all the interests in Propius; previously 
one-third was owned by each of Stobart 
Group, Invesco Perpetual and Aer Lingus. 
The ownership forms part of our plan to 
release the value of the airline and to fund 
the purchase of eight new aircraft. 
Consequently, Propius now leases eight 
ATR aircraft to Stobart Air.

Further Aviation Opportunities for 
Stobart Group 
Notwithstanding Stobart Group’s core 
focus on creating value through the 
airport, LSA represents a significant 
opportunity for the Group to utilise its 
existing businesses as well as its expertise 
to explore and develop the following:
• Executive Handling: LSA provides 
a unique opportunity to develop the 
Stobart Executive Handling business. 
With c.100,000 private jet movements 
per year in London, our Fixed Base 
Operator facilities create a good base 
from which to grow. 
• Ground Handling: Currently, the ground 
handling sector in the UK and Europe 
fails to deliver a vital customer service 
for airports and airlines, thus creating 
an opportunity for Stobart Aviation.
By combining the ground handling 
expertise of LSA and our in-depth 
knowledge of systems and logistics that 
was inherent in the Eddie Stobart 
Logistics business, Stobart Group can 
offer a ground handling model that 
manages labour by the minute, 
supported by the latest logistics systems 
to the UK and European markets. This 
represents an exciting opportunity to offer 
a dedicated operations business to 
airlines at medium to large airports.

What other projects have you  
worked on?
The Stobart Rail team has successfully 
delivered a Combined Heat and Power 
(CHP) Plant in Widnes for Burmeister and 
Wain Scandinavian Contractor, in spite of 
some challenges that impacted on the 
returns from this project. We have also 
further developed our Stobart Forestry 
arm for our under managed woodland 
programme. This team is charged with 
sourcing sustainable timber for the rapidly 
expanding renewable energy sector.
In September, Stobart Rail was awarded a 
Logistics, Storage and Transport Major 
Incident Response contract from the 
Environment Agency. 
How do you plan to grow?
We have increased our focus on, and 
investment in, plant and equipment 
particularly in relation to design, 
development, technology and innovation 
of assets, creating options for sale or to 
self-operate, whichever works best for us. 
An example of this are our new tracked 
ballast undercutters (pictured) with 
follow-up machines which distribute new 
ballast, brush the clips and lift and slew 
the track. One of our main purchases 
this year, was a new concrete paving 
machine (pictured). This piece of kit 
gives excellent output rates, significantly 
reducing the cost of the works we are 
delivering for Group projects and for 
third parties. During the year, we further 
invested in more new rail equipment, 
we upgraded a significant number of 
machines and disposed of a number 
of rail containers and reachstackers, 
realising cash and profit on disposal.
With no major change in overall strategy, 
we will continue to serve contracts 
both directly and indirectly for Network 
Rail. Building on successes such as 
the Far North contract in Scotland, we 
hope to win further maintenance works, 
whilst actively exploring opportunities 
for similar work on Light Rail.
In light of recent publicly-voiced 
dissatisfaction concerning the operation 
and maintenance of the UK’s rail network, 
Stobart Rail is readying itself for a change 
in the Government’s strategy. We are 
submitting a passport application that 
will enable us to bid for franchises 
and we have gone so far as to identify 
Mission Statement:  
To provide customers with 
excellent quality engineering 
solutions, safely and efficiently.
Stobart Rail is one of the UK’s 
leading providers of innovative 
and efficient rail and non-rail 
civil engineering projects. 23

businesses with whom we will partner.
Furthermore, we are endeavouring to 
build a team to deliver innovation and 
technologies that can be transferred 
across the road, rail and air sectors.
What are the key challenges facing 
the business?
Spend is increasing on all infrastructure 
contracts across the country. This 
should be an advantage to the 
business in the coming years but 
there is a known national shortage 
of quality and experienced senior 
management and engineering personnel. 
As a result, it can be expensive 
and difficult to secure good senior 
management and skilled engineers. 
Furthermore, staying abreast of legislative 
change and compliance requires a strong 
team, sometimes bringing associated 
costs. We understand the value in 
keeping the right management teams 
in place, to ensure Stobart Rail’s ability 
In calendar year 2017, we hope 
to increase our win percentage 
on bids, securing more contracts 
with Network Rail and other tier 1 
providers, whilst maintaining good 
working relationships with our clients 
at all levels of the business.
Furthermore, we have increased our 
focus on our customers’ aspirational 
growth plans, which allows us to provide 
them with better support.
While we will not waiver from our growth 
target of a minimum 5% per year, Stobart 
Rail recognises the need for flexibility and 
looks to remain open to new areas of 
service provision.

to plan competently, deliver successful 
projects and ensure quality throughout.
We will strive to form partnerships with 
like-minded contractors, enabling us to 
build a complementary and efficient 
alliance that fulfils the requirement of 
these partnerships.
What are your targets for 2017?
We aim to deliver efficiencies across all 
our contracts, both external and internal.
 
On the numerous projects for Stobart 
Energy and Stobart Aviation this 
year, our target is to complete all 
planned works efficiently and safely, 
without compromising on the quality 
of the end product and without 
adversely affecting live operations.
We hope to take advantage of current 
successes such as the Far North 
Contract, and increase our railway 
maintenance associated business.

MEDIUM-TERM PLAN
 Manage and develop Stobart 
Group assets effectively and 
enhance value.
 Divest all commercial property 
assets and return cash to 
shareholders.
 Create 25% IRR through asset 
realisations and value 
improvement.
PROGRESS WITH THE PLAN
 During the course of 2016/17, 
Stobart Infrastructure generated 
£52.7m of net proceeds from 
property disposals; a profit of 
£14.5m was achieved on these 
disposals. 
Enhancing assets  
and realising value
Mission Statement:  
To create value for Stobart  
Group and realise commercial 
property and infrastructure 
assets.
The Infrastructure division 
holds our portfolio of 
commercial properties and our 
investments in energy plants 
and has a strong track record 
of enhancing and realising the 
value of its assets.
Stobart Group has a clear strategy to 
divest all of its non-core infrastructure 
assets and return cash to shareholders. 
Our strategy is to maximise the realisable 
value of these assets through their 
efficient development and management. 
Across the portfolio, we are targeting 
to achieve an average realisation 
of 20% above book value and we 
have a near-term target of divesting 
all commercial property assets 
within the next two to three years.
What have been the key disposals 
during the year? 
The division has successfully disposed 
of a number of assets, notably Speke, 
Chelford and Kingston-upon-Hull, 
generating net disposal proceeds of 
£36.9m, £7.3m and £8.5m respectively.
Have any acquisitions taken place? 
During the year, the division acquired 
one property, a former Council depot 
located in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. 
The site is to be developed by Stobart Rail 
and will be used by Stobart Energy as a 
waste wood processing site, to service 
its 20-year fuel supply agreement with 
the newly constructed T empleborough 
biomass CHP (Combined Heat and 
Power) Plant, located in Rotherham.
What have been the key highlights 
from the last 12 months? 
During the last 12 months, Stobart 
Infrastructure has generated net disposal 
proceeds of £52.7m and a profit on 
disposal of property assets of £14.5m.

DIVISIONAL KPIS
The disposal of the Speke property, in 
particular, is a fantastic demonstration of 
the division managing assets to deliver 
their full potential. The 53-acre property, 
of which 47 acres were occupied by 
Ford, was acquired in December 2015 
and in March 2016, negotiations were 
concluded with Ford for a new 20-year 
lease at an annual rent of £2.1m and 
an option for the tenant to acquire the 
site for £37.0m, which was ultimately 
exercised on 31 May 2016. As a result 
of the disposal, the Group has realised 
a total gain of £20.7m since acquiring 
the property and it still retains ownership 
of six acres of development land. We 
are currently pursuing a number of 
potential development options for this 
land, which is expected to result in 
further value creation for the Group.
Speke
Hull
In November 2016, we completed the 
sales of our B&Q premises in Kingston-
upon-Hull and land at Knutsford Road, 
Chelford generating combined net cash 
proceeds of £15.8m. The B&Q store was 
sold to a third party following a successful 
negotiation with B&Q for a ten-year lease 
extension. The Chelford site, for which the 
division had secured outline planning 
consent for a residential development, 
was sold to one of the UK’s leading home 
builders. These two disposals generated 
a profit of £2.8m during the year and are 
further great examples of the 
Infrastructure team managing and 
developing our assets to enhance value.
Also of note is the division’s successful 
assignment of a lease on a warehouse 
at Daventry, achieving a profit of £1.0m 
on the lease assignment, as well as 
removing exposure to a potential 
liability on the headlease of £9.8m.
Revaluation gains in the year amounted 
to £3.1m, reflecting our continued 
success in asset management to achieve 
greater returns for Stobart Group.
 
What are your targets for 2018? 
Looking towards 2018, Stobart 
Infrastructure plans to continue to create 
value and realise its commercial property 
and infrastructure assets to underpin 
dividend payments to shareholders.

PROGRESS WITH THE PLAN
 Revenues in ESL increased 
by 14.8% year on year to 
£570.2m, driven by strong 
volumes and new progress 
within the logistics sector. 
ESL secured a number of 
new contracts with high 
profile customers in the retail, 
consumer and construction 
sectors, including the 
renewal of a three-year 
contract with Tesco, covering 
seven distribution centres. In

Mission Statement:  
Create 25% IRR through  
asset realisations and  
value improvement.
Our Investments division  
holds our 49% investment in 
our logistics business Eddie 
Stobart Logistics (ESL).
What is the business strategy?
The strategy is to grow and realise the 
value of our investment portfolio.
What have been the key highlights 
from the last 12 months? 
Last year, ESL traded ahead of 
the previous year and won a 
number of new business contracts 
with high profile customers.
The company has continued to focus 
on its people, with recent additions 
to the executive management 
team bringing further skills and 
knowledge to Stobart Investments, 
thereby supporting future growth. 
Grow value to realise 
at the optimum time
Similarly, further employee investment 
has been made at ESL, with £1m 
spent on a state-of-the-art training 
and services support centre.
Looking to the customers, ESL has 
reorganised its operational structure 
to introduce a more focused sector 
approach. This approach will enable 
business unit directors to focus on 
specific specialist customer needs and 
align services to match customers’ 
strategic objectives, which will 
provide a strong basis to achieve 
growth from existing customers. The 
strategy is also expected to deliver 
increased volumes in attractive and 
complementary markets with different 
profiles of truck utilisation to existing 
businesses, therefore further balancing 
the fleet and improving utilisation. 
In addition, through investments in 
modern warehousing, ESL expanded 
its available space in desirable, well-
placed locations. This increased capacity 
demonstrates the commitment to 
providing a first-class integrated network 
to customers and supports incremental 
revenue and profitability in the future.
What are the targets for 2018? 
Looking forward to 2018, the Stobart 
Investments division plans to maintain 
and grow the value of its investments. 
On 25 April 2017, the Group disposed 
of its 49% investments in Greenwhitestar 
Holding Company 1 Limited and 
Greenwhitestar Finance Limited for 
consideration comprising cash of 
£113.3m and a 12.5% shareholding in 
Eddie Stobart Logistics plc. Eddie Stobart 
Logistics plc was admitted to AIM on 
25 April 2017 and the 12.5% shareholding 
was valued at £71.5m on admission.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Overview of risk identification 
and management
The successful management of risk is a fundamental part  
of Stobart Group’s activities and is critical to the delivery  
of our business plan.
Strategy
Our formal approach to risk management 
is delivered through the application of 
the Stobart Group Risk Management 
Framework. The Framework is a 
defined process for identifying and 
escalating significant risks. It applies to 
the whole Group with the responsibility 
for oversight of the process resting 
with the Audit Committee.
Consideration of our appetite for, 
and tolerance of risk forms part 
of the risk management process, 
in particular when deciding how 
best to manage the risks that are 
identified. Having a robust system of 
internal control with a combination 
of people, process and technology 
controls, helps us to mitigate risk. 
Inherent Attributes of Stobart Group
• Stobart Group is strongly  
process driven.
• A stable long-standing management 
team is in place.
• Operations are predominantly in  
the UK with a well-developed  
business culture.
• Stobart Group promotes a  
‘Just Culture’ which encourages  
open and fair reporting, enabling  
clear lines of communication 
throughout the business.
• Stobart Group works across diverse, 
regulated industries which enable the 
Group to share best practices 
throughout its divisions.
Risk Appetite 
The level of risk considered appropriate 
to achieving our business objectives is 
determined by the Board. The Group 
has no appetite for risk relating to the 
health, safety and welfare of employees, 
customers and the wider community. 
We do have an increasing appetite for risk 
in relation to activities which are directed 
towards creating additional demand 
for our services to drive revenues and 
increase financial returns for the Group.

BUSINESS AREA
GROUPWIDE
Potential Impact
In some areas of the Group there is reliance on a small 
number of customers. Loss of a significant customer would 
impact revenues and profits, and challenge cost models.
 RISK MITIGATIONS
There are strategies in place to secure additional customers in key 
areas to dilute the share of business represented.
Relationship management of significant customers remains a priority, 
with the senior management in each division closely involved.
Significant breach of licence of regulation conditions.
BUSINESS AREA

Potential Impact
A significant breach to the conditions of licence; regulatory 
or operating requirements which could lead to the loss of 
our operating licences or approvals.
This would have a significant impact on the Group’s 
revenues and profits, as activities could be curtailed  
whilst remedial actions were taken.
 RISK MITIGATIONS
We have experienced management teams and integrated business 
systems in place which are designed to ensure that licence and 
regulatory requirements are recognised and fully addressed.
There is a comprehensive internal operational audit programme to 
provide management with independent assurance that requirements 
are being met.

INVESTMENTS
Potential Impact
The Investments division is subject to external changes  
in the market and market confidence, which can have a 
significant impact on asset values and revenues.
 RISK MITIGATIONS
The Group monitors the performance and position of its investments.
Risk Identification and Management
During the year, the Board has reviewed 
the risk management process, 
approving a new Risk Management 
Framework, enhancing risk recording, 
evaluation and reporting measures, 
and implementing corporate and 
Group function Risk Registers. The 
Risk Management Framework, 
as part of the wider governance 
framework, provides assurance and 
confidence to stakeholders about 
the Group’s ability to deliver its 
objectives and manage key risks.
All significant business risks and non-
compliances are measured and reviewed 
at Director level within each operating 
division and business unit, with results 
reported at divisional Board meetings 
as a standing agenda item. The Group 
Board has also reviewed the Corporate 
Risk Register in detail, as part of its 
assessment of the Group’s principal risks.
Business managers across the Group 
own and manage these risks, with regular 
reports keeping the Board fully appraised 
of all current and emerging risks within 
the business, ensuring a consistent and 
controlled approach to risk management.
The Risk Registers encompass health 
and safety, environmental, strategic, 
operational, brand and financial risks 
across the business and operate on a 
defined scoring matrix. Current mitigation 
measures are evaluated and where 
appropriate, additional mitigations 
are identified for implementation. 
Principal Risks and 
Mitigation Controls
Detailed below and opposite are the 
risks that the Board considers to be 
the principal risks to the business. 
The Group’s Director of Health, Safety 
and Compliance is responsible for 
the delivery of a programme of audits 
across the business which are designed 
to give management assurance over 
compliance with procedures and 
controls included in Risk Registers. 29

RISK MANAGEMENT
CONTINUED
The Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a three-year period to 
February 2020, considering the Group’s 
current position and the potential impact 
of the principal risks documented in the 
Principal Risks and Mitigation Controls 
section. Based on this assessment, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period.
In making this statement, the Directors 
have considered the resilience of the 
Group, taking account of its current 
position, the principal risks facing the 
business in severe but reasonable 
scenarios and the effectiveness of any 
mitigating actions. This assessment has 
considered the potential impacts of 
these risks on the business model, 
future performance, solvency and 
liquidity over the period. 
The Directors have determined that the 
three-year period to February 2020 is an 
appropriate period over which to provide 
its Viability Statement as this period in 
the business plan presents a reasonable 
degree of confidence whilst still 
providing an appropriate long-term 
outlook. The Directors have no reason to 
believe the Group will not be viable over 
a longer period.

Underlying EBITDA
1
Underlying Group EBITDA is our key measure of profitability  
for the business and has grown by 16.8% to £35.0m. The  
Energy division has improved underlying profitability in spite of a 
decline in revenue following a customer entering administration. 
Infrastructure profitability increased by £8.4m, following the 
successful disposal of our Speke site. The Aviation division 
made two acquisitions during the latter part of the year, which 
had an adverse impact on profitability due to the seasonal 
nature of the airline industry. 
Central function costs and eliminations have increased by  
18.1% partially due to an increase in the share-based payment 
charge and professional fees.
Depreciation
Depreciation has increased by 11.2% to £9.3m, due to 
investment in processing sites and equipment within the  
Energy division.

Finance costs (net) increased from £1.0m cost to £0.4m income,

Taxation
The tax charge of £1.2m (2016: £1.2m) reflects a negative 
effective tax rate of 14.4% (2016: 12.0% positive). The effective 
rate is lower than the standard rate of 20.0% mainly due to the 
write-off of goodwill and income in respect of the Group’s 
post-tax share of joint venture results being treated as non-
taxable, and the effect of the change in corporate tax rate on 
deferred tax balances.
 
Business Segments
The business segments reported in the financial statements are 
unchanged from those reported in the prior year. The segments are 
Energy, Aviation, Rail, Infrastructure and Investments, representing 
the operational and reporting structure of the Group. The results of 
our aircraft leasing business, Propius, have transferred from 
Investments to Aviation following its acquisition, and the prior year’s 
figures have been restated.
Earnings per Share
Earnings per share from underlying operations were 8.0p  
(2016: 5.0p). T otal basic earnings per share were 2.7p loss 
(2016: 2.7p profit).

The Board has proposed a final dividend of 4.5p per share 
which, subject to the approval of shareholders at the AGM,  
will be payable to investors on the record date of 16 June 2017, 
with an ex-dividend date of 15 June 2017, and will be paid on 
7 July 2017.
During the year, the Group sold 10.1m of its treasury shares for a 
net amount of £15.0m to fund the Propius acquisition. At the 
year end there were no shares held in treasury.

Net assets 387.5 413.7
The net asset position has decreased by £26.2m in the year to 
£387.5m at 28 February 2017, mainly due to the non-cash 
write-off of goodwill arising on the acquisition of Everdeal 
Holdings Limited.
Non-Current Assets
Property, plant and equipment of £326.3m (2016: £218.0m) has 
increased following the acquisition of Propius and assets 
acquired for the new biomass processing sites. The net book 
value of the eight aircraft owned by Propius at the year-end was 
£100.7m. 
During the year £14.5m (2016: £49.1m) of asset investment has 
been made, comprising the cash purchases of property, plant 
and equipment and net advances to biomass plant investments. 
Investment in associates and joint ventures of £59.2m (2016: 
£62.7m) include the Group’s 49% share of the Eddie Stobart 
Logistics business. The reduction is due to Propius Holdings 
Limited being classified as a subsidiary at the year end, 
following its acquisition. Investment property of £3.2m (2016: 
£47.0m) represents the holding of one (2016: four) property.
Amounts owed by associates and joint ventures of £13.4m 
(2016: £13.4m) represents interest-bearing loans to renewable 
energy plant investments in which we also hold equity interests.
Intangible assets of £108.4m (2016: £112.3m) include the 
Stobart and Eddie Stobart brands and goodwill, which 
principally relates to the Energy division. 
Current Assets and Current Liabilities
Current assets include £60.0m (2016: £44.4m) of development 
land assets. Excluding these assets, the net current assets at 
the year-end total £6.7m (2016: £10.3m).

Economic Outlook
Following the UK’s referendum vote to leave the membership of 
the EU, management continues to monitor the implications for 
the Group. The Group and its customers are predominantly UK 
based and though there have been some effects on US dollar 
denominated costs in the airline, this has been partly offset by 
the US dollar denominated assets in the leasing company. The 
Group benefits from diverse assets and sources of income, and 
its entrepreneurial culture leaves it well placed to respond to 
future developments and opportunities.
Post Balance Sheet Events
In April 2017, the Group entered an arrangement to sell and 
leaseback eight ATR 72-600 aircraft. The Group received net 
proceeds of $62.7m (£50.2m) after repayment of existing 
financing in respect of the aircraft of $85.3m (£68.2m), including 
refundable deposits withheld of $3.8m (£3.0m) and $1.0m 
(£0.8m) in rental payments. 
On 25 April 2017, the Group disposed of its 49% investment in 
Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Limited and Greenwhitestar 
Finance Limited for consideration comprising cash of £113.3m 
and a 12.5% shareholding in Eddie Stobart Logistics plc. Eddie 
Stobart Logistics plc was admitted to AIM on 25 April 2017 and 
the 12.5% shareholding was valued at £71.5m on admission.  34

A responsible business
Our credentials in these areas are 
increasingly influencing our ability to 
attract and retain customers, employees 
and investors. This also underpins our 
licences to operate, by strengthening 
our relationships with local communities, 
industry partners and regulators.
Responsible to our People
Our people are our most important asset; 
we aim to attract the right people for 
the right roles and ensure they are fully 
supported to grow and develop within 
our business to reach their full potential.
Responsible Safety
The safety of our people is vital to 
being a responsible business. We 
actively aim to ensure that all Stobart 
employees remain safe whilst carrying 
out their day-to-day activities. This is 
reinforced by our ‘Just Culture’ ethos.
Responsible Environmental Efficiency
Stobart Group aims to continuously 
review and investigate initiatives to 
reduce its consumption of energy, 
waste and water and where possible, 
report our actual and target levels.
Responsible to our Communities
Stobart aims to actively engage with 
stakeholders and local communities 
within all areas of our business 
to provide ongoing support with 
community development initiatives 
and to make a positive contribution

Governance of the Safety Strategy
The safety team oversees, steers and 
challenges the progress of our safety 
performance, and ensures that we 
continue to deliver. Divisional senior 
managers are directly responsible 
for their risk registers and manage 
the actions required to mitigate or 
remove risks within their division. The 
divisional senior managers also identify, 
through continuous monitoring and 
review, where potential new hazards 
could emerge within our business.
Since the year ended 29 February 2016 
there has been an increase in the Group 
AFR. There has been an increase of one 
RIDDOR on Group sites in comparison 
to the previous year. 
17%
reduction in non-RIDDOR  
accidents since the year 
ended 29 February 2016.
Making Safety Risks Clearer
As part of the previous years’ safety 
strategy we introduced the BowTie 
system which is already widely used in 
the aviation industry for risk analysis. 
BowTie is a visual tool which effectively 
depicts risk, while providing an 
opportunity to identify and assess the key 
safety barriers either in place or lacking 
between a safety event and an unsafe 
outcome. BowTie not only identifies the 
controls (or barriers) in place, it also 
looks at control failure mechanisms 
(as escalation factors) and in turn how 
these are managed (as escalation factor 
controls). Based on these considerations, 
insights are gained into the organisation’s 
risk mitigation strategies and therefore 
into the appropriate management of 
safety resources. Using the BowTie 
system, we have carried out assessments 
for the significant risks identified within 
the divisional risk registers, allowing 
us to focus on the effectiveness of the 
control barriers we have in place.

Handling Change
With the aid of Stobart Information 
Management System (SIMS) the Group 
has access to real-time information on all 
incidents and accidents including near 
miss reports. During 2016, data collected 
and analysed identified that Handling, 
Lifting and Carrying was a significant 
underlying cause of workplace injuries.
With this in mind, manual handling 
training company ‘Handling Change’ 
was enlisted to assess the level of risk 
in day-to-day tasks being performed 
in the Energy division. This allowed 
them to provide the division with a 
bespoke training plan. The initial 
training was delivered by Handling 
Change to 140 of our drivers.
In addition to the training being rolled out 
to existing drivers, a DVD was produced 
by Handling Change which will be used 
as part of future induction training for 
new employees and for refresher training. 
Our own in-house driver trainers have 
received training to become ‘In-house 
Champions’ and are able to deliver this 
training and offer advice and support.
Plans are under way to use the same 
approach throughout the Group. 36

Employee Survey
Stobart Group is dedicated to improving 
employee engagement and being an 
employer of choice. During 2016 we 
carried out an employee survey across 
all Group employees*. The survey was 
designed in-house with our Stobart 
Values in mind. We achieved a very 
pleasing overall response rate of 85%.
Included in the employee survey were five 
employee engagement index questions, 
indicating how engaged our employees 
are within their role and business. These 
gave pleasing results too, ranging 
from 78% to 95% strongly agreeing or 
agreeing to four of the five questions 
and 91% of our respondents willing to 
go ‘the extra mile’ for Stobart Group.
* The survey did not include Stobart Air  
as it was not a Group subsidiary at the time.

Mental Health Awareness Campaign
We recognise our responsibility for the 
wellbeing of our people which is why as 
part of our health and wellbeing strategy, 
we decided to join forces with Carlisle 
Mind to design and deliver a mental 
health awareness campaign to our line 
managers and employees. The aim of the 
workshops was to improve awareness 
and understanding of mental health 
issues and what help is available. The 
workshops covered a range of issues 
from how to manage stress, coping with 
grief, identifying depression and how 
to help prevent suicide. Lots of useful 
information on mental health awareness 
and where to seek help is placed on our 
employee portal, for all of our employees 
to access. In total 66 employees 
have attended these workshops but 
more are planned in the future.
Leadership Development
We pride ourselves on continually 
improving our learning and development 
offering. In 2016 we redesigned 
our management and leadership 
development programmes to ensure 
complete alignment within our diverse 
business. Focusing on our two core 
programmes, ‘Developing Effective 
Management’ and ‘Fast Track to 
Leadership’, these programmes are 
designed to enhance the skills of our 
existing managers and leaders and they 
are delivered in-house in a way that 
enables our people to easily apply the 
learning to the workplace. In 2016, 75 
of our managers completed either the 
Developing Effective Management or 
Fast Track to Leadership programme.
Performance Appraisals for  
our Mobile Workers
Annual performance appraisals and 
capability conversations are conducted 
with our mobile workforce. These 
allow employees and managers to 
give and receive two-way feedback 
on performance-related areas.
In June 2016 the Company designed 
and implemented a new annual driver 
appraisal within the Stobart Energy 
division. These appraisals are conducted 
by our Driver Trainers who, prior to 
the appraisal, receive feedback from 
the driver’s Operations Manager and 
Planner. The appraisals are conducted 
at the driver’s place of work whilst they 
are carrying out their daily duties so that 
the Driver Trainers are able to provide 
live feedback on performance and 
also address any issues that the driver 
may be experiencing. Since June 2016 
over 70% of our driving workforce have 
been appraised, with the remaining 
appraisals scheduled to be completed 
by summer 2017. We are pleased to say 
that feedback from the drivers has been 
wholly positive and we are confident 
that this appraisal process will help with 
driver engagement and retention.
For our mobile workers within our 
Rail division, capability conversations 
take place annually to help promote 
and develop behaviours, attitudes 
and skillsets of the workforce. Over 
the last year, these have been 
developed to include our Stobart 
Values and to bring them in line with 
our overall appraisal process.
Onboarding 
Our onboarding process for our drivers 
has been completely redesigned. 
Previously our two-day induction for new 
drivers was predominately classroom-
based. Following a full review, the 
induction has now been extended to 
two and a half days and involves 50% 
practical training. It is important we fully 
prepare our new drivers for their first day 
of driving with our business to ensure 
our high standards are maintained. As 
brand ambassadors, our new drivers 
are inducted and trained in all aspects 
of their role which is brought together 
with a role play scenario of ‘your first 
day in the life of a Stobart driver’.   OUR TOTAL CO

Responsible 
Environmental 
Efficiency
Whilst it is not compulsory for Stobart 
Group to report on emissions of 
greenhouse gases, we follow guidance 
detailed within the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic and Directors’ Report 
Regulation 2013) as we are committed to 
reducing the environmental impact of our 
operations. We regularly review and 
investigate ways to reduce our energy, 
waste and water usage.
1 The Group emissions data has been adopted and prepared using an operational control approach following 
voluntary and mandatory guidance issued by both Defra and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Under this guidance  
the Company is considered responsible for the day-to-day operations of the assets and resource consumption over 
which the business has effective operational control. The data presented represents the businesses consistent with 
those which are included in the Group revenue in the consolidated financial statements. The revenue amount used 
for the ‘CO

Producing Our Own Solar Energy
Our 2016 Annual Report and Accounts 
reported the development of a £2m 
and 3.2 hectare solar farm at London 
Southend Airport. Since the installation, 
the solar farm generated 55.1% of the 
airport’s total electricity requirement.
Following the success of this initiative 
our Stobart Energy division continued 
with our solar developments and gained 
planning permission in July 2015 for a 
5MW solar farm located at our Pollington 
site. The installation of all solar panels 
has now been completed, and work 
to connect these to the National Grid 
is underway. Occupying 12.9 hectares 
the purpose of generating electricity for 
export to the National Grid helps satisfy 
both renewable energy programmes and 
BES objectives. Stobart Energy has also 
incorporated an ecological element into 
the scheme, and opted for the sowing 
of a wildflower meadow between the 
solar cells and the planting of trees and 
shrubbery along site boundaries. Once 
developed, the lack of disturbance of 
this site will encourage the creation of 
a diverse population of flora and fauna 
over the project’s 20-year lifetime.
CASE STUDY 
Stobart Rail supports  
EA Flood Defence
In October 2016 Stobart Group  
joined forces with the Environment 
Agency in a 12-month arrangement to 
transport 40km of temporary barriers in 
preparation for flood events in England.
The Emergency Flood Resilience 
Contract, ‘Delivering Resilience 
T ogether’, has so far seen Stobart 
Group support the Environment 
Agency to combat Storms Angus, 
Barbara, Connor and Doris by 
dispatching over 10.6km of flood 
defences over 5,000 miles. From Blyth 
in Northumberland to Great Yarmouth 
and from York to Redruth, our Stobart 
Rail division has delivered lorry-loads 
of temporary barriers to protect people 
and properties from potential flooding. 
This critical work has supported the 
Environment Agency’s “go big, go 
early” ethos by being prepared to 
defend against excessive rainfall, 
swelling rivers and tidal surges from 
the North Sea.
Sustainable Biomass – Contributing 
to the UK’s Renewable Energy
Stobart Energy continues to grow 
its network of sourcing, processing 
and supplying renewable biomass 
fuel to industry and the energy 
sector whilst acting upon initiatives 
to encourage further environmental 
efficiency and compliance. 
Environmental Protection and 
Resource Use
During August 2016 Stobart Energy 
examined its processing activities to 
reduce the proportion of dust (or ’fines’) 
arising from the shredding and screening 
of wood. Following this review, Stobart

Employee Donation Scheme
On 1 March 2016 Stobart Group 
launched its employee donation scheme. 
This initiative provides all employees 
with an incentive of £50 to become 
more involved in their local community 
or charitable activities. Over the past 
12 months 162 employees took part 
in the scheme, providing £8,100 to 
causes important to our workforce.
Educational
In April 2016 Stobart Group’s Health and 
Safety Department achieved the ‘Most 
Interesting Community Engagement 
Activity Award’ for the Rail Divisions’ 
‘Think Safety, Act Safely’ school 
campaign, at the Rail Media Awards. 
The campaign has been delivered 
throughout the UK, to a total of four 
schools so far, introducing young people 
to the rail industry and highlighting 
the potential dangers of the railway.
Stobart Rail will continue to deliver 
the campaign to the surrounding 
communities in which they work.
London Southend Airport has continued 
to engage with a number of local schools 
and community groups throughout the 
year; children from primary schools 
in Stambridge and Rochford were 
given tours around the airport. EasyJet 
staff also got involved, talking to the 
children about careers in aviation.
Responsible to 
our Communities
Our businesses are part of their 
communities and our workforces are 
drawn from these local environments. 
We actively engage with these 
communities to ensure that we support 
skill and enterprise development to 
promote employment, we enhance 
local community growth and we 
positively contribute to community 
initiatives and fundraising.
Community
On 4 December 2016 London Southend 
Airport launched its ‘Blue Band Scheme’ 
to help passengers with hidden 
disabilities. The discreet blue wristband 
is voluntary for passengers and families 
to wear as a subtle sign to airport staff 
that additional support may be required.
London Southend Airport recognises 
that airports may be a challenging 
environment. All 110 customer-facing 
staff including check-in, security and 
food and beverage employees have 
received in-house training to ensure they 
can help those with hidden disabilities 
to enjoy a better airport experience. An 
informative training memo was also 
circulated to all staff within the airport.
On 21 February 2017 employees at 
London Southend Airport hosted a great 
charity event at which they were able to 
distribute £10,000 of match-funding from 
Stobart Group to 11 much-deserving local 
charities, including the Indee Rose Trust, 
which is based on Canvey Island and 
helps children with brain tumours, and 
the Isaiah Project Southend, which works 
to help the homeless, providing sleeping 
bags and toiletries for the night shelter.
During the year, a team of Stobart 
employees also took part in a Three 
Peaks Challenge to raise a massive 
£3,586 for Macmillan Cancer Support 
and C-R-Y (Cardiac Risk in the Young). 
Those involved climbed and conquered 
Ben Nevis in Scotland, Scafell in England 
and Snowdon in Wales within 24 hours.
Aviation Business Development Director, 
Mike Robinson, visited Chase High 
School for a Business Q&A session 
with students. Mike was also one of 
six judges for the Young Entrepreneurs 
2016, in which High School from 
Rochford competed. The winning team 
of students were invited to a VIP tour of 
the airport. The Cool Aeronautics held 
two events at the airport, demonstrating 
a number of aviation topics to primary 
school students from Leigh and 
Rochford. The Cool Aeronautics are 
part of the Royal Aeronautical Society 
and encourage children to take a keen 
interest in aviation careers. LSA also 
hosted a Lost Souls event run by Blade 
Education in which West Leigh Infant 
School children were taught about 
the history of the airport and its part in 
supporting pilots in WW1 and WW2. 41

Providing long-term, 
sustainable growth
The Board’s primary 
responsibility is to ensure that 
the Group provides long-term 
and sustainable growth for its 
shareholders. 
Good corporate governance assists in the 
promotion of growth by ensuring that there 
is effective authority and accountability 
throughout the organisation. The base 
the Group uses for this is the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (2014 
Code), which sets out best practice as 
to how a company should be run. 
The Directors consider that the Company 
was fully in compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in relation  
to Board composition and Committee 
membership for the financial year ended 
28 February 2017. 
Printed copies of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code can be obtained free 
of charge from the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC Publications) by emailing 
customer.services@lexisnexis.co.uk 
or by telephoning 0845 3701234.
The Group has continued to work 
towards delivering its clear targets for its 
three growth divisions: Energy, Aviation 
and Rail. Ben Whawell took the decision 
to step down from his role as Executive 
Director and Chief Financial Officer of 
the Group to move into the role of Chief 
Executive Officer of Stobart Energy. 
Since joining the Energy Division Ben 
has been providing strong, dedicated 
leadership at a very important phase 
of the division’s development.

28 November 2016 acting as interim 
Chief Financial Officer until 31 May 
2017, bringing more than 20 years 
of experience in senior finance roles 
across a broad range of sectors.
On 3 January 2017, the Company 
welcomed Warwick Brady to the Group 
as Deputy Chief Executive Officer. It 
is intended that Warwick will join the 
Board and become Group CEO and an 
Executive Director following the Group’s 
Annual General Meeting in June 2017. 
Warwick has extensive commercial and 
management experience which will 
be extremely valuable to the Group.

STATEMENTS
The Board Chairman and  
Chief Executive Officer
The positions of Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer are held by 
different individuals in order to provide 
segregation of roles. The Chairman 
is responsible for leading the Board, 
ensuring its effectiveness and looking 
after shareholders’ interests. The 
Chief Executive Officer’s role is to 
implement strategy laid down by the 
Board of Directors and to manage the 
Group and its operations. The Board 
of Directors is collectively responsible 
for the success of the Group.
Board Composition and 
Independence
On 8 July 2016 Ben Whawell stood 
down from the Board and from his 
role as Chief Financial Officer to 
take up his new position as Chief 
Executive Officer of Stobart’s Energy 
division. Ben continued to support the 
Board in his previous role as Chief 
Financial Officer until a replacement 
for the position was appointed.
On 28 November 2016 Mark Adams 
joined the Group as Interim Chief 
Financial Officer. Mark has held senior 
finance roles in a number of listed 
companies, most recently as Interim 
CFO for Pets at Home Group plc. He 
has also held CFO roles at easyJet 
plc, Helphire Group plc and others. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors 
provide a breadth of experience and 
independent judgement to Board 
discussions. Their role is to challenge 
and support the Executive team 
whilst being ultimately responsible for 
overseeing corporate governance and 
protecting shareholder interests. 
Each Director has some specialist 
knowledge that helps provide 
the Board with valuable insights 
and, in some situations, key 
contacts in related industries.
The appointment letters of the 
Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at each 
Annual General Meeting, and at 
the Company’s registered office 
during normal business hours. 
Senior Independent Director 
Andrew Wood is the Senior Independent 
Director of the Group. His role is to:
• Provide a sounding board for the 
Chairman and to serve as an 
intermediary for other Directors 
where necessary.
• Be available to shareholders if they 
have concerns which cannot be dealt 
with by the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer or Chief Financial Officer.
• Be available to other Directors if they 
have any concerns regarding the 
Chairman, or the relationship between 
the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer. 
• Attend institutional and analyst 
briefings, in addition to the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Officer and 
his team.
• Attend sufficient meetings with 
shareholders to obtain a balanced 
understanding of their issues and 
concerns. 
• Meet with the Non-Executive  
members of the Board at least once  
a year without the presence of the 
Chairman or the Executive Directors  
in order to review the Chairman’s 
performance in his role and also the 
Chairman’s relationship with the  
Chief Executive Officer.
Mark will step down from his position on 
31 May 2017, and we will make a further 
announcement regarding the leadership 
of the finance function in due course.
On 3 January 2017 Warwick Brady 
joined the Group as Deputy Group Chief 
Executive Officer. It is intended that 
Warwick will join the Board as Group 
CEO following the Group’s Annual 
General Meeting in June 2017. Warwick 
has previously held the position of Chief 
Operating Officer with easyJet plc and 
has broad business and extensive 
aviation experience at a senior level.
The Board believes that it, and its 
Committees, have an appropriate 
composition and blend of backgrounds, 
skills and experience to fulfil their 
duties effectively and, importantly, to 
comply with the Corporate Governance 
Code. No one individual or small 
group dominates decision-making.
The Board keeps its membership, and 
that of its Committees, under review 
to ensure that an acceptable balance 
is maintained, and that the collective 
skills and experience of its members 
continue to be refreshed. It is satisfied 
that all Directors have sufficient time 
to devote to their roles and that undue 
reliance is not placed on any individual.
As at 28 February 2017 the Board 
consisted of six individuals: a 
Non-Executive Chairman, three 
independent Non-Executive Directors 
and two Executive Directors. Over 
the past year this Board has had 
the appropriate balance and skill 
set to advise on Group strategy. 
The biographies of all members of  
the Board, outlining the experience  
they bring to their roles, are set  
out on pages 42 to 43.

Executive Directors
The Executive Directors are responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the business. They are accountable for 
developing the Group’s strategy and budget for Board approval 
and for monitoring the financial, operational and service 
performance of the Group.
Executive management meetings comprise the Executive 
Directors, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer 
and senior management from across the divisions and are held 
monthly to discuss business activity. 
Company Secretary and Independent Advice
The Company Secretary’s role is to act as advisor to the Board 
on matters relating to corporate governance and, in conjunction 
with the Chairman, to ensure good information flows between 
the Board, its various Committees, the Non-Executive and 
Executive Directors and senior members of the Executive team.
The Non-Executive Directors have access to his advice and 
services in addition to independent, professional advice if 
required (at the Group’s expense).
Matters Reserved for the Board and How it Operates 
In accordance with the Code, the Board has agreed a formal 
schedule of matters requiring its decision. In summary, those 
matters reserved to the Board include:
Group Strategy and Risk Management
• Approval of the Group’s long-term objectives and  
commercial strategy
• Approval of changes relating to the Group’s capital structure
• Approval of changes to the Company’s management and 
control structure
• Approval of the Group’s risk management framework
Financial and Internal Controls
• Approval of all financial statements and results 
announcements
• Recommendation and approval of all dividends
• Monitoring the Group’s operating and capital expenditure 
budget and business plan
• Approval of major capital expenditure or disposals
Board Membership and Committees
• Approval of changes to the structure, size and composition 
of the Board
• Appointments to and removals from the Board
• Approval of remuneration of Board members
• Ensuring adequate succession planning for the Board and 
senior management team
• Approval of terms of reference and membership of 
Board Committees
Corporate Governance
• Review of the Group’s overall corporate governance 
arrangements
• Determining the independence of Directors
• Reviewing reports from the Company’s major shareholders
Board Attendance
The Board has held nine scheduled meetings during the course 
of the 12 months under review and attendance at Board and 
Committee meetings by individual Directors is set out below. In 
addition, there were five special Board meetings to discuss the 
dividend policy, approval of the interim and final dividends and 
the Stobart Energy Incentive Plan (SEIP), approved at the 2016 
AGM. Sub-committees were formed for three of these meetings 
whereby not all of the Board were present. This is reflected in the 
Board attendance table below. 
The agenda and relevant briefing papers are distributed by  
the Company Secretary on a timely basis, usually one week in 
advance of each Board meeting. In March 2016 a new Board 
portal was introduced. The portal is an app which allows the 
Directors secure access to Board and Committee papers they 
need before, during and after meetings. It has a number of 
benefits which include streamlining Board meeting 
management, including the process of collating and distributing 
Board materials. It provides a robust solution which facilitates 
better Board communications for increased engagement and 
effective decision-making while enhancing corporate 
governance.

Directors to challenge performance of the various divisions 
against targets and KPIs, to review transactions which have 
taken place since the preceding meeting and to receive reports 
from the Board’s Committees.
All meetings of the Board and its Committees have minutes 
recorded by the Company Secretary. In the first instance, 
minutes are reviewed by the Chairman of that meeting and then 
tabled for approval at the next meeting. Any concerns raised by 
Directors are clearly recorded in the minutes of each meeting.
Principal Committees of the Board
The main Committees established by the Board are the  
Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and

Information, Induction and Professional Development
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring all Directors receive 
comprehensive information on a regular basis to enable them to 
perform their duties properly. Updates, where necessary, are 
provided at Board meetings and governance updates are 
provided in each Board pack to keep all Directors up to date 
with regulatory requirements.
New Directors receive an appropriate induction on joining the 
Board, typically including meeting members of the senior 
management team and visits to operational sites. All Directors 
have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that 
Board procedures are complied with.
During this financial year, Mark Adams and Warwick Brady have 
undertaken thorough induction programmes that have been 
planned and coordinated by the Company Secretarial team. The 
inductions have involved a number of site visits, introductions to 
the senior management team and advisors to the Group, 
including brokers and PR consultants, and attendance on the 
Group-wide induction course (attended by all new employees).
Non-Executive Director Site Visits
T o further enhance the Non-Executive Directors’ knowledge and 
understanding of the business there have been fully escorted 
visits to the biomass plant at Widnes in April 2016 and to 
London Southend Airport (landside and airside) in July 2016.
Board and Governance Evaluation
An independent external evaluation of the Stobart Group Board 
was conducted from October 2014 to January 2015. The 
findings of the Board evaluation made recommendations which 
we believe have further enhanced the effectiveness of the Board. 
In accordance with the requirements of the Code, an internal 
evaluation was carried out this financial year led by Iain 
Ferguson, Chairman. The outcome of the evaluation was 
discussed at the January 2017 Board meeting and the findings 
and recommendations have been documented and circulated to 
the Board. 
The summary of the review highlighted that generally the Board 
was performing well and the open culture encouraged good 
communication. It was noted that having a stable Board team for 
nearly three years had been helpful in building knowledge, trust 
and effectiveness. 
There were a number of key priorities which emerged from the 
evaluation, some of which are listed below:
• T o develop a medium-term corporate strategy for the Group 
together with a revamped investor proposition, to include the 
development of the Aviation division strategy.
• T o support the Executive team in delivering the ‘Value Wheel’ 
whilst ensuring that strong operational focus is maintained.
• T o maintain strong focus on understanding and managing the 
Group risk profile as the business develops. 
Other more general points where improvements could be made 
were also highlighted. The Board has now allocated timings 
against these priorities and will be working towards them during 
2017/18.
It is our intention to commission an external review towards  
the end of the current financial year ending 28 February 2018, 
details of which will be included in next year’s Annual Report  
and Accounts.
The Chief Executive Officer conducts annual appraisals with 
Executive Directors and has regular one-to-one discussions 
about their performance with them, as does the Chairman with 
the Chief Executive Officer. The Board undertakes a regular 
cycle of training on corporate governance matters.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Richard Butcher, Executive Director, takes Board level 
responsibility for developing and implementing the Group’s 
policy and approach to Corporate Social Responsibility. This 
includes its arrangements for matters in relation to people, 
communities and the environment. 
Governance
Detailed policy statements, including Health and Safety, Equality 
and Diversity, Anti-Bribery and Corruption, Quality, Ethics, CSR, 
Whistleblowing, Learning and Development and the Use of 
Auditors for Non-Audit Services are available on the Group’s 
website at www.stobartgroup.com.
The Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the financial 
year ended 28 February 2017 has been drafted and will be 
reviewed by the Board shortly. Stobart Group is committed to 
ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our 
supply chains or in any part of our business and considers our 
supply chain to be at a low risk. 
The Statement made pursuant to Section 54(1) of the Modern 
Slavery Act 2015 will be made available on the Group website 
once approved by the Board. 
The Board takes an active role in approving any significant 
changes to Group policies and monitors any employees’ 
concerns through our confidential whistleblowing procedure. 
Our policies are managed by our document control team in our 
Safety and Compliance department. Each policy is reviewed on 
an annual, three-year or five-year basis and updated when 
required. All policies are clearly communicated to every member 
of staff via our internal induction programme and on an ongoing 
basis via our intranet portal, Stobart Central.
Whistleblowing Policy
An amended Whistleblowing Policy was prepared and approved 
by the Executive Board during 2016/17. The revised Policy was 
made available to view on the Group website and intranet in 
April 2017. This policy includes increased detail on 
arrangements for employees to raise concerns.  48

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CONTINUED
Shareholder Relations
The Company is committed to 
maintaining good communications with 
its shareholders. Senior executives, 
including the Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, have ongoing dialogue with 
individual institutional shareholders 
in order to develop an understanding 
of their views. These views are 
periodically fed back to the Board. 
During the year, shareholders are 
kept informed of the progress of the 
Group through regular corporate 
communications: the annual 
results announcement, the interim 
statement, trading updates and 
press releases regarding other 
important developments as well as the 
distribution of regulated information. 
T wice a year, general presentations 
are given to analysts and investors 
covering the annual and half year 
results. In addition, members of the 
Board meet with institutional investors 
and analysts on a periodic basis.
The Company Secretary generally 
deals with enquiries from individual 
shareholders. The website 
www.stobartgroup.com contains 
published information and press releases. 
Internal Control and 
Risk Management
The Directors’ responsibilities in 
connection with the financial statements 
are set out in the Directors’ Report 
on page 69. The Board, through the 
Audit Committee, is responsible for 
the Group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board considers risk assessment, 
implementation of mitigating actions 
and internal control to be fundamental to 
achieving the Group’s strategy. Internal 
control gives the Board reasonable 
but not absolute assurance. The 
Board has an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant risks faced by the Group 
and maintains a risk register.
The system of internal control is based 
upon:
• The Board’s overall responsibility.
• The Group’s organisational structure, 
with established lines of accountability, 
as well as clearly defined levels 
of authority.
• Regular, and at least annual, review by 
the Board and the Audit Committee.
• Support by Company policies in other 
areas such as finance.
• Management rather than elimination of 
the risk of failure to achieve strategic 
objectives. Systems of internal control 
can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee and the Board have 
reviewed the effectiveness of internal 
control (including financial, operational 
and compliance controls together 
with risk management in accordance 
with the Code) over the period of this 
report, and to the date of its publication 
and confirm that no significant failings 
or weaknesses have been identified. 
Stobart Group has a robust process of 
internal control. Systems compliance and 
confirmation of corrective actions are 
the subject of a detailed report which is 
submitted to the Board at each meeting. 
The Audit Committee reviews the 
independence of the auditor at the 
interim stage and at year end. The 
Audit Committee has a policy of 
reviewing the status of the auditing 
firm and its lead engagement partner 
after five years from initial appointment 
and each year thereafter.
Stobart Group has a business systems 
internal audit function which reviews 
performance against the agreed 
policies and procedures. The Board 
has recently approved a two-year 
internal audit programme to cover 
financial controls and procedures. 
Further details can be found in the 
Audit Committee Report on page 50. 49

Overview and Role of Committee
The Board has established a 
Nomination Committee which is 
required to meet at least once a year 
or more often if so required, in order 
to make recommendations to the 
Board on the composition, balance 
and membership of the Board.
The Nomination Committee met twice 
during the period. The Nomination 
Committee leads the process for 
Board appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board on 
the structure, size and composition of 
the Board and succession planning 
for Directors and senior executives. 
The Committee’s members are the Non-
Executive Directors. For new potential 
Non-Executive Board members, the 
Nomination Committee meets and 
agrees on a shortlist of potential Non-
Executive Directors. Once this shortlist 
is agreed, the Nomination Committee 
meets and undertakes a formal, rigorous 
and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Directors to the 
Board. Careful consideration is given by 
the Nomination Committee to ensure that 
any appointees to the Board have enough 
time available to devote to the role and 
that the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board is maintained. 
When dealing with the appointment 
of a successor to the Chairman, the 
Senior Independent Director will chair 
the Committee instead of the Chairman. 
When the Committee has found a 
suitable candidate, the Chairman of the 
Committee will make the proposal to the 
full Board and the appointment is the 
responsibility of the full Board following 
recommendation from the Committee. 
During 2016/17 two senior appointments 
to the Group were considered by the 
Nomination Committee. Mark Adams 
joined the Group as Interim Chief 
Financial Officer on 28 November 
2016 and Warwick Brady joined 
the Group as Deputy Group Chief 
Executive Officer on 3 January 2017.
Stobart Group recognises the 
importance of a fully diverse workforce 
in the successful delivery of strategy. 
The Nomination Committee will keep 
under regular review the issue of 
diversity including at Board level, senior 
management level and throughout the 
entire workforce, taking into account 
amongst other things, Lord Davies’ 
review ‘Women on Boards’. Over the 
coming year, and as opportunities arise, 
we will continue to seek candidates who 
have both the appropriate skills and who 
will help achieve the Board’s gender and 
diversity aspiration which is underpinned 
by the Equal Opportunities Policy. 50

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Audit Committee  
(the ‘Committee’) I am pleased to  
present our Audit Committee Report for 
the year ended 28 February 2017.
Having conducted careful reviews,  
the Committee concluded that the  
2017 Annual Report is fair, balanced  
and understandable and advised the 
Board accordingly.
The Committee has written terms  
of reference, which have been updated 
during the year and are available  
on the Group’s website at  
www.stobartgroup.com.
Details of the membership of the 
Committee, the main activities of the 
Committee during the year, the matters 
related to the engagement of the  
external auditor and an overview of  
our risk management and internal control 
framework are set out in this report.  
In addition, we include in the report

Audit Committee Membership  
During the Year
The Audit Committee is chaired by 
Andrew Wood and its other members 
are John Garbutt and John Coombs, all 
of whom have been members for the 
full year. All members of the Committee 
during the year were fully independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Company 
Secretary acts as the Committee’s 
secretary. Andrew Wood is a qualified 
accountant and is considered by the 
Board and the Nomination Committee 
to hold the requisite recent and relevant 
financial experience, having been 
Finance Director of public companies 
for a number of years. Andrew Wood 
is Chairman of the Audit Committee 
at one other public company.
Other Directors, including the Chairman, 
the Chief Financial Officer, and the 
Group’s internal and external auditors 
attended meetings by invitation. At least 
once a year, the Committee will meet with 
the external auditors without the Chief 
Financial Officer or any other Executive 
Directors present. In addition, the 
Chairman of the Committee has regular 
discussions with the external auditors 
outside of the formal Committee meeting. 
Under the terms of reference of the 
Committee there should be three 
members, with a quorum of two. 
Throughout the current year membership 
was three Directors with a quorum 
being present for all meetings. The 
Committee was able to discharge its 
duties adequately at all times and was 
in compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code provision that the 
Committee should comprise at least 
three members for the full year.

STRATEGIC 
REPORT GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Engagement of the External Auditor 
The external auditor is engaged to 
express an opinion on the Group’s 
financial statements. The audit includes 
the review and testing of the systems 
of internal financial control and the data 
contained in the financial statements 
to the extent necessary for expressing 
an audit opinion on the truth and 
fairness of the financial statements. 
KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’) has been 
the Company’s auditor since their 
appointment in September 2012. 
KPMG provides the Committee 
with relevant reports, reviews and 
advice throughout the year, as set 
out in their terms of engagement. 
Non-audit fees charged by the auditors 
in the year were £82,000 compared 
with an audit fee of £333,000. The 
non-audit fee relates to tax advisory 
work and the half year review.
The objectivity and independence of 
the auditors has been reviewed and 
considered to be safeguarded. 
Significant Accounting Matters
As part of their monitoring of the 
integrity of the financial statements, 
the Committee reviews whether 
suitable accounting policies have been 
adopted, whether management has 
made appropriate judgements and 
estimates and also seeks support from 
the external auditors to assess them. 
The main issues reviewed for the year 
ended 28 February 2017 are set 
out below:
Impairment Testing of Goodwill, Other 
Intangible Assets and Property, Plant 
and Equipment
The Committee considered the carrying 
values of goodwill, other intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment 
together with the assumptions underlying 
the impairment reviews. The judgements 
in relation to the impairment testing 
largely relate to the assumptions 
underlying the value-in-use and net 
realisable value calculations for the 
assets being tested for impairment. 
These were primarily the achievability 
of long-term business plans and 
macroeconomic assumptions underlying 
the valuation process, together with 
the appropriateness of the discount 
factors used. This is a prime area of 
audit focus and, accordingly, the external 
auditor provided detailed reporting 
to the Committee. The Committee 
challenged the assumptions made both 
by management and by the auditors, by 
reference to those used in previous years 
and to changes in business performance 
and outlook. The Committee discussed 
the sensitivities to key assumptions. 
The Committee concluded that no 
impairment charges were necessary in 
the year except in relation to the goodwill 
arising on the business combination 
with Everdeal Holdings Limited as 
mentioned in the paragraph below.
In accordance with UK regulations, 
the Company’s auditor adheres to a 
partner rotation policy in line with these 
regulations. This was the fifth year since 
appointment and was the final year before 
the requirement to rotate the Group 
lead engagement partner. A new lead 
engagement partner has been appointed 
by KPMG for the forthcoming year.
During the year the performance of 
the auditor was formally assessed by 
the Committee in conjunction with the 
senior management team. In making 
this assessment the Committee focused 
on the robustness of the audit, the 
quality of delivery of audit services and 
the quality of the auditor’s staff. The 
Committee is satisfied that the audit 
continues to be effective and provides 
an appropriate independent challenge 
of the Group’s senior management. 
Whilst it will continue to review this 
annually, the Committee does not plan 
to carry out another tender process 
this year as the cost and disruption 
that would be caused to the Group’s 
businesses by an audit tender process 
outweighs any benefit to shareholders 
from a more frequent change.
The Committee has a policy for the 
use of auditors for non-audit services. 
The Committee is responsible for 
considering the following prior to 
engaging the auditors for non-audit work:
• the scope of the work to be 
undertaken; 
• whether the skills and experience of 
the audit firm make it a suitable 
supplier of the non-audit service;
• whether there are safeguards in place 
to ensure that there is no threat to 
objectivity and independence in the 
conduct of the audit resulting from the 
provision of such non-audit services 
by the external auditor, the nature of 
the non-audit services, the related fee 
levels and the fee levels individually 
and in aggregate relative to the audit 
fee; and
• the criteria which govern the 
compensation of the individuals 
performing the audit.
In addition to this, the policy states in 
detail a number of additional controls. 
A full copy of this policy is available 
on the Stobart Group website. 
  ACTIVITIES DURING 
THE YEAR
During the year the Committee met 
three times and a summary of the 
main areas dealt with during the year 
are set out below:

by the auditors of the interim 
results to 31 August 2016

internal audit projects conducted 
during the year
– Approval of the audit plan and 
strategy for the year ended 
28 February 2017
– Review of the significant 
judgements and estimates 
applied in preparation of the 
Annual Report
– Review of the Annual Report to 
ensure it is fair, balanced and 
understandable

revised UK Corporate Governance 
Code on risk management, 
internal control and going concern
– Consideration of the terms of 
reference of the Audit Committee 52
Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accounting for Business 
Combinations
During the year the Group acquired 
control of two businesses in which 
the Group had previously held equity 
interests, Everdeal Holdings Limited 
and Propius Holdings Limited. Prior 
to acquiring controlling interests, the 
results of these investments were 
equity accounted. The Committee 
considered the accounting for the 
business combinations, the fair value 
adjustments made, and the presentation 
and disclosures made in the Annual 
Report. The Committee is satisfied that 
it is appropriate to provide against the 
goodwill arising on the accounting for the 
acquisition of Everdeal Holdings Limited.
Investment Property and Assets Held 
for Sale Valuations
The value of property held by the Group 
has reduced significantly over the year 
following a number of disposals. The 
three remaining properties are classified 
as investment property or assets held 
for sale. The Committee assured itself 
that appropriate independent valuations 
had been obtained for the investment 
portfolio and that, where necessary, 
provisions had been made against 
properties held for sale, where it was felt 
that market conditions required them.
Classification of Investments in 
Subsidiary Undertakings, Joint 
Ventures and Associates
The Group holds investments in a 
number of companies and a small 
number of other entities. The Committee 
reviewed the accounting treatment 
of these investments proposed by 
management categorised as either 
subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures 
or associates by reference to accounting 
standards. The Committee is satisfied 
that the accounting treatments 
appropriately follow the levels of control 
or influence available to the Group.
Valuation of Property Inventories
The carrying value of property inventories 
held by the Group has increased 
significantly. Judgements have been 
made in relation to the development 
of these assets. The Committee has 
reviewed these judgements and is 
satisfied that the assets are held at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. 
The Board has established a clear 
organisational structure with defined 
authority levels. The day-to-day running 
of the Group’s business is delegated to 
the Executive Directors of the Company. 
The Executive Directors visit all of our 
operational sites on a regular basis and 
meet with both operational and financial 
management and staff. The Group has 
an extensive programme of employee 
engagement and communication which 
enables Executive Directors to ensure 
that they have a fully rounded, well-
informed and robust view of operations 
and management on an ongoing basis.
Key financial and operational measures 
are reported on a weekly and/or monthly 
basis and are measured against 
forecasts that have been reviewed and 
approved by the Board. Each business 
unit reviews risk and continually updates 
the risk register, ensuring that budgetary, 
strategic and resource capabilities are 
in place to mitigate and manage risk. 
The Board continually monitors the 
Group’s risk register, reviewing in 
detail the principal risks affecting the 
Group’s performance. The risks and 
uncertainties which are currently judged 
to have the most significant impact on 
the Group’s long-term performance 
are set out on pages 27 to 30.
Internal Audit 
The Group’s Safety and Compliance 
team perform audits against documented 
processes. Reports summarising 
the findings and key actions arising 
from the reviews are produced for 
circulation to the Executive Directors 
and divisional management.
During the year, the Group appointed 
an external firm to act as a dedicated 
financial internal audit function, with an 
initial two-year agreed scope. There 
were seven projects completed during 
the year with reports summarising the 
findings and recommendations. A 
summary of the reports is presented 
at each Audit Committee meeting.
Non-underlying items
The Group has a number of material 
items that warrant separate presentation 
in the Consolidated Income Statement 
and a number of these are presented 
as non-underlying. The Committee has 
reviewed the items disclosed as non-
underlying and are satisfied that they 
have been presented in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policy. 
Fair, Balanced and Understandable 
Information
The Committee acknowledges that, 
taken as a whole, the Annual Report and 
Accounts needs to be fair, balanced and 
understandable in order to provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and 
strategy. The Committee advises the 
Board on whether it believes that the 
Annual Report and Accounts meet this 
requirement. In order for the Committee 
to make this assessment it considers 
reports from management received 
during the year that monitor financial 
performance, and at the year end in 
support of the financial statements, and 
also reports from external auditors on 
the findings of their annual audit. Formal 
review processes are in place to ensure 
that the Annual Report and Accounts 
are factually accurate. Following 
a detailed review, the Committee 
concluded that the Annual Report was 
fair, balanced and understandable 
and advised the Board accordingly.
The responsibility statement of the 
Directors in respect of the Annual Report 
is on page 70.
Risk Management and 
Internal Control 
The Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control. The 
system of internal control is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.

Committee Chairman
I am pleased to present our remuneration 
report for the year ended 28 February

Our Remuneration Policy was approved 
at the General Meeting on 24 October 
2014 and came into effect on 
1 November 2014. In accordance with 
the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Group (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2013, we are presenting a 
new Remuneration Policy for approval 
at our AGM on 29 June 2017. During 
the year, the Committee reviewed the 
current Policy and determined that no 
substantial changes are required at 
this time. We are therefore resubmitting 
our current policy with only minor 
changes to shareholders for approval.
During the year the Committee 
reviewed Executive salaries and 
no changes were made. 
Annual bonuses for Executive Directors 
are based 70% on Group EBITDA and 
30% on personal/strategic measures 
and can be up to a maximum of 
100% of salary. For the year ended 
28 February 2017 the Group recorded 
growth in underlying EBITDA of 
16.8%. The Committee also reviewed 
the performance of each Executive 
Director against their personal/strategic 
objectives set at the beginning of 
the year, and determined awards of 
between 95.4% and 98.0% of salary. 
Further details of the annual bonus 
are set out on pages 62 and 63. 
During the year, the Executive Directors 
were granted LTIP awards of 150% 
of salary under the approved 2014 
Long-T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP). See 
page 63 for details of the performance 
conditions and numbers of shares 
awarded. Following discussion, the 
Committee determined to make no 
changes to award sizes for the year 
ending 28 February 2018. Further 
details of the Long-T erm Incentive 
Plan are set out on pages 63 to 64. 
The terms of reference of the Committee 
have been reviewed and updated and 
are available on the Group’s website.
The Committee takes a keen interest 
in the views of all shareholders on 
remuneration and, as Chairman of the 
Committee, I am available at any time via 
the Company Secretary or at the AGM 
to hear your views and respond to any 
questions you may have on this report or 
any aspect of the Committee’s activities. 
During the year, we consulted with major 
shareholders, representing over 75% 
of the share capital, on matters relating 
to the updated Remuneration Policy. 
Shareholders were asked to provide 
their views and any feedback on the 
Policy in preparation for AGM approval.

1.2  Remuneration  
Policy Report
Introduction
This Remuneration Report has been 
prepared in accordance with the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2013, as amended, 
although as a Guernsey registered 
company we are not strictly required 
to do so. The Policy was developed 
taking into account the principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2016 and shareholders’ 
executive remuneration guidelines.
This Policy Report was first approved 
by shareholders at the General Meeting 
held on 24 October 2014. During the 
year to 28 February 2017, the Committee 
completed its triennial review of the 
Remuneration Policy and determined 
to make no substantial changes at 
this time. As such, the Committee 
resubmits this Policy to shareholders 
with only minor changes for approval 
at our AGM on 29 June 2017.
Stobart’s remuneration decision-making 
processes reflect the Group’s objectives 
for good corporate governance and 
our Remuneration Policy is designed to 
support our business vision and help 
drive the implementation of our strategy. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive 
Directors (excluding the Chairman) 
is determined by the Chairman 
and Group Executive Directors.
Full terms of reference for the 
Remuneration Committee, which 
are reviewed annually, are available 
on the Stobart Group website,

Overview
Stobart Group Remuneration 
Principles, Policy and Structure
What are the Stobart Group 
Remuneration Principles?
The key principles which underpin 
our Executive Director Remuneration 
Policy are to pay fairly for performance 
and to help align senior executive and 
shareholder interests. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy also aims to:
• Provide a good balance between fixed 
and variable pay, and between short 
and long-term performance;
• Ensure pay levels take into account 
the skills and experience of the 
Directors, the nature and complexity of 
their responsibilities, and relevant 
comparative market data; and
• Recognise and reward stretching 
performance.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
approved in October 2014 introduced 
remuneration packages for the Executive 
Directors in line with market norms and 
new incentives based on challenging 
but attainable performance targets.

T o reward the achievement 
of short-term strategic 
objectives and motivate 
executives to achieve 
stretching profit goals.
Performance conditions for annual bonus awards will be 
based primarily on a profit measure, initially 70% on Group 
EBITDA.
Vesting of this profit element will be nil at or below threshold 
performance, increasing on a straight-line basis between nil 
and 50% for achievement of target, and on a straight-line 
basis between 50% and full vesting for stretch performance.
The remainder of the award (a maximum of 30%) will be 
based on specific, relevant personal or strategic objectives 
set by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of the 
financial year.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to adjust  
the formulaic bonus outcome to ensure it reflects the 
Group’s overall underlying financial performance, does  
not result in an outcome that is inconsistent with the  
Group’s remuneration principles, and takes into account  
any significant health and safety, environmental, social  
or governance event that materially affects the  
Company’s reputation.
The Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to claw 
back any awards made under the annual bonus for two 
years in the event of material misstatement, gross 
misconduct, miscalculation or risk taking in excess of that 
approved by the Board.
Up to 100% of salary. 56

Long-Term 
Incentive Plan
(Variable pay)
Rewards longer-term value 
creation and aligns Executive 
Director interests with those 
of shareholders through use 
of performance shares.
Awards vest subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions at the end of a three-year performance period, 
based on a combination of relevant performance measures, 
which will include both EPS and TSR. For 2017 awards, 
these two measures will be weighted 50% each.
Each metric will vest on a straight-line basis between 25% 
and 100% between threshold and stretch performance 
levels, with nil vesting for performance below threshold.
Dividends will accrue over the vesting period on shares  
that vest.
If all elements of the Long-T erm Incentive Plan exceed 
stretch performance levels for any grant at the end of the 
three-year performance measurement period, participants, 
i.e. the Executive Directors, will be eligible to receive a 
multiplier of the LTIP award based on the following 
performance levels:
• No multiplier if three-year TSR outperforms the FTSE 250 
Index by less than 15% p.a.
• A stepped multiplier between 15% and 40% p.a. 
outperformance, rising by 0.167x for each additional 5% 
p.a. outperformance.
• A multiplier of 2x (the cap) if three-year TSR outperforms 
the FTSE 250 Index by 40% p.a. or more.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to adjust the 
formulaic level of LTIP vesting to ensure it reflects the 
Group’s overall financial performance, does not result in an 
outcome that is inconsistent with the Group’s remuneration 
principles, does not incentivise any short-term decisions or 
behaviours, and takes into account any significant health 
and safety, environmental, social or governance event that 
materially affects the Company’s reputation.
Following the end of the three-year performance period 
vested shares may be subject to an additional holding 
period of up to two years.
The Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to claw 
back any vested and/or unvested LTIP awards for up to two 
years in the event of material misstatement, gross 
misconduct, miscalculation or risk taking in excess of that 
approved by the Board.
Normal LTIP maximum; face 
value at grant of 150% of 
salary, up to 300% with 
maximum 2x multiplier.
In exceptional circumstances, 
as determined at the 
discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, 
awards may be made up to a 
face value at grant of 200% of 
salary (400% with maximum 
2x multiplier).
Shareholding 
requirements
Aligns Executive Director 
interests with those of 
shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to build a shareholding equal to at least 200% of their annual 
salary within the later of five years of their appointment to the Board or the introduction of 
this guideline.
Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration
Fees
T o remunerate Non-Executive Directors to

The Chairman is paid a fee determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Fees for other Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors. The fees paid comprise a base fee and additional fees for the roles of Senior 
Independent Director, Chairman of the Audit Committee and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.

REPORT GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Notes to the Policy Table
Differences in the Remuneration Policy Between 
Executive Directors and Other Employees
Salaries across the Group reflect the skill, expertise and 
experience of individual staff members. Certain senior 
members of staff are entitled to a bonus based on broadly 
similar criteria as the Executive Directors, i.e. 70% based on 
EBITDA and 30% based on personal/strategic objectives. 
Some are also invited to participate in a LTIP scheme, again 
based on broadly similar criteria as the scheme in which the 
Executive Directors participate. As of 1 May 2017, all 
employees will be enrolled into a new Health Cash Plan 
which includes a range of benefits including discounts off 
routine dental and optical treatment. This is to enhance our 
remuneration offering. All employees are also eligible to join 
the Company auto-enrolment pension scheme where 
contributions vary depending on service or contract.
Changes to the Remuneration Policy
The Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy saw 
significant changes in 2014. The changes to the Policy 
brought remuneration structures broadly into line with 
market norms for a company of Stobart’s size, while 
retaining the capacity to incentivise truly exceptional 
performance. As highlighted in the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman’s statement, a new Remuneration 
Policy will be presented to shareholders for approval at our 
AGM on 29 June 2017. During the year, the Committee 
reviewed the current Policy and determined that no 
substantial changes are required at this time as we believe it 
remains appropriate for retaining and incentivising the 
Executive team. We are therefore resubmitting our current 
policy for reapproval, with only minor updates to:
• Clarify the extent of Remuneration Committee discretion 
(see next section);
• Strengthen malus and clawback conditions by adding 
provisions for miscalculation and risk-taking in excess of 
what has been approved by the Board as well as to 
clarify that malus and clawback provisions can apply for 
a period of two years from the date of annual bonus 
payment or LTIP vesting;
• Update information as required, e.g. performance 
scenario charts; and
• Make it shorter and easier to read.
Remuneration Committee Discretion
This Policy Report permits the Remuneration Committee limited 
discretion in implementing the Policy without needing to refer to 
shareholders for a further vote.
Fixed remuneration elements (salaries, pensions and benefits) 
may be adjusted within the limits set out in the Policy to maintain 
market competitiveness. Pensions may be paid in the form of 
pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement.
Annual bonus performance measures and weightings may be 
adjusted, subject to the limits that no less than 50% will be 
based on profit and no more than 30% on personal and strategic 
objectives. The definition of financial measures used may be 
updated. Each Executive’s personal or strategic objectives, the 
balance between Group and Divisional performance linkage for 
executives with divisional responsibilities and the target 
performance ranges will be selected annually. The maximum 
annual bonus opportunity may be set at up to 100% of salary.
Long-term incentive performance measures and weightings may 
be changed for new cycles, subject to the continued inclusion of 
EPS and TSR. The calibration of EPS performance conditions 
may be altered (e.g. whether cumulative or point-to-point, 
relative to RPI). T argets for outstanding awards may be adjusted 
if events unduly affect the achievability of targets. The calibration 
of TSR may be changed for new cycles prior to grant, provided 
the toughness of the targets is broadly similar. The maximum 
LTIP granted may be set at up to 150% of salary, or up to 200% 
of salary in exceptional circumstances, before the multiplier. The 
length of the holding period on vested LTIP awards may be set 
at up to two years.
The Committee also has discretion:
• Over the application of malus and clawback in the prescribed 
circumstances.
• T o adjust the formulaic bonus or LTIP outcomes to ensure 
they reflect the Group’s overall financial performance, do not 
result in any outcome that is inconsistent with the Group’s 
remuneration principles, does not incentivise any short-term 
decisions or behaviours and take into account any significant 
health and safety, environmental, social or governance event 
that materially affects the Company’s reputation.
• T o determine any additional cash and/or benefits to replace 
awards relinquished by new recruits at a former employer 
under Listing Rule 9.4.2R. Replacement awards will generally 
reflect the value, nature and time horizons of awards 
foregone. The fair value of any buyout will not exceed that of 
the awards being replaced.
• The granting of “good leaver” status, which will generally 
follow HMRC guidance. Awards held by good leavers will 
continue, subject to pro-rating for time and continuation of 
performance conditions.
• The payment of any Director’s legal fees for settlement 
agreements.
Choice of Performance Measures for the Annual Bonus 
and LTIP , and Approach to Target-Setting
Annual bonus measures are selected at the beginning of the 
financial year. EBITDA was selected again for the year to 
28 February 2018 as it is considered the best indicator of annual 
performance for most of Stobart’s divisions. T argets are set in 
line with budget, which is intended to be stretching but 
achievable, and the range between threshold and stretch 
performance is considered annually by the Remuneration 
Committee. The remaining annual bonus is based on specific, 
relevant personal/strategic metrics, which are selected by the 
Board and approved by the Remuneration Committee at the 
beginning of each financial year to reflect the most pertinent 
personal/strategic goals for the year ahead. 58
Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Regarding the LTIP , the Remuneration Committee feels that 
relative TSR continues to be the best measure of the long-term 
success of Stobart Group and that the FTSE 250 T otal Return 
Index remains a suitably robust and relevant benchmark. 
Supplementing this with an EPS measure helps focus 
management on growing Stobart’s revenues and margins, and 
provides a good balance of internal and external and absolute 
and relative measures.
In setting targets for relative TSR outperformance of the FTSE 
250 Index, the Remuneration Committee aims to align the 
vesting schedule of the TSR element of the LTIP with FTSE 
market practice, with threshold vesting of 25% of the TSR 
proportion initially awarded for performance in line with the 
Index, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting initially 
awarded for outperformance of the Index by 10% p.a.
When considering the vesting schedule for the LTIP multiplier, 
the Remuneration Committee also sets targets which are 
designed to incentivise performance beyond upper quartile. 
Note that the multiplier does not apply unless the EPS condition 
is met in full. Three-year cumulative earnings per share targets 
are set based on a range of internal and external forecasts, 
including broker forecasts, internal strategic plan, etc. A similar 
process for target-setting would be applied in the event that any 
additional financial performance metric was included. The 
Remuneration Committee may adjust EPS targets during the 
performance period if it feels that external events outside 
management control, for example changes in tax regime, 
accounting rules and so on, have affected the achievability and 
hence motivational quality of the targets.
Approach to Remuneration for New Director Appointments
The remuneration package for the appointment of a new 
Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms 
and maximum levels of the approved Remuneration Policy in 
force at that time.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee may offer additional 
cash and/or benefits if it considers these to be in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders, up to the fair 
value of the remuneration relinquished when leaving the former 
employer. This would take into account the nature and vesting 
horizons attached to any remuneration forfeited and the impact 
of any performance conditions. T o facilitate this, the 
Remuneration Committee may need to avail itself of the 
discretion provided under Listing Rule 9.4.2R. The Company 
does not intend to use Listing Rule 9.4.2R for any other purpose 
than a buyout at up to fair value. Shareholders will be informed 
of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded 
in respect of the previous role will be honoured.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the Director fees would be set in accordance with the 
approved Remuneration Policy in force at that time.
Service Contracts and Loss of Office Payments
The Remuneration Committee’s policy on service contracts 
includes that they be limited to a maximum notice period of one 
year. All Director contracts comply with this policy.
The Remuneration Committee is also under a duty to ensure 
contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, are 
fair to the individual and to the Group, that failure is not 
rewarded, and that liabilities of the Group are mitigated wherever 
possible. If the Group terminates the employment of an 
Executive Director without giving the period of notice required 
under the contract, the Executive Director would be entitled to 
claim recompense for up to one year’s remuneration as follows:
Notice period 12 months
Remuneration-related  
provisions
Payments in lieu of notice of 
salary and benefits including 
health cover, a company car or 
car allowance, life and health 
insurance and pension.
Payments in lieu of notice are 
not pensionable.
Change of control There are no enhanced provisions 
on a change of control.
In some circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may also, 
at its discretion, pay a bonus to the Director equivalent to the 
amount to which they would have been entitled to, pro-rated 
over the portion of the year that they worked.
Under the LTIP , the default treatment is that any outstanding 
awards lapse on termination of employment. However, in certain 
prescribed ‘good leaver’ circumstances, the awards remain 
subject to performance conditions measured to the end of the 
performance period, and reduced by reference to the portion of 
the period they were employed. The Remuneration Committee 
retains discretion to pay Directors’ legal fees for settlement 
agreements.
For the purposes of this Policy the Committee interprets the term 
‘good leaver’ to follow normal HMRC guidance which will also 
allow them discretion in some circumstances where a Director 
leaves the Company for reasons other than those outlined by 
HMRC but whose performance merits such award as 
determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts for Andrew Tinkler and 
Richard Butcher are dated 21 September 2007.
Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal business hours.
Non-Executive Directors are engaged under letters of 
appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. They 
are appointed for an initial period of one year, subject to annual 
shareholder re-election. Their continued appointment is subject 
to the requirements of the Company’s Articles (74) relating to the 
retirement of Directors by rotation.

Reward Scenarios
The chart below gives an indication of the level of remuneration 
which could be receivable at different levels of performance 
under the Remuneration Policy.
Illustration of Potential Reward Opportunities for the Executive Directors
Assumptions:
Fixed pay = salary + benefits + pension.
Salary levels (on which other elements are calculated) are based on Executive Directors’ salaries as at the most recent review date on 1 July 2017 at which the Executive Directors’ 
salaries were unchanged.
Benefits as paid for year ended 28 February 2017.
Pensions based on a cash supplement of 20% of salary.
Bonuses based on nil payout for minimum scenario, 50% of salary for target and 100% of salary for maximum.
Long-term incentive based on nil vesting at minimum, 25% vesting of normal awards of 150% of salary (i.e. 37.5% of salary) for on-target performance, normal opportunity of 150% of 
salary for maximum scenario without multiplier and normal opportunity of 300% of salary for maximum performance scenario with maximum multiplier.
Views of Shareholders
We are committed to engaging appropriately with our 
shareholders and our aim is to have an open dialogue on all 
relevant matters, including remuneration. Each year there are 
meetings with major shareholders to review the Group’s 
performance and financial position. Executive pay is on the  
table for discussion at such meetings and we believe that it  
is better to do so as part of an overall review that puts pay in  
the context of overall Group performance.
Consideration of Others Such as Employees
We have a comprehensive employee engagement and 
communication programme where knowledge, ideas and 
feedback are shared. Communication is encouraged through 
various methods including our divisional employee forums  
which are led by Executive Director, Richard Butcher. ‘Stobart 
Central’ is an employee intranet site introduced to improve  
the engagement of staff, ‘Your Say’ was an employee survey 
carried out in October 2016, and the popular ‘Tink T alk’  
monthly messages from Andrew Tinkler, CEO, provide updates 
to employees on what’s happening across the business and 
allows all staff to provide feedback on matters important to 
them. Currently there is no formal consultation with employees 
specifically on Board remuneration.
Legacy Arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy includes authority for the 
Company to honour any commitments entered into with current 
or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders 
previously. Details of any payments to current or former Directors 
will of course be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
as they arise. 60

Remuneration Committee Membership
The membership of the Remuneration Committee is determined 
by the Group Board and is confined to independent Non-
Executive Directors and the Group Chairman, with the Company 
Secretary acting as secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
Committee Members
John Garbutt, Chair (appointed 1 July 2014)
Iain Ferguson (appointed 1 October 2013)
Andrew Wood (appointed 1 November 2013)
John Coombs (appointed 1 July 2014)
The above Directors were members of the Remuneration 
Committee when matters relating to the Directors’ remuneration 
for the year were considered.
While no others have rights of attendance or voting, the 
Remuneration Committee may invite the Chief Financial Officer, 
external advisors and the others holding key positions to attend 
some or all of its meetings.
During the year, the Committee also invited the following 
individuals to attend on certain occasions to provide advice to 
the Committee to enable it to make informed decisions:
• Chief Executive Officer
• Chief Financial Officer
• Head of HR
• Kepler, a brand of Mercer (independent advisor to the 
Remuneration Committee)
• Hill Dickinson

the Committee.
Overview and Role of Committee
The role of the Committee is to determine and recommend to 
the Board a fair and responsible remuneration framework for 
ensuring that the Company’s Executives are appropriately 
rewarded and incentivised for their contribution to Group 
performance.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining 
the terms of service and remuneration for Executive Directors, 
senior employees and the Group Chairman, who plays no part in 
the determination of his fees. It also reviews the framework for 
the remuneration for all other employees.
The Committee conducts an annual review of its terms of 
reference and performance. The Remuneration Committee 
evaluation was discussed at the Committee meeting held in 
November 2016 and it was decided this evaluation should also 
form part of the internal Board evaluation which occurred in 
January 2017.
Remuneration Committee Activities During the Year
A summary of the main activities of the Committee during the 
year is set out on page 54.
All members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive 
Directors, as defined under the Corporate Governance Code, 
with the exception of the Group Chairman who was independent 
on appointment.

2 Annual bonus payable in cash for performance over the relevant financial period. Further information is set out on pages 62 and 63.
3 Ben Whawell stepped down from the Board on 8 July 2016 but remains with the Group. Remuneration for 2017 includes pay received in respect of his role as an Executive Director 
from 1 March 2016 to 8 July 2016.
4 Includes base fee of £50,000 plus additional fees of £10,000 for chairing the Audit (Andrew Wood) and Remuneration (John Garbutt) Committees and fulfilling the role of Senior 
Independent Director (Andrew Wood).
The single figure of remuneration for Stobart’s Executive Directors in 2016/17 reflects the Group’s growth in EBITDA of 16.8% and 
achievement of objectives set out in order to progress towards our stated strategic plan.
Salary
Salaries for the Executive Directors are currently £432,600 for 
Andrew Tinkler and £260,000 for Richard Butcher, effective 
1 July 2016.
The Remuneration Committee reviews Executive Directors’ 
salaries annually to ensure that they remain appropriate and 
commensurate with equivalent roles at companies of a similar 
size and industry sectors. Our sector comparator group for pay 
benchmarking in 2016/17 includes Brammer, Costain, Daejan, 
Drax, Electrocomponents, First Group, Flybe, Go-Ahead Group, 
Hansteen, Hill & Smith, John Menzies, Mucklow (AJ), Pennon, 
Shanks, SIG, Stagecoach, UK Mail Group, Wincanton and 
WizzAir. Pay data for these companies is size-regressed to 
provide a benchmark that is relevant to a company of Stobart’s 
market capitalisation. Any salary increases take account of 
general increases across the workforce and the ratio of CEO pay 
to average employee pay and the average pay of the senior 
executive team (see page 64 for details).
Benefits
The Company currently provides fringe benefits which comprise 
standard executive medical cover and death in service cover to 
Executive Directors. Executives are also entitled to a company 
car of a size and type deemed appropriate for the proper 
performance of their duties. During this period, the Executives 
opted to take an additional salary supplement of £20,000 in lieu 
of an equivalent car benefit. The Group does not envisage any 
adjustments to benefits for the financial year ending 28 February 
2018, except as necessary to reflect the market cost of providing 
the benefits described.
Pension
For the financial year ended 28 February 2017, Andrew Tinkler 
opted to receive a cash supplement in lieu of pension. Company 
contributions to a pension plan remained at 20% of salary for the 
Executive Directors for 2016/17. No changes in pension are 
proposed for 2017/18. 62
Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Annual Bonuses
Annual bonuses are based 70% on Group EBITDA and 30% on personal/strategic objectives, and can be up to a maximum of 100% 
of salary for all Executive Directors.
It is the intention of the Committee, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, to disclose actual targets for the annual bonus in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration for the year in which the bonus is actually paid (i.e. after one full year), subject to the Committee being 
satisfied that the information is no longer commercially sensitive when published. Set out below are the actual targets for the 2015/16 
annual bonus, performance against targets for the 2016/17 annual bonus and performance targets set for the 2017/18 annual bonus.
For the annual bonus for the period from 1 March 2015 to 29 February 2016, Group EBITDA performance was measured against 
targets for 2015/16 based on the following sliding scale:
Threshold Target Stretch
Group EBITDA £21.9m £23.1m £26.6m
% of Group EBITDA element payable 0% 50% 100%
The actual adjusted EBITDA for 2015/16 of £30.0m, was ahead of stretch, resulting in bonus payments to each Executive Director of 
70%, in line with their maximum opportunity.
The remaining 30% of the annual bonus opportunity was based on specific personal/strategic objectives set by the Remuneration 
Committee, which included:
Executive Director Personal/strategic objectives for 2015/16
Achievement

STRATEGIC 
REPORT GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
For annual bonuses paid for the year to 28 February 2017, performance targets for the 70% of the annual bonus determined by 
Group EBITDA were set on a sliding scale with no bonus paid for achieving threshold performance, increasing on a straight-line basis 
to 50% of the EBITDA element for achieving target and 100% for stretch. As discussed above, actual targets for 2016/17 bonuses  
are commercially sensitive at this time and will be disclosed, subject to them no longer being commercially sensitive, in next year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration. Actual Group EBITDA performance was £35.0m, resulting in bonus payments to each Executive 
Director of 70% of salary.
The remaining 30% of the bonus opportunity was based on specific personal/strategic objectives set by the Remuneration 
Committee, concerning their key responsibilities in connection with delivering the Group’s strategy. Achievement of these personal/
strategic objectives resulted in bonus payments of 27.0% of salary for Andrew Tinkler, 28.0% of salary for Ben Whawell and 25.4%  
of salary for Richard Butcher.
This resulted in overall bonus payments of 97.0% of salary for Andrew Tinkler, 98.0% of salary for Ben Whawell and 95.4% of salary  
for Richard Butcher. Ben Whawell stepped down from the Board on 8 July 2016 but remains with the Group. The bonus received for 
financial year ended 28 February 2017 is pro-rated based on his Executive Director role from 1 March 2016 to 8 July 2016.
Annual bonuses for Executive Directors for 2017/18 will again be based 70% on Group EBITDA and 30% on personal/strategic 
objectives. Performance against targets and consequent bonus payments will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration. Specific performance measures and targets will again be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration in the 
following year, subject to them no longer being commercially sensitive at that time.
Long-Term Incentive Schemes
The 2014 LTIP was introduced at the AGM on 24 October 2014 and the first grants were made on 1 November 2014 and will vest  
on 1 November 2017. As such, no awards under the 2014 LTIP are due to vest until the next financial year. 
During the year ended 28 February 2017, Andrew Tinkler and Richard Butcher were awarded a grant of performance shares under 
the 2014 Long-T erm Incentive Plan, with a face value equal to a maximum opportunity of 150% of salary calculated based on the 
average share price for the three days preceding the grant date of 127.0p, as set out in the table below.
On 8 July 2016 Ben Whawell stood down from his role as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director to become Chief Executive 
Officer of Stobart’s Energy Division. On doing so he became eligible to participate in the Stobart Energy Incentive Plan (SEIP) and 
relinquished any right to participate in any other LTIP of the Company or any annual bonus scheme following the date of grant. As 
such, Ben Whawell did not receive an LTIP in the 2016 grant of awards. As he continues to be employed by the Group, he will retain 
the benefit of any awards made under the LTIP prior to stepping down from the Board (see page 65 for details of his outstanding  
LTIP awards).

For these awards, threshold and stretch targets for three-year cumulative EPS were set at 20p and 28p respectively. Relative TSR 
targets, for the purpose of both the TSR element and the multiplier, are in accordance with the Remuneration Policy (as illustrated 
below). Both performance measures will be measured over the period from 1 March 2016 to 28 February 2019 (covering three full 
financial years). These awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant on 17 June 2019 and any shares that vest may 
then be subject to an additional holding period of up to two years. Dividend equivalent shares will accrue over this period and will  
be paid in respect of the proportion of shares that vest. 64
Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
For the financial year ending 28 February 2018, the Committee 
intends to make grants of 150% of salary to each Executive 
Director. These awards will vest on the third anniversary of grant, 
following the end of the three-year performance period, which 
will run from 1 March 2017 to 29 February 2020. Any shares that 
vest may be subject to an additional holding period of up to two 
years. The EPS and TSR performance conditions will remain 
equally weighted. Cumulative EPS threshold and stretch targets 
are being reviewed by the Committee and will be disclosed no 
later than the RNS announcement accompanying the grant of 
Directors’ awards, and confirmed in next year’s Annual Report 
on remuneration. Relative TSR targets, for the purpose of both 
the TSR element and the multiplier, are set out in the

Non-Executive Directors’ Fees
During the financial year ended 28 February 2017, the annual 
base fee for Non-Executive Directors remained at £50,000, a fee 
of £10,000 is paid for chairing a Board Committee or fulfilling the 
role of Senior Independent Director, and the Group Chairman 
received a fee of £150,000.
For the financial year ending 28 February 2018, the fees for 
Non-Executive Directors were discussed at a meeting of the 
Chairman and the Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees were last increased in July 2014 and, following a 
benchmarking review, it was determined that the base fee 
should be increased from £50,000 to £52,500 per annum with 
effect from 1 July 2017. Additional fees for chairing a Board 
Committee and fulfilling the role of Senior Independent Director 
will remain unchanged.
The fee paid to the Chairman was reviewed by the Remuneration 
Committee. Based on the time commitment required of the 
Chairman, the Board’s assessment of the Chairman’s contribution, 
and Chairman fee levels for comparable listed companies, the 
Committee determined that the Chairman’s fee be increased to 
£175,000 per annum with effect from 1 July 2017. The Committee 
noted that this was the first fee review since the Chairman was 
appointed in October 2013.

Directors’ Shareholding and Share Interests
Details of the Directors’ interests in shares are shown in the table below. Stobart has a formal shareholding requirement whereby 
Executive Directors are expected to hold shares to the value of 200% of their salary, to be achieved within five years of the later of 
their appointment to the Board or the introduction of this Policy on 24 October 2014. Based on the share price at 28 February 2017, 
Andrew Tinkler has satisfied this requirement. Richard Butcher is still to meet the requirement, but has time within the Policy.

investment returns.
Emissions
Whilst not compulsory, as best practice Stobart Group reports 
on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) as required under 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Reports 
Regulations 2013). The organisational boundaries for Group 
emissions data has been adopted and prepared using an 
operational control approach in line with statutory requirements 
and voluntary guidance issued by both Defra and the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Under this framework the Company 
is considered to be responsible for all emissions and resources 
consumed during day-to-day operations in control of the 
business. This is consistent with the structure of the Company’s 
consolidated financial statements. Stobart Group emissions 
data is shown in the table below. This includes both absolute 
and intensity tonnes of CO
2
e, with a financial intensity measure 
based on ‘tonnes per £m revenue’. T otal Group CO
2
 emissions 
for the year to 28 February 2017, were 27,321 tonnes CO

Stobart People
Stobart Group recognises that our people are key to the 
continued success of our business. Through the continued 
work on our people strategy, underpinned by our Stobart 
Values, we aim for our employees to feel motivated and 
engaged in their job roles and with the continued growth 
of our business. We pride ourselves on nurturing and 
growing our own talent within the business by ensuring 
that all employees are given equal opportunities to reach 
their full potential regardless of their race, sex, religion, 
belief, age, sexual orientation or disability. We encourage 
contributions from our diverse community of employees 
and actively oppose all forms of unlawful discrimination. 
As a company, we are also committed to ensuring that our 
employees have a healthy work-life balance and to assist with 
this we have our family-friendly policies and procedures formed 
around flexible working, capability, maternity leave, paternity 
leave and shared parental leave. 
Our people strategy is centred on employee engagement and 
over the last 12 months Stobart Group has taken a number 
of positive steps to ensure that, wherever possible, our 
employees are absorbed in their job role and are enthusiastic 
about their work and the success of our business. In order 
to establish our current level of employee engagement, in 
October 2016 we carried out an employee survey with all 
employees and we received a very pleasing overall response 
rate of 85%. Within this survey there were five employee 
engagement index questions which gave a very pleasing 
average score of 87%. This confirms that, overall, our 
employees are engaged with Stobart Group. However, we 
do not rest on our laurels and following the survey our line 
managers have been meeting with their teams to gain further 
feedback and compile action plans on how we can improve 
things even further. Our next steps and priorities for 2018 can 
be found in the People section of this report on page 36.

STATEMENTS
Results and Dividends
The financial statements set out the results of the Group for the 
year ended 28 February 2017 and are shown on pages 79 to 
114. In June 2016 the Board proposed a revised dividend policy 
which increased the level and frequency of dividend payments 
to reflect the cash generation of the Group. The policy was 
approved and the first quarterly dividend payment under the 
new policy of 3p per share was paid on 7 October 2016. Further 
interim dividends were declared by the Board on 8 December 
2016 and paid to shareholders on 20 January 2017 and declared 
on 2 March 2017 and paid to shareholders on 7 April 2017.
Subject to shareholders’ approval at the AGM to be held on 
Thursday 29 June 2017 at 12.00pm, at the St Pierre Park Hotel, 
Rohais, St Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 1FD, a final dividend of 
4.5p per share will be paid on 7 July 2017 to shareholders on the 
register at 16 June 2017. The ex-dividend date is 15 June 2017.
Directors
Biographies of the Board of Directors are shown on pages 42  
to 43.
On 8 July 2016, Ben Whawell, Chief Financial Officer, stepped 
down from the Board following his change of role to Chief 
Executive Officer of Stobart Energy. This change of focus will 
provide the Energy division with strong, experienced, dedicated 
leadership during the next two years of growth and development 
of this business.
On 3 January 2017, Warwick Brady joined the Group as Deputy 
Group Chief Executive Officer. It is intended that Warwick will join 
the Board as Group CEO following the Group’s Annual General 
Meeting in June 2017. Warwick has previously held the position 
of Chief Operating Officer with easyJet Plc and has broad 
business and extensive aviation experience at a senior level.
Andrew Tinkler will step down as Group CEO after the AGM but 
will continue as an Executive Director and will also chair a new 
value creation unit, Stobart Capital.
Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
The Group maintains an appropriate level of Directors’ and 
Officers’ insurance whereby Directors are indemnified against 
liabilities to third parties to the extent permitted by Guernsey 
Company Law.
Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual financial 
statements in accordance with applicable Guernsey Law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards applicable in the 
EU. Our Guernsey registration dates back to January 2002, the 
days of the Westbury Property Fund. We have looked at options 
to reregister in the UK and have found it to be too complicated 
and costly to enact at this time. Guernsey Company Law 
requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period and are in accordance with applicable laws.
In preparing those financial statements the Directors are 
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and apply them 
consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent.
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern  
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group  
will continue in business.
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements.
Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies (Guernsey) 
Law 2008. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention of fraud and other irregularities.
The Board and senior executives of the Group are accountable 
to the shareholders and communicate with them on a regular 
basis in a number of ways. Communication methods and 
channels include:
• Annual general and extraordinary meetings.
• Announcements on the London Stock Exchange.
• Regular briefings on the Group’s website.
• Bi-annual presentations to institutional shareholders.

Share Capital
Details of the authorised and issued share capital and 
reserves of the Company are shown in note 27 to the 
financial statements. The share capital of Stobart Group 
Limited at the year end was made up of 354,328,831 ordinary 
shares of 10p. The ordinary shares are listed on the London 
Stock Exchange. On 18 November 2016, the Company 
sold 10,081,778 treasury shares at 155p per share. At 
28 February 2017 the Company held no treasury shares.
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with factors 
likely to affect its future performance and position, are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 41 and the 
financial position of the Group. Its cash flows and funding 
are set out in the Financial Review on pages 31 to 33.
In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes 
details of the Group’s loans and borrowings at the year end 
together with the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital, its financial risk management 
objectives, details of its financial instruments and its 
exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group actively 
manages its short and long-term funding requirements 
through various forecasting procedures (see note 22).
The Group has considerable financial resources, significant 
property assets and investments and contracts with a number 
of customers and suppliers. The financial forecasts show that 
borrowing facilities are adequate such that the Group can 
operate within these facilities and meet its obligations when 
they fall due for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, 
the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully. After making enquiries, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for at least twelve months. Accordingly, the financial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Responsibility Statement of the Directors in respect of  
the Annual Report and Group Financial Statements
The Directors confirm to the best of their knowledge that:
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group.
• The Annual Report includes a fair view of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that the Group faces.
• The Directors consider the Annual Report and Accounts 
taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable 
and contain the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess and provide the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
• A robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model,  
future performance, solvency and liquidity has taken place.
Auditor
Resolutions to reappoint KPMG LLP as auditor of the Company 
and for the approval of its remuneration are to be proposed at 
the 2017 AGM.
The Directors who held office at the date of the approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s 
auditor is unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps 
that he ought to have taken as Director to make himself aware  
of any relevant audit information and establish that the Group’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
By order of the Board.

71 2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Impairment of goodwill, 
intangible assets and property 
plant and equipment
 Goodwill £59.0 million (2016:
£59.0 million)
 Intangible assets £49.3 million
(2016: £53.3 million)
 Property, plant and equipment
(“PPE”) £326.3 million (2016:
£218.0 million)
Refer to page 51 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 86 
(accounting policy) and pages 99 
and 102-103 (financial 
disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
Determining the recoverable amount 
for each cash-generating unit (“CGU”) 
requires the Directors to make 
judgements over certain key inputs in 
the discounted cash flow models. 
These include revenue and operating 
cost cash flows, discount factor and 
long term growth rate assumptions. In 
particular, the following areas contain 
significant risk due to the inherent 
uncertainty in future forecasting:
 Passenger numbers and income per
passenger at London Southend
Airport (“LSA”);
 Contract revenue and profitability
within the Energy business;
 External revenue within the Rail
business; and
 Expected future cash flows from
the Eddie Stobart brand asset.
Our procedures included:
— Historical comparison: We assessed the
accuracy of the Group’s historical forecasts 
by comparing to actual results and, where 
relevant, factored this into our sensitivity 
analysis; 
— Benchmarking assumptions: We 
assessed the revenue and operating cost 
cash flows and long term growth rate 
inputs to the Group’s forecasts to data 
internal and external to the Group. This data 
included signed contracts, status of 
discussions with potential customers and 
actual profitability achieved on current 
volumes;
— Our sector experience: We involved our 
own corporate finance specialists to 
critically assess the discount factors applied 
by the Group; 
— Sensitivity analysis:, We performed 
several scenario based sensitivity analysis 
for each CGU to reflect the risk that the 
Group’s assumptions would not be met. 
For each scenario considered, we assessed 
the remaining headroom between 
recoverable amount and carrying amount; 
and
— Assessing transparency: We considered 
the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of impairment testing, and whether 
disclosures in relation to the sensitivity of 
the outcome of the impairment 
assessment to changes in key assumptions 
properly reflected the risks inherent in the 
valuations.

The risk Our response
Classification and valuation of 
investments in subsidiaries,

 £59.2 million (2016: £62.7
million)
Refer to page 52 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 90 
(accounting policy) and pages 
100-101 (financial disclosures).
Accounting treatment
The Group holds investments in a 
number of investees. The risk of 
inappropriate classification of an 
investment as a subsidiary, associate or 
joint venture, both on acquisition or in 
subsequent reporting periods, can have 
a material effect on the financial 
statements and involves judgement as 
to whether the Group controls the 
investee, in particular where the Group 
ownership interest is not a decisive 
factor. Although the risk of incorrect 
classification is lower in the periods 
subsequent to initial investment, there 
were changes during the year to facts 
and circumstances and to the Group’s 
holdings that may mean previous 
conclusions are no longer appropriate.
Forecast-based valuation
The risk of inappropriate valuation of 
investments in associates and joint 
ventures arises as the Group’s 
assessment of realisable value will be 
dependent on future trading 
performance of each individual 
investment, and hence on the Group’s 
estimates of the likely future cash 
flows of the underlying investee, 
repayment of loan balances and 
disposal value. 
The assessed level of risk has reduced 
since the prior year following the 
acquisitions of 100% interests in 
Propius Holdings Limited and Everdeal
Holdings Limited that result in those 
investees being wholly-owned 
subsidiaries by year-end, and the partial 
disposal post year-end of 
Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 
Limited and Greenwhitestar Finance 
Limited which provides evidence of the 
investment’s valuation.
Our procedures included:
— Accounting analysis: We reviewed the 
Group’s historical accounting analysis in 
conjunction with our historical examination
of legal investment documents that 
determined the key terms, including rights 
of the investors, terms of shareholders’ 
agreements, termination provisions, 
governance structures and profit-sharing 
arrangements. We then considered 
whether any changes had occurred since 
the prior period which would warrant a 
change in classification;
— Comparing valuations: To evaluate the 
Group’s estimates, we assessed the 
investee’s recent performance by 
reviewing the most recent audited financial 
statements and management accounts at 
the year end date. We also considered 
relevant external indicators over valuation, 
including offers for sale and 
announcements in respect of future 
transactions, and assessed underlying cash 
flow models of certain investments; and
— Assessing transparency: We have 
considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the classification 
and valuation of investments in 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.

Refer to page 52 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 89 
(accounting policy) and pages 
101, 103 and 104 (financial 
disclosures).
Accounting treatment
The Group has a significant property 
portfolio. The classification of 
properties as own use, investment 
property, held for sale (“HFS”) or 
inventory is based on how the property 
is initially, and subsequently, used and 
intentions for future use or disposal, 
which can change periodically, leading 
to a risk that properties may not be 
appropriately classified.  
For properties classified as inventory, 
the net realisable value is based on the 
intended development and future sales 
of these properties. 
Subjective valuation
The valuation of investment property, 
assets HFS and inventory requires 
significant judgement and estimation 
around market pricing, demand and 
timing of development or disposal. The 
Directors also exercise judgement in 
choosing the most appropriate 
valuation methodology, which contains 
a mix of independent valuation of 
properties, internal value in use and net 
realisable value calculations, supported 
by external assumptions where 
applicable, for own use properties and 
inventory.
The assessed level of risk has 
increased during the year as, due to the 
continued strategy of the Group to 
dispose of its non-core assets, plans 
have started to crystallise. This increase 
in risk is primarily attributed to the 
Widnes and Runcorn development land 
inventory.
Our procedures included:
— Tests of details: We analysed the 
classification of each significant asset 
against its specific actual and intended use 
by making inquiries of Directors, inspecting 
development plans and proposals and 
evaluating communication with external 
parties. This included an assessment of 
any changes to the actual and intended use 
compared with the prior period;
— Assessing valuer’s credentials: 
Investment property was subject to an 
independent valuation by an external valuer
engaged by the Group. We evaluated the 
competence, capabilities and objectivity of 
this external valuer;
— Comparing valuations: For HFS 
properties we compared the carrying 
amount to the value at which the 
properties are currently being marketed for 
sale and expected to be realised;
— Sensitivity analysis: We performed 
sensitivity analysis in respect of key 
assumptions such as the level of rental 
income and exit yields underlying the 
calculation of the expected sales proceeds 
and the expected level of capital 
expenditure in developing the asset;
— Our sector experience: We utilised our 
own real estate specialists, primarily for 
inventory and investment property assets, 
to challenge the appropriateness of the 
assumptions and valuation methods used 
by the Directors and the external valuer, 
comparing the Group’s assumptions to 
externally derived data as well as to our 
own assessment in relation to yield rates, 
on a geographical and property type basis; 
and
— Assessing transparency: We have 
considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the classification 
and valuation of investment property, HFS 
properties, own use properties and 
inventories to confirm that the key 
judgements taken in arriving at the 
appropriate classification and valuation are 
adequately disclosed.

The risk Our response
Accounting for acquisitions
 Everdeal Holdings Limited:
(consideration to obtain
control: £0.6m; goodwill
acquired: £28.3m)
 Propius Holdings Limited
(consideration to obtain
control: £11.8m; gain on
acquisition: £1.3m)
Refer to page 52 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 85 
(accounting policy) and page 93 
(financial disclosures).
During the year the Group acquired
controlling interests in Everdeal
Holdings Limited and Propius Holdings 
Limited, which were previously an 
associate and a joint venture 
respectively. These acquisitions have 
had a material impact on the financial 
statements, resulting in goodwill on 
acquisition of Everdeal Holdings 
Limited, which was subsequently 
impaired in full at year end, and a gain 
on acquisition of Propius Holdings 
Limited, which has been recognised in 
the income statement.
Accounting treatment
In assessing control, judgement was 
required in determining the ability of 
the other shareholders to restrict the 
Group’s ability to control the investee 
through previously held shareholder 
agreements and therefore the date at 
which the group gained control of the 
investee.
Accounting treatment
The Everdeal Holdings Limited and 
Propius Holdings Limited transactions 
involved a common other shareholder 
and were viewed by the Directors as 
being commercially linked transactions. 
Consequently, there is a risk that the 
transactions should be accounted as 
one for accounting purposes, resulting 
in a different allocation of consideration 
and goodwill.
Forecast-based valuation
Significant judgement is required in 
respect of the completeness and 
accuracy of fair value adjustments, 
recognition and valuation of goodwill 
and other intangible assets. The focus 
was on fair value adjustments 
pertaining to assets in Propius Holdings 
Limited and completeness of liabilities 
in Everdeal Holdings Limited.
Our procedures included:
— Accounting analysis: We reviewed each 
acquisition’s sale and purchase 
agreements. We assessed the factors 
surrounding control including reviewing any 
previous shareholder agreements to 
understand the rights that remaining non-
controlling interests held. We assessed 
whether, and at what point, control was 
obtained based on our consideration of 
these factors. We compared our 
assessment to that of the Directors;
— Comparing valuation: In respect of the 
acquisition of Propius Holdings Limited, we 
assessed the fair value adjustments in 
respect of the aircraft and loans by 
reviewing external valuations and market 
data;
— External confirmation: In respect of the 
acquisition of Everdeal Holdings Limited, 
we assessed the completeness of 
provisions by comparing to legal 
confirmations;
— Our sector experience: In respect of both 
acquisitions, we applied our knowledge of 
the business and industry to evaluate the 
completeness and accuracy of fair value 
adjustments in respect of intangible assets 
and contingent liabilities;
— Accounting analysis: We assessed 
whether the acquisitions are to be 
considered to be one transaction by 
analysing the facts and circumstances of 
the acquisitions against applicable 
accounting guidance. We also reviewed 
the goodwill acquired in respect of 
Everdeal Holdings Limited and the gain on 
acquisition in respect of Propius Holdings 
Limited and assessed whether, due to the 
inherent commercial link between these 
acquisitions, the goodwill was allocated 
correctly. We also challenged whether the 
impairment of the Everdeal Holdings 
Limited goodwill was appropriate given this 
occurred in the same period as the 
acquisition, by obtaining and understanding 
the basis for the impairment calculations; 
and
— Assessing transparency: We have 
considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the acquisitions, 
including the presentation of the impairment 
of goodwill in respect of Everdeal Holdings 
Limited and the gain on acquisition in respect 
of Propius Holdings Limited.

million (2016: £8.4 million)
Refer to page 52 (Audit

Presentation appropriateness
The Group has a number of material 
income statement items that the
Directors have separately presented in
the income statement and a number of 
these are presented as non-underlying 
activities.
Whilst this is not prohibited, 
inappropriate use of this presentation, 
or a lack of clear explanation or 
reconciliation to relevant GAAP 
measures, can distort the financial 
results for the year or result in difficulty 
understanding the true performance of 
the business.
Our procedures included:
— Assessing application: We held detailed 
discussions with the Group to understand 
the nature of each item and whether those 
items would be more appropriately 
presented as underlying. We obtained 
external evidence, such as a sample of 
invoices, in respect of the items to verify 
that they matched the description of the 
non-underlying items. We also considered 
whether the accounting policy had been 
applied consistently with prior periods;
— Assessing balance: We considered 
whether the presentation of items as 
underlying or non-underlying was a fair and 
balanced representation of the financial 
results; and
— Assessing transparency: We reviewed 
the narrative reporting contained in the 
Annual Report and assessed whether 
references to non-GAAP measures could 
be appropriately understood by reference 
to reconciliations of non-GAAP measures 
to relevant GAAP measures. Furthermore
we have considered the adequacy of the 
Group’s accounting policy disclosures in 
respect of the classification of items as 
non-underlying.

76  3. Our application of materiality and an
overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements 
as a whole was set at £1.2m, determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Group revenue, of 
which it represents 0.93% (2016: 0.79%). We 
consider Group revenue to be the most 
appropriate benchmark as it provides a more 
stable measure year-on-year than Group profit 
before tax, or other alternatives, in particular given 
the early stage of the lifecycle of the Group’s 
main trading divisions, and the volatility of 
profits/losses from property transactions and 
revaluations.
We reported to the Audit Committee any 
corrected or uncorrected misstatements 
exceeding £50,000, in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
The Group team performed full scope audits for 
group purposes on four (2016: six) of the Group’s 
nine (2016: seven). The remaining five (2016: one) 
components were subject to full scope audits for 
group purposes by KPMG component auditors, of 
which two (2016: none) included members of the 
Group team. The Group team instructed 
component auditors as to the significant areas to 
be covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported back. 
The Group team determined the materiality for 
each component to be £750,000, having regard to 
the mix of size and risk profile of the group across 
the components. 
The components within the scope of our work 
accounted for the percentages illustrated 
opposite.
For the components not audited by the Group 
audit partner nor members of the group team, 
video and telephone conference meetings were 
held at the planning stage to assess and 
communicate the audit risks and strategy. 
Similar meetings were held at the completion 
stage, where the findings reported to the Group 
team were discussed in more detail, and any 
further work required by the Group team was 
then performed by the component auditor. For 
components that did not involve the Group 
team, these meetings also involved a remote 
review of the significant risk areas contained 
within the electronic audit file.

Refer to page 52 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 85

(financial disclosures).
Presentation appropriateness
The Group has a number of material 
income statement items that the
Directors have separately presented in
the income statement and a number of 
these are presented as non-underlying 
activities.
Whilst this is not prohibited, 
inappropriate use of this presentation, 
or a lack of clear explanation or 
reconciliation to relevant GAAP 
measures, can distort the financial 
results for the year or result in difficulty 
understanding the true performance of 
the business.
Our procedures included:
— Assessing application: We held detailed 
discussions with the Group to understand 
the nature of each item and whether those 
items would be more appropriately 
presented as underlying. We obtained 
external evidence, such as a sample of 
invoices, in respect of the items to verify 
that they matched the description of the 
non-underlying items. We also considered 
whether the accounting policy had been 
applied consistently with prior periods;
— Assessing balance: We considered 
whether the presentation of items as 
underlying or non-underlying was a fair and 
balanced representation of the financial 
results; and
— Assessing transparency: We reviewed 
the narrative reporting contained in the 
Annual Report and assessed whether 
references to non-GAAP measures could 
be appropriately understood by reference 
to reconciliations of non-GAAP measures 
to relevant GAAP measures. Furthermore
we have considered the adequacy of the 
Group’s accounting policy disclosures in 
respect of the classification of items as 
non-underlying.

STATEMENTS 4. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we 
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation 
to:
— the Directors’ statement of viability on page 30, 
concerning the principal risks, their management, and, 
based on that, the Directors’ assessment and 
expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation 
over the three years to 28 February 2020; or
— the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters
on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified other information in the Annual 
Report that contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
— we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider that the Annual 
Report and financial statements taken as a whole is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
— the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee. 
Under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
— the Company has not kept proper accounting records; 
or  
— proper returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
— the financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records; or  
— we have not received all the information and 
explanations, which to the best of our knowledge and 
belief are necessary for the purpose of our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part 
of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 44 to 48 
relating to the company’s compliance with the eleven 
provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities. 
Scope and responsibilities
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 70, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of Group financial statements which give a true 
and fair view.  Our responsibility is to audit, and express an 
opinion on, the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and international Standards of Auditing (UK and 
Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply with the UK 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of an audit of financial statements performed in 
accordance with ISAs (UK and Ireland)
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is 
provided on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeother2014.  This report is made 
subject to important explanations regarding our responsibilities, 
as published on that website, which are incorporated into this 
report as if set out in full and should be read to provide an 
understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we have 
undertaken and the basis of our opinions.
The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe 
our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with section 262 of the Companies 
(Guernsey) Law 2008 and, in respect of the reporting as if the 
Company were required to comply with the Listing Rules 
applicable to companies incorporated in the UK, on terms that 
have been agreed. Our audit work has been undertaken so that 
we might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and, in 
respect of the reporting as if the Company were required to 
comply with the Listing Rules applicable to companies 
incorporated in the UK, on terms that have been agreed, and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 28 FEBRUARY 2017
1 Accounting Policies of Stobart Group Limited
Basis of Preparation and Statement of Compliance
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of 
the financial statements are set out below. The policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
These Group financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations) as adopted by the European 
Union (‘adopted IFRSs’).
The financial statements of the Group are also prepared in 
accordance with the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008.
Stobart Group Limited is a Guernsey registered company. 
The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London  
Stock Exchange.
Measurement Convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis 
except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair 
value: derivative financial instruments and investment property. 
Non-current assets and assets held for sale are stated at the 
lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to 
affect its future performance and position, are set out in the  
Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 10 to 11 and the financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows and funding are set out in  
the Financial Review on pages 31 to 33.
Note 22 on page 104 of the financial statements includes details 
of the Group’s loans and borrowings at the year end together  
with the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of  
its financial instruments and its exposure to credit risk and 
liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources, together  
with contracts with a number of customers and suppliers. The 
financial forecasts show that the Group’s remaining borrowing 
facilities are adequate such that the Group can operate within 
these facilities and meet its obligations when they fall due for at 
least 12 months.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
the financial statements have been prepared on a going  
concern basis.
Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of  
the previous financial year except as follows:
a)  New Standards, Amendments to Existing Standards and 
Interpretations to Existing Standards Adopted by the Group
 Amendments arising from the Annual Improvement Project 
2012–2014 were endorsed by the EU for periods commencing 
on or after 1 January 2016. There were separate transitional 
provisions for each amendment. The adoption of the 
amendments did not have any material impact on the financial 
position or performance of the Group.
b) New Standards and Interpretations Not Applied
 The following standards and amendments have an effective 
date after the date of these financial statements:
International Accounting 
Standards and 
amendments (IAS/IFRSs)
Effective for accounting 
periods commencing 
 on or after
Proposed adoption  
in the year ending
IFRS 9: Financial 
Instruments 1 January 2018 28 February 2019
IFRS 15: Revenue 
from Contracts with 
Customers 1 January 2018 28 February 2019
IFRS 16: Leases 1 January 2019 29 February 2020
Annual Improvement 
Project 2014–2016 1 January 2017 28 February 2018
IFRS 15: The Group is in the process of analysing the impact of 
this standard, however, the impact has yet to be quantified. 
IFRS 16: Leases was issued in January 2016 and will have a 
significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements although, given the timing of the issue of this standard, 
at this stage it has not been practicable to quantify the full effect 
this standard will have on the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements upon transition. IFRS 16, with certain exceptions, 
requires the Group, where the Group is a lessee, to recognise 
right of use assets and lease liabilities for all leases, there no 
longer being a distinction between operating and finance leases 
for lessees. Finally, the profile of the Group Consolidated Income 
Statement impact for items previously accounted for as operating 
leases is likely to change for the Group, where the Group is a 
lessee, with a higher periodic expense in the earlier periods of a 
lease. This standard is likely to have a significant impact on the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated 
Income Statement presentation and measurement. A project to 
oversee the implementation of this standard is in progress.
The adoption of all the other standards, amendments and 
interpretations is not expected to have a material effect on the net 
assets, results and disclosures of the Group. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue
Revenue for services rendered by Stobart Aviation and the 
transport element of the Stobart Energy business segments is 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on the delivery 
of those services, based on the proportion of the total delivered 
at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date. It is 
recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, net of returns, contracted trade discounts, volume 
rebates and VAT. The principal sources of revenue within the  85

STRATEGIC 
REPORT GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Aviation division are aviation income, retail and catering income, 
surface access income and fuel sales income.
Revenue from Stobart Infrastructure and the supply element of the 
Stobart Energy business segment is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable, net of returns, contracted trade discounts, volume 
rebates and VAT. Revenue is recognised when significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, 
recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs 
and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no 
continuing management involvement with the goods and the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably. If it is probable that 
contracted discounts will be granted and the amount can be 
measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction 
of revenue as the sales are recognised.
Stobart Infrastructure also recognises rental income from 
investment property. This revenue is recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives granted are 
recognised as an integral part of the total rental income, over the 
term of the lease.
Stobart Rail contract revenue includes the initial amount agreed 
in the contract plus any variations in contract work, claims and 
incentive payments, to the extent that it is probable that they will 
result in revenue and can be measured reliably. This contract 
revenue is recognised by stage of completion. Contract 
expenses are recognised as incurred unless they create an asset 
related to future contract activity. An expected loss on a contract 
is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Revenue is analysed by segment in note 3 on pages 91 to 93.
Presentation of Consolidated Income Statement
The presentation of the Consolidated Income Statement shows 
the underlying results and non-underlying results, including 
non-underlying items included in the Group’s share of profits 
of associates and joint ventures, in separate columns. These 
non-underlying items are material incomes and expenses, 
which because of their nature, infrequency or occurrence, or the 
events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to better understand the financial performance 
for the period. Underlying operating profit and underlying 
profit before tax are non-GAAP measures which comprise 
operating profit and profit before tax respectively before non-
underlying items. The columnar format is considered to be 
the clearest method of presentation of this information.
Non-GAAP measures are used as they are considered to 
be both useful and necessary. They are used for internal 
performance analysis; the presentation of these measures 
facilitates comparability with other companies, although 
management’s measures may not be calculated in the same 
way as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Functional and Presentation Currency The Group’s functional 
currencies are GBP , USD and EUR. The Group has adopted  
GBP as its presentational currency.
Basis of Consolidation
Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to 
control the relevant activities of another entity or business, has  
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with 
the entity, and has the ability to use its power over the entity to 
affect the amount of the returns to the Company, it is classified as 
a subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements present the 
results of Stobart Group Limited and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) 
as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and 
balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
Business Combinations
Business Combinations from 1 March 2010
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate 
of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date 
fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in 
the acquiree. Acquisition costs are expensed and included in 
transaction costs which are reported below underlying profit.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial 
assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic 
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
Any contingent consideration payable to be transferred by the 
acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the 
aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling 
interest (and where the business combination is achieved 
in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the net 
identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed in exchange for the business combination.
Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-
legal or separability criterion, are recognised separately 
from goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a 
present obligation are recognised if the acquisition-
date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the 
consideration transferred (and where the business combination is 
achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree) is lower than the fair 
value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair 
value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the 
difference is recognised in profit and loss within non-underlying.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from 
the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-
generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether 
other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those 
units. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated 
shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill 
is monitored for internal management purposes and shall not 
be larger than an operating segment before aggregation. 86
Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Business Combinations prior to 1 March 2010
Business combinations were accounted for using the purchase 
method. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition 
formed part of the acquisition costs. The minority interest is 
accounted for using the Parent-entity extension method, whereby 
the difference between the consideration paid and the book value 
of the share in net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill was initially measured at cost, being the excess of the 
cost of business combination over the Group’s interest in the net 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities. Where the net fair value of the acquired entity’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities was greater 
than the cost of investment, the difference was recognised in 
profit and loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business 
combination over the interest in the fair value of identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Cost 
comprises the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred and 
equity instruments issued.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment 
in carrying value being charged to the Consolidated Income 
Statement. Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities exceeds the fair value of consideration paid, 
the excess is credited in full to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets (Excluding Investment 
Properties and Deferred Tax Assets)
Impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite 
useful lives are undertaken at least annually at the financial year 
end and also if there are indicators of impairment. Other non-
financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair 
value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the asset’s 
cash-generating unit (i.e. the lowest group of assets in which the 
asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash 
inflows). Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
Impairment charges are included in the Consolidated Income 
Statement, except to the extent they reverse gains previously 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Other 
Comprehensive Income. Impairment losses, except losses 
relating to goodwill, can be reversed in certain circumstances.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether 
there is any indication that previously recognised impairment 
losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.  
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if  
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine  
the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss 
was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the 
asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased 
amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is 
recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is carried at revalued 
amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation 
increase. After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is 
adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying 
amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its 
remaining useful life.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash in hand, demand 
deposits and highly liquid investments readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
Financial Instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as fuel 
swaps to mitigate the risk of fuel price fluctuations. Derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the 
date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date. 
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive 
and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Forward contracts are entered into by the Group to purchase 
and/or sell biomass-related products and management judges 
that these forward commodity contracts are entered into for the 
Group’s ‘own use’ rather than as trading instruments. They 
continue to be held in accordance with the Group’s expected 
purchase, sale and/or usage requirements. Accordingly, these 
contracts are not accounted for as derivatives or other financial 
instruments.
Foreign Currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other 
than the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
they operate (their ‘functional currency’) are recorded at the rates 
ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled 
monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into 
GBP at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Statement of 
Financial Position date. The income statements are translated at 
the average rate. The exchange differences arising on the 
translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Financial Assets
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the  
Group’s financial assets are a reasonable approximation of  
their fair values.

REPORT GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Loans and Receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They arise principally through the provision of goods and 
services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also 
incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. They are 
initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue and subsequently 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, 
less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective 
evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of 
the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that 
the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under 
the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the 
difference between the net carrying amount and the present 
value of the future expected cash flows associated with the 
impaired receivable.
For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are 
recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being 
recognised within operating expenses in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will 
not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written 
off against the associated provision.
Financial Liabilities
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Group’s 
financial liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair 
values.
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of 
any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the 
instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period 
to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability 
carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are 
initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Share Capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity 
only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial 
liability. The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity 
instruments.
Own Shares Held by Employee Benefit Trust
Stobart Group Limited shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust 
are designated as own shares held, classified in shareholders’ 
equity and recognised at cost. Consideration received for the 
sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any 
difference between the proceeds from sale and original cost 
taken to retained earnings.
Treasury Shares
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the 
amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly 
attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a 
deduction from equity. When share capital held in treasury is 
subsequently disposed of, the proceeds of sale, net of any directly 
attributable costs, are recognised as an addition to equity.
Pension Arrangements and Other  
Post-Employment Benefits
The Group has pension schemes of both a defined benefit and 
defined contribution nature. The Group’s defined benefit pension 
liability, which is assessed each period by actuaries, is based on 
key assumptions including return on plan assets, discount rates, 
mortality rates, inflation and future salary and pension costs. 
These assumptions, individually or collectively, may be different 
to actual outcomes. Other key assumptions for pension 
obligations are based in part on current market conditions. 
Additional information is disclosed in note 23 on page 107.
The liability in respect of defined benefit schemes is the present 
value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date less the fair 
value of scheme assets. The trustees commission a full actuarial 
valuation triennially and the present value of the obligation is 
updated annually by external professional actuaries using the 
projected unit method for financial reporting purposes. The 
present value of the obligation is determined by the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate 
bonds which have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of 
the related liability. The current service cost, and gains and 
losses on settlements and curtailments, are recognised in 
operating costs in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Past service costs are included in operating costs where the 
benefits have vested. The Group determines the net interest 
expense/(income) on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) for 
the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the 
defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to 
the then-net defined benefit liability/(asset), taking into account 
any changes in the net defined benefit liability/(asset) during the 
period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net 
interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit 
plans are recognised in profit or loss. Remeasurements of the net 
defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and 
losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the 
effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are 
recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
For defined contribution schemes, costs are charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement as they accrue.
Share-Based Payments
Where equity-settled share options are awarded to employees, 
the fair value of the options at the date of grant is normally 
charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the vesting 
period. If the vesting conditions are directly related to a capital 
asset then the charge is debited to the cost of the related asset.  88
Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by 
adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at 
each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date so that, 
ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting 
period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. 
Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the 
options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are 
satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market 
vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not 
adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
At each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date before 
vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of 
non-market conditions and of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a 
market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The 
movement in cumulative expense since the previous Statement 
of Financial Position date is recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
The Group has share-based Long-Term Incentive Plans 
accounted for as set out above.
Leased Assets
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recorded in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as tangible assets, 
initially at fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of 
their estimated useful lives or the lease term as detailed in the 
depreciation policy below. The interest element of leasing 
payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance 
outstanding and is charged to the Consolidated Income 
Statement over the period of the lease.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership are not transferred to the Group (an ‘operating lease’), 
the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is 
recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease 
term on a straight-line basis.
The land and buildings elements of property leases are 
considered separately for the purposes of lease classification. 
Where the use of an asset is provided or obtained in exchange 
for payment, consideration is given as to whether in substance 
this is a lease.
Externally Acquired Intangible Assets (Excluding Goodwill)
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at 
cost and are subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over 
their useful lives. The amortisation expense is included as 
‘amortisation of acquired intangibles’ and is included in non-
underlying items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if 
they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other 
contractual/legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such 
intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation 
techniques (see section related to significant accounting 
estimates, judgements and assumptions below).
The significant intangible assets recognised by the Group and 
their useful economic lives are as follows:
Intangible asset Useful life
Brands Term of licence agreement or 
indefinite
Customer contracts and  
related relationships
Term of contract
Where there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which a 
brand is expected to generate cash flows for the Group it will be 
considered to have an indefinite life.
Current Taxation
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods 
are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or 
paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to 
compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
Deferred Taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the 
carrying amount of an asset or liability in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position differs from its tax base, except 
for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where 
the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the 
difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances 
where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date and are 
expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are 
settled/(recovered).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has 
a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes 
levied by the same tax authority on either:
• the same taxable Group Company; and
• different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in 
which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
are expected to be settled or recovered.

FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Government Grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received and all attached 
conditions will be complied with. Where the grant relates to an 
expense item, it is recognised as income over the period 
necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs 
that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an 
asset, it is credited to deferred income and released to the 
Consolidated Income Statement to match the depreciation of the 
related asset.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In 
the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when 
paid. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Freehold land and buildings and plant and equipment are stated 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on items of property, plant and 
equipment, other than land and assets under construction, to 
write off to their residual value the carrying value of items over 
their expected useful lives. Useful lives and residual values are 
reconsidered on an annual basis. Depreciation is applied at the 
following rates:
Buildings 2% per annum straight line
Modular buildings 3%–10% per annum straight line
Plant and machinery 10%–20% per annum straight line
Commercial vehicles  
and aircraft 5%–33% per annum straight line
Fixtures, fittings and 
equipment 10%–20% per annum straight line
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from 
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of 
the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in 
profit or loss in the period the asset is derecognised.
Borrowing costs attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised.
Investment Properties
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including 
transaction costs. The carrying amount includes the cost of 
replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that 
the cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met and excludes 
the cost of day-to-day servicing of an investment property. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated 
at fair value, which reflects market conditions at the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position date. Gains or losses arising from 
changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in 
the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they 
arise. The fair value of the investment property portfolio is based 
on a valuation by an independent valuer who holds a recognised 
and relevant professional qualification and who has recent 
experience in the location and category of the investment 
property.
Investment properties acquired as part of a business 
combination are recognised initially at fair value and exclude 
transaction costs.
Investment properties are derecognised when either they have 
been disposed of or when the investment property is 
permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit 
is expected from its disposal. Any gains or losses on the 
retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period of retirement 
or disposal.
Investment properties are reclassified as ‘held for sale’ assets 
from commencement of marketing for disposal, provided that the 
Directors believe it is highly probably that they will be sold within a 
period of 12 months.
Rental income arising from operating leases on investment 
properties is spread on a straight-line basis over the period of the 
lease. Where an incentive (such as a rent-free period) is given to 
a tenant, the carrying value of the investment property excludes 
any amount reported as a separate asset as a result of 
recognising rental income on this basis.
Self-Constructed Assets
The cost of a self-constructed asset is determined using the 
same principles as for an acquired asset. Costs include any 
costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location  
and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management. Costs include employee 
benefits, site preparation, delivery and handling, installation and 
assembly, testing and professional fees. For assets made for  
sale or similar to those made for sale then the cost is the same  
as the cost of constructing an asset for sale including fixed and 
variable overheads which are considered directly attributable. 
Internal net profits are eliminated in arriving at such costs.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net  
realisable value.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle, 
and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, 
production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in 
bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case 
of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes 
an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal 
operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Inventories include property assets which are held for 
development and/or disposal, to the extent that they are not  90
Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
used in the Group’s operations or held for investment purposes. 
The net realisable value of these property inventory assets 
is determined by assessment of fair value less costs to sell, 
using a similar method to that used in impairment workings.
Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Disposal Groups
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when:
• they are available for immediate sale;
• management is committed to a plan to sell;
• it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made 
or that the plan will be withdrawn;
• an active programme to locate a buyer has been initiated;
• the asset or disposal group is being marketed at a reasonable 
price in relation to its fair value; and
• it is highly probable that a sale is expected to complete within 
12 months from the date of classification (or an extended 
period if the delay is caused by circumstances beyond the 
entity’s control but the Group remains committed to the plan 
to sell the asset).
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at 
the lower of their carrying amount immediately prior to being 
classified as held for sale in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy and fair value less costs to sell.
Following their classification as held for sale, non-current assets 
are not depreciated.
The results of operations disposed of during the prior year are 
included in the Consolidated Income Statement up to the date  
of disposal.
Associates
The Group’s investments in its associates are accounted for 
using the equity method of accounting unless the investment is 
classified as held for sale.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant 
influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
Under the equity method, the equity investment in the associate 
is carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 
cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net 
assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is 
included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not 
amortised. Loans to associates, where the settlement is planned 
or expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future, do not form 
part of the equity investment and are included in other 
receivables or non-current amounts owed by associates and joint 
ventures according to the expected repayment terms. The 
Consolidated Income Statement reflects the share of the results 
of operations of the associate but the loss is limited to the equity 
investment made, plus any loans which form part of the net 
investment in the associate, unless the Group has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the 
associate. Where there has been a change recognised directly in 
the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any 
changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the Statement of 
Changes in Equity and the Statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income. The Group’s share of profits and losses resulting from 
transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated 
to the extent of the interest in the associate.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines 
whether it is necessary to recognise an additional impairment 
loss on the Group’s investment in its associates. The Group 
determines at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 
date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment 
in the associate is impaired. If this is the case and there is a 
resulting impairment, the amount is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
Joint Ventures
Investments in joint ventures, which are jointly controlled entities, 
are included in the financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting unless the investment is classified as held for sale.
Under the equity method, the equity interest in the joint venture is 
initially recorded at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-
acquisition change in the Group’s share of net assets of the joint 
venture but any loss is limited to the equity investment made, 
unless the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the joint venture. Goodwill relating 
to the joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment and is not amortised. Loans to joint ventures, where 
the settlement is planned or expected to be repaid in the 
foreseeable future, do not form part of the equity investment and 
are included in other receivables or non-current amounts owed 
by associates and joint ventures according to the expected 
repayment terms. The Consolidated Income Statement reflects 
the share of the results of operations of the joint venture but the 
loss is limited to the equity investment made, plus any loans 
which form part of the net investment in the joint venture, unless 
the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the joint venture. Where there has been a 
change recognised directly in the equity of the joint venture, the 
Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, 
when applicable, in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the 
Statement of Other Comprehensive Income. Profits and losses 
resulting from transactions between the Group and the joint 
ventures are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the joint 
venture, unless the Group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines 
whether it is necessary to recognise an additional impairment 
loss on the Group’s investment in its joint ventures. The Group 
determines at each Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 
date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment 
in the joint venture is impaired. If this is the case and there is a 
resulting impairment, the amount is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
Aircraft maintenance reserves
Under certain lease arrangements, the Group is responsible for 
major overhaul aircraft maintenance costs. The estimated cost of 
major airframe and engine maintenance checks are provided for 
over the shorter of the period to the next check or the remaining 
life of the lease.

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Judgements and 
Estimates
The Group makes judgements and estimates in preparing the 
financial statements. Judgements and estimates are continually 
evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual 
experience may differ from these judgements and estimates. The 
judgements and estimates that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Judgements
(a) Treatment of Brand Licence
 The accounting treatment of the licence of certain trademarks 
and designs to an external party is based on judgements over 
who bears the risk and rewards of ownership and assessments 
of the likelihood of options under the licence being taken.
( b )	 Cl a ssific a t i on 	 of 	 Assoc i a t es, 	 J o in t 	 V en t ures 	 and 	 	 	
 Investments
 The key factor in determining the classification of associates, 
joint ventures and investments is the timing and level of 
control. During the year, the Group acquired two investments 
previously recognised as an associate and joint venture, as 
disclosed in note 4 on page 93. Significant judgement was 
exercised to determine the date control was obtained.
Estimates
(a) Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether 
goodwill and intangible assets have suffered any impairment. 
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use 
or fair value less costs of disposal calculations. The use of this 
method requires the estimation of future cash flows and 
discount rates in order to calculate the present value of the 
cash flows. Intangible assets subject to these judgements 
include brand assets, some of which are licensed to third 
parties, and assessments of their values include judgements 
and estimates over whether the licence agreement will be 
extended or the asset purchased by the licensor. Actual 
outcomes may vary. Further information, including carrying 
values, is set out in note 16 on page 102.
(b) Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment
 Where there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, 
the Group is required to test whether assets have suffered any 
impairment. The recoverable amount is determined based on 
value in use or fair value less costs of disposal calculations. 
The use of these methods requires the estimation of future 
cash flows and discount rates in order to calculate the present 
value of the cash flows. Actual outcomes may vary. Further 
information, including carrying values and impairment

 The determined fair value of the investment properties is in 
accordance with independent valuations. The fair value is 
most sensitive to the estimated yield as well as long-term 
vacancy rate. 
 Investment properties are reclassified as ‘held for sale’ assets 
from commencement of marketing for disposal. Estimation is 
required to assess the likelihood that a property will be sold 
within a period of 12 months.
 The valuation of investment property in the current year is not 
considered to be a material estimate as there is only one 
investment property remaining in comparison to three in the 
prior year.

 Determining the existence and the fair value of intangible 
assets on business combinations and in investments in 
associates and joint ventures involves judgements and 
estimates. Estimates include determining future cash flows 
and discount rates. See notes 4 and 14 for further disclosure.

 The Group is required to review, on an annual basis, whether  
the property inventories carrying values can be recovered. If  
carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is  
written down to its net realisable value. The net realisable  
values of properties are based on certain estimates. 
Estimates include the ability to obtain the appropriate   
planning permission, the customer demand for usage of the  
type of properties that could be developed, the build costs,  
and the price of sale of the developed properties to a   
customer or of the undeveloped land to a developer. See note 
17 for further disclosure.

4 Business Combinations
Acquisition of Propius Holdings Limited
On 24 February 2017, the Group acquired the remaining 33.3% of 
the ordinary shares in Propius Holdings Limited (Propius). Propius 
is registered in the Cayman Islands. The principal activity of 
Propius is aircraft leasing. Together with the existing 66.7% 
already owned by the Group prior to the acquisition, this gave the 
Group control over Propius.
Control was only deemed to be obtained on 24 February 2017, 
due to the existence of a previously held shareholder agreement.
The primary reason for the acquisition was to give the Group 
more control over its ability to grow and develop its aviation 
operations across the UK, Ireland and Europe.
The provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and  
liabilities of Propius as at the date of acquisition are as follows:
Provisional  
fair value

acquisition

Maintenance deposits – (11,704)
Deferred tax liabilities (2,651) (1,691)
Net identifiable assets and liabilities 41,263 34,464
Consideration paid: 
Cash 11,763
Fair value of existing equity interest 28,149
Total consideration 39,912
Excess of fair value of net assets 
over consideration 1,351
The consideration comprised cash of £11,763,000 and the 
existing owned proportion of the fair value of the net assets at 
acquisition date of £28,149,000. There was no contingent 
consideration as defined in IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ in 
connection with this acquisition. The Group incurred acquisition- 
related transaction costs of £1,402,000. These costs have been 
included in non-underlying other operating expenses in the 
Group’s Consolidated Income Statement.
Immediately prior to this acquisition, the Group owned 66.7%  
of Propius which was disclosed as an equity accounted joint 
venture with a carrying value of £22,771,000. 
The difference of £5,378,000, between this carrying value of 
£22,771,000 and the existing owned proportion of the net assets 
at acquisition date of £28,149,000, has been recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement within impairment of goodwill/
credit for business purchase.
The excess of fair value of net assets over consideration of 
£1,351,000 has been taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, 
and is disclosed within impairment of goodwill/credit for business 
purchase. Due to fair value adjustments and the transaction being 
completed at a later date than the price being agreed, net assets 
exceeded consideration.
In the four days to 28 February 2017, the subsidiary contributed 
net profit of £34,000 to the consolidated loss for the year. If the 
acquisition had occurred on the first day of the accounting 
period, Group revenue would have been an estimated 
£12,152,000 higher before elimination of intra-group trading and 
net profit would have been an estimated £1,811,000 higher, 
excluding share of profits already recognised in note 14.  94
Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Acquisition of Everdeal Holdings Limited
On 8 February 2017, the Group acquired the remaining 19% of the 
ordinary shares in Everdeal Holdings Limited (Everdeal). Everdeal 
is registered in Ireland. The principal activity of Everdeal is the 
operation of an airline. Eight of the aircraft in the Everdeal fleet are 
leased from the group headed by Propius Holdings Limited. 
Control was only deemed to be obtained on 8 February 2017, 
due to clauses within the Articles of Association.
The primary reason for the acquisition was to give the Group more 
control over its ability to grow and develop its aviation operations 
across the UK, Ireland and Europe. Although Everdeal had book 
value net liabilities of £26.9m on acquisition, the Directors are 
satisfied that their future actions can have a positive impact on the 
financial position and performance of this business.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets 
and liabilities:
Provisional

Net identifiable assets and liabilities (27,811) (26,886)
Consideration paid: 
Cash 564
Fair value of existing equity interest –
Total consideration 564
Goodwill 28,375
The consideration comprised cash of £564,000 and the existing 
owned proportion of the fair value of the net assets at acquisition 
date of £nil. There was no contingent consideration as defined in 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ in connection with this 
acquisition. The Group incurred acquisition-related transaction 
costs of £200,000. These costs have been included in non-
underlying other operating expenses in the Group’s Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Immediately prior to this acquisition, the Group owned 81% of 
Everdeal which was disclosed as an equity accounted associate 
with a carrying value of £nil. There was no resulting gain or loss 
taken to the income statement following remeasurement of this 
investment.
In the 20 days to 28 February 2017, the subsidiary contributed a 
net loss of £1,064,000 to the consolidated loss for the year. If the 
acquisition had occurred on the first day of the accounting 
period, Group revenue would have been an estimated 
£111,364,000 higher and net profit would have been an estimated 
£1,177,000 higher.
Following an impairment review, during which the future forecasts 
of the business were reviewed, the goodwill arising on acquisition 
was written off in full in the Consolidated Income Statement and 
disclosed within impairment of goodwill/credit for business 
purchase.

of Other Comprehensive Income is a tax charge of £556,000 
(2016: £60,000) in relation to the defined benefit pension scheme.
The deferred tax charge/(credit) in the Consolidated Income

acquisition 2,839 1,030
Brands recognised on acquisition (1,158) (1,795)
Other temporary differences 199 (696)
1,158 (1,933)
Deferred tax on temporary differences in the year amounting to 
£869,000 (2016: £nil) has not been recognised in the financial 
statements on the basis that these temporary differences relate to 
tax losses of certain Group entities where there is uncertainty 
over whether taxable profit will be generated by the operations of 
these entities against which the unused tax losses can be utilised 
in future periods.
Stobart Group Limited’s affairs are conducted such that it is 
considered to be resident in the UK for tax purposes. HM 
Revenue & Customs has not objected to this position. As a result, 
the Company is liable to pay UK corporation tax on its profits.
Factors That May Affect the Future Tax Charge
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% 
(effective from 1 April 2017) and 18% (effective from 1 April 2020) 
were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. As part of the 
March 2016 Budget, a further reduction to 17% (effective from 
1 April 2020) was announced and substantively enacted in 
September 2016. The deferred tax assets/liabilities as at 
28 February 2017 have been provided at 17%.
11 Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net 
profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the 
Parent by the weighted average number of ordinary 10p shares 
outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit 
attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Parent by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for share options 
which have exercise prices below the average market price of 
shares during the period. With the exception of share options 
issued under the employee SAYE scheme, these options are  
anti-dilutive in the current and prior years and have not therefore 
been included in the calculation in accordance with IAS 33.

The numerator used for the basic and diluted underlying earnings 
per share is the underlying profit for the year of £27,606,000 
(2016: £16,249,000). 
There are 1,414,575 options which were granted on 21 September 
2007, with an exercise price of 176.7p. These are potentially 
dilutive instruments but were not included in the calculation of 
diluted earnings per share because the average market price of 
the shares was lower than the exercise price. 
On 1 November 2014, 479,395 awards were made to Executive 
Directors under a Long-Term Incentive Plan. These are potentially 
dilutive instruments but were not included in the calculation of 
diluted earnings per share because the performance conditions 
have not been met unconditionally at the year end date.
On 22 June 2015, 1,308,941 awards were made to other senior 
employees under a Long-Term Incentive Plan. These are potentially 
dilutive instruments but were not included in the calculation of 
diluted earnings per share because the performance conditions 
have not been met unconditionally at the year end date.
On 1 September 2015, the Group introduced an HMRC-
approved, SAYE scheme available to all employees. The 
maximum number of shares that may be acquired under this 
scheme is 843,849. These are potentially dilutive instruments but 
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share in the 
current year because to do so would be anti-dilutive. 
On 6 November 2015, 1,520,772 awards were made to Executive 
Directors and other senior employees under a Long-Term 
Incentive Plan. These are potentially dilutive instruments but were 
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
because the performance conditions have not been met 
unconditionally at the year end date.
On 17 June 2016, 1,687,748 awards were made to Executive 
Directors and other senior employees under a Long-Term 
Incentive Plan. These are potentially dilutive instruments but were 
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
because the performance conditions have not been met 
unconditionally at the year end date.
During the year, the Company sold 10,081,778 (2016: 16,396,300) 
and purchased 75,078 (2016: nil) treasury shares. Treasury 
shares are not included in the weighted average number of 
shares used to calculate earnings per share.
Own shares held in an employee benefit trust are excluded from 
the weighted average number of shares.

Impairment of Assets
There were no impairment charges in the current or prior year.
Impairment Testing of Other Property, Plant and Equipment 
Where No Charge for Impairment Has Been Recognised
The London Southend Airport CGU comprises the business 
operations of the commercial airport and ancillary operations 
including a hotel and railway station. Whilst there were no 
significant indicators at the year end that the CGU may be 
impaired, the CGU has been tested for impairment as the 
business suffered a loss before tax in the year to 28 February 
2017. The Group estimated the value in use of the CGU and 
determined that no charge for impairment was necessary. The 
pre-tax discount rate used in the value in use calculation was 
12.9% (2016: 11.5%). The estimated value in use was based on 
estimates of the timing and extent of increases in the level of 
future passenger numbers, income per passenger, rental income 
and the discount rate. The carrying value of property, plant and 
equipment included in this CGU at 28 February 2017 was 
£140.2m (2016: £149.4m).
The calculation of the value in use is most sensitive to the 
discount rate. In order for the estimated recoverable amount of 
the CGU to be equal to the carrying amount the discount rate 
would need to be individually increased by 6.9 percentage points 
(2016: 6.2 percentage points).
Other Disclosures in Relation to Property, Plant and 
Equipment
Certain land and buildings were acquired through business 
acquisitions and were subject to independent valuations as part 
of the fair value exercise, or were acquired during the year and 
accounted for at cost.
Bank borrowings are secured on the Group’s freehold land and 
buildings.
Included in land and buildings at 28 February 2017 are assets 
under construction of £18,896,000 (2016: £10,226,000). The 
current year assets relate to a new processing site at Tilbury and 
development at Carlisle Lake District Airport.

In the prior year, the Group acquired an investment property at 
Speke for £17,598,000, inclusive of stamp duty and fees. This 
property was revalued at 29 February 2016 at £26,700,000, 
giving rise to a revaluation gain of £9,102,000.
During the year, the Group disposed of two investment 
properties, realising net proceeds of £45,371,000 and a profit on 
disposal of £11,716,000.
Rental income received from investment properties during the 
year was £1,359,000 (2016: £1,960,000), and direct operating 
expenses attributable to these properties were £89,000 (2016: 
£411,000).
All of the Group’s investment properties were subject to an 
independent valuation as at 28 February 2017 by GVA Grimley, 
on the basis of open market value, supported by market 
evidence. The open market value represents the amount at which 
the assets could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, 
willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arm’s 
length transaction at the date of the valuation. The valuation was 
performed in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards 
issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and is 
based on available market evidence.
At 28 February 2017, there were no contractual obligations to 
purchase investment property (2016: nil). 102

During the year, the Group acquired Everdeal Holdings Limited 
creating £28,375,000 of goodwill. As explained in note 4, this 
goodwill was written off in full. 
No internally generated intangible assets are recognised in the 
financial statements.
Brand names consist of the Stobart and Eddie Stobart 
trademarks and designs and other Stobart-associated 
trademarks and designs.
Customer relationships consist of contractual relationships with 
customers recognised on acquisitions.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives
The goodwill and brands with indefinite lives from business 
combinations have been allocated to CGUs. Carrying amounts of 
goodwill and brand names with indefinite lives allocated to each 
CGU are set out below. These assets are considered to have 
indefinite lives because there is no foreseeable limit to the period 
over which the assets are expected to generate net cash inflows 
for the Group. Factors taken into account in the consideration 
were the legal ownership, the long period over which the brand 
names have been established, the strength of brand awareness 
and the stability of the industries in which the main brands  
are involved.

Impairment Testing of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with 
Indefinite Lives
In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group  
has undertaken impairment testing for each CGU. The key 
assumptions applied in respect of each CGU are set out below.  
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, at the individual CGU 
level, in order to review the effect of changes in key assumptions.
Stobart Energy Cash-Generating Unit
During the year, the previous Stobart Biomass Products and 
Stobart Biomass Transport CGUs were amalgamated into one 
Stobart Energy CGU. The Directors determined that this more 
appropriately reflected the Energy business going forward 
following significant changes in the management structure. The 
recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangible assets in the 
Stobart Energy CGU has been based on value in use 
calculations using projections from financial forecasts approved 
by senior management covering a five year (2016: five year) 
period. The main assumptions on which the forecasts were 
based include sales volumes and profit margins. The pre-tax 
discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 9.6% 
(2016: 8.9%) based on the weighted average cost of capital for 
the CGU, taking into account the cost of equity and debt for the 
CGU, and adjusting for risk specific to the CGU. Cash flows 
beyond the five year period are deemed to be in perpetuity but 
an annual growth rate of 2.0% (2016: 2.0%) is assumed in the 
calculations.
No impairment losses have been recognised in the current or 
prior year. The calculation of the value in use is most sensitive to 
the discount rate. With regard to the assessment of value in the 
Stobart Biomass CGU, management believes that no reasonably 
possible change in the discount rate would cause the carrying 
value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
Stobart Rail Cash-Generating Unit
The recoverable amount of the goodwill and intangible assets in 
the Stobart Rail CGU has been based on value in use 
calculations using projections from financial forecasts approved 
by senior management covering a five year (2016: five year) 
period. The main assumptions on which the forecasts were 
based include Network Rail work volumes. The pre-tax discount 
rate applied to the cash flow projections was 11.6% (2016: 9.8%) 
based on the weighted average cost of capital for the CGU, 
taking into account the cost of equity and debt for the CGU, and 
adjusting for risk specific to the CGU. Cash flows beyond the five 
year period are deemed to be in perpetuity but an annual growth 
rate of 2.0% (2016: 2.0%) is assumed in the calculations. 103

reasonably possible change in the discount rate or sales volumes 
would cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its 
recoverable amount.
Other
The brands with indefinite life in the ‘other’ column in the table 
relate to Stobart brands for which the Group obtained an 
independent valuation in 2014 which supports these values.  
This asset has been tested for impairment at the year end using  
a pre-tax discount rate of 10.2% (2016: 6.2%). No impairment 
losses have been recognised and in order for the estimated 
recoverable amount of the CGU to be equal to the carrying 
amounts the discount rate would need to be individually 
increased by 12.2 percentage points (2016: 16.5) to 22.4%  
(2016: 22.7%) and management believes that no reasonably 
possible change in cash flows would cause the carrying value  
of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The balance of the brands of £34,249,000 (2016: £37,966,000), 
not included in the above table, represents the value of expected 
receipts under the licence agreement with a trading subsidiary of 
Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Limited for the right to use 
the Eddie Stobart brand, following the disposal of the Transport 
and Distribution business. This is not included in the table above 
in the current year because this asset is not considered to have 
an indefinite life, but instead will be amortised to a residual value 
over its useful economic life of six years, three years of which are 
remaining at the year end. The licence agreement allows a 
trading subsidiary of Greenwhitestar Holding Company 1 Limited 
to use certain Eddie Stobart trademarks and designs for an initial 
period of 15 years with options to extend the licence period, 
terminate within four years, or purchase the trademarks and 
designs for use in the logistics business or purchase the 
trademarks and designs for unlimited use.
The discount rates used in the impairment workings for most of 
the CGUs are higher than those used in the prior year. The 
methods used to determine the factors within the discount rate 
calculations were consistent with the prior year. Reasons for the 
increase in some of the discount rates include an increase in cost 
of debt, the inclusion of a size premium and variations in gearing 
and beta values for comparative companies used to calculate 
cost of equity.
The Stobart Energy CGU is part of the Energy segment. The 
Stobart Rail CGU is part of the Rail segment and the Other CGU 
is part of the adjustments and eliminations segment.

Property inventories include development land and buildings at 
Runcorn and Widnes with a total carrying value of £55.4million. 
The net realisable values of these development assets are 
expected to be higher than the carrying values. The net realisable 
value of these property inventories are based on certain 
estimates. The assets are at different stages of development.
For the Widnes assets, the estimates include the build costs and 
the price obtainable from customers for the developed land. 
Development plans are expected to crystallise within the next one 
to two years.
For the Runcorn assets, the plans are at an earlier stage and are 
expected to include a mixed use development. The estimates 
include the ability to obtain appropriate planning permissions, the 
price of development land, the build costs and the customer 
demand for the developed assets. These development plans are 
expected to progress over more than one year. The Group is not 
yet committed to a firm plan for this development land.
Applying reasonable sensitivities to these development assets 
does not result in the net realisable value falling below the current 
carrying values. The Group has a proven track record of 
achieving profitable returns on property developments but if the 
estimates are not met, then it is possible there would be a 
material write down of the value of property inventories. If the 
current plans do not crystallise, the Group would seek alternative 
development options.

During the year, the £50,000,000 variable rate committed 
revolving credit facility with a facility end date of January 2019 
was amended to £65,000,000 and extended to an end date of 
January 2020. This facility was drawn at £42,200,000 (2016: 
£27,000,000) at the year end.
The Group was in compliance with all financial covenants 
throughout both the current and prior year.

For trade and other receivables/payables with a remaining life of 
less than one year, the carrying amount is considered to reflect 
the fair value.
The fair values of loans and borrowings have been calculated by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest 
rates. The fair value of finance leases and hire purchase 
arrangements and of loans and borrowings are classified as level 
2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Fair Value Hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and 
disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 
technique:
Level 1:  quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have a 
significant effect on the recorded fair value are 
observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3:  techniques which use inputs which have a significant 
effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on 
observable market data.

Investment Properties
In addition to the financial assets disclosed above, investment 
properties are also measured at fair value. All of the Group’s 
investment properties were subject to an independent valuation 
as at 28 February 2017 by GVA Grimley, on the basis of open 
market value, supported by market evidence. The open market 
value represents the amount at which the assets could be 
exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a 
knowledgeable, willing seller in an arm’s length transaction at the 
date of the valuation. The valuation was performed in accordance 
with the RICS Valuation Standards issued by the Royal Institution 
of Chartered Surveyors and is based on available market 
evidence, and therefore falls within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy. The significant unobservable inputs in the fair value 
calculations are the future rentals and the related yields 5.0%–
9.5% (2016: 5.0%–9.5%), void period 0–3 years (2016: 0–3 years) 
and rent-free period 0–1 year (2016: 0–1 year).
Assets Classified as Held for Sale
Both property assets classified as held for sale at the year end 
were previously classified as investment properties. They were 
subject to the above valuations prior to transfer and fall within 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Fair Value Calculation Methodology
Fuel swaps are valued based on market rates and market-
accepted models. Fair value for financial instruments held at 
amortised cost has been estimated by discounting cash flows  
at prevailing interest rates.
During the current and prior year, there were no transfers 
between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements, and no 
transfers into and out of level 3 fair value measurements. 106
Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Instruments – Risk Management
The Group is exposed through its operations to the following 
financial risks: 
• Credit risk • Fair value or cash flow interest rate risk
• Liquidity risk • Capital risk
• Diesel price risk • Jet fuel price risk
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to 
risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note 
describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing those risks and the methods used to measure them.
Principal Financial Instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which 
financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
• Trade and other receivables • Cash at bank
• Bank overdrafts • Trade and other payables
• Floating-rate bank loans • Finance leases
General Objectives, Policies and Processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the 
Group’s risk management objectives and policies.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to 
reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the 
Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding 
these policies are set out below:
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer  
or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. The Group is mainly exposed to credit 
risk from credit sales. It is Group policy, implemented locally,  
to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering 
contracts. Such credit ratings are taken into account by local 
business practices.
All credit sales are made under Group payment and delivery 
terms and conditions and are mostly covered by insurance. All 
credit limits are formally set and are in agreement with the bank.
The recoverability of the net trade and other receivables book is 
considered highly likely. This is supported by the history of 
collection by the Group.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from 
long-term borrowings and cash at variable rates. There are loan 
facilities at variable rates as well as amounts held on deposit. 
These borrowing policies are managed centrally. Although the 
Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely 
from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates nor 
eliminates fully cash flow risk associated with variability in interest 
payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of 
exposure to these risks.
During the current and prior year, the Group’s borrowings at 
variable rate were denominated in GBP . During the current year, 
the Group’s borrowings at fixed rate were denominated in USD. 
Diesel Price Risk
The Group is exposed to diesel price risk as diesel fuel is a key 
supply to the transport fleet of vehicles in the Energy business.  
If diesel prices rise, there will be increases in the base costs that 
cannot be fully passed on to customers. In order to mitigate this 
risk, the Group has taken out diesel swap contracts to manage its 
exposure.
The fair value of diesel swap contracts, falling within level 2 of the 
fair value hierarchy as at 28 February 2017 is £540,000 asset 
(2016: £1,381,000 liability) and the gross swap coverage was 
£2,053,000 (2016: £5,283,000).
The fair value of the swap is calculated by Investec Bank 
Commercial Markets based on mid-market levels as of the close 
of business on 28 February 2017.
Jet Fuel Price Risk
The Group is exposed to jet fuel price risk as jet fuel is a key 
supply to the fleet of aeroplanes in the Aviation business. If  
jet fuel prices rise, there will be increases in the base costs that 
cannot be fully passed onto customers. In order to mitigate this 
risk, the Group has taken out jet fuel swap contracts to manage 
its exposure.
The fair value of jet fuel swap contracts, falling within level 2 of  
the fair value hierarchy as at 28 February 2017 is £101,000 liability 
(2016: £nil) and the gross swap coverage was £6,570,000  
(2016: £nil).
The fair value of the swaps is calculated by Mitsui Bussan 
Commodities Ltd based on mid-market levels as of the close  
of business on 28 February 2017.
Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity 
of the market value of financial instruments to hypothetical 
changes in market rates and prices. Sensitivity is calculated 
based on all other variables remaining constant.
The interest rate analysis assumes a 1% change in interest rates. 
The diesel and jet fuel price sensitivity analysis is based on diesel 
and jet fuel related derivative instruments held at the end of each 
reporting period.
The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% increase 
in the diesel and jet fuel price is disclosed. A corresponding 
decrease results in an equal and opposite impact on the 
Consolidated Income Statement.

Capital Management
The objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure 
that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in 
order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group monitors capital using gearing ratios. Gearing 
(excluding net debt in disposal groups) based on net debt 
divided by capital was 31.0% at 28 February 2017 (2016: 11.6%). 
The Group includes the following within borrowings: bank loans 
and overdrafts, finance leases and hire purchase contracts and 
loan notes. Capital comprises equity attributable to the equity 
holders of the Parent.
The Group uses share capital to partly fund major acquisitions 
where considered appropriate.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital 
restraints except compliance with normal bank covenants.
Dividends are payable after considering the solvency of the 
Group and the forecast funding requirements and headroom.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working 
capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on 
its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter 
difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. 
See also the maturity profile of loans and borrowings below.
The Group prepares and reviews rolling weekly cash flow 
projections. Actual cash and debt positions along with available 
facilities and headroom are reported weekly. These are monitored 
by Group management.
In addition, full annual five year forecasts are prepared including 
cash flow and headroom forecasts. These are full detailed 
forecasts prepared by each division and consolidated for the 
Group.
 
The financial statements have been prepared using the going 
concern basis as the financial forecasts support the assumption that 
the Group will be able to meet its obligations when they fall due.

23 Employee Benefits – Pension Schemes
The Ansa plan remains open for employees of Ansa Logistics 
Limited. The latest actuarial valuation of the Ansa plan was as 
at 31 December 2013 and was carried out by an independent 
qualified actuary using the projected unit method. At the date 
of the latest actuarial valuation, the realisable value of assets 
was £20,291,000, which was sufficient to cover 82% of the 
value of benefits that had accrued to members, measured on 
the continuing basis. Total contributions payable for the year to 
28 February 2017 amounted to £608,000 (2016: £614,000) with 
no contributions due to the plan at 28 February 2017 (2016: £nil).
The Scheme is established under trust law and has a corporate 
trustee that is required to run the Scheme in accordance with the 
Scheme’s Trust deed and rules and to comply with all the relevant 
legislation. Responsibility for governance of the Scheme lies with 
the Trustee. The Trustee is a company whose directors comprise 
representatives of the Group and the Scheme participants, in 
accordance with its Articles of Association and UK pension law.
The principal assumptions for the purpose of the actuarial 
valuations used in these Consolidated Financial Statements were 
as follows:
2017 2016
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 2.55% 3.85%
Rate of inflation (RPI) 3.60% 3.20%
Rate of inflation (CPI) 2.60% 2.20%

Expected rate of return on assets

Stobart Group Limited  Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Longevity Assumptions for Members of the Ansa Plan
The life expectancies based on the plan’s IAS 19 mortality 
assumptions at the plan’s normal retirement age of 65 are as follows:
Male life  
expectancy
Female life  
expectancy
28 February 2017 87.0 89.0
28 February 2037 88.3 90.5
29 February 2016 86.9 88.9
29 February 2036 88.2 90.4
The figures for the members 20 years in the future show how the 
expected future improvements in longevity, as a result of the CMI 
projections and the 1% p.a. minimum annual improvements, 
affect life expectancies. An ‘improvement’ means the decrease in 
the rate of mortality at a given age over the time period.
Sensitivities to Principal Assumptions
The principal risk to the Group in relation to the plan is that the 
Group would be required to fund any deficits in the plan, the level 
of which is variable and depends upon mortality rates, inflation 
and returns on plan assets.
The most significant sensitivity stems from the following 
assumptions:
• Discount rate. This is a key assumption because it is applied 
to the future pension payments.
• Price inflation. This is a key assumption because it is used to 
determine increases to pensions in payment and in deferment, 
and increases to pensionable salaries for the one active 
member.
• Mortality after retirement. This is a key assumption 
because it determines how long pensions are paid for when 
they come into payment. The central assumptions are the 
S2PA base tables, with the CMI_2015 projections of future 
experience, subject to a 1.0% p.a. minimum annual 
improvement with no age rating.
Sensitising the assumptions listed above would have the 
following effects on the total liabilities, assets and deficit 
positions. For the purposes of the mortality sensitivity illustrations, 
we have varied the minimum annual improvement.

The plan assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial 
instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used 
by, the Group. The trustees of the Ansa plan regularly review 
their investment strategies to ensure that wherever possible 
the nature of assets held in each scheme is appropriate to the 
maturity profile of the underlying pension obligation. The types 
of assets held are shown above. The age profile of the Ansa 
plan members, which provides an indication of the maturity 
profile of the defined benefit obligation, is shown below:
2017 
Years

Normal retirement age 65 65
Average age of deferred members 55 55
Average age of pensioner members 66 66
The Group expects to contribute £608,000 to the Ansa plan in the 
year ending 28 February 2018 (2017: £608,000). A new schedule 
of contributions was agreed with the trustees in the prior year to 
cover a 16 year period to 28 February 2031, setting out the deficit 
contributions payable into the Scheme.
The trustees seek to align the investment strategies with the 
maturity profile of the liabilities in the schemes. 
An additional liability for any surplus contributions payable as a 
result of this agreement has not been recognised as Stobart 
Group has the right to a refund of any surplus.
The Group operates a defined contribution plan. The charge in 
the year to the Consolidated Income Statement was £825,000 
(2016: £955,000). The value of contributions outstanding as at 
28 February 2017 and included in other payables is £46,000 
(2016: £62,000).

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of  
certain tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise  
to deferred tax assets because it is probable that the assets will  
be recovered.
Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of tax losses  
of certain Group entities of £9,564,000 as at 28 February 2017 
(2016: £9,669,000) on the basis that there is uncertainty over 
whether taxable profit will be available within the trades operated 
by these entities against which the unused tax losses can be 
utilised in future periods.
The deferred tax balances have been calculated at 17% as this 
was the rate that was substantively enacted at the Statement of 
Financial Position date. The main rate of corporation tax reduced 
to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015 and will reduce further to  
19% from 1 April 2017, and will reduce further to 17% from  
1 April 2020.  110

Site Restoration
The Group leases a long leasehold property which is currently 
unoccupied, in respect of which it has annual holding costs and 
dilapidation obligations. The estimated liability is discounted to its 
present value. 
Onerous Leases
The provisions in relation to leases for properties at Wakefield 
and Northampton have been settled in the year. The provision 
acquired relates to a lease for under-utilised hours in a flight 
simulator, following the acquisition of Everdeal Holdings Limited. 
The provisions used in the period represents the costs payable in 
the period. The remaining provision relates to holding costs of an 
unoccupied property.
Litigation and Claims
The provisions acquired in the year relate to the acquisition of 
Everdeal Holdings Limited. These cases are being defended; 
however, a provision is held to cover the estimated future liability 
to the Group. Provisions released during the year relate to 
litigation and claims in Eddie Stobart Logistics that the Group 
indemnified, with £708,000 still provided at the year end. 111

The share-based payment plans are described below. 
Share Options
On 21 September 2007, 1,414,575 options over 10p ordinary 
shares of the Company were granted with an exercise price of 
176.7p each. The options vested over a three year period and 
there are no performance conditions attached. These options 
lapse in September 2017.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 2014 to Date
During the current and prior years, performance shares were 
awarded to Executive Directors and other senior management 
under a Long-Term Incentive Plan. These performance shares 
vest subject to the TSR and the cumulative earnings per share 
(EPS), both measured over three year periods. 50% of the share 
awards vest dependent on the TSR performance of the Group. 
None of these share awards will vest if the TSR performance 
of the Group is less than that of the comparator group (the 
TSR of the FTSE 250). 25% of the awards will vest if the TSR 
performance of the Group equals that of the comparator group 
and the remaining 75% will vest proportionately in line with 
how the TSR performance of the Group exceeds that of the 
comparator group between 0% and 10%. 50% of the share 
awards vest dependent on the cumulative EPS over the three 
financial years ending at the end of the third February after grant. 
None of these share awards will vest if the cumulative EPS is less 
than threshold, 25% of the shares will vest if the cumulative EPS 
is threshold and the remaining 75% will vest proportionately in 
line with how the cumulative EPS performs between threshold 
and stretch. If both elements of the performance conditions 
are achieved in full, the awards will be subject to a multiple up 
to a maximum of 2x multiplier if the Group’s three year TSR 
outperforms the index by 40% per annum or more. Further details 
are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 53 to 67.

Save As You Earn (SAYE)
On 1 September 2015, the Group introduced a SAYE scheme 
which was available to all qualifying employees and Directors. 
The scheme is approved by HM Revenue & Customs. 
Participants enter into a contract to save a fixed amount per 
month of up to a maximum of £500 for three years and are 
granted an option over shares at a fixed option price, set at a 20% 
discount to average market price for the three days prior to the 
invitation to participate. The number of shares comprising the 
option is determined by the monthly amount saved on maturity of 
the savings contract. Options granted under the SAYE scheme 
are not subject to any performance conditions. The maximum 
number of shares, if all vest, is 843,849 (2016: 1,113,367).

Valuation Details
The fair value of the options granted without market-based 
performance conditions is estimated using a Black-Scholes 
model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the options were granted. The fair value of the options granted 
with market-based performance conditions are estimated using a 
Monte Carlo model taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the options were granted. 112

Group as Lessee
The Group has various operating lease agreements for land and 
buildings, in respect of both operational and office premises. 
These leases typically have terms of renewal but do not contain 
purchase options. Property leases typically include rent review 
clauses which allow for upward revision to the rental charge on a 
periodic basis, according to prevailing market conditions. Where 
escalation clauses are present that stipulate specific increases to 
the rental amount the operating lease expense is recorded on a 
straight-line basis. Similarly, lease incentives are recorded on a 
straight-line basis.
At the year end, the Group had outstanding commitments for 
future minimum payments under non-cancellable operating 
leases, which fall due as follows:

claim, and therefore any future liability, cannot be certain, it is the 
Directors’ opinion, based on external legal and property advice, 
that no material liabilities exist in respect of legal claims at year 
end beyond those included in provisions.
