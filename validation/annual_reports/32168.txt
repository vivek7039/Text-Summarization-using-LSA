Flybe UK
After resolving the major legacy 
issues, we can now focus all of our 
resources on growing a sustainable 
regional airline. 
t his year we served more 
passengers – 8.8 million in total. 
And we got them to their final 
destination on time more often. 
For the second year running, Flybe 
was named the u K’s most punctual 
airline and ranked sixth worldwide. 
Capacity was higher than we 
would have liked, therefore 
this has been deployed on 
33 new scheduled routes and 
we have increased frequency 
on existing routes. We reached 
64 scheduled destinations 
in 12 different countries. 
We reviewed and optimised 
our franchise partnerships. We 
also expanded our codeshare 
partnerships, adding to the ‘o ne 
Stop to the World’ programme 
and giving our customers greater 
access to long-haul destinations 
via our key hubs.
We’ve made good progress in 
a number of areas, but there 
is still work to be done. o ne 
of our key points of focus now 
is delivering the best possible 
customer experience – from 
making a booking to arriving at 
the final destination. o ur digital 
transformation is a key enabler to 
improve the customer journey.
by continuing to strive for the 
highest quality customer service, 
getting our customers to their 
destination safely and on time, 
providing regional connectivity 
unlike any other airline, and 
improving profitability, we will 
continue to build a sustainable 
Flybe for the future.

to deliver a consistent, high quality customer experience, we 
believe that all our employees need to share the same values and 
objectives, and need to be empowered and equipped to deliver 
excellent service.
Building from the ground up
Great organisations must be built on strong foundations.  
We therefore focus on:
> Culture
establishing and embedding with our employees a 
clear set of values and behaviours to build a culture  
of excellence.
> Fairness and transparency
Creating a fair and transparent reward structure. 
> Organisational structure and capability
Shaping the organisation to deliver our strategic 
objectives, and creating work levels with job 
descriptions, salary bands and a range of training 
opportunities for each role.
> Getting the basics right
Implementing new systems and processes that deliver 
information services to the organisation, such as our 
new HR system, it rent.
From these foundations, we have developed a number 
of programmes to support, enable and engage our 
employees, all of which are described in detail in the 
Corporate Responsibility section.

Our values
Shared values are really important to drive 
sustainable, long-term business performance. 
t hey need to be led from the top to ensure that they 
are embedded in everything we do. In April 2017 all 
our employees were invited to complete a survey, 
asking what they believe are the most important 
values in order to achieve success in the future. 
t heir feedback has led to the establishment of five 
values, as follows: 
 > Care and respect
Creating a positive and inclusive environment with 
all our working relationships
 > Customer-focused
Putting the customer at the heart of everything  
we do
 > t eamwork
Working together effectively to create a team 
greater than the sum of its parts
 > Continuous improvement 
Striving to find a better and more efficient way 
to operate
 > a ccountability
being proactive and taking personal responsibility 
to achieve objectives
At our April leadership meeting, ‘be.Inspirational’, 
we worked with 150 members of our senior team 
to agree a set of behaviours that embody these 
five values. t hese carefully selected values and 
behaviours are embedded in everything we do 
and are championed at all levels. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Chairman’s statement
Flybe needed a new way forward and a different culture
Since the start of the turnaround in 2013, much has 
been achieved. However, the market remains highly 
competitive and the results of the turnaround need 
to be assessed against this background. t he business 
has succeeded in managing great change, in focusing 
the business into being a regional airline, fulfilling the 
needs of regional customers and competing on thin 
routes. We compete with all forms of transport – road, 
rail and ferry – as well as other airlines with 18.9% of 
our routes having a direct airline competitor.
Consumer demand has continued to be fragile, 
subdued by tragic events in Paris in November 2015 
and brussels in March 2016; and then by uncertainty 
arising from the brexit vote in June 2016. Despite 
this backdrop, our continued growth in fleet size, the 
result of an aircraft order placed at the time of the 
IPo in 2010, forced us to grow the route network with 
new routes being launched, principally to utilise the 
aircraft we had. t he result has been lower load factors 
and yields.
t he board took the view last Autumn that much of 
the initial turnaround had been completed and that 
the Company needed a fresh look at its future and a 
different culture. As the historic aircraft order works its 
way out, this Summer will see the size of the fleet peak. 
From the Autumn, the fleet will reduce in number, as 
six end-of-lease handbacks will be returned to lessors. 
t his gives us the opportunity to refocus the business 
on truly profitable routes and being really  
customer-orientated. 
becoming truly customer-focused is an essential part of 
our strategy. t he board decided that the ‘command and 
control’ culture that had been prevalent in Flybe had to 
change. We need to listen more to our customers, and 
importantly listen to our own employees who work with 
customers every day. Communication needs to flow 
up the organisation from customers and employees, 
as much as flow down from senior executives. Flybe 
needed a new way forward and a different culture.
Given that Flybe was entering a new phase in its 
development, we agreed that it was time for a new Chief 
executive o fficer to lead the Company. Saad Hammad 
stepped down and left the business by mutual consent 
in o ctober last year. t he board began the search for 
a new Ceo and in the interim, I took on the role of 
executive Chairman. t he search proved successful and 
in January 2017, Christine o urmieres-Widener took up 
the role of Ceo .
Christine brings a lifelong experience in aviation, having 
started her career in the maintenance department 
of Air France with a Masters degree in aeronautical 
engineering. She progressed in Air France (later Air 
France Kl M), with stints in It , sales and marketing, as 
well as general management in both the u K and uSA, 
culminating in being Ceo of CityJet, both as a subsidiary 
of Air France Kl M and later as an independent private 
company. before joining us, Christine was Chief Global 
Sales o fficer for American express Global business 
t ravel. We are very pleased to have attracted such a 
talented executive to lead our business. Christine has 
made a very strong start to her Flybe career, and gives 
her perspective on Flybe later in this report.
o ver the past 12 months, Flybe has continued to 
engage with both the u K and Scottish governments to 
support regional aviation more effectively by providing 
a level playing field versus international air travel and 
other modes of transport. We agree that penalties for 
excessive flight delays within an airline’s control are 
an important protection for passengers, but believe 
that compensation needs to have some relationship to 
the value of the ticket price, and not be, as is currently 
the case for regional airlines, often three times the 
ticket price or more. No such punitive regime exists 
for rail, road and ferry operators, nor indeed for long-
haul airlines.
“Regional aviation is  
a critical part of this  
country’s infrastructure.”
Simon Laffin
Non-executive Chairman
Compliance 
t here is a commitment to maintaining the 
highest standards of compliance with corporate 
governance so wherever possible best practice 
is followed.
Culture 
High standards of corporate governance play 
an important role in achieving organisational 
excellence and in setting the right culture.
Leadership 
A small, high quality and well-balanced board to 
provide effective leadership and vision.
Communication 
Consulting with stakeholders on key issues 
like remuneration.
Committees 
An established committee structure to assist the 
board discharge its responsibilities:
 > Audit Committee – review of the effectiveness 
of internal controls, financial reporting and 
risk management.
 > Remuneration Committee – recommendation 
of executive performance-based remuneration 
based on non-financial metrics.
 > Nomination Committee – ensure a rigorous 
and transparent process is followed for new 
directors to the board.
 > Safety and Security Committee – review and 
monitor policies and procedures to provide 
a framework of assurance for safe and 
secure operations.

Strategic r eport Flybe Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016/17 13
t he u K government’s Air Passenger Duty (APD) is also 
levied disproportionately on domestic flights. A typical 
domestic flight can be charged up to 19 times the tax 
per mile of a long-haul one. t his is doubled when a 
domestic flight is taxed twice, as APD is a u K departure 
tax, whereas a return international flight suffers this 
charge only once.
t he Scottish government is legislating to introduce 
its equivalent, Air Departure t ax (ADt ), but, while the 
Scottish National Party has promised to halve the cost, 
it has not as yet announced the rate structure. Four 
times more business in Scotland is conducted with 
the rest of the u K than europe, and more than 80% of 
visitors to Scotland are from Great britain, so reducing 
domestic ADt rates would produce significant benefits 
for the Scottish economy. Flybe earns just under 30% 
of its revenue from Scottish routes and would be keen, 
if ADt were reduced, to introduce new routes and 
more rotations to serve more Scottish customers. 
Regional aviation is a critical part of this country’s 
infrastructure. Many business trips are not practical 
by road or rail due to their slowness. Growing 
tourism in the u K requires fast, reliable regional 
connectivity. Margins are very tight in regional 
aviation, for both airports and airlines, as our results 
amply demonstrate, so raising distortive charges 
does not help either businesses or consumers. t he 
government for example says that the proposed new 
runway at l ondon Heathrow will facilitate more u K 
domestic routes. t hese will, however, not materialise 
until the economics of such routes improve, and the 
government will have to play its part in this. We have 
recently started routes from Aberdeen and edinburgh 
into l ondon Heathrow, offering more choice and 
lower fares, but the economics of even these popular 
domestic routes are tough.
Results
Revenue grew by 13.4% this year, compared to 8.7% last 
year. With the growing fleet commitments in difficult 
market conditions, Flybe showed an adjusted loss 
before tax of £(6.7)m (2015/16: £5.5m adjusted profit), 
excluding u SD loan revaluation losses of £(13.2)  m 
(2015/16: £(2.8)m). t he Group’s reported loss before 
tax was £(19.9)m (2015/16: profit of £2.7m).
We finished the year with net debt of £(64.0)m and 
total cash of £124.3m (2016: net funds £62.2m and 
cash of £171.4m).
General outlook
t he board wishes to create the best european 
regional airline, with an earnings stream that is 
resilient to consumer downturns and delivers value 
to our shareholders. 
t he general economic conditions remain difficult. 
We are, as ever, exposed to exogenous events that 
can disrupt regional air travel. With new leadership 
and impetus, we shall continue to drive costs lower 
and improve the profitability of our route network. 
Flybe plays a vital role in u K regional connectivity. 
t he board believes that our new leadership, 
differentiated competitive positioning, reducing cost 
base, strong balance sheet and disciplined growth 
strategy, will now be combined with a more customer-
focused culture and control over our own fleet size. 
t his will enable us to deliver continued progress 
in 2017/18 and position us well to drive sustainable 
profitable growth in the future.

Brexit
t he government has not yet laid out any industry-
specific brexit objectives so the exact implications 
on airlines following the u K leaving the eu are difficult 
to predict. In the worst case, if there is no agreement 
between the u K and the eu , this would mean that 
we may no longer be able to fly between the u K and 
Continental europe. We are currently assuming that 
there will be a deal to ensure that we remain a full 
member of the european safety body, eASA, in the 
interest of maintaining common safety and operating 
standards.
We have, however, now discontinued all our intra-
european routes and the situation remains unclear on 
our codeshare and White l abel arrangements as well 
as any regulatory and supply chain impacts on the FAS 
operations. It is difficult to plan as a business when the 
regulatory environment is so uncertain. However, the 
predominance of our business in u K domestic routes 
provides some protection. 
Board 
Aside from the change to our Ceo , discussed earlier, 
there were no other changes to the board during 
2016/17. As announced on 18
th
 April 2017, Philip 
de Klerk will leave us at the end of September 2017, 
primarily for personal reasons. We very much wish 
Philip well for the future and would like to thank him

Implementing a clear strategy is about returning to 
the core of what really works for the airline. We will 
make Flybe a sustainable business that operates the 
best routes and at the best times to suit the needs 
of our customers. We will stay true to our mission 
to connect people and businesses with safe, reliable 
and affordable travel.
Flybe is a regional airline with 53.7% of the u K 
domestic flights outside of l ondon, connecting people 
and regions with one another throughout the u K and 
to and from Continental europe, for both business and 
leisure. In many markets, we provide a true ‘lifeline’ 
transport service. We must fly the right routes, at 
the right times of the day and at the right times of the 
week according to the demands of the market. o ur top 
eight departure points are all in the u K and represent 
62.2% of our customers, and our top four represent 
42.9% with birmingham, Manchester, belfast City and 
Southampton leading the way.
o ur strength is not only in the point-to-point network 
but also in the connection opportunities for regions 
via Manchester, birmingham and now l ondon 
Heathrow with our increasing number of partners.
o ur maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRo ) business, 
Flybe Aviation Services, and our t raining Academy 
are core to our success. t hese two distinct but key 
support areas, with their own expertise, need to be 
managed effectively to support the future profitability 
of the Group.
l ooking beyond the u K at this stage it is neither the 
right moment, nor do the markets currently support, 
an expansion of intra-european activity (leaving aside 
brexit uncertainty).
Flybe has achieved many significant changes: a capital 
raise, a relaunched brand, the cessation of the Finland 
joint venture, the strategic project addressing legacy 
fleet issues and a strong cost-conscious culture was 
introduced to drive effective unit cost reductions. 
Despite the substantial progress in reducing the 
size of legacy fleet orders in 2015/16, Flybe has still 
seen significant capacity growth in a market where 
we witnessed slower growth in consumer demand. 
t he Company has deployed its additional capacity 
on new routes and increased frequencies on existing 
routes, solely where these deployments could deliver 
at least a contribution to direct costs. New routes 
and increased frequencies were targeted to cover 
marginal costs in the early years of operation, but 
do not contribute significantly to overall profitability. 
t he capacity growth therefore had a negative effect 
on profitability. 
Flybe reached its peak fleet size of 85 in May 2017. 
Reduction in the fleet size will start by returning six 
end-of-lease Q400s in 2017/18. t his will enable Flybe 
to become a more customer centric business and for 
the first time concentrate the business on profitable 
routes. becoming a truly demand and customer-
focused business is the key plank of our strategy.
During my first hundred days, I have met many 
stakeholders, customers, shareholders and investors. 
I had the pleasure to meet our employees and unions 
and visited many of our bases in the u K. I have 
thoroughly reviewed the strengths and weaknesses 
of the business, identified what the threats and 
opportunities are with the management team and 
developed the agenda for the coming year. 
o ur fleet size will start to decrease during 2017/18 
which allows us to enter a phase of stabilisation and 
consolidation. We need to ensure we are executing 
what we are best at and making sure everyone knows 
who Flybe is. We will deliver a controlled expansion 
mainly via the optimisation of our partnerships.
Organisation and safety culture
t he Sustainable business Improvement Plan is 
underpinned by a strong organisation and safety 
culture, aiming to ensure that every employee believes 
they can and will contribute to Flybe’s success.
Improved employee engagement will be key to 
delivering the strategy. We will regularly survey 
our employees to measure progress and adapt our 
approach as appropriate. t o support the delivery 
of our 2017/18 objectives, we will drive the right 
behaviours through the following balanced values:
 > Care and respect;
 > Customer-focused;
 > teamwork;
 > Continuous improvement; and
 > Accountability.

Sustainable Business Improvement Plan 
t he Sustainable business Improvement Plan was 
launched in April 2017 to all the key leaders and 
influencers in Flybe. t he plan is based on the following 
six pillars:
1 The customer 
t he customer will be put at the heart of everything 
we do. Sales and marketing will deliver sustainable 
revenue growth to maximise profitability while 
optimising the customer experience and improving 
the customer interface at every touch point. Flybe’s 
digital proposition will be enhanced through a strong 
digital e-commerce platform and the Flybe product 
will be developed in line with insights gathered from 
a better understanding of Flybe customers. t his 
requires significant investment and will take several 
years to deliver in full.
2 Network and fleet optimisation
We will deliver an optimised network focusing 
on positive route contribution based on customer 
and financial analytics starting from Winter 2017. 
t he delivery of the tighter network will follow 
a structured process with minimal changes once 
the schedule is published.
We intend to make a decision during this financial 
year on the long-term fleet configuration. 
3  Operational excellence with reliability and  
on-time performance
With a better understanding and knowledge of our 
customers and a demand-driven network, we need 
to improve reliability and on-time performance and 
always seek continuous improvement. We also plan 
to re-design and implement a new structure for 
our engineering organisation which remains core 
to our business. t he expert support offered by our 
t raining Academy will be important to plans to 
drive customer service and profitability.
4 Organisational excellence 
We shall design and implement a cost-effective 
organisation structure with clear and aligned KPIs 
cascaded and embedded in every role profile and 
annual performance measurement. t he basics 
need to be in place combined with a strong 
backbone of policies, processes and a transparent 
remuneration policy. 
5 Technology 
We will build further resilience into our It platform 
during 2017 and invest in the core operational 
platforms as we move towards improving the 
digital experience for passengers and implementing 
industry leading support systems for our 
engineering platforms. 
In 2018, we will move towards offering our 
customers a truly digital online experience as 
we invest in a new platform. t he new platform 
will not just benefit our customers. t he first 
phase will commence this summer when we will 
launch the electronic Flight bag which will bring 
paperless working to our flight deck, enabling 
operational data to flow more efficiently into our 
operations team.
A principal reason for customer dissatisfaction is 
the quality of our website and their interaction with 
it. o ver 80% of our customers are booking online 
via our website, with the majority being repeat 
customers. o ur new digital platform, backed by 
our sales and marketing action plan, will enable 
us to attract new customers and enhance our 
customer relationship management.
6 Costs
We will continue to look for ways to reduce costs 
at all levels of our business without hindering our 
performance and the quality service we deliver to 
our customers. 
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
Strategy
Flybe is well placed as it enters 2017/18 as it will be 
in control of its capacity going forward. Flybe has a 
clear business plan, which will form the foundation of 
a longer term plan to become the best regional airline 
in europe. As part of this plan, we will optimise our 
fleet and network, expand our partnerships, improve 
our distribution approach and optimise our customer 
proposition in the coming years.
Moving forward we will have additional opportunities 
to optimise our route network and our fleet: 
 > o ur route network will be optimised by focusing on 
domestic u K and u K to europe routes, eliminating 
underperforming routes and exploring opportunities 
through partnerships; and 
 > Regarding our fleet, we will continue our discussions 
with the regional original equipment manufacturers 
(oe Ms), both to further improve the reliability of the 
existing fleet and to explore opportunities to replace 
our existing fleet with new aircraft over time.
t he three year project to digitalise Flybe commences 
this year. o ur digital transformation will empower us
with industry standard solutions to attract more 
passengers, improve the customer journey and 
optimise our revenue per seat. t he proximity to 
our customers and our ability to serve them will be 
improved through the implementation of a long 
awaited customer relationship management suite.
I am truly passionate about the airline industry and 
I see tremendous opportunities for Flybe to connect 
and engage with communities and to establish a 
reputation for excellence in serving our customers. 
We will be successful in delivering by continually 
focusing on our costs, increasing our knowledge about 
who our customers are and what makes them tick, 
achieving industry-leading operational excellence and 
implementing a great digital platform. 
Flybe has a great future as europe’s largest regional 
airline. My team is focussed on delivering an 
exceptional customer experience and building value 
for shareholders.

Passenger revenue  
per seat
Passenger revenue per seat is 
a combination of passenger 
yield and load factor. 
 
 
Passenger revenue per seat
£50.64 15/16
£48.84 16/17
£51.35 14/15
Performance
During 2016/17 we have seen 
a 3.6% reduction in passenger 
revenue per seat, as our 
capacity grew 12.3% in a 
competitive marketplace. We 
managed to maintain our yield, 
which measures our passenger 
yield per sold seat, at £70.20 
(2015/16: £70.23). 
 
Goal
Our goal is for year-on-year 
improvement in passenger 
revenue per seat now that 
we are in control of our fleet 
and capacity.
Load factor
l oad factor is measured as 
sold seats as a percentage of 
available seat capacity. 
 
 
 
Load factor
72.6% 15/16
75.2% 14/15
69.6% 16/17
Performance
l oad factor has decreased 
by 3.0ppts due to a capacity 
increase of 12.3% and tough 
competition within the market.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Goal
r aising load factor is a 
key driver to improve 
passenger revenue per seat. 
Our s ustainable business 
improvement Plan aims to 
deliver a 75% load factor.
Reliability
A key enabler for operational 
excellence is the reliability of 
our fleet. t his is measured 
as the percentage of aircraft 
which depart within 15 minutes 
of scheduled departure time 
without a technical fault.
Reliability
98.8% 15/16
98.6% 14/15
99.0% 16/17
Performance
Investment in reliability 
modifications for the Q400 
has contributed to an 
improvement in our technical 
despatch reliability to 99.0% 
across our fleet. 
 
 
 
 
Goal
Our business plan includes 
further improvements 
to improve reliability 
above 99.0%.
On-time performance
A key measure for our 
customers is on-time 
performance, measured as the 
percentage of flights which 
arrive within 15 minutes of their 
scheduled arrival time. 
On-time performance
85.4% 15/16
84.5% 14/15
82.7% 16/17
Performance
We have seen a significant 
reduction of our on-time 
performance due to various 
reasons, including weather, 
technical issues and French 
air traffic control strikes. 
Despite this reduction, Flybe 
was named as the best u K 
airline for punctuality by o AG 
in January 2017, placing us 
sixth worldwide.
Goal
We will continue to improve 
our on-time performance in 
order to achieve our goal of 
operational excellence.
Total passenger revenue
t otal passenger revenue 
is ticket revenue plus 
ancillary revenues. 
 
 
 
Total passenger revenue
£571.7m 15/16
£528.6m 14/15
£619.3m 16/17
Performance
During 2016/17 the increase 
in sold passenger numbers 
resulted in an increase in 
passenger revenue of 8.3%. 
t his increase was partially 
due to the 12.3% growth 
in capacity. 
 
 
 
Goal
Our goal is to optimise 
total passenger revenue 
to maximise profits.
Key performance indicators 
Measuring our progress
Revenue optimisation Operational excellence
We measure passenger revenue performance in two ways: 
passenger revenue per seat and total passenger revenue.
We track three measures of operational performance: load factor, reliability  
and on-time performance.

is a non-cash item. t his is the 
adjusted profit measure used 
by Flybe (as defined in the 
Financial Review).

t he adjusted loss is as a 
direct result of the fleet being 
at its peak size, which will 
start to decrease next year, 
and passenger revenue per 
seat falling.
Goal
We aim to grow our profit 
sustainably.
EBITDAR
eb It DAR is a key metric to 
compare profitability across 
the airline industry. It measures 
operational profitability as 
it excludes items relating to 
aircraft ownership (whether 
owned or leased).

Cost reduction
We measure our cost reduction effectiveness  
by tracking unit cost performance via two cost 
per seat indicators.
We use two indicators 
to measure each  
of these.
Performance
t otal cash has reduced due to capital expenditure on fleet during the 
financial year with net debt increasing due to the debt financing of 
aircraft acquisitions in 2016/17. 
Goal
Maintaining and generating cash is a priority for f lybe alongside 
reducing debt to give a more favourable net debt and ultimately net 
funds position. 
Cost per seat  
including fuel
1
Cost per seat  
excluding fuel
1
Due to the proportion of our costs that are driven by fuel, we therefore 
measure cost per seat including fuel and also excluding fuel. We also 
look at the impact of currency through application of constant 
currency rates.
Performance
Cost per seat including fuel has increased by 2.0%, however on a 
constant currency basis it reduced by 5.2%. t he growth of the SAS 
White l abel business adds costs, which are included in the cost per 
seat calculation, whereas the additional seats are excluded from the 
seats, which is adversely impacting the cost per seat. 
Fuel costs fell by 3.6% due to falling fuel prices offsetting higher costs 
associated with increased sectors flown. Cost per seat excluding 
fuel has increased by 5.5%, however on a constant currency basis 
it reduced by 0.6%.
 
Goal
f lybe will continue to focus on cost reduction across all cost lines as 
well as optimising the use of its resources.

For profitability, we use adjusted profit before tax to exclude the non-cash impact of 
uSD aircraft loan revaluation and we use ebIt DAR which enables comparison across the 
airline industry as this measure excludes aircraft ownership costs. t o measure our progress 
on use of cash we track total cash and net funds/(debt).

o ur major legacy issues have 
been resolved, enabling us 
to now focus on making the 
business more resilient and 
customer-focused.
In addition to our existing codeshares with Aer 
l ingus, Air France, british Airways, Cathay Pacific, 
emirates, etihad and Finnair, we signed new codeshare 
agreements with Virgin Atlantic, Air India, Air berlin 
and Singapore Airlines, adding to the ‘o ne Stop to the 
World’ programme and giving our customers greater 
access to long-haul destinations via our key hubs. 
We also continued to review our relationships with 
airport partners. t he commercial arrangements with 
Cardiff, Doncaster Sheffield, exeter and Norwich to use 
the bigger e195 jets have all been fully implemented 
and are being continuously optimised. We maintained 
a strong presence at regional airports with the highest 
frequency share at airports including Manchester, 
birmingham, belfast City, exeter and Southampton.
In 2016/17 Flybe u K made an adjusted loss before 
tax of £(5.8)m (2015/16: profit of £8.8m). t his loss 
excludes Group costs of £(4.3)m (2015/16: £(5.8)  m) 
and u SD loan revaluation losses of £(13.2)m 
(2015/16: £(2.8)m). t he adjusted loss includes the 
following one-off items:
 > £4.3m intangible assets write-off;
 > £0.5m accelerated amortisation for intangible 
assets with a reduced useful economic life;
 > £(3.6)m bonus accrual released on assessment of 
2015/16 performance conditions; and
 > £(4.2)m deferred income released following 
a detailed review of historic balances.
Further detail can be found in the Financial Review 
on pages 28 to 35.
Flybe continued to review and optimise its partnerships. 
We extended our franchise partnerships by bringing 
in Channel Islands-based operator, blue Islands. 
During the year we also announced that the franchise 
arrangement with Scotland-based operator, l oganair, 
will end in Autumn 2017. In June 2017 we signed 
Heads of t erms for a new franchise and joint venture 
alliance with eastern Airways. We will continue to 
review our franchise opportunities to ensure they 
generate a positive contribution to the Flybe brand 
and our profitability.
Business review
Focusing on the customer
Flybe UK
t he legacy fleet deliveries of Q400 aircraft plus 
increased flying of the e195 jets (which contributed 
approximately half of the additional seats) lead to an 
increase in capacity of 12.3%. t he additional capacity 
was deployed on 33 new routes and an increase in 
frequency on existing routes.
t his year we served more passengers – 8.8 million, 
an increase of 7.6% – and reached 64 scheduled 
destinations. Increased competition from other 
airlines and train operators, and overcapacity of 
the market, put pressure on our yield and load factor. 
both declined, but this reduction was partially offset 
by significant cost savings made elsewhere.
Flybe – europe’s leading regional airline has 
a long relationship with birmingham Airport 
and continues to be one of our largest customers. 
t he airline fulfils a number of market roles for the 
midlands providing frequent connectivity between 
birmingham and key u K and european cities and 
off-peak travel to leisure destinations. It brings real 
competitive tension to the market which means 
that our passengers and midlands consumers get 
great choice and value for money.”

As the largest carrier linking Wales to 
major markets in the u K and europe, 
Flybe brings a unique dynamic that allows us to 
explore new opportunities to offer our customers 
a wider choice of destinations that are priced 
competitively and offered at convenient times – 
and the airline’s ever-growing network of routes at 
Cardiff is testament to this. 
As the national airport of Wales, we are committed 
to promoting both Wales as a tourism destination 
and accessible air travel from Wales across the u K, 
europe and beyond. Flybe’s provision of routes 
to key capital cities and hubs makes the airline 
an important factor in more and more of our

Business review continued
o perating on average more than 400 daily flights 
in crowded airspace, busy airports and in often 
challenging weather conditions means that such 
official, independent ot P recognition is especially 
important. We understand that time is of the essence 
for all of our customers, whether they are travelling for 
business or leisure. t ravelling with a reliable, punctual 
operator remains a key consideration for customers 
when deciding which airline to choose.
We are a truly regional airline. Most of our customers 
prefer to fly from local airports as it offers them 
convenience, easy access and a time saving 
opportunity. We have a balanced split between male 
and female passengers. We have been able to attract 
more leisure passengers last year. t his year we will

Passengers benefitting 
from more choice of flights 
between l ondon Heathrow 
and Scotland following 
the launch of new Flybe 
flights from edinburgh and 
Aberdeen
In March 2017 Flybe became 
the first regional airline to begin 
operating at l ondon Heathrow 
since 2013. t his was following a 
european Commission ruling on 
redeploying slots from british 
Airways following its merger with 
Aer l ingus. l ondon Heathrow 
also introduced a £10 reduction 
in domestic passenger charges 
in January in an effort to boost 
domestic connections at 
the airport.
Passengers flying from 
edinburgh and Aberdeen into 
l ondon Heathrow will benefit 
from more choice on these key 
routes. t he new routes offer 
convenient transfers with Flybe’s 
codeshare partners – emirates, 
Virgin Atlantic, etihad Airways 
and Singapore Airlines – plus 
connections onto the extensive 
Star Alliance network serving 44 
global destinations directly from 
l ondon Heathrow.
With our unrivalled network of 
regional airports, we continue to 
develop routes and codeshare 
relationships to connect our 
customers to destinations in 
the u K, europe and the rest 
of the world.
emphasising the role l ondon 
Heathrow plays in boosting 
communities and businesses 
across the u K, the Government 
Minister for Aviation l ord Ahmad 
of Wimbledon commented: 
“Flybe’s flights from both 
edinburgh and Aberdeen to 
l ondon Heathrow will offer 
competition, choice and vital 
trading opportunities for people 
and businesses in Scotland. 
t hese routes are good news 
for Scotland, and for britain as 
a whole, in delivering better 
regional connectivity to important 
global markets.”
From Scotland to London Heathrow
I travel most weeks to our factory in 
the north west from the south and have 
been doing so for six years. t he most efficient 
way to travel is by taking advantage of Flybe’s 
Southampton to Manchester route. Flying is by far 
the most cost-effective, quickest and hassle-free 
way to make this journey on a regular basis.
your slogan ‘faster than road or rail’ is very 
true; it is also a great deal less stressful. 
Flybe’s convenient timetable allows me to travel 
up and back in a day or the flexibility to return 
at an appropriate day and time to suit my 
business agenda.
I would also compliment Flybe on the 
professionalism of the call centre and cabin 
crew, in particular their approachable manner 
and helpful attitude. I would recommend Flybe 
whether travelling for business or pleasure 
without any hesitation.”
Chris Arthur 
o rganica (u K) l imited
Providing reliable, competitively priced, 
commercial and leisure links to our islands 
remains vital for the communities that live there. 
t he importance of Flybe in the u K domestic 
market has been highlighted in recent years with 
the continued demise/consolidation of other 
regional airlines due to their use of planes that are 
unsuitable for multi-daily rotations. t he link Flybe 
provides is so important in allowing tourists and 
leisure travellers to fly to and from the islands; but 
also for business purposes, to enable effective 
trade with the rest of the u K.”

Flybe Aviation Services (FAS)
based in exeter, Flybe Aviation Services l imited (FAS), 
is a stand-alone entity containing our maintenance, 
repair and overhaul (MRo) business. Focusing on civilian 
heavy maintenance activity, FAS provides third party 
maintenance coverage for the bAe, At R, bombardier 
and embraer aircraft types, as well as MRo services for 
Flybe’s own fleet. 
During 2016/17 FAS received more than 125 aircraft 
for maintenance in the exeter facility which covered 
over 10 different airframe types. Aircraft came from 
more than 20 different customers across five different 
continents. t he greater part of aircraft which were 
maintained came from repeat customers Finnair, 
Air baltic and Aegean. During the period FAS also 
signed agreements with three worldwide aircraft 
leasing companies, GeCAS, Falko and NAC, all of 
whom put aircraft through the facility in 2016/17.
Workload in FAS, measured by man-hours, delivered 
519,400 hours in 2016/17. Man hours on third party 
aircraft saw an increase of 7.4 ppts to 58.1% of total 
FAS work (2015/16: 50.7%) with the balance being 
work on behalf of Flybe. t he business delivered 
revenue of £50.1m and a profit before tax of £3.4m 
(2015/16: revenue £42.8m; profit before tax £2.5m). 
FAS continues to take steps to retain its position as 
a leading regional aircraft maintenance provider in 
europe, with the focus strongly placed on quality and 
timely outputs delivered through a safe environment 
and an efficient cost base. 
In addition, FAS is the leading supplier of MRo services 
to the u K’s Royal Air Force through Airbus Military. t he 
brize Norton base has continued to grow and leads the 
way globally in base maintenance activities of this type.
Flybe Training Academy
Flybe continues to develop and promote talent within 
the aviation industry through the training programmes 
it provides at its exeter t raining Academy. t he state-of-
the-art building has 26 classrooms, a simulator hall with 
two full flight l evel D simulators, embraer 170/190 cabin 
door trainer and aircraft mock-up, and an engineering 
apprentice workshop. 
t he t raining Academy is a fully approved eASA part 
147 facility for technical engineering training and is 
purpose-built for delivering pilot and cabin crew training 
programmes. During 2017/18, the number of cabin crew 
delegates increased by 10.4% to 868.

offers training for third party businesses for engineering 
(c87% of engineering delegates were third party) 
and ground operations, and can also provide hire of 
time in flight simulators. t he building also provides 
an impressive and unique setting for the training and 
conferencing requirements of local businesses.
Since 2008 the t raining Academy has hosted the 
jointly-run engineering Apprenticeship programme 
with exeter College with 180 students across the 
academic years.
Airbus, through its Defence and Space 
division, has been contracted by the u K 
Ministry of Defence (Mo D) for the servicing and 
maintenance of the Royal Air Force’s (RAF) new 
A400M Atlas strategic and tactical transport 
aircraft. Flybe Aviation Services l imited (FAS) 
was selected by Airbus as the MRo for the base 
maintenance of the fleet, and has been working 
with Airbus in support of the Royal Air Force  
on-site at RAF brize Norton, the fleet’s home 
base in oxfordshire, since 2015.
FAS is providing an agile and flexible service 
for the base maintenance of the A400M fleet, 
bringing competitive commercial practice, while 
responding to the demands of introducing a new 
military aircraft type into service. As a valued 
partner, FAS has been successfully working with 
Airbus alongside the Mo D and the RAF to ensure 
the delivery of military capability. As well as 
establishing a benchmark level of performance 
for the initial A400M scheduled C checks, FAS 
has played a key part in developing innovative 
procedures for complex maintenance tasks, such 
as the on-wing change of the aircraft’s Propeller 
Gear boxes. We look forward to strengthening 
and broadening the relationship with FAS in the 
coming years.”

 > Maintenance costs increased by 73.6% to £39.4m. 
Capacity increased by 12.3%, which along with the 
disproportionate impact of the increased flying of 
e195s which have substantially higher maintenance 
costs per hour, resulted in an increase of £7.4m 
on underlying maintenance costs. Approximately 
70% of maintenance costs are spares purchased 
in u S dollars, and the fall in the value of sterling 
contributed to an increase of c£6m in costs. 
t he remaining increase is largely driven by 
increased flying in our White l abel operation, 
which is offset by a corresponding increase 
in revenue;
 > Depreciation and amortisation increased 21.8% 
to £39.1m due to more aircraft being owned rather 
than leased. Included within the amortisation 
cost is £0.5m of accelerated amortisation on an 
identified group of intangible assets where the 
useful economic life has been reduced due to the 
planned implementation of a digital platform; and
 > Net other operating gains totalled £18.8m 
(2015/16: £7.0m) resulting from the aforementioned 
£26.0m of currency gains offset by £7.2m of losses 
on disposal of assets including £4.3m related to the 
one-off write-down of It intangibles arising from the 
new digital platform. 
t he MRo business, Flybe Aviation Services (FAS) 
generated a profit before tax of £3.4m (2015/16: 
£2.5m) as third party revenues increased 39.5% to 
£31.8m. t he A400M facility in brize Norton maintained 
its strong contribution to the FAS result. In 2017/18 it 
is anticipated that there will be a reduced contribution 
from the A400M service contract as FAS moves from 
the start-up phase into business as usual. 
Overview
t hrough deploying the added legacy fleet 
commitments along with an evolving route network 
and improved customer offering, total revenue 
increased by 13.4% to £707.4m (2015/16: £623.8m). 
Seat capacity increased by 12.3% to 12.7 million 
seats, and passenger numbers increased by 7.6% to 
8.8 million. Passenger yield (on seats sold) has been 
resilient, holding broadly flat at £70.20 but revenue 
per seat has fallen by 3.6% to £48.84, reflecting the 
increased capacity and competitive market conditions. 
o ur cost base is predominantly driven by the 12.3% 
capacity growth with operating costs increasing by 
15.4% from £615.1m to £709.8m. Costs this year are 
adversely affected by the fall in the value of sterling 
but as we hedged most of our currency requirements 
there is a total (spot and hedged) currency gain of 
£26.0m within other operating gains. At a line level, 
the main cost variances can be summarised as follows:
 > Fuel costs fell 3.6% from £104.9m to £101.1m 
with a gain of £16.0m (15.8%) arising from falling 
fuel prices (net of £7.1m of adverse u S dollar 
movements) offset by c£(12.2)m (12.1%) of higher 
costs arising due to increased flying;
 > Net airport and en route charges increased by 
26.0% to £148.2m due to a combination of higher 
airport charges, currency and increased flying;
 > Ground operations costs increased by 16.1% 
to £94.3m due to increased flying and 
currency impact;
 > Staff costs increased 15.8% to £120.2m mainly due 
to the increase in capacity and the 2.0% salary 
increase awarded as part of the three-year pay deal;
 > Aircraft rental costs increased 20.2% to £97.5m due 
primarily to the fall in sterling as most agreements 
are denominated in u S dollar, and the increase in 
capacity. At constant currency, aircraft rental costs 
numbers were c8% higher;
Flybe made an adjusted loss before tax
2
 of £(6.7)m 
(2015/16: profit of £5.5m). t his is adjusted by non-
cash revaluations on our u S dollar loans that are 
intended to be natural hedges against the value of each 
aircraft, whose value is denominated in the dollar rate 
prevailing when acquired. Including these non-cash 
revaluations, Flybe made a loss before tax of £(19.9)m 
(2015/16: profit of £2.7m). 
Flybe continues to have a strong balance sheet 
with free cash of £115.1m at the end of March 2017 
(2016: £163.6m) net of restricted cash of £9.2m 
(2016: £7.8m). Net debt at 31
st
 March 2017 was  
£(64.0)m (2016: net funds of £62.2m). t his change 
was mainly due to £140.3m of capital expenditure 
primarily reflecting the cost of buying more owned 
aircraft (£98.4m) and other capital expenditure relating 
to components (£17.8m), capitalised maintenance 
(£16.7m), plus It and other items (£7.4m).

Flybe u K’s seat capacity increased by 12.3% to 
12.7 million (2015/16: 11.3 million) with scheduled sectors 
increasing by 10.1% to 153,000 (2015/16: 139,000). 
t he increased flying of the e195 fleet contributed 
approximately half of the additional seats. Flybe served 
8.8 million customers on its network, a 7.6% increase 
(2015/16: 8.2 million). t he combination of overcapacity 
in the market, fragile consumer confidence and tough 
competition resulted in a load factor decrease from 
72.6% to 69.6%. Passenger yield held broadly flat at 
£70.20 (2015/16: £70.23) though revenue per seat 
fell from £50.64 to £48.84, reflecting the additional 
capacity and a highly competitive market.
White l abel flying increased from £13.9m to £33.0m, 
reflecting the annualisation of the White l abel

In 2014/15 Flybe entered into agreements with 
embraer S.A. (‘embraer’) and Republic Airline Inc. 
(‘Republic’) whereby the contractual commitment to 
acquire 20 (of a backlog of 24) new embraer e175 jet 
aircraft was removed and in return Flybe committed 
to sub-leasing 24 smaller used Republic Q400 aircraft 
between 2015 and 2019. In 2015/16 Flybe took delivery 
of five Republic aircraft.
Flybe subsequently entered into a contract in March 
2016 with Nordic Aviation Capital (‘NAC’), to cancel 
obligations to lease nine of the 24 used bombardier 
Q400 turboprop aircraft it was committed to under 
the terms of the embraer and Republic agreement, 
and in return to take ownership of 10 Q400 aircraft it 
was under contract to lease, for a cash consideration 
of u SD131.8m (£103.0m). t his earned Flybe a return on 
capital employed of c12% and provided much greater 
flexibility for aircraft deployment or divestment. of the 
10 aircraft, five were delivered in 2015/16, and another 
five Q400 have been delivered in 2016/17. As at

t he Group is required to purchase carbon allowances 
for all flights departing from and arriving into the eu 
in order to offset its carbon footprint in each calendar 
year. Flybe manages its exposure by purchasing 
carbon emissions allowances through a forward

Change
%
Revenue 50.1 42.8 17.1
o perating costs (46.7) (40.3) 15.9
Profit before tax 3.4 2.5 36.0
Revenue increased by 17.1% to £50.1m (2015/16: £42.8m), 
of which £31.8m was for third party customers (2015/16: 
£22.8m), a 39.5% increase. In the previous year, we 
had more Flybe related work as we brought the e195s 
back into service. In 2017/18, we expect less third party 
customer revenue as the A400M brize Norton contract 
moves from the start-up phase into the business as 
usual phase and also the MRo will be heavily involved 
in the handback of leased aircraft. Man-hours reduced 
5.2% from 547,600 in 2015/16 to 519,400 in 2016/17. 
t he increase in revenue generating capacity resulted 
in a 15.9% increase in operating costs from £40.3m 
to £46.7m.
Group costs
Group costs of £(4.3)m (2015/16: £(5.8)m) include 
Group board salary costs and Group-related legal and 
professional fees. t he decrease year-on-year is primarily 
due to a £3.6m staff bonus accrual release offset by a 
£1.2m increase to share-based payments costs.
Cost per seat including fuel increased by 2.0% to 
£53.74, though on a constant currency basis reduced 
by 5.2%. excluding fuel, cost per seat increased 5.5% 
to £45.76 but fell 0.6% on a constant currency basis. 
Fuel
Flybe u K’s results are impacted by movements in the 
price of fuel which forms a significant variable cost 
for the business. brent crude per barrel has been in 
the u SD37 to u SD58 range (2016: u SD27 to uSD68) 
for the period, with the average price over the period 
being u SD50 (2016: uSD49). t he price of jet fuel has 
traded between uSD351 and u SD550 (2016: uSD271 
and u SD645) per tonne. Aviation fuel prices remain 
capable of large and unpredictable movements due to 
a variety of external factors, such as changes in supply 
and demand for oil and oil-related products, and the 
role of speculators and funds in the futures markets.
During 2016/17, Flybe u K used some 206,897 tonnes 
of jet fuel, an increase of 19.4% on the 173,254 tonnes 
used in the prior year. Fuel burn decreased to 14.9kg 
per seat for 2016/17 (2015/16: 15.2kg). t he average 
market price during the period was u SD470 per tonne 
(2015/16: u SD470), with the Group paying a blended 
rate (net of hedges) of u SD556 per tonne (2015/16: 
u SD826). Including ‘into plane’ costs, Flybe’s fuel costs 
in 2016/17 of £101.1m (2015/16: £104.9m) represent an 
all-in cost of u SD637 per tonne (2015/16: u SD911).
Flybe u K operates a policy of managing fuel price 
volatility by entering into derivative contracts 
representing a portion of its aviation fuel requirements 
a minimum of 12 months forward from the current 
date. t he intention of this programme is to provide 
a significant element of certainty over its forthcoming 
fuel costs. As at 31
st
 March 2017, 83.2% of the fuel 
requirement for 2017/18 was hedged at an average 
price of u SD489 per tonne. t aking into account our 
hedged position, each u SD50 increase/decrease in 
the price of jet fuel reduces/improves Group profits 
in 2017/18 by £1.0m.
(Loss)/profit before and after tax
t he Group’s reported loss before tax was £(19.9)m 
(2015/16: profit of £2.7m).
t he Group’s adjusted loss before tax and u SD 
aircraft loans revaluation was £(6.7)m (2015/16: profit 
of £5.5m).
t he reported loss after tax was £(26.7)m (2015/16: 
profit of £6.8m). t he deferred tax charge was 
£(6.8)  m (2015/16: tax credit of £4.1m) reflecting the 
non-  recognition of temporary timing differences on 
capital allowances.
EPS and dividends
t he loss per share for the year was (12.3) pence 
(2015/16: earnings per share of 3.1 pence).
No dividends were paid or proposed in either 2016/17

Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased from £6.0m to £17.5m 
mainly due to a £(13.2)m non-cash, non-underlying 
loss on the retranslation of u S dollar-denominated 
debt used to fund the acquisition of aircraft 
(2015/16: £(2.8)m). u nder International Financial 
Reporting Standards, u S dollar aircraft are non-
monetary assets and are therefore held at the rate 
as at the date of acquisition, whereas the u S dollar 
liability is a monetary item and is retranslated at each 
month end and therefore Flybe does not have a natural 
offset. t his income statement loss of £(13.2)m has 
therefore been removed in arriving at adjusted (loss)/
profit before tax. o ther net finance costs increased 
by £1.1m due to the increase in aircraft loan financing.
Foreign exchange
t he Group foreign currency hedging policy has an 
objective to reduce the volatility of costs. Flybe 
manages its foreign exchange positions based on its 
net foreign currency exposure, being foreign currency 
expenditure less associated revenue. Historically 
treasury policy capped hedging at 90%, though 
treasury policy now allows hedging up to 100% to 
protect against increased risks to profit. t he Group 
currently has a relatively small net exposure to the 
euro, but has significant u S dollar costs in relation to 
fuel, maintenance, aircraft operating leases and loan 
repayments. t he Group generates no significant u S 
dollar revenue and actively manages its u S dollar 
position through a foreign exchange forward purchase 
programme similar to that outlined for fuel. t he post-
brexit deflation of sterling has been largely mitigated 
due to hedging levels.
As at 31
st
 March 2017, 85.8% of Flybe’s anticipated 
u S dollar requirements for 2017/18 were hedged at 
an average exchange rate of u SD1.42. All existing 
derivative financial instruments are cash flow hedges. 
t aking into account our hedged position, each 
u SD 0.05 reduction/improvement in the u S dollar 
exchange rate has the effect of reducing/increasing 
Flybe u K’s profits in 2017/18 by approximately £1.1m.

Country and currency risk
Flybe operates in a global marketplace. Most of Flybe’s 
customers are based in the u K and Continental europe, 
although the MRo business also has customers from 
Africa, the Middle east and the central Asian republics. 
Most of Flybe’s revenues are derived from u K-based 
customers (82.7% of Group revenue). Aircraft are 
bought and sold in u S dollars as are other key costs 
such as fuel, lease costs, maintenance and aviation 
insurance. Airport and en route charges are payable 
in a mix of sterling and euros. t his is further considered 
in the principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 
36 to 41 and note 33 ‘Financial instruments’.
Going concern
Flybe’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position, are set out in the Chairman’s and Chief 
executive o fficer’s statements on pages 10 to 17. 
t he financial position of the Group, its cash flows and 
liquidity position, and events since the balance sheet 
date are described on page 151, and in the Financial 
Review on pages 28 to 35. In addition, note 33 covers 
Flybe’s financial risk management objectives, details 
of its financial instruments and hedging activities and 
its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Flybe had free cash balances of £115.1m at 31
st
 March 
2017, and has met all of its operating lease commitments 
and debt repayments as they have fallen due during 
the year.
Flybe faces trading risks presented by current 
economic conditions in the aviation sector, particularly 
in relation to passenger volumes and yields and the 
associated profitability of individual routes. In addition, 
the Group is exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices and 
foreign exchange rates. As of 5
th
 June 2017, we had 
purchased 83.9% of our anticipated fuel requirements 
and 88.1% of our anticipated u S dollar requirements for 
the following 12 months.
t he directors have prepared a detailed trading budget 
and cash flow forecast for a period which covers at 
least 12 months after the date of approval of these 
financial statements.
t he Group generated £33.5m from operating activities 
excluding the increase in restricted cash of £1.4m to give 
a net cash inflow from operating activities of £34.9m 
(2016: £53.9m excluding the £10.2m fall in restricted 
cash to give a net cash inflow from operating activities 
of £64.1m). See the cash flow statement on page 116 for 
the breakdown of cash inflow from operating activities. 
Restricted cash increased from £7.8m to £9.2m almost 
entirely due to the adverse foreign exchange impact of 
sterling against the uS dollar. 
Net capital expenditure included outflows of £(134.6)  m 
on purchases of property, plant and equipment 
plus an outflow of £(5.7)m for intangible software 
additions (2016: total capital expenditure of £(65.6)m 
plus a reduction on pre-delivery deposits of £1.3m to 
give a net outflow of £(64.3)m).
Net inflow on borrowings of £64.5m was as a result 
of £84.3m of new borrowings offset by £(19.8)m of 
repayments (2016: repayments of £(12.8)m). In the year 
there was a £3.3m outflow of cash to acquire shares, 
which are held by the employee benefit t rust, to cover 
the Flybe Share Incentive Plan.
t otal cash was £124.3m at the year-end (2016: £171.4m).

Having considered the forecasts and making 
other enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that Flybe has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. t hus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.
Viability statement
t he directors have assessed Flybe’s viability over 
a three-year period to March 2020. While the board 
believes that the Company will be viable over a longer 
period, three years is the period considered most 
appropriate to form a reasonable expectation of the 
Company’s viability. t his period is supported by the 
three-year business plan enabling the forecasting 
assumptions to be aligned.
In making their assessment, the directors took account 
of Flybe’s current financial and operational positions. 
t hey also assessed the potential financial and 
operational impacts, in severe but plausible scenarios, 
associated with the principal risks and uncertainties 
set out on pages 36 to 41 and the likely effect on the 
Company’s prospects and viability.
based on this assessment, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group will be able to continue to operate, meet all their 
liabilities as they fall due and have a viable business 
model during the three-year period to March 2020.
In making this statement, the directors have also made 
the following key assumptions on the basis that it 
would not be meaningful to attempt to measure the 
impact of major events occurring in these areas:
 > Funding for capital expenditure in the form of 
capital markets debt, bank debt, or aircraft leases 
will remain available;
 > t here will not be a prolonged grounding of the 
Flybe fleet or a substantial proportion thereof; and
 > t here will neither be a significant change in 
government regulation nor significant problems 
arising from brexit.

t he £287.3m of net book value of aircraft represents 
owned aircraft, engines and aircraft modifications. 
t he increase of £95.0m is mainly due to the increase 
in owned aircraft complemented by the capital 
expenditure on new components and capitalised 
maintenance. 
Net debt, representing total cash offset by borrowings, 
totals £(64.0)m at 31
st
 March 2017 compared to net 
funds of £62.2m at 31
st
 March 2016. Debt is greater 
due to the increase in owned aircraft from 17 owned at 
31

 March 2016 to 27 owned at 31
st
 March 2017. t he net 
debt calculation at 31
st
 March 2017 includes restricted 
cash of £9.2m (2016: £7.8m) which represents 
predominantly cash deposits held as security in 
favour of aircraft lessors. 
t he mark-to-market valuation of derivative financial 
instruments improved from a net liability of £(9.9)m at 
31
st
 March 2016 to a net asset of £24.5m at 31
st
 March 
2017, reflecting positive moves in Flybe’s portfolio of 
net currency and fuel hedging contracts. Net current 
liabilities decreased from £(123.5)m to £(116.4)m 
largely due to increased trade and other payables. 
t he balance sheet also includes the impact of the 
defined benefit pension scheme deficit of £20.8m 
(2016: £15.3m) which is included in other non-current 
assets and liabilities above. t his scheme is closed to 
future benefit accrual. t he year-on-year increase in the 
deficit is primarily due to the fall in the discount rates 
arising since the brexit referendum.
t he triennial valuation at 31
st
 March 2016 has now 
been agreed with the t rustees at a deficit of £(12.2)m. 
t he revised recovery plan will result in Flybe making 
contributions of £0.83m per annum (previously £0.5m 
per annum). t he next valuation will be at 31

management processes within the Flybe Aviation 
Services maintenance organisation, as well as other 
service providers.
t he Flybe Safety Management System (SMS)  
co-ordinates all safety activity across the Flybe 
operation. t his allows safety data derived from both 
normal operations and safety events to be used in 
the review of operational procedures and training. 
t he SMS is reviewed on a monthly basis at the 
Safety and Security Review board chaired by the 
Accountable Manager, Flybe’s Chief o perations 
o fficer, l uke Farajallah.
Flybe, as a member of IAt A, is required to maintain 
International o perational Safety Audit (Io SA) 
accreditation. t he airline underwent its last Io SA 
renewal audit during May 2015 and is accredited 
through to September 2017, having been on the 
registry since 2007. Io SA utilises internationally 
recognised standards and recommended practices 
(totalling more than 900) against which the airline is 
audited to demonstrate Flybe has both documented 
procedures and implemented practices. Preparation 
is under-way for the next renewal audit, scheduled 
for May 2017.
We have a strong commitment 
to the well-being of our

t he internal compliance monitoring function oversees 
all operational activity and consists of two teams. 
t he first is dedicated to the airline, covering:
 > t he Air o perator’s Certificate;
 > Approved t raining o rganisation;
 > eASA Part M, aircraft continuing airworthiness; and
 > Part 21J, for a design organisation. 
t he second team is dedicated to the Flybe Aviation 
Services (FAS) maintenance organisation and covers:
 > Part 145, for an aircraft maintenance organisation;
 > Part 147, for an engineering licence type training 
organisation; and
 > Part 21G, for a production organisation.
both the airline compliance monitoring manager and 
the FAS quality manager have a direct line of report 
to their respective accountable managers who have 
overall responsibility for the safe operation of Flybe and 
FAS activities under civil aviation legislation in the u K.
Safety and security management
Flybe continues to demonstrate its commitment to 
developing, implementing and constantly improving 
strategies and processes aiming to deliver our aviation 
activities to the highest level of safety and security 
performance, while delivering our services against 
the corporate goals.
Everyone at Flybe promises to: 
• Identify and report risks, ‘near misses’ and hazards before they become incidents. 
• Report openly any safety event. 
• Understand the risk to themselves and others before engaging in a task. 
•  Work as one Purple team to improve continuously our safety culture and  
performance.
THE FLYBE  
SAFETY PROMISE
Safety with no compromise is one of core values.
Flybe’s Safety Promise recognises that safety and 
security are everyone’s personal responsibility whether 
a colleague, customer, contractor, visitor or supplier. 
All employees are accountable for the Group’s safety 
and security performance. In addition, managers 
ensure that our Safety Policy is implemented and 
understood by all employees and contractors. 
Reporting processes and systems that were 
implemented in 2015, along with company-wide 
encouragement given to all Group members and 
service partners to further increase hazard and 
near-miss safety reporting, has led to overall 
safety reporting levels near doubling. t his increase 
in reporting has led to improved information in 
identifying hazards, quantifying the risks associated 
with these and taking actions to eliminate or mitigate 
these risks to acceptable levels. 
All personnel are encouraged to report any safety 
or security issue, irrespective of the cause, in the 
knowledge that Flybe operates in an open, fair 
and balanced way with all incidents investigated 
objectively and thoroughly.

Creating a fair, transparent and consistent 
working environment 
Fairness and transparency 
Flybe is committed to creating a working environment 
in which our employees feel valued and fairly 
treated. We understand the importance of fairness 
and transparency and as such we are implementing 
a review of salary and benefits for all head office 
employees.
t his review will result in the development of defined 
work levels that will be assigned a salary range and 
suite of benefits, including a tailored programme of 
learning and development. t his will ensure that each 
employee has clarity on how they will be remunerated 
and what their progression pathway opportunities are.
Support
t he welfare of our employees is of ultimate importance 
to Flybe and we pride ourselves on the breadth of 
support services that we offer to all employees, ranging 
from our employee Assistance Programme to childcare 
vouchers. In order to ensure our employees are 
supported and enabled effectively, we have established 
the employee Welfare Forum, consisting of key 
operational stakeholders from across the business. 
t he objective of the forum is to align the support 
services we offer our employees into one central hub to 
evaluate their effectiveness and to align and strengthen 
the suite of policies that underpin them. 
Enable
Creating learning and development opportunities to 
cultivate our greatest resource, our people, is a priority 
as we move into the next financial year. o ur learning and 
development plan includes bringing non-operational 
training in-house at our t raining Academy in exeter. 
We are designing training which will be aligned to the 
work levels created by our benchmarking programme 
to ensure development of our employees so they have 
the right skills for their role and a pathway of future 
learning opportunities.
t his is an ambitious project which will be phased in over 
the next two years. o ur first focus will be developing 
our range of management training to ensure that all 
of our managers are fully equipped to support and 
enable their employees to succeed. o ur learning and 
development programme will produce consistency 
in the training available as well as a great range 
of opportunities for Flybe employees to develop 
their skills.
We are embracing the forthcoming Apprenticeship 
l evy for internal development, meaning we are able 
to offer training and development through tailored 
apprenticeship programmes.
We have a revitalised Performance Development 
Review (‘PDR’) process to ensure that every employee 
fully understands, and is aligned to, our strategy, 
operational plan, their department objectives and the 
requirements of their role. t his will ensure complete 
organisation-wide alignment to a suite of metrics, 
enabling all employees to contribute to the overall 
success of the business. t his is also the opportunity 
to review employees’ progress, future development, 
career opportunities and any training needs. PDRs are 
undertaken annually, supported by mid-year reviews, 
regular one-to-ones and departmental briefings.

At the start of the 2017/18 financial year, we invited 
all of our employees to take part in a survey to 
select the top five values to become the foundation 
of a high-performance environment and culture. 
t he survey feedback was shared and discussed with 
the top 150 managers at our April l eadership event, 
be.Inspirational, where the values were refined into 
defined behaviours and ways of working. t hese 
values are being embedded in all HR-related tools and 
processes, from recruitment and induction to training, 
PDRs and rewards. t his will ensure that the entire 
organisation is aligned to a defined, high-performance 
culture and agreed ways of working at every step. 
Health and safety management
t he health and safety of customers, employees and 
contractors of Flybe receives equal focus, and as much 
attention as any other aspect of the business operations. 
Flybe has a commitment to deliver the highest level of 
quality in health and safety management. Flybe’s goal 
is for zero avoidable accidents to its workforce and 
customers. t he Flybe management team continues 
to demonstrate its commitment to health and safety 
through proactive initiatives and close liaison with 
staff and union safety representatives. 
Health and safety is incorporated into the Flybe 
SMS and overseen by the Flybe Health and Safety 
Committee, which itself reports ultimately into the 
Safety and Security Committee. Flybe’s policy for 
health and safety is defined in the Health, Safety 
and environment manual. In turn this shapes the 
procedures throughout the organisation which 
define how the policy is implemented within each 
department. t he policies and procedures are drawn up 
with the involvement of union safety representatives 
and Flybe’s People team, and are subject to oversight 
by the Flybe Health and Safety Committee. As part 
of this drive for continuous improvement the Health, 
Safety and environment manual, which details all 
of the Company’s systems and procedures for safe 
working, has been reviewed and improved.
o ver the last year, Flybe employees have been 
undertaking ‘Do t he Right t hing’ training. t his is 
an in-house training course, which is the next stage 
in our strategy for health and safety training. t he 
Flybe Safety Promise sets out our commitment to 
health and safety and leads everything we do. Purple 
Safety t raining then incorporates the promise into 
everyday working life by heightening the awareness 
of hazards and the risks they pose. ‘Do t he Right 
t hing’ then moves the strategy directly into the 
workplace by focusing on behaviours and the day-
to-day application of safe working practices, all part 
of our co-ordinated approach to all aspects of safety, 
security and health and safety management processes 
across the Group.

Human rights
Flybe operates entirely with employees based in the 
eu under the e uropean Convention on Human Rights. 
Detailed policies and procedures exist, among others, 
around:
 > equality and diversity;
 > Grievances;
 > Disciplinary procedures;
 > Whistle-blowing;
 > Harassment and bullying;
 > bribery; and
 > Modern slavery.
In addition, Flybe uses its relationship with its 
employees to raise, air and resolve issues, whether 
this is through ‘t own Halls’, o pen Channel or its 
established, recognised trade unions.
Flybe also provides the employee Assistance 
Programme with a confidential helpline available with 
free help and support available for every stage on the 
employee’s journey through life.
Benefits
Flybe aims to provide fixed and variable pay, and short 
and long-term benefits (including insured benefits) 
that are affordable, competitive in the marketplace, 
performance-led and flexible. 
u K employees have been able to participate in the 
Group’s Share Incentive Programme (‘SIP’) under 
which all eligible employees were awarded 100 free 
shares shortly after Flybe’s IPo . In August 2016, all 
eligible employees were awarded 5% of their salary in 
shares under the same scheme.
Flybe operates a group personal pension plan 
and more than 90% of employees have elected to 
participate and benefit from employer’s contributions 
to their personal fund. Flybe has salary sacrifice 
schemes including the Cycle Scheme, buying extra 
days off work and childcare vouchers.
In addition to this, we also offer a rewards platform 
called ‘Purple t ake o ff’, which is an online employee 
benefits portal where our employees can find 
attractive discounts and offers to help them save 
money on a range of products and services.
Engage
We are implementing our next employee engagement 
survey in Q2 2017/18, to ensure we have a clear 
picture of the motivations, needs and expectations 
of our people. From this survey we will produce our 
engagement Plan.
In the u K, in addition to active engagement with its 
recognised trade union partners, Flybe uses its internal 
consultative forum o pen Channel to engage and listen 
to our employees. o pen Channel meets quarterly, is 
chaired by a member of the executive Committee and 
is attended by up to 15 elected representatives from 
different departments and locations and members of 
the management team.
o ur new communications plan will include ‘t own Hall’ 
live-streamed call-ins from employees. t he executive 
Committee will answer questions in real time over the 
phone, without pre-preparation, enabling employees 
to get open and authentic responses to their 
questions. t his forum is a good example of how we  
are promoting a listening and empowering culture. 
Senior management has continued with regular base 
visits across our network to engage with our people. 
In addition to this, our Purple l eadership t eam meets 
on a regular basis to discuss, share and agree on the 
dissemination of information and key messages  
to our people.
Regular updates from our Ceo and news stories 
are published on our intranet PurpleNet ensuring 
employees are kept up to date and well informed.
Equality and diversity 
Flybe recognises the value of a truly diverse workforce, 
and is proud to have the highest percentage of female 
pilots of any u K-based airline. However, we are always 
striving to do more to promote diversity, and welcome 
and encourage applications from candidates from all 
backgrounds and candidates with disabilities.
We are developing a diversity strategy, supported 
by a leading, global aviation network. Additionally, 
in 2017/18 we are conducting an analysis of the 
distribution of men and women within pay quartiles, 
and the difference between men’s and women’s pay 
throughout the business, regardless of position. t he 
results of the analysis will be published on the Flybe 
website and a government-sponsored website. t his 
will comply with the equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay 
Gap Information) Regulations 2017. We are committed 
to discovering gaps, if they exist, in men’s and women’s 
pay in Flybe. by developing a thorough understanding 
of why these gaps exist we can implement a process 
to minimise them. We hope that this will improve our 
ability to attract, recruit and retain talented women in 
the business.

Community and charitable activities
Flybe undertakes a number of community and 
charitable activities. t hese are focused on supporting 
the local communities where the Company is based, as 
well as harnessing the fundraising power of employees 
and customers.
Flybe has sponsored a number of local community 
events and activities. t hese include:
 > Shirt sponsor, exeter City FC, now believed to be 
the longest-standing shirt sponsorship in the english 
Football l eague;
 > Flybe extended its long-standing sponsorship of the 
exeter Chiefs Rugby Football Club, and its logo is 
featured on the back of the Premiership top division 
team’s shirts, as well as on signboards around 
the pitch;

Sponsorship of local sporting teams
Flybe has partnerships 
with both the exeter Chiefs 
Rugby Club (the Chiefs) 
and exeter City Football 
Club (the Grecians). both 
teams excelled in their 
respective leagues  
this season. 
t he Flybe brand is communicated 
through the Chiefs and Grecians 
both in terms of the games played, 
but also through their off-field 
activities in and around the 
community. We are proud to  
be associated with both clubs.
Football in the Community Charity
t he work of the Football in the 
Community Charity covers a huge 
variety of activities ranging from:
 > Having nearly 100 students 
in full time education 
at the club studying for 
NVQ, bte C, Foundation 
Degree qualifications and 
apprenticeships; 
 > being a major part of the City’s 
‘Respect’ campaigns, aimed at 
removing all forms of prejudice 
across all equality strands;
 > Managing running clubs, keep-
fit groups, ‘walking football’, 
table tennis groups and multi-
sports coaching for schools; 
 > Setting up and mentoring 
football teams to play in local 
leagues; 
 > Working with and teaching 
life skills to sheltered housing 
communities, young offenders 
and people with mental health 
problems; 
 > Helping young people excluded 
from mainstream education 
re-engage with schooling 
and society;
o ne of the benefits to 
Flybe’s partnership with 
exeter City Football Club 
is that our sponsorship 
helps the club’s multi-
award winning Football 
in the Community Charity 
continue its inspiring work, 
which touches the lives 
of over 50,000 people 
per year.
t he club’s community team 
works across the region and 
centres its efforts into the 
four main areas of Health and 
Wellbeing, Sports Participation, 
education and Social Inclusion. 
t he Football in the Community 
Charity is the fifth largest 
charity in the region, with over 
30 full time staff employed and 
turnover greater than £1m for 
community activity.
 > Running ‘t iny t ots’ classes 
aimed at introducing the 
very young to not just core 
balance, but integrating into 
groups and taking instructions 
from other adults and not just 
parents; and
 > t he team also provides 
wheelchair football, football 
for the blind and visually 
impaired and runs teams for 
those with learning difficulties 
and low-level mental 
health issues. 
exeter City’s Football in the 
Community Charity team is used 
and endorsed by a wide range of 
civic and educational bodies to 
deliver social, health and fitness 
projects across the area. t he 
programme has a close working 
relationship with both exeter 
College and u niversity, which 
provide educational and facilities 
resources, furthering the team’s 
reach into the community. 
t he team also links with key 
partners across the area’s 
professional spectrum. 
t he Flybe brand is carried in 
a variety of ways into much of 
this work of course, but the real 
value is in the work and projects 
carried out by the charity, 
meaning that by association with 
them, Flybe is also recognised 
as being part of the community, 
rather than just a name on 
an aircraft. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

every flight; 
Cancer Research u K and Flybe have worked 
in partnership since 2008, raising over 
£725,000 for life-saving research to beat cancer 
sooner. each year, Flybe has held at least two 
dedicated months of on-board collections in aid 
of Cancer Research u K as well as supporting the 
charity through employee fundraising, gifts in kind 
and joint PR initiatives. In 2016/17, Flybe’s staff 
and passengers generously donated over £97,000 
through key initiatives including Cancer Research 
u K’s Kids and t eens campaign, which raises money 
for research into cancers affecting children, teens 
and young adults. 
We’re delighted that Flybe has taken the decision 
to begin collections on every Flybe-operated 
flight throughout the year. Cancer Research u K 
receives no government funding, so funds raised 
through partners like Flybe are crucial to the work 
of doctors, nurses and scientists who work day 
and night to fight cancer on all fronts. We are very 
grateful for Flybe’s longstanding commitment to 
Cancer Research u K and support of our ambition 
to bring forward the day when all cancers are

Fuel usage and emissions
t he airline has a very strong Flight efficiency Strategy 
across all of its fleets which was introduced in 2009 
and is continually being updated. t he flight efficiency 
initiatives derived from this strategy are being 
constantly reviewed to ensure that the consumption of 
fuel is a major focus. All Flybe crews are aware of these 
initiatives and they are reinforced through standard 
operating procedures.
Some of the initiatives that have been successful in 
reducing fuel burn are:
 > o ptimal flight planning with accurate fuel predictions 
for all phases of flight: climb, cruise and descent; and
 > t echniques to operate each aircraft to achieve 
maximum efficiencies which include: calculating 
and flying most efficient cruise speeds to optimise 
performance with best fuel consumption; low 
power/low drag continuous descent approaches; 
delayed engine start and single-engine taxi on 
all fleets.
In addition, all the aircraft are now nearly paperless 
which means no heavy manuals or charts and the 
ability to use more intuitive information to assist the 
Flight efficiency Strategy through the medium of the 
electronic Flight bag. 
With all these techniques to hand, which in isolation 
only provide small efficiencies, given the size of the 
fleets and the number of rotations per day this soon 
adds up to operational fuel savings. t he reduced fuel 
burn directly correlates to reduced Co
2
 emissions. 
Environment 
Flybe has always made a commitment to 
environmental sustainability and operates one of 
the most environmentally-sensitive fleets in aviation. 
o ur goal is to reduce both noise and emissions for 
each flight. 
According to the intergovernmental panel on climate 
change, aviation accounts for around 2% of global Co
2
 
emissions. Flybe is therefore committed to being an 
industry leader in minimising its environmental impact, 
while continuing to provide a safe and punctual 
product to our customers. We are proud of our multi-
million-dollar investment in the aircraft fleets in recent 
years, which has modernised our operations and given 
us the ability to take advantage of the extra flight 
efficiency features that these aircraft have. 
Flybe is among one of the world’s largest operators 
of the bombardier Q400, which is one of the most 
economic turboprop passenger aircraft. Flybe is able 
to take advantage of its extensive knowledge of this 
aircraft type having operated it for over 15 years. 
Noise
t he Q400 and the At R72 are two of the quietest 
passenger turboprop aircraft in the world. Inside 
both, Active Noise and Vibration Suppression systems 
significantly reduce noise and vibration, making 
them as quiet and comfortable as a jet. o utside, they 
are also considerably quieter than jets with a similar 
number of seats. 
Flybe understands that noise from any aircraft can 
have a major impact on local communities living and 
working close to airports. It is committed to doing 
everything it can to ensure the operation of the aircraft 
fleets is done in such a way to minimise unnecessary 
noise. t his includes ensuring Noise Preferential 
Routings are flown, the prescribed climb techniques 
are followed and low power/low drag approaches 
are practised. t he use of auxiliary power units is also 
assessed to reduce noise at airports. t o ensure that 
Flybe can achieve this, it works very closely with 
the airport authorities and also the air traffic service 
providers to ensure the most efficient techniques can 
be facilitated safely at each airport.
t he embraer e-Jet is one of the most modern regional 
aircraft available on the market. It is designed to 
operate in the short-haul, low-cost environment and 
sets new standards in operating costs, fuel efficiency, 
environmental performance, and in-flight cabin 
services. t his complements the Q400 which can be 
utilised on shorter routes.
t he At R72-600 is the newest aircraft in the Flybe fleet 
and is used for the Swedish SAS White l abel operation 
in Sweden. It is also the current At R derivative 
and has many enhanced features which reduce its 
environmental impact. 
Flybe’s policy is to continue to commit to a system 
for managing the environmental impact of its fleet in 
order to comply with all applicable current legislation 
and, where practical, seek to meet future legislative 
requirements ahead of relevant deadlines.

Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (‘ESOS’)
As part of the eu e nergy efficiency Directive (ee D) 
the u K government introduced the eSo S which is 
a mandatory scheme for large organisations. t he 
scheme is administered by the environment Agency 
and applies throughout the u K and focuses on energy 
assessment and energy-saving identification.
As part of the scheme Flybe has contracted a third 
party ‘eSo S energy’ which has conducted a two-
stage audit of Flybe’s energy use and identified 
opportunities for potential energy saving. t hese 
opportunities are being assessed by an in-house team 
for their potential implementation.
Environmentally-friendly techniques 
Management of buildings have incorporated, wherever 
possible, environmentally-friendly techniques such 
as rainwater harvesting and a ‘living’ roof on part of 
the Flybe t raining Academy site. t he facility, which is 
powered by its own combined heat and power unit, 
uses an eco-friendly ventilation system to heat and 
cool the building.
Emissions Trading Scheme (‘ETS’)
Since the introduction of aviation into the european 
et S on 1
st
 January 2012, Flybe has complied fully 
with the requirements of the scheme to submit an 
independently verified report of its Co
2
 emissions 
and purchase equivalent carbon allowances under the 
scheme to offset its carbon footprint. 
Flybe supports initiatives which provide for an 
international framework for governing aviation 
emissions so long as this is consistent with, and not 
supplementary to, the european et S. It remains 
concerned about the imposition of specific aviation 
taxes, some of which purport to be linked to 
environmental objectives. Flybe has campaigned for 
some time for the reform of u K Air Passenger Duty 
and for the per passenger tax to be replaced with a 
per plane tax which is linked to aircraft emissions and 
deployment. 
Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) Emissions Report
t he directors of Flybe Group plc present the 
greenhouse gas emissions report for the Group for 
the year ended 31
st
 March 2017. Flybe’s GHG emissions 
data is intended to comply with the reporting 
requirements of the Climate Change Act 2008. 
emissions include all data reported from Flybe l imited 
and Flybe Aviation Services l imited (the trading 
subsidiaries of Flybe Group plc).
t he information presented follows the 2013 u K 
government environmental reporting guidance. 
t he Group has also adopted the GHG Protocol Value 
Chain (Scope 3) Standard, but Flybe is not as yet 
able to report on all categories that may be relevant. 
t he figures relate to the required elements of each 
Scope 3 category and some of the optional elements.

Intensity measurements
t he Group’s carbon emissions are principally made 
up of emissions from flying activities. In order to allow 
comparison between its peers, the chosen measurement 
is emissions per passenger kilometre flown. 
For 2016/17, the Group’s total emissions per passenger 
kilometre were 149.4 g/km (2015/16: 144.9 g/km) due 
to the reduction in load factor in 2016/17.

Chairman’s statement on corporate governance
The Board has once again reviewed its own structure 
and performance. We continue to believe that a small 
well-balanced Board, with a high quality management 
team and a majority of committed, diverse, informed 
and energetic n on-executive Directors, is the most 
effective leadership team for this c ompany. We 
expect all Board members to contribute to general 
discussion and strategy, as well as bringing specialist 
knowledge and experience.
Last year’s Board evaluation suggested that the 
Board would benefit from more diversity, particularly 
another female member, as well as more marketing 
and IT experience. A search was started but did 
not succeed in identifying a suitable candidate. 
Meanwhile the recruitment of c hristine o urmieres-
Widener as ceo has, in the opinion of the Board, 
satisfied this need. The Board will continue to review 
its composition to ensure that we have the right 
composition for the business for the future.
Following a selection process, in May 2017 an 
external consultant, Radojka Miljevic (who has no 
other connection with Flybe) of c ampbell Tickell, 
was appointed to conduct a full board and committee 
effectiveness evaluation. Initially this was scheduled 
for early 2017, but the change of c hief executive 
o fficer meant that the process was put on hold 
pending c hristine’s appointment. The evaluation 
will be conducted over the Summer and will include 
reviews of each director’s performance as well as 
a review of how the Board works as a whole.
We will continue to review our remuneration policies in 
the light of best practice and our shareholders’ views. 
c hanges to our remuneration are listed in full in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
All shareholders are very much encouraged to attend 
the AGM in July where the directors will be available 
to meet shareholders directly and to discuss any 
matters of importance to them. Additional materials 
such as annual and interim reports, results and other 
announcements are available via Flybe’s website at 
www.flybe.com/corporate/investors.

Dear Shareholder,
We believe that high standards of corporate 
governance play an important role in assisting a 
company in organising itself, in setting the right culture 
and ultimately in delivering value to shareholders, 
while taking account of our responsibilities to the 
wider community. Although not yet in the FTSe 250, 
Flybe governs itself in line with the governance 
recommendations and requirements for those 
companies. This includes all directors submitting 
themselves for re-election at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting (the ‘AGM’).
“High standards of corporate 
governance play an important 
role in setting the right culture 
and ultimately in delivering 
value to shareholders.”

Directors’ report continued
This report sets out how the company applied 
the principles of the UK corporate Governance 
code issued by the Financial Reporting council 
in September 2012 (the ‘code’) in the year to 
31
st
 March 2017. The Financial c onduct Authority’s 
Listing Rules require the c ompany to set out how it 
has applied the main principles of the c ode and to 
explain any non-compliance. A copy of the code can 
be found at www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.
Statement of compliance 
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of corporate governance and has fully 
considered the provisions of the code. The Board 
considers that the company is a ‘smaller company’ 
for the purposes of the c ode which defines this as 
a company which has been below the FTSe 350 
throughout the year immediately prior to the reporting 
year. Throughout the year ended 31
st
 March 2017, 
and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report, 
the Board considers that it and the company have 
complied with the best practice provisions set out 
in the c ode as it applies to ‘smaller companies’ other 
than the one exception detailed in the independence 
section below. 
The following paragraphs explain how the company 
has applied the principles of good governance and 
the code of best practice set out in the c ode.

The Board is led by the c hairman, Simon Laffin, 
who is responsible for ensuring its effectiveness in 
all aspects of its role. The Board’s key purpose is to 
provide the leadership and vision necessary to ensure 
the c ompany’s prosperity by collectively directing 
the company’s affairs while meeting the appropriate 
interests of its shareholders and stakeholders. The 
c hief executive o fficer and the c hief Financial 
o fficer meet regularly with analysts, brokers and key 
investors. The c hairman and non-executive directors 
have met key shareholders and the Board receives 
analyst and broker briefings. The Board has consulted 
shareholders on remuneration issues. In addition to 
business and financial issues, the Board of Directors 
deals with challenges and issues relating to corporate 
governance, corporate social responsibility and 
corporate ethics. It has the ultimate responsibility 
for setting the c ompany’s overall strategy and long-
term direction and applies governance within a 
framework of effective controls which permit risk to be 
assessed and managed. The Board has responsibility 
for approving the financial statements, significant 
acquisitions and disposals, major non-recurring 
projects and major capital expenditures.
The directors’ biographies appear on pages 58 and 59 
and illustrate the range of experience which ensures an 
effective board to lead and control the Group. Further 
details of changes to the membership of the Board are 
given on page 68. We continue to believe that a small 
well-balanced board, with a high quality management 
team and a majority of committed, diverse, informed 
and energetic non-executive directors, is the most 
effective leadership team for this company. The 
directors have a complementary range of financial, 
commercial, operational and entrepreneurial 
experience which, in the opinion of the Board, provides 
it and its committees with the necessary balance of 
skills, diversity, independence and knowledge of the 
Group to enable them to discharge their respective 
duties and responsibilities effectively.
The company has governance procedures in place to 
ensure that concerns can be raised with the c hairman 
or the Senior Independent Director. n o concerns were

Key activities of the Board
Aside from day-to-day management issues, the Board 
has focused on: 
 > Reviewing and developing a five-year strategic 
business plan, alongside the more immediate 
Sustainable Business Improvement plan, and 
considering the appropriate balance of risk and 
shareholder returns to determine the long-term 
direction of Flybe;
 > c ontinuing White Label activity, operating aircraft 
on routes for SAS and Brussels Airlines;
 > With the Loganair franchise ending in August 2017, 
there has been a strengthening of the relationship 
with Stobartair including the new commercial 
agreement announced on 2
nd
 May 2017 to provide 
two aircraft to Stobart. In addition, the new 
relationship with Blue Islands has been operating 
well;
 > A review of future fleet requirements was 
undertaken and the decision made to hand back six 
Q400 aircraft at the end of their leases in 2017/18;
 > IT strategy: with the recruitment of a new c hief 
Information o fficer, there is a focus on developing 
an integrated digital platform to improve the 
customer interface and booking experience and 
improve the resilience and performance of the 
company’s IT systems;
 > n etwork development strategy;
 > people engagement, in particular a new share 
incentive scheme was launched in September 2016; 
and
 > Safety culture, with a survey and report from 
industry experts Baines Simmons commissioned 
and reviewed with changes in the process of 
implementation.
In addition, the Board supported the management 
team in its final full year of the three-year turnaround, 
during which the business gained stability and has 
moved its focus to an alignment of its fleet capacity 
with passenger demand.
Operation of the Board
In carrying out its work, the Board focuses on key 
tasks, which include receiving reports on safety, 
security and health, business risks, long-term 
strategy, the Group’s trading performance, the work 
of its c ommittees and the actions of the executive 
committee and senior management. The Board 
delegates specific responsibilities, with written terms 
of reference, to its c ommittees, details of which 
appear below. The executive directors of the c ompany 
may attend meetings of the c ommittees at the 
invitation of the respective c hairmen.
The executive directors review and discuss with the 
Board all strategic projects and all material matters 
currently or prospectively affecting the Group and 
its performance. The Board delegates its authority 
for executive management to the c hief executive 
o fficer, who leads the executive c ommittee, subject 
to monitoring by the Board and those items referred 
to above.
To enable the Board to function effectively, and to 
assist the directors to discharge their responsibilities, 
a comprehensive set of papers is provided in advance 
of each Board and c ommittee meeting. These 
include regular business progress reports, budgets, 
financial statements and business cases for review. 
The company Secretary manages the provision 
of information to the Board in consultation with 
the c hairman.
The Board held nine scheduled meetings during 
the year, which all directors attended. o ne of those 
occasions was incorporated within a two-day strategy 
session in September. In addition there were a number 
of ad hoc meetings of the Board and the Remuneration 
c ommittee to deal with the circumstances surrounding 
the resignation of Saad Hammad and the appointment 
of c hristine o urmieres-Widener.
The Board requires all directors to devote sufficient 
time to their duties and to use their best endeavours 
to attend meetings. The table on page 68 details the 
directors’ attendance at the scheduled Board and 
committee meetings during the year.

1 Simon Laffin stood down from the Audit c ommittee when he became executive c hairman and was not reinstated once the executive role came 
to an end.
The Group company Secretary, c atherine 
Ledger, acts as secretary for the Board and all 
committee meetings.
Independence
The Board considers each of its non-executive 
directors to be independent in character and 
judgement and no one individual, or group of 
individuals, dominates the Board’s decision-making.
each of the non-executive directors who served during 
the year has been identified as independent on the 
basis of the criteria specified in paragraph A.3.1 of the 
code and, generally, is free from any business or other 
relationship which could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement.
Following the departure of the previous c hief 
executive o fficer, Saad Hammad on 26
th
 o ctober 
2016, Simon Laffin acted as executive c hairman, 
until the new c hief executive o fficer, c hristine 
o urmieres-Widener was in situ. Simon Laffin returned 
to his n on-executive role on 20
th
 January 2017. It was 
appreciated that combining the roles of the c hairman 
and ceo is not in line with governance best practice 
(paragraph A.2.1 of the c ode), but it was believed to 
be in the best interests of the c ompany to have the 
interim period overseen by someone who was already 
very familiar with the company and could therefore 
act as a caretaker for the period until a new ceo 
was appointed.
Diversity 
All recruitment for the Board is led by the n omination 
committee. There has been the appointment of 
a new c hief executive o fficer this year, and now 
a third of the c ompany’s directors are women. The 
Board recognises that diversity, in its widest sense, 
is important for the Board’s effectiveness. All the 
directors have been appointed on merit alone and 
specifically for the contributions that are brought from 
their knowledge and experience. Their wide-ranging 
experience and backgrounds ensure that they can 
debate matters in relation to both the development of 
strategy and performance against the objectives set 
by the Board. We believe that the diverse backgrounds 
of the individual directors ensure we have a Board 
with the optimum combination of skills and experience 
needed to support the business. As a result, no 
targets have been established for the composition 
of the Board, whether in terms of racial background 
or gender. 
o verall information on the gender diversity of the 
Board and the Group as a whole is given on page 47.
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the companies Act 2006, the 
company’s Articles of Association permit the Board 
to consider and, if thought fit, to authorise actual 
or potential conflicts of interest which may arise 
and to impose such limits or conditions as it thinks 
fit. The Board has established a formal procedure 
whereby actual and potential conflicts of interest can 
be recorded by each director and authorised by the 
Board. The decision to authorise a conflict can only be 
made by non-conflicted directors (those who have no 
interest in the matter being considered) and in making 
such a decision the directors must act in a way they 
consider in good faith will be most likely to promote 
the company’s success.
Directors’ indemnity and insurance cover
In accordance with the company’s Articles of 
Association, throughout the year the directors have 
been, and continue to be, indemnified to the fullest 
extent permitted by law. Appropriate Directors’ and 
o fficers’ liability insurance cover is arranged and 
maintained via the company’s insurance brokers, Willis 
Towers Watson, and its terms are reviewed annually.
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has approved a schedule of matters 
reserved for decision by it. This schedule is available 
for inspection at the company’s registered office 
and on the c ompany’s website at www.flybe.com/
corporate/governance. The matters reserved for 
specific approval by the Board can be subdivided into 
a number of key areas including but not limited to:
 > Reviewing the Group’s overall safety and security 
arrangements;
 > Approving the Group’s long-term objectives and 
strategy; 
 > Approving the Group’s annual operating and capital 
expenditure budget;
 > Group financial reporting and controls including the 
approval of interim and final financial statements, 
trading statements and dividends; 
 > ensuring a sound system of internal controls and 
risk management;
 > Identifying, evaluating and managing the principal 
risks faced by the company;
 > Decisions relating to acquisitions, disposals and 
major items of capital expenditure;
 > Board and committee membership and succession 
planning;
 > Remuneration; 
 > corporate governance matters; and
 > Approving certain Group policies including tax 
and treasury.
Matters requiring Board approval are generally 
the subject of a proposal by the executive directors 
submitted to the Board, together with supporting 
information, as part of the Board or c ommittee 
papers circulated prior to the relevant meeting.

Board performance and evaluation 
The Board supports the c ode’s provisions on Board 
performance evaluation. A self-evaluation of the 
Board took place in 2015/16 assisted by an external 
consultant, who conducted interviews with all of 
the directors. A full Board evaluation by an external 
consultant is currently underway with an expectation 
that it will report back to the Board in Summer 2017. 
The non-executive directors meet regularly without the 
executive directors present. The Senior Independent 
Director received informal feedback on the 
performance of the c hairman and discussed that with 
him. A formal performance evaluation was not carried 
out due to the scheduled full board effectiveness 
review that is taking place Summer 2017 and which 
includes a section on the c hairman’s performance.
Induction and continuing development 
of directors
c hristine o urmieres-Widener was appointed to 
the Board during the year. Her induction included 
meetings with key external stakeholders, including 
major shareholders, trade bodies, regulators, brokers, 
airports, suppliers and franchise partners. Within 
Flybe, c hristine has visited a number of bases and 
met with employee and union representatives. 
The c hairman and c hief executive o fficer are 
responsible for reviewing the development needs of 
individual directors. All of the non-executive directors 
have, during the course of the year, received updates 
on best practice, as well as more formal training 
sessions on directors’ duties, disclosure obligations 
and share dealing compliance, as well as bringing 
knowledge and information gathered from their other 
business interests. 
All directors have access to the advice and services 
of the c ompany Secretary who is responsible to 
the c hairman on matters of corporate governance 
and provides the Board with updates on relevant 
legislation, regulations and governance best practice. 
The directors may, at the c ompany’s expense, take 
independent professional advice where necessary 
and appropriate to do so.
Directors’ election and re-election
All directors will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, 
being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election. 
A biography for each of these directors, together with 
a description of the skills and experience they possess 
that the company considers relevant, will be included 
in the proposals put to shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
n one of the non-executive directors has served more 
than nine years in office. 
Any changes to the commitments of any director 
are always considered by the Board to ensure they 
will continue to have sufficient time to enable them 
to fulfil their duties to the c ompany. The Board is 
satisfied that all of the directors continue to perform 
effectively and demonstrate commitment to their 
roles, including commitment of time for Board and 
c ommittee meetings and any other duties which may 
be undertaken by them from time to time.
Operational management of the Group
Beneath the Board there is in place a clear and appropriate apportionment of responsibilities among the senior 
managers designed to ensure that the business can be managed and monitored effectively. Senior managers 
report to the executive c ommittee which in turn reports to the Board. The executive c ommittee is led by the c hief 
executive o fficer and comprises the executive Directors together with the c hief o perations o fficer, c hief Revenue 
o fficer, c hief people o fficer, c hief Information o fficer and the General c ounsel and c ompany Secretary. It has 
responsibility for implementing on a day-to-day basis the strategy that has been agreed by the Board. executive 
committee members report regularly to the Board on key issues. The management structure of the company

Audit Committee report
Dear Shareholder,
The Audit committee has been particularly focused 
during the year on reviewing risk management 
effectiveness, financial and operational controls 
of the Group and audit effectiveness. 
Role
The primary function of the Audit c ommittee 
is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight 
responsibilities. This includes reviewing the financial 
reports and other financial information before 
publication. In addition, the c ommittee also reviews 
the systems of internal controls on a continuing basis, 
with respect to finance, accounting, risk management, 
compliance, fraud and audit that management and the 
Board have established.
The c ommittee also reviews the accounting and 
financial reporting processes; along with the roles and 
effectiveness of both the internal and external auditors. 
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving 
the annual and other accounts remains with the Board. 
Working with the internal audit function the 
c ommittee challenges and reviews the controls within 
the organisation, ensuring that any control issues 
are actioned through the risk management process. 
This risk management process is reviewed by the 
committee ensuring that the risks are identified, 
accurately assessed and effectively managed through 
a robust risk assessment process.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Audit c ommittee, further 
details of which can be found in its terms of reference 
at www.flybe.com/corporate/governance include 
monitoring and reviewing:
 > The integrity of the Group’s financial statements 
and any formal announcements relating to Flybe’s 
performance;
 > Management’s response to any major external or 
internal audit recommendations;
 > The effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial 
and operational controls and risk management 
systems;
 > The effectiveness of the external audit process 
including their independence, objectivity and cost – 
see Auditor Independence on page 78;
David Kappler
c hairman, Audit c ommittee
 > policy on the engagement of the external auditor to 
supply non-audit services;
 > Key areas of risk management to support the 
Board’s role in overseeing an enterprise-wide 
approach to risk identification, management and 
mitigation; and
 > The effectiveness of communication between the 
external auditor and both the Audit c ommittee and 
the Group’s financial and senior management.
The Audit c ommittee undertakes its activities in line 
with an annual work plan designed to ensure that it 
meets its responsibilities under its terms of reference 
set by the Board. The Audit c ommittee agrees the 
scope of the external audit work and discusses the 
results of the half-year review and the full-year audit 
with the external auditor, the c hief Financial o fficer 
and c hief executive o fficer. The ultimate responsibility 
for reviewing and approving the annual and other 
accounts remains with the Board; however, the Audit 
committee reviews these documents and discusses 
them with the c hief executive and c hief Financial 
o fficers, particularly areas where there is subjectivity 
or the application of judgement, before making 
recommendations to the Board.
The Audit c ommittee has responsibility for 
recommending the appointment, reappointment 
and removal of the external auditor to the Board who, 
in turn, will propose a resolution for consideration by 
the shareholders. 
Membership and attendees
The Audit c ommittee met on six occasions during 
2016/17. Details of the attendance at its meetings are 
set out in the table on page 68.
During the year Simon Laffin stepped down from 
the c ommittee upon taking up the role of executive 
c hairman. Simon will not be re-joining the c ommittee 
despite now moving back to n on-executive 
c hairman in order to maintain good c orporate 
Governance practices.
The c hief executive o fficer, c hief Financial o fficer, 
Group Financial c ontroller, Head of Internal Audit and 
Risk and representatives from the external auditor are 
invited to attend all meetings of the Audit c ommittee. 
Since stepping down from the Audit c ommittee, 
Simon Laffin has been invited to attend all c ommittee 
meetings. The external auditor has a private session 
with the c ommittee at the end of each meeting. 
The Head of Internal Audit and Risk and the external 
auditor may also request a meeting with the Audit 
committee c hair or any other members.
Main activities of the Committee during 
the year
During the year the Audit committee’s business has 
included the following items:
 > Reviewing trading updates and interim management 
statements;
 > Reviewing the effectiveness and terms of reference 
of the committee;
 > Monitoring and reviewing the integrity of financial 
reporting, including reviewing the Annual Report 
and related formal announcements ensuring that 
they are fair, balanced and understandable;

Review of the Annual Report
The committee examined, at the request of the Board, 
the Annual Report to determine whether it was fair, 
balanced and understandable. The committee did 
this by gaining an understanding of the drafting 
and preparation process and the level of review and 
challenge introduced to ensure balance and accuracy. 
After its review of the process, consideration of 
management and auditor papers on the financial 
statements and the Annual Report and its own review 
of the Annual Report, the Audit committee concluded 
that the Annual Report was fair, balanced and 
understandable and recommended that the Board 
approve it on those terms.
Review of business risk and its reporting 
in the financial statements
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
business are discussed on pages 36 to 41. The Board 
has responsibility for determining the nature and 
extent of the risks it is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives and for oversight of the risk 
management process. Flybe has used the experience 
gained over many years to develop structures and 
processes to identify, evaluate, manage and report 
on the significant risks faced by the Group. These 
structures and processes, which are embedded within 
Flybe’s operations, have been in place throughout 
the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report. The Board is satisfied that these structures 
and processes ensure that risks are adequately and 
appropriately addressed and corrective actions taken.
A process of Risk Management Self-Assessment has 
been introduced, where management responsible for 
the risk report on the effectiveness and operation of 
mitigating controls. Risks are formally self-assessed on 
a quarterly basis. This, in addition to Risk Assessment 
workshops and regular reviews and updates by the 
Board and Audit c ommittee ensure a robust framework 
of risk management is maintained. The purpose of 
these workshops has been to review enterprise-wide 
the likely risks to business objectives so that the Board 
can update its understanding of how well risks are 
understood and managed. The findings are recorded 
in a risk register along with their potential impact, 
the mitigations and controls currently in place, and 
recommendations, where possible, for risk reduction. 
The Audit c ommittee and the Board review the risk 
register at half-year and year-end and will do so more 
frequently if necessary. The principal risks identified 
are robustly assessed by the committee and any 
issues are challenged back to management through 
the Head of Internal Audit and Risk.
In addition to the work of this c ommittee, the Safety 
and Security committee chaired by an independent 
n on-executive Director meets at least quarterly 
to review the Group’s safety performance.
Risks identified
The committee assesses whether suitable accounting 
policies have been adopted and whether management 
have made appropriate estimates and judgements. 
The committee reviews accounting papers prepared 
by management which provide details on the main 
financial reporting judgements at both the half and 
full years. The c ommittee also reviews reports by the 
external auditor on the half-year and full-year results 
which highlight any issues that have arisen as a result 
of their work.
Regarding the financial statements the committee 
considered the following significant issues:
 > The basis for the write-off of intangible assets 
totalling £4.3m plus £0.5m of accelerated 
amortisation on an identified group of intangible 
assets where the useful economic life has been 
reduced due to the planned implementation of 
a digital platform;
 > How Flybe should account for its deferred tax 
position. Advice has been sought on this and 
recommendations were made in relation to the 
governing rule in IAS 12;
 > Hedging conditions for both fuel and currency 
reviewing the fundamentals of the accounting of 
such hedges under IFRS 9;
 > Future impacts to the financial statements on 
the forthcoming adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 
(see note 2); and
 > Maintenance provisions have been reviewed and 
remain unchanged.
The committee is satisfied that the judgements made 
by management are reasonable, and that appropriate 
disclosures have been included in the accounts.
The significant other issues considered in the year are 
detailed below, while the wider set of risks that impact 
on the business are shown on pages 36 to 41:
 > The committee regularly reviewed the progress 
of the back-office system transformation 
project. In doing so any risks associated with 
the implementation of the new systems were 
considered and fed back to the project team 
for consideration;
 > There was discussion by the c ommittee of 
the accounting treatment of the material fleet 
movements during 2017/18;
 > Information security remains in constant focus 
for the c ommittee. During the year plans have 
commenced in preparation for the changing data 
protection laws through the eU General Data 
protection Regulations; and
 > The committee has considered the risks which 
could affect the business following the UK vote 
to leave the eU and the subsequent triggering of 
Article 50. 
Internal audit
Internal audit is independent of business operations, 
undertaking an ongoing programme to provide 
assurance on the adequacy of internal control and risk 
management processes across the Group’s operations. 
It is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the 
effectiveness of internal controls and risk management 
to the Audit committee. The committee approved the 
annual Internal Audit and Risk plan, designed to provide 
effective risk-based coverage over the internal control 
environment, for the coming year. 
The Audit c ommittee has made the decision to  
co-source the Internal Audit and Risk Management 
function, which is currently performed in-house. It is felt 
that external providers will provide access to specialists, 
use best practices and offer resource flexibility. They 
will be truly independent and will have tools, processes 
and people specialised in the Internal Audit and 
Risk Management functions. With the risk profile of 
Flybe and the limited number of qualified resources, 
it seemed an opportune point to proceed with this 
strategy. This will be implemented during 2017/18.
External audit process
The Audit committee considers the report prepared by 
Deloitte LLp highlighting any matters identified in the 
course of its statutory audit work, which is reviewed by 
the Audit c ommittee in the presence of Deloitte LLp, 
the c hief executive o fficer, the c hief Financial o fficer 
and the Head of Internal Audit and Risk.
During the year, the committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the overall audit process including 
review of:
 > external auditor papers detailing their audit plans 
as well as the results of their full-year audit and 
half-year review which includes papers on critical 
judgements and estimates, risk and internal 
control; and
 > The independence and effectiveness of the external 
audit itself.
It is standard practice for the external auditor to meet 
privately with the Audit c ommittee, without any 
member of management or the executive directors 
being present. This practice is made available at each 
of the Audit committee meetings and is considered 
a standing agenda item.
As a result of its reviews, the Audit c ommittee was 
able to recommend the re-appointment of Deloitte 
LLp to the Board.

Auditor independence
The Audit c ommittee is responsible for ensuring that 
an appropriate relationship is maintained between 
the Group and the external auditor. The external 
auditor provides some non-audit services, primarily 
advice on corporate transactions that may arise from 
time to time. In 2016/17, the external auditor has also 
provided advice to the c ompany in relation to the 
triennial valuation of the defined benefit pension 
scheme. In order to ensure that auditor objectivity and 
independence are safeguarded, the following controls 
have been implemented:
(a)  A formal policy on the use of the external auditor 
for non-audit work has been agreed by the Audit 
committee and is available on the company’s 
website at www.flybe.com/corporate/governance. 
In summary, this ensures that, usually, such work 
is only awarded when, by virtue of the auditor’s 
knowledge, skills or experience, the external auditor 
is clearly to be preferred over alternative suppliers. 
Any fees charged by the Group’s external auditor in 
respect of non-audit services over a set cumulative 
value of, currently, more than £50,000 require the 
prior approval of the Audit c ommittee. Under the 
policy, the external auditor is specifically excluded 
from providing any work that may impair their 
independence and from providing internal audit 
services to Flybe.
(b)  The Audit c ommittee receives and reviews each 
year an analysis of all non-audit work awarded 
to the external auditor over the financial period. 
A breakdown of the fees paid to the Group’s 
external auditor during the year is set out in note 
6 to the consolidated financial statements and 
further detail is highlighted in the Audit fees –  
non-audit services section of this report. 
(c)  The Audit c ommittee receives each year a report 
from the external auditor as to any matters that 
the external auditor considers have, or may have, 
bearing on its independence and which need to 
be disclosed to the Audit c ommittee. The Audit 
c ommittee is satisfied that, notwithstanding non-
audit work, Deloitte LLp have retained objectivity 
and independence during the year. The Audit 
c ommittee will continue to monitor its policy in this 
regard and accepts that non-audit work should be 
controlled to ensure that it does not compromise 
the independence of the external auditor.
We believe the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor and the effectiveness of the audit 
process are safeguarded and remain strong. 
Auditor rotation
Deloitte LLp audited the Annual Report and accounts 
for the first time for the year ended March 2007 and 
as a plc for the year ended March 2011. Under eU audit 
reform legislation, companies are required to have 
a mandatory rotation of auditors after 10 years from 
listing, or 20 years if there is a compulsory retender 
at 10 years. 
Audit fees – non-audit services
The level of fees paid to the auditor for non-audit 
services is as follows:
2015/16 
actuals 
£000
2016/17 
estimate 
£000
Audit fees (A) 354 326
o ther non-audit services (B) 73 67

o ther non-audit services relate to all other services 
provided by the auditor. o ther fees include defined 
benefit pension scheme consultancy and compliance 
services.

Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce this year’s Remuneration 
Report.
Having obtained shareholder approval for a revised 
remuneration policy at the 2015 AGM, we do not 
propose making any further changes to the policy this 
year. A full summary of the current policy is appended 
to this report, with an ‘at a glance’ summary of the 
policy and how it is currently being implemented set 
out on page 81.
It has been another challenging year for Flybe, with 
external pressures – including a highly competitive 
market and fragile consumer confidence – together 
with legacy fleet deliveries resulting in a growing fleet 
size, the completion of the transformation programme 
and the change in executive leadership of the business. 
This provided the backdrop to the considerations of 
the c ommittee during the course of the year. 
Key Committee activities during the year
In January 2017, c hristine o urmieres-Widener became 
ceo . We were very pleased to secure c hristine as 
our new ceo . She brings extensive experience of 
aviation and travel, as well as a deep knowledge 
of the UK regional aviation market, which will be 
extremely valuable to Flybe. Key details of c hristine’s 
remuneration package on her appointment (which 
is lower in terms of quantum than Saad Hammad’s 
package) are:
 > Base salary – £400,000
 > pension – 10% of salary 
 > Annual bonus – 100% of salary maximum (pro-rated 
in 2016/17 to reflect her appointment part-way 
through that year)
 > pSp – 150% of salary award for 2016/17 and 2017/18, 
with the intention that this award level will be 
reviewed in 2018/19 
 > Relocation allowance – £120,000, repayable in full/
part if c hristine serves notice within two years. 
c hristine is also responsible for the tax payable on 
this allowance

c hristine’s appointment followed Saad Hammad 
stepping down from the Board. Saad’s termination 
arrangements, which were in line with our policy and 
which were disclosed at the time, are set out in detail 
on page 84.
During the period between Saad stepping down from 
the Board and c hristine assuming the role as ceo , 
Simon Laffin acted as executive c hairman. To reflect 
the additional time commitment required of Simon, he 
received a supplementary fee of £34,629 which was in 
addition to his standard c hairman’s fee of £153,000 p.a.
o ther committee activities during the year included: 
 > Determining the then incumbent executive 
directors’ base salary levels for 2016/17 – Saad 
Hammad and philip de Klerk received a base salary 
increase of 2% at the start of the last financial year;
 > Setting the executive directors’ bonus targets for 
2016/17 – these were a mix of profit before tax and 
personal targets on a 70:30 weighting as explained 
more fully below; 
 > o verseeing the 2016/17 performance Share plan 
awards – also as reported last year, awards over 
shares worth 150% of salary were granted (albeit 
using a higher share price than at the date of 
grant, thereby reducing the number of shares 
over which awards were made), with vesting 
subject to challenging adjusted epS and relative 
TSR targets; and
 > Determining that the award made on Saad 
Hammad’s recruitment in August 2013 lapsed due 
to the performance conditions not being satisfied.
Since the year-end, the committee has:
 > Set c hristine o umieres-Widener’s base salary for 
2017/18 which will be unchanged from last year 
(i.e. £400,000);
 > Determined performance against the targets set 
under the 2016/17 annual bonus plan. Based on 
performance in 2016/17, no bonuses will be payable; 
 > Set the performance targets to apply to c hristine’s 
2017/18 annual bonus opportunity of 100% of 
salary which will contain a mix of pBT and personal 
targets on a 70:30 weighting and are subject to 
(i) an aviation safety event underpin and (ii) positive 
adjusted pBT being delivered (following the payment 
of bonuses);
 > Agreed to make a further grant under the pSp 
in 2017/18 to c hristine over shares worth 150% 
of salary. As was the case last year, these awards 
will vest subject to a mix of challenging relative 
TSR and epS targets described more fully later 
in this report; and
 > Agreed the termination arrangements for philip 
de Klerk following the announcement of his 
resignation in April (further details of which are 
set out on page 84). The process to appoint philip’s 
successor is ongoing.

during this period.
4 c harlie Scott stepped down from the Board on 21

6 Taxable benefits comprise private health care, life assurance, permanent health insurance, car allowance, and (in the case of Saad Hammad) 
driver and tax on certain of such benefits. In addition c hristine o urmieres-Widener received a relocation payment of £120,000 relating to her 
recruitment. This payment is repayable in full if c hristine serves notice to terminate her employment within six months of commencement  
(i.e. 16
th
 January 2017), 75% if she serves notice to terminate between six and 12 months, 50% if she serves notice to terminate between 12 and 
18 months and 25% if she serves notice between 18 and 24 months of commencement. c hristine is responsible for settling the tax liability on 
the allowance excluding the tax-free amount of £8,000.

value of the portion of this bonus that was paid in deferred shares on a ‘one-off’ basis.
The aggregate emoluments (being salaries/fees, benefits, cash allowances in lieu of pension contributions and

2016/17 annual bonus
For the year ended 31
st
 March 2017, the annual bonus 
opportunity for c hristine o urmieres-Widener was 
100% of salary (pro-rated to reflect her appointment 
part-way through that year), with philip de Klerk’s 
annual bonus opportunity also 100% of salary. Bonuses 
were payable dependent on a mixture of financial 
targets based on adjusted pBT performance (70% of 
opportunity) and personal objectives (30%) based on 
the strategic priorities. The pBT targets, and related 
potential bonus payouts, were as follows (with straight-
line payouts between each hurdle):
2016/17 adjusted pBT % of element of bonus that pays out
Less than £10m 0%
£10m 0%
£15m 50%
£20m 100%
The adjusted loss before tax for the year was £(6.7)m, 
resulting in no portion of this element of bonus being 
payable.
Bonuses also included an underpin that enabled 
the c ommittee to scale back bonuses (to zero if 
considered appropriate) in the event that there had 
been an aviation safety event that it considered 
warranted the use of such discretion. 
In addition, no portion of the personal/strategic bonus 
would normally be payable unless adjusted pBT grew 
versus the prior year. As Flybe made an adjusted loss 
before tax in 2016/17, the c ommittee determined 
that no element of the personal/strategic bonus was 
payable. 
Upon his departure, Saad Hammad ceased to be 
eligible for an annual bonus (maximum 150% of salary) 
for the year ended 31
st
 March 2017.
Payments to past Directors
There were no payments in the year to past Directors, 
other than the loss of office payments to Saad 
Hammad, as detailed below. 
Payments for loss of office
Saad Hammad left the Board on 26
th
 o ctober 2016. 
The following provides a summary of his settlement 
agreement, which accords with the current policy:
 > Saad was entitled to 12 months’ notice from the 
company under his service agreement and will 
therefore continue to receive his salary and other 
benefits until 25
th
 o ctober 2017, payable on a 
monthly basis. He will be on garden leave until this 
date. During his notice period he will be available 
to ensure an orderly transition;
 > Saad will be paid £30,000 in compensation of 
lost benefits and in consideration of a waiver of 
his statutory employment rights at the end of his 
notice period;
 > The ‘one-off’ deferred share element of his 2015/16 
bonus will vest pursuant to its terms in July 2017; 
 > Saad ceased to be eligible to receive a bonus in 
respect of the year ended 31
st
 March 2017;
 > Unvested awards previously granted to Saad under 
the performance Share plan lapsed in accordance 
with the rules of the plan; and
 > The c ompany made a contribution of £4,000 plus 
vAT towards Saad’s legal fees in obtaining advice on 
the termination of his employment.
philip de Klerk’s resignation was announced on  
18
th
 April 2017:
 > philip will remain employed as c Fo until the end of 
September 2017. A process to appoint his successor 
has already commenced;
 > Until that date, philip will continue to receive base 
salary, pension and other standard benefits at the 
same level as 2016/17;
 > philip will not participate in the 2017/18 annual 
bonus, nor will he receive a pSp award in 2017/18;
 > The ‘one-off’ deferred share element of his 2015/16 
bonus will vest pursuant to its terms in July 2017; 
and
 > Unvested awards previously granted to philip under

1 c hristine o urmieres-Widener’s award was granted at the average market price of 43.0p of the last three trading days prior to grant. 
2 As explained in last year’s report, while Saad Hammad and philip de Klerk received a notional 150% of salary grant under the pSp in 2016, 
the c ommittee was mindful of the fall in the share price over the preceding year. Therefore, when calculating how many shares were actually 
awarded, the c ommittee used the 89.5p share price used for the 2015 awards as opposed to the average share price of the last three dealing 
days prior to grant, thereby resulting in an award over fewer shares.

Recruitment awards
Saad Hammad’s recruitment award
As part of his remuneration arrangements on joining Flybe, Saad Hammad received an award under the one-
off LTIp which provided him with an entitlement to a cash payment based on the incremental growth in Flybe’s 
market capitalisation over a three-year period commencing on 1
st
 August 2013.
Under the terms of his award, Saad Hammad was entitled to a cash sum equivalent to a fixed percentage of the 
incremental increase in market capitalisation between 1
st
 August 2013 and 31
st
 July 2016. Starting and ending 
market capitalisations for Flybe were based on a three-month average market capitalisation to the relevant 
date. Saad Hammad was entitled to receive a 4% share of any incremental increase in market capitalisation if the 
ending market capitalisation was £150m or less. If the ending market capitalisation was greater than £150m, Saad 
Hammad was entitled to receive 4% of the incremental increase between the starting market capitalisation and 
£150m and a 3% share of any incremental increase in market capitalisation above the £150m threshold.
As disclosed in the prospectus released on 20
th
 February 2014 in connection to the proposed Firm placing and 
placing and o pen o ffer, the committee further agreed that the ending market capitalisation should be reduced 
by the value of the aggregate subscription price paid for any new shares in the capital of the c ompany which 
were issued after the date that the ceo joined the c ompany, but on or before the end of the performance period. 
Accordingly, £156m was deducted from the ending market capitalisation, relating to the fundraising completed 
in March 2014.
Directors’ remuneration continued
To the extent the award vested at the end of the three-
year performance period, 50% of the award was to be 
released after three years, with the remainder released 
after further deferral periods of six months (25% of the 
award) and 12 months (25% of the award).
Having assessed performance against the targets 
applicable to this award, the committee determined 
that no portion of this award vested, resulting in the 
entire award lapsing.
Philip de Klerk’s recruitment award 
philip de Klerk was granted a phantom option under 
the cash-based LTIp on 22
nd
 August 2014 over 705,096 
notional shares with an ‘opening price’ of £1.2126. 
This award vests on the third anniversary of grant 
provided that the ‘closing price’ (i.e. the average share 
price over three months prior to the third anniversary 
of grant) is at least £1.6126. To the extent that this 
performance condition is met, an amount equal to 
the embedded gain (i.e. the difference between the 
opening price and the closing price) at the end of the 
three-year performance period will vest subject to an 
overriding cap which states that the vested amount 
cannot exceed 300% of the opening price. vesting will 
be on a phased basis between three and four years 
from grant (i.e. 50% on the third anniversary of grant, 
25% six months later and the final 25% a further six 
months later).
As set out above, this award will lapse following philip’s 
resignation.
Implementation of policy for the year commencing 
1
st
 April 2017
Base salary
For the coming year with effect from 1
st
 April 2017, 
executive Directors’ base salaries will remain at the 
same levels as last year i.e.:
c hristine o urmieres-Widener  £400,000
philip de Klerk* £290,700
* philip de Klerk has resigned and is serving notice.
Pension
c hristine o urmieres-Widener has elected to divide her 
pension contribution of 10% of salary between a non-
bonusable cash supplement and payment to a plan 
of her choice. philip de Klerk’s pension contribution 
is 11% of salary, payable as a non-bonusable cash 
supplement in lieu of pension. c ash supplements 
in lieu of pension contribution are reduced by the 
employer’s n Ic liability that arises to ensure the 
approach is cost-neutral to Flybe.
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for 
c hristine o urmieres-Widener will be 100% of salary. 
philip de Klerk will not participate in the bonus 
plan for 2017/18 as he has resigned and is serving 
notice. The proposed performance measures will 
reflect the approach adopted last year, i.e. a mix of 
adjusted Group pBT targets (70% weighting, with pBT 
excluding any foreign exchange translation differences 
on US dollar loans, but with no adjustments made for 
surplus aircraft costs), as well as the achievement of 
personal/strategic objectives (30% weighting) relating 
to a number of performance indicators. The bonus also 
includes an underpin that enables the committee to 
scale back bonuses (to zero if considered appropriate) 
in the event that there has been an aviation safety 
event that it considers warrants the use of such 
discretion. Furthermore, no portion of the personal/
strategic bonus will normally be payable unless there 
is a positive adjusted pBT (following the payment 
of bonuses).
Given the competitive nature of the c ompany’s sector, 
the specific performance targets are considered to 
be commercially sensitive and accordingly are not 
disclosed. Following the conclusion of the current 
financial year, the committee intends to adopt the 
same level of retrospective disclosure of bonus targets 
as has been applied in previous years. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

PSP awards 
It is proposed that a pSp award be granted to c hristine 
o urmieres-Widener in the forthcoming year over 
shares worth 150% of salary. As was the case with 
awards made last year, the performance measures for 
these awards will be based on adjusted epS and TSR 
growth, summarised as follows:
Adjusted epS for 2019/20 
(50% weighting) % of that part of the award that vests
11.1p or more 100%
Between 11.1p and 7.4p pro-rata on straight-line basis 
between 100% and 0%
7.4p 0%
Three-year TSR (50% weighting) 
relative to the constituents, as at 
1
st
 April prior to grant, of the FTSe 
Smallc ap excluding investment trusts % of that part of the award that vests
Upper quartile or more 100%
Between upper quartile  
and median
pro-rata on straight-line basis 
between 100% and 20%
Median 20%
Below median 0%
performance conditions will be measured over three 
financial years to 31
st
 March 2020. The epS condition 
looks at the epS achieved in the final year only 
based on the reported adjusted epS (subject to such 
adjustments as the c ommittee considers appropriate) 
and the TSR condition compares the TSR over the 
three months prior to the start of the financial year 
in which the grant is made with the three months 
prior to the end of the financial year ending three 
years later. In addition, an underpin applies under 
which the c ommittee can scale back vesting (to zero 
if considered appropriate) in the event that there 
has been an aviation safety event that it considers 
warrants the use of such discretion. To the extent that 
awards vest a holding period applies such that 50% of 
the shares are receivable immediately, with the balance 
receivable in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth 
anniversaries of grant.
The c ommittee is mindful of the fact that the epS 
target range is lower in absolute terms than the 
12.9p–15.9p target range employed for the 2016/17 
grant (which was also lower than the 18.5p–22.2p 
range used in the 2015 grant). However, the committee 
believes that the 7.4p–11.1p target range is entirely 
appropriate and reflects tough market conditions 
and lower internal and external forecasts for growth, 
making it no less challenging for management than 
the targets employed for past awards. Based on 
the current capital structure and tax rates, the full 
vesting epS of 11.1p is consistent with an adjusted (i.e. 
excluding currency revaluations of loans) profit before 
tax of £30m, with no payout made under the epS 
element unless the 2019/20 outturn is greater than 
£20m. particularly with a new ceo , the c ommittee 
believes it is vital that we retain and incentivise 
c hristine’s evolving senior management team. Making 
a further round of pSp grants with stretching but 
potentially achievable targets will be a crucial element 
in this. 
As stated above, c hristine will be awarded shares 
worth 150% of her salary (i.e. the same size as her 
2016/17 award). The c ommittee does not think it 
appropriate to reduce the value of c hristine’s award 
to reflect the lower epS targets, as the performance 
conditions applying to the 2016/17 awards were set 
prior to c hristine joining Flybe. However, to reflect 
the lower targets, the committee has retained the 
vesting schedule that was applied to the epS element 
of awards last year of 0% vesting at threshold (as 
opposed to the more common 25%/20% threshold 
vesting used by other companies and by Flybe for the 
2015/16 awards). In addition, the fact that c hristine’s 
package is lower in overall terms than Saad Hammad’s 
is evidence of the prudent approach the committee is 
taking to remuneration at Flybe.

Appendix to the Directors’ Remuneration Report
The Directors’ remuneration policy as summarised below was approved the company’s shareholders at the 2015 
AGM (with the full formal policy as set out in the 2014/15 Report of the Remuneration c ommittee). This policy 
takes due account of the c orporate Governance c ode and is felt to be appropriate to support the long-term 
success of the c ompany while ensuring that it does not promote inappropriate risk-taking.

Notes to the policy table
1.  Stating maximum amounts for the 
remuneration policy
The Regulations and related investor guidance 
encourages companies to disclose a cap within which 
each element of the directors’ remuneration policy 
will operate. Where maximum amounts for elements 
of remuneration have been set within the directors’ 
remuneration policy, these will operate simply as caps 
and are not indicative of any aspiration.
2.  Travel and hospitality
While the c ommittee does not consider these to form 
part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, 
we have been advised that corporate hospitality 
(whether paid for by the company or another) and 
product familiarisation through staff/business travel 
for directors (and exceptionally their families) may 
technically come within the applicable rules and so 
the c ommittee expressly reserves the right for the 
c ommittee to authorise such activities within its 
agreed policies.
3.  Past obligations
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, 
any commitment made prior to, but due to be 
fulfilled after, the approval and implementation 
of this remuneration policy will be honoured.

A malus provision applies to the pSp, under which the 
c ommittee may lapse part/all of any unvested pSp 
award and/or any shares that are the subject of a post-
vesting holding period in certain circumstances (e.g. if 
information used to determine vesting was materially 
inaccurate and resulted in an overpayment, gross 
misconduct, material reputational damage caused by 
mismanagement etc.). There is a three-year time bar 
on this malus provision, i.e. no award can be lapsed if 
the trigger event comes to light more than three years 
after its occurrence.
Similarly, a clawback provision will apply to the annual 
bonus under which any future net bonus paid can be 
reclaimed in broadly the same circumstances as apply 
to the malus provision in the pSp (with a similar three-
year time limit).
5.  Discretions
The c ommittee may exercise discretion in two broad 
areas for each element of remuneration:
 > To ensure fairness and align executive Director 
remuneration with underlying individual and 
company performance, the committee may adjust 
upwards or downwards the outcome of any short- 
or long-term incentive plan payment within the 
limits of the relevant plan. Any adjustments in 
light of corporate events will be made on a neutral 
basis, i.e. the intention of any adjustment will be 
that the event is not to the benefit or detriment 
of participants. Adjustments to underlying 
performance may be made in exceptional 
circumstances to ensure outcomes are fair both 
to shareholders and participants.
 > In the case of a non-regular event occurring, the 
c ommittee may apply its discretion to ensure 
fairness and seek alignment with business 
objectives. n on-regular events in this context 
include, but are not limited to: corporate 
transactions, changes in the c ompany’s accounting 
policies, minor or administrative matters, internal 
promotions, external recruitment and terminations.
Any use of discretion by the c ommittee during the 
financial year will be detailed in the relevant Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
6.  Shareholding guidelines
executive Directors are required to retain 50% of any 
net vested shares received under any share plan until 
they hold shares worth 150% of base salary. Shares 
subject only to a holding period will, consistent with 
institutional shareholder guidelines, count towards the 
guidelines. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Directors’ remuneration continued
Remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as described above. 
Annual salary reviews across the Group take into account company performance, local pay and market conditions 
and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
o ther members of the Group’s executive committee and certain key management participate in similar annual 
bonus arrangements to the executive Directors, although award sizes vary by organisational level. pSp awards 
are also granted to a broader population than the executive Directors. All other employees may be eligible 
to participate from time to time in an employee bonus scheme, under which a bonus is payable subject to the 
achievement of Group profit targets. All eligible employees may participate in the c ompany’s SAYe and SIp 
schemes on identical terms.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The company’s Recruitment Remuneration p olicy, which is set out below, aims to give the committee sufficient 
flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of high calibre executives to strengthen the management 
team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic aims. 
In terms of the principles for setting a package for 
a new executive Director, the starting point for the 
committee will be to apply the general policy for 
executive Directors as set out above and structure 
a package in accordance with that policy. c onsistent 
with the Regulations, any caps contained within the 
policy for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, 
although the committee would not envisage exceeding 
these caps in practice. Where a new appointee’s 
salary is initially set below market, the c ommittee 
may manage salary progression in a phased manner 
over a number of years, subject to the individual’s 
development in the role.
The Annual Bonus plan and pSp will operate (including 
the maximum award levels) as detailed in the general 
policy in relation to any newly appointed executive 
Director. Any recruitment-related pSp awards which 
are not buy-outs will be subject to the relevant plan 
terms, including performance conditions, and limits as 
stated in the general policy. Details of any recruitment-
related awards will be appropriately disclosed.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue 
on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new 
appointment, as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the committee 
may agree that the c ompany will meet certain 
relocation expenses as it considers appropriate.
For any buy-outs the c ompany will not pay more than 
is, in the view of the c ommittee, necessary and will in 
all cases seek, in the first instance, to deliver any such 
awards under the terms of the company’s existing 
incentive arrangements. It may, however, be necessary 
in some cases to make buy-out awards on terms that 
are more bespoke than the existing arrangements. 
All buy-outs, whether under the company’s existing 
incentive arrangements or otherwise, will take 
account of the service obligations and performance 
requirements for any remuneration relinquished by 
the individual when leaving a previous employer. The 
c ommittee will seek to make buy-outs subject to what 
are, in its opinion, comparable requirements in respect 
of service and performance. However, the committee 
may choose to relax this requirement in certain cases 
(such as where the service and/or performance 
requirements are materially completed, or where such 
factors are, in the view of the c ommittee, reflected 
in some other way, such as a significant discount to 
the face value of the awards forfeited) and where 
the c ommittee considers it to be in the interests of 
shareholders.
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make 
additional awards in connection with the recruitment 
to buy-out awards forfeited by the individual on 
leaving a previous employer. For the avoidance of 
doubt, buy-out awards are not subject to a formal cap.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Service contracts and treatment for leavers and 
change of control
The committee’s policy is to provide service 
contracts for executive Directors with notice periods 
of 12 months or less. The c ommittee reserves flexibility 
to alter these principles if necessary to secure the 
recruitment of an appropriate candidate and, if 
appropriate, introduce a longer initial notice period 
(of up to two years) reducing over time. Details of 
the service agreements of the executive Directors 
in post during the year are as follows:

Upon termination, executive Directors are entitled 
to salary and benefits (inclusive of pension/pension 
allowances) for the duration of their notice period. It 
is the c ommittee’s policy to seek to mitigate the need 
for such payments. each executive Director has post-
termination provisions which (among others) restrict 
the executive Director from competing with Flybe for 
the duration of their notice period.
The executive Directors’ service contracts are 
available to view at the company’s registered office.
In the event that a participant ceases to be an 
employee of Flybe, treatment of outstanding awards 
under the Group’s long-term incentive plans will be 
determined based on the relevant plan rules. When 
considering any such payments, the committee 
reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure 
they are fair to both shareholders and participants. 
 > executive Directors will normally not be entitled to 
any bonus payment on termination of employment 
(or if notice of termination has been given) unless, 
for any period actually worked, the c ommittee 
considers it appropriate in its discretion.
 > Under the rules for the pSp, awards lapse on 
cessation of employment other than in certain 
prescribed ‘good leaver’ circumstances (e.g. death, 
ill health, redundancy, retirement) in which case 
awards vest either on cessation or on the normal 
vesting date, typically subject to the performance 
conditions and pro-rating (unless the c ommittee 
determines otherwise). In the event of a change in 
control, awards will normally be time pro-rated and 
vest subject to the performance conditions. Awards 
are not forfeitable during any subsequent holding 
period (but may be available for the application 
of malus).
 > Under the rules for the LTIp (under which philip 
de Klerk received an award on joining Flybe, further 
details of which are set out on page 89), awards 
lapse in the event a participant leaves Flybe, unless 
for reasons including, but not limited to, death, 
ill health, permanent disability and redundancy. 
In these circumstances, awards will normally be  
pro-rated for time and vest at the normal time, 
subject to the achievement of the performance 
condition over the complete performance period. 
In the event of a change of control, the award will 
normally be pro-rated for time and vest based 
on performance over the period to the change of 
control. At its discretion, the c ommittee may vary 
these default treatments. As noted above, this 
award will lapse following philip’s resignation.
 > The company has the power to enter into 
settlement agreements with directors and to 
pay compensation to settle potential legal claims. 
In addition, and consistent with market practice, 
in the event of the termination of an executive 
Director, the c ompany may make a contribution 
towards that individual’s legal fees and fees for 
outplacement services as part of a negotiated 
settlement. Any such fees will be disclosed as part 
of the detail of termination arrangements. For the 
avoidance of doubt, the policy does not include an 
explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.

elizabeth McMeikan’s service agreements expire in 2017 
but both have agreed with the c ompany to extend 
their appointments for a further three-year period. All 
directors stand for election or re-election at the AGM.
The ne Ds are not eligible for bonuses or participation 
in share schemes and no pension contributions are 
made on their behalf.
Details of the policy on fees paid to our ne Ds are set out in the table below:

Fees
To attract and

Directors 
with broad

Fee levels are reviewed annually, with 
any adjustments normally effective 
1
st
 April in the year following review.
The fees paid to the c hairman are 
determined by the committee, 
while the fees of the n on-executive 
Directors are determined by the 
executive Directors.
Additional fees are payable for acting 
as Senior Independent Director and 
as c hairman of any of the Board’s 
committees (Audit, Remuneration, 
n omination, Safety and Security).
Fee levels reflect the skills and 
experience of the ne Ds, the market 
practice adopted in similar sized 
organisations and anticipated time 
commitments. 
ne Ds may also receive certain benefits 
from time to time.
Fee increases for the n on-executive 
Directors (and the c hairman) are 
applied in line with the outcome of 
the annual fee review. Fees for the year 
under review (and the coming year) 
are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
It is expected that any increases to 
ne D fee levels will be in line with 
salaried employees over the life of 
the policy. However, in the event 
that there is a material misalignment 
with the market or a change in the 
complexity, responsibility or time 
commitment required to fulfil the ne D 
role, the Board has discretion to make 
an appropriate adjustment to the fee 
level. Aggregate fees (plus the value of 
any benefits) will not exceed the cap in

(currently £500k).

To assist with product familiarisation, all Group Board 
directors are entitled to four complementary pairs of

Directors (including the c hairman) but the company 
reserves the right to provide benefits (including travel 
and office support) within the overall limits on fees set 
out in the c ompany’s Articles of Association. c urrently, 
no such tax liabilities arise.
In recruiting a new n on-executive Director, the 
c ommittee will use the policy set out in the table

External appointments 
At the discretion of the Board, executive Directors 
may be appointed as a n on-executive Director at 
other companies. Before granting permission, the 
Board will take into account, inter alia, the time 
commitment of the new role, the competitive status 
of the other company, the Listing Rules and the UK 
corporate Governance code. Whether the e xecutive 
Director retains any associated fees, or whether they 
are remitted to the company, will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis. 
Consideration of conditions elsewhere 
in the Company
The c ompany seeks to promote and maintain good 
relationships with employee representative bodies – 
including trade unions and employee representatives – 
as part of its employee engagement strategy and 
consults on matters affecting employees and business 
performance as required in each case by law and 
regulation in the jurisdictions in which the c ompany 
operates. The c ommittee is also mindful of the salary 
increases applying across the Group when considering 
salary increases for the executive Directors. The 
committee does not, however, consult with employees 
specifically on the effectiveness and appropriateness 
of the executive remuneration policy and framework.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The committee considers shareholder views received 
during the year and at each Annual General Meeting, 
as well as guidance from shareholder representative 
bodies more broadly, in shaping the Remuneration 
policy. The c ommittee continues to keep its 
remuneration arrangements under regular review, to 
ensure the Remuneration policy continues to reinforce 
the company’s long-term strategy and aligns closely 
with shareholders’ interests. We will consult, and 
seek approval from, shareholders before making any 
significant changes to our Remuneration policy. 
As stated in the c ommittee c hair’s introductory 
letter, the resolution approving the Annual Report on 
Remuneration was passed with a substantial majority 
at the 2016 AGM.
Directors’ remuneration continued
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
c ompany law requires the directors to prepare such 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law the directors are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the european Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. Under company law the directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and the c ompany and of the 
profit or loss for that period.
In preparing the Group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
directors:
 > properly select and apply accounting policies;
 > present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information;
 > provide additional disclosures when compliance 
with the specific requirements in IFRSs are 
insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
 > Make an assessment of the company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the c ompany’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > The financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with the relevant financial reporting framework, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the c ompany and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole;
 > The strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face; and
 > The Annual Report and financial statements, taken 
as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

Summary of our audit approach
Key risks t he key risks that we identified in the current year were:
 > Aircraft fleet;
 > Aircraft maintenance provisions;
 > Revenue recognition and provisioning; and
 > Deferred tax recognition.
Materiality t he materiality that we used in the current year was £1.90m. in determining materiality we 
considered a number of measures and derived a figure based on revenue.
Scoping c onsistent with our approach in the prior year, our group audit scope focused primarily on 
the audit work at the two components (both in the UK), being Flybe l imited (passenger 
operations) and Flybe Aviation services l imited (maintenance, repair and overhaul operations).
Significant 
changes in 
our approach
Due to the continued changes to the fleet we have identified this as a key risk as there are 
material accounting impacts. We no longer consider that passenger claims provisions to 
represent a key risk as the provisioning is based upon a well-established methodology and 
has historical data to support judgements applied. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the group
As required by the l isting Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement 
regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting 
contained within note 3 to the financial statements and the directors’ 
statement on the longer-term viability of the group contained within the 
financial review on page 35.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention 
to in respect of these matters.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or 
draw attention to in relation to:
 > t he directors’ confirmation on page 35 that they have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity;
 > t he disclosures on pages 36 to 41 describe those risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
 > t he directors’ statement in note 3 to the financial statements about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue to do so over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; and
 > t he directors’ explanation on page 35 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why 
they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ 
adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we did 
not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because 
not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the 
group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting c ouncil’s ethical 
standards for Auditors and confirm that we are independent of the group 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
those standards.
We confirm that we are 
independent of the group and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with 
those standards. We also confirm 
we have not provided any of the 
prohibited nonaudit services  
referred to in those standards.
 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
t he assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Due to the continued changes to the fleet we have identified this as a key risk as there are material accounting 
impacts. We no longer consider that passenger claims provisions to represent a key risk as the provisioning is 
based upon a well-established methodology and has historical data to support judgements applied.
Aircraft fleet
Risk description c hanges in the fleet, whether related to aircraft or components such as engines, or to the 
associated loans and lease terms have material accounting impacts. each instance could 
result in additional liabilities and obligations, with bespoke and potentially complex contract 
terms, as well as additional implications on maintenance accounting. Additionally, we have 
considered the valuation of the fleet. Additional aircraft increase potential valuation risk. 
t here have been 9 (FY16: 8) new aircraft delivered in the year and a number of changes to 
aircraft ownership (from operating leased to owned) resulting in aircraft additions of £132.9m 
(FY16: £59.0m). c hanges to the fleet and related risks are disclosed on page 30 and note 14.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to  
the risk
For each aircraft and significant aircraft component delivered we have evaluated each lease 
to challenge the appropriateness of management’s classification, being treated as either an 
operating or finance lease.
For owned aircraft we have agreed the values capitalised to source documentation and have 
critically challenged the component accounting and separation of the aircraft components. 
We have also evaluated the accuracy of useful economic lives and residual valuations, 
including assessing external source data for similar assets. We have challenged management’s 
forecasts to support the carrying value of the fleet, including evaluating the reasonableness of 
underlying assumptions and historical accuracy of forecasting.
We have agreed loans to agreements with counterparties and vouched the drawdown 
of funds. We have also assessed the accounting and presentation of the related loans.
For leased aircraft we have challenged the completeness and accuracy of maintenance 
provisions required under the lease.
Key observations Based on our procedures, we concluded that the classification and valuation of the new 
aircraft delivered in the year, together with the related financing, is appropriate and that the 
carrying value of the fleet is reasonable.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

is provided in note 24, as well as being included in the Audit c ommittee Report at page 76.

How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to  
the risk
We evaluated the methodology and key assumptions adopted by management in 
their calculation of the aircraft maintenance provisions and evaluated the design and 
implementation of the controls in this process. t his work included:
 > t esting the integrity and arithmetical accuracy of the provision model through 
recalculations; and
 > consideration and challenge of the consistency and reasonableness of the assumptions 
adopted, including review of lease terms and conditions, testing of source data for the 
provision model to information from lessors, comparison of assumptions to contract 
terms, and assessment of recent interval and cost experience. We have supplemented 
this work with inquiry of engineering management in order to challenge the assumptions 
adopted, in particular in relation to asset lives, the utilisation pattern of the aircraft and 
the consistency of the provisions with their assessment of aircraft condition.
Key observations t he provisions for maintenance obligations and assumptions are appropriate  
in all material respects.
 
Revenue recognition and provisioning
Risk description Group revenue includes £619.3m (2016: £571.7m) of passenger revenue for the year ended 
31
st
 march 2017. Further detail is set out in note 5.
management have recorded certain provisions against revenue where revenue data derived 
from the revenue reporting systems have needed amendment to accurately reflect revenue 
in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition criteria (as set out in note 3 to the 
financial statements). 
t hese provisions primarily arise from activities such as inter-airline and code-sharing 
agreements as well as ancillary revenue. t heir quantification can involve complex data flows 
and in some cases judgment on the likely volume of rejected transactions.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to 
the risk
We have evaluated the design and implementation of the key controls over revenue 
recognition and performed substantive tests and analytical procedures of related revenue and 
revenue provisions. We have also challenged the judgements made in valuing the required 
revenue provisions which include challenging judgments with past experience to determine 
historical accuracy, as well as the consistency of judgements and assumptions applied 
between financial periods.
in addition, it audit specialist members of the audit team have tested automated controls for 
those systems controlled by the Group and the reconciliation of data in the revenue reporting 
systems to the general ledger.
Key observations Based on our procedures, the revenue provision estimates applied by management 
are appropriate.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Deferred tax valuation 
Risk description A deferred net tax liability of £0.6m (2016: £11.3m asset) is recognised at 31
st
 march 2017, 
representing assets of £4.0m offset by liabilities of £4.6m. Further detail is set out in the 
critical accounting judgements in note 4 and further detail is provided in note 23, as well 
as being included in the Audit c ommittee Report at page 76.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to  
the risk
We have evaluated management’s process to prepare the deferred tax calculation and 
evaluated the design and implementation of the controls in this process.
We critically assessed the judgements over the level of forecast taxable profits available 
to support the recoverability of recognised deferred tax assets. We have also considered 
historical utilisation of unclaimed capital allowances.
We have involved tax specialists to assist with our assessment of the tax principles applied 
in the tax calculations, being the treatment of long funding leases, assessing capital allowances 
available on owned assets and treatment of financial instruments and pensions.
Key observations Based on our procedures, the deferred tax valuation is consistent with the Group’s assessment 
of future taxable profits and capital allowances available and our understanding of the business.
t hese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
 
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality 
both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £1.90m (2016: £1.67m).
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
in determining materiality we considered a number of measures and derived a figure based on 
a percentage of revenue (0.27% in both the current and prior years).
Rationale for  
the benchmark 
applied
t his measure provides a consistent basis to the prior year and its movement reflects the 
growth in the overall business. Having also considered the group’s profitability and key 
movements in its financial position, such as fixed asset additions, disposals and maintenance 
accounting entries, we considered this level of materiality to be appropriate for the users of 
the financial statements. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Revenue £707.40m
Group materiality £1.90m
Component materiality range 
£0.63m to £1.81m
Audit Committee reporting 
threshold £0.10m
We agreed with the Audit c ommittee that we would 
report to the committee all audit differences in excess 
of £95,000 (2016: £83,500), as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to 
the Audit c ommittee on disclosure matters that we 
identified when assessing the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an 
understanding of the group and its environment, 
including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement at the group level. Based 
on that assessment, our group audit scope focused 
primarily on the audit work at the two components 
in the UK, being Flybe l imited (passenger operations) 
and Flybe Aviation services l imited (maintenance, 
repair and overhaul operations). Our audit work was 
completed by the group audit team and comprised 
a full scope audit on both UK components where the 
extent of our testing was based on our assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality 
of the Group’s operations in that component being: 
Flybe l imited £1.81m (FY16: £1.50m) and Flybe Aviation 
services l imited £0.63m (FY16: £0.84m). t hese 
components represent the principal business units 
and, together with head office, account for 100% of the 
Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax.
At the parent entity level and head office we also 
tested the consolidation process and carried out 
analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion 
that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement of the aggregated financial information 
of the remaining components not subject to audit.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the 
course of the audit:
 > t he part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the companies Act 2006; 
 > t he information given in the strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
 > t he strategic Report and the Directors’ Report 
have been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements.
in the light of the knowledge and understanding 
of the company and its environment obtained in 
the course of the audit, we have not identified any 
material misstatements in the strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report.
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the c ompanies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
 > We have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit; or
 > Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 > t he parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the c ompanies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our 
opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made 
or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report arising 
from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the l isting Rules we are also required to review part of the c orporate 
Governance statement relating to the company’s compliance with certain 
provisions of the UK corporate Governance code.
We have nothing to report arising 
from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under international s tandards on Auditing (UK and ireland), we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
 > materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
 > Apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
our knowledge of the group acquired in the course of performing our 
audit; or
 > Otherwise misleading.
in particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced 
and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed.
We confirm that we have not 
identified any such inconsistencies 
or misleading statements. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Prior year restatements:
1 A new finance system was implemented in the year which has resulted in a change in the presentation of transactional foreign 
exchange. Previously each income statement line had been shown at the effective exchange rate. From 1
st
 April 2016, foreign 
exchange gains and losses have been allocated to the appropriate income statement line. t he prior period consolidated income 
statement has therefore been restated which included adjustments to fuel of £(3.3)m, airport and en route charges of £3.1m and 
other operating gains of £2.4m. t here has been no impact to the operating profit for the year.
2 During the year the Group restated its 2015/16 income statement to reclassify contractor costs of £3.9m from the other 
operating expenses line to the staff costs line.

the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. if we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. General information
Flybe Group plc is a company incorporated in the United 
Kingdom under the c ompanies Act 2006. t he address 
of the registered office is given on page 64. t he nature 
of the UK Group’s operations and its principal activities 
are set out in the strategic Report on pages 1 to 55.
t hese financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates.
2. Adoption of new and revised standards
New and amended standards that are mandatorily 
effective for the current year
t here are no new accounting standards, amendments 
or interpretations which are mandatory for the first 
time for the financial year ended 31
st
 march 2017 that 
materially impact the Group.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not 
yet effective
At the date of approval of these financial statements, 
the following new standards and interpretations, which 
have not been applied in these financial statements, 
were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases 
had not yet been adopted by the eU):
 > iFRs 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (effective for the 
Group’s 2018/19 financial year);
 > iFRs 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ 
(effective for the Group’s 2018/19 financial year);
 > iFRs 16 ‘ l eases’ (effective for the Group’s 2019/20 
financial year);
 > iAs 7 (amendments) ‘statement of cash flows’ 
(not yet endorsed – effective for the Group’s 2017/18 
financial year); and
 > iFRs 2 (amendments) ‘c lassification and 
measurement of share-based payment transactions’ 
(not yet endorsed – effective for the Group’s 
2018/19 financial year).
iFRs 9 ‘Financial instruments’ is effective for periods 
beginning on or after 1
st
 January 2018. t he Group 
will adopt the standard from 1
st
 April 2018 and 
does not expect there to be a significant change in 
the classification and measurement of its financial 
instruments or in its hedging activities on adoption.
iFRs 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ is 
effective for periods beginning on or after 1
st
 January 
2018. t he Group will adopt the standard from 1
st
 April 
2018. Flybe is currently analysing revenue streams 
under iFRs 15 and we will follow industry guidance. 
At this stage, the Group anticipates potential changes 
regarding the timing of the recognition of certain 
ancillary revenue and revenue streams from third 
party contracts.
iFRs 16 ‘ l eases’ introduces a single lessee accounting 
model and is effective for periods beginning on or after 
1
st
 January 2019. t he new standard will require lessees 
to recognise a lease liability reflecting the obligation 
to make future lease payments and a ‘right-of-use’ 
asset for all leases unless exemption is taken for certain 
short-term leases or for leases of low-value assets. 
At 31
st
 march 2017, the Group has £332.9m outstanding 
commitments arising from operating leases (see note 
29) so the new standard will have a material impact on 
the Group. t he Group is currently assessing the impact 
of the new standard and it is not practicable to quantify 
the effect of this standard until this detailed review has 
been completed. in line with the reducing fleet size and 
planned hand-back of leases, the eventual ‘right of use’ 
asset capitalised is likely to be significantly less than 
the current outstanding lease commitment. t he Group 
expects to adopt the standard from 1
st
 April 2019 and is 
currently considering whether to use fully or modified 
retrospective application. 
iAs 7 (amendments) ‘ statement of cash flows’ is 
effective for periods beginning on or after 1
st
 January 
2017; it requires disclosures about changes in liabilities 
arising from financing activities. t he amendment will 
result in additional disclosures for the Group.
iFRs 2 (amendments) ‘c lassification and measurement 
of share-based payment transactions’ is effective 
for periods beginning on or after 1
st
 January 2018. 
t he amendment provides guidance on three issues: 
the effects of vesting conditions on the measurement 
of a cash-settled share-based payments; the 
classification of share-based payment transactions with 
net settlement features for withholding tax obligations; 
and the accounting for a modification to the terms and 
conditions of a share-based payment that changes 
the classification of the transaction from cash-settled 
to equity-settled. t he amendment is not expected to 
result in any material changes for the Group. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
t he financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with international Financial Reporting s tandards 
(‘iFRss’). t he financial statements have also been 
prepared in accordance with iFRss adopted by 
the european Union and therefore the Group 
financial statements comply with Article 4 of 
the eU iAs Regulation.
t he financial statements have been prepared on 
the historical cost basis, except for certain financial 
instruments that are recorded at fair value. t he principal 
accounting policies adopted, which have been applied 
consistently in the current and the prior financial year, 
are outlined below.
Basis of consolidation
t he consolidated financial statements incorporate 
the financial statements of the company and entities 
controlled by the company (its subsidiaries) made 
up to 31
st
 march each year. c ontrol is achieved when 
the c ompany is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the investee. 
t he financial statements of subsidiaries are included 
in the consolidated financial statements from the 
date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Going concern
t he directors have, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, a reasonable expectation that the company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

Revenue and revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable and represents 
amounts receivable for goods and services provided 
in the normal course of business, net of discounts, 
VAt and other sales-related taxes and comprises: 
Passenger revenue
s cheduled and charter passenger ticket sales, net 
of passenger taxes and discounts, are recorded in 
a ‘forward sales’ account and are included in current 
liabilities, within deferred income, until recognised as 
revenue when transportation occurs. t his also includes 
revenue derived from flights operated by the Group’s 
codeshare partners.
Unused tickets are recognised as revenue when the 
right to travel expires and the Group’s obligation to 
refund ceases, which is determined by the terms and 
conditions of these tickets.
Ancillary revenue, comprising principally baggage 
carriage, advanced seat assignment, commissions, 
change fees and credit and debit card fees due to 
the Group, are recognised as revenue on the date the 
right to receive consideration occurs. in respect of 
credit and debit card fees and hotel and insurance 
commission, this occurs when each flight is booked 
and paid for. For the remaining ancillary revenue, this 
occurs on the date of transportation, as this is when 
the service is generally provided.
commission received from the issue of Flybe branded 
credit cards by a third party provider is deferred 
to the extent that it relates to free flights which the 
Group is required to offer as part of the transaction. 
c ommission received in excess of the sales value of 
free flights granted to card-holders is recognised 
immediately as revenue. Revenue associated with free 
flights is recognised when the related flights are taken.
White Label flying revenue
White l abel (definition in the glossary on page 161) 
flying revenue is accounted for as a long term contract 
and is therefore recognised in the period when the 
service is delivered. income is deferred when there is 
a possibility of service-related penalties and then later 
released when it has been confirmed that the service 
level agreement has been satisfied.
Revenue from other activities
t hese represent the amounts derived from the provision 
of goods and services to customers during the year, 
including aircraft maintenance, overhauls and the 
associated rotable and consumable parts. t he amount 
of profit attributable to the stage of completion of 
an engine and maintenance overhaul contract is 
recognised when the outcome of the contract can be 
foreseen with reasonable certainty. Revenue for such 
contracts is stated at the cost appropriate to the stage 
of completion plus attributable profits, less amounts 
recognised in previous years. Provision is made for any 
losses as soon as they are foreseen.
Other revenues, such as for cargo and franchise, are 
recognised in the period when the services are provided.
Other revenue includes operational support received 
under airport partnership agreements and is recognised 
in the period to which it relates. 
Customer loyalty programme
Flybe has an agreement to enable Avios and BA 
executive c lub members to accrue Avios points 
when using Flybe’s network offering, including 
partners. Flybe simply purchases points from Avios 
at a pre-agreed rate which is recorded as a liability 
against deferred income. At transportation the cost 
of purchasing the points is charged against the 
passenger revenues.
in addition, Avios purchases passenger tickets from 
Flybe in order to include Flybe in its redemption 
network. Revenues from these tickets is accounted 
for as passenger revenue. Avios purchases the 
flights from Flybe on behalf of its customers and 
these are included in the deferred income and once 
transportation has been provided, in the income 
statement revenues.
Investment income
interest income is recognised when it is probable that 
the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably. interest 
income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected 
life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying 
amount on initial recognition.
Foreign currencies
t ransactions arising, other than in the functional 
currency, are recorded using the rate of exchange 
ruling at the date of the transaction. monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated using the rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. n on-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at 
fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. 
n on-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.
exchange differences are recognised on the other 
operating gains and losses line in the income 
statement in the period in which they arise. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at their cost, 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Aircraft and engines and other associated equipment 
are classified as aircraft. All other equipment is 
classified as plant and equipment.
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed 
on acquisition to prepaid maintenance of its engines 
and airframe and is amortised over a period from 
one to five years from the date of purchase to the 
date of the next scheduled maintenance event for 
the component. s ubsequent costs, such as long-term 
scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft, 
are capitalised and amortised over the length of period 
benefiting from these costs. All other costs relating 
to maintenance are charged to the income statement 
as incurred.
Advance payments and option payments made in 
respect of aircraft purchase commitments and options 
to acquire aircraft where the balance is expected to 
be funded by lease financing are recorded at cost in 
current or non-current aircraft deposits. On acquisition 
of the related aircraft, these payments are included as 
part of the cost of aircraft and are depreciated from 
that date. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Depreciation is provided by the Group to write off the 
cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed 
assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful 
economic lives as follows:
Freehold land n il
Freehold and short 
leasehold buildings
2% to 10% per annum or 
lease term where shorter
Plant, equipment and 
motor vehicles
10% to 50% per annum
Aircraft 4% to 20% per annum
maintenance assets 25% to 50% per annum
estimated residual values are reviewed annually at 
each period-end with reference to current market 
conditions. Where estimated residual values are found 
to have changed significantly this is accounted for 
prospectively as a change in estimate and depreciation 
charges over the remaining useful life of the asset are 
adjusted to take account of the revised estimate of 
residual value.
Intangible assets
Computer software
expenditure on research activities is recognised 
as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
expenditure on development activities is capitalised if 
the product or process is technically and commercially 
feasible and the Group intends to, and has the 
technical ability and sufficient resources to, complete 
development and if the Group can measure reliably the 
expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during 
its development. t he expenditure capitalised includes 
the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate 
proportion of overheads. Other development 
expenditure is recognised in the income statement as 
an expense as incurred.
computer software is carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. it is amortised on a straight-line basis 
over its useful economic life of five years.
Disposals of property, plant, equipment 
and intangible assets
t he gain or loss on disposal of property, plant, 
equipment and intangible assets after deducting 
any costs associated with selling, disposing of or 
retiring the relevant asset is recognised in the income 
statement and reported under other operating gains 
or losses.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. if any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any).
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. in assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for 
which the estimates of future cash flows have not 
been adjusted.
if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated 
to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there 
is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply 
with the conditions attaching to them and that the 
grants will be received. Once such assurance exists, 
government grants are either recognised in the 
income statement or, where related to property, plant 
and equipment, are treated as deferred income and 
released to the income statement over the expected 
useful lives of the assets concerned.
Inventories
inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
Aircraft deposits
Aircraft deposits represent deposits made with 
aircraft manufacturers for future delivery of aircraft 
or deposits made with aircraft financiers or operating 
lessors to provide security for future maintenance 
work or lease payments.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the relevant instrument.
Classification of financial instruments issued 
by the Group
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated 
as equity only to the extent that they meet the 
following two conditions:
 > t hey include no contractual obligations upon the 
Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to 
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with 
another party under conditions that are potentially 
unfavourable to the Group; and
 > Where the instrument will or may be settled in the 
company’s own equity instruments, it is either a 
non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver 
a variable number of the company’s own equity 
instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by 
the c ompany exchanging a fixed amount of cash or 
other financial assets for a fixed number of its own 
equity instruments.
t o the extent that this definition is not met, the 
proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. 
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form 
of the company’s own shares, the amounts presented 
in these financial statements for called up share capital 
and share premium account exclude amounts in 
relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities 
are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance 
payments associated with financial instruments that 
are classified in equity are treated as distributions and 
are recorded directly in equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
t he Group’s activities expose it primarily to the 
financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates and commodity prices. t he Group uses forward 
foreign exchange contracts and commodity swaps to 
hedge these exposures but does not use derivative 
financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised, 
and subsequently remeasured, at fair value.
t he Group designates hedges of foreign exchange 
and commodity price risks on firm commitments as 
cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting is applied to 
these instruments.
Cash flow hedges
c hanges in the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments that are designated and are effective as 
hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly 
in other comprehensive income and any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item.
Amounts deferred in other comprehensive income are 
recognised in the income statement in the same period 
in which the hedged item affects net income or loss. 
t hese amounts are recorded in the other operating 
gains/(losses) in the income statement as the hedged 
item (see note on face of consolidated income 
statement for prior year treatment). However, when 
the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial 
liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated 
in equity are transferred from equity and included in 
the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial 
asset or non-financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group 
revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain 
or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at 
that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised 
in the income statement. When a forecast transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss 
accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on 
a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial 
asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery 
of the investment within the timeframe established by 
the market concerned. initially they are measured at fair 
value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial 
assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss 
(‘FVt Pl ’) or at fair value designated and effective as 
hedges, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified into the following 
specified categories: financial assets at FVt Pl , 
financial assets that are designated and effective 
as hedging instruments and ‘loans and receivables’. 
t he classification depends on the nature and purpose 
of the financial assets and is determined at the time of 
initial recognition. t he Group holds no ‘available-for-
sale’ or ‘held-to-maturity’ financial assets.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets are classified as at FVt Pl when 
the financial asset is either held for trading or is 
designated as at FVt Pl . A fuel or foreign exchange 
hedging instrument is classified as held for trading if 
it is a derivative that is not designated and effective 
as a hedging instrument. A fuel or foreign exchange 
hedging instrument may be designated as at FVt Pl 
upon initial recognition if the instrument forms part 
of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities, 
or both, which is managed and its performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the 
Group’s documented risk management strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally 
on that basis.
Financial assets at FVt Pl are stated at fair value, 
with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognised in the income statement. t he net gain or 
loss recognised in the income statement incorporates 
any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset 
and is included in the ‘unrealised gains and losses on 
fuel and foreign exchange hedges’ line item or ‘other 
gains and losses’ line item in the income statement 
depending upon the nature of the instrument. 
Loans and receivables
t rade receivables, loans and other receivables that 
have fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market are classified as ‘loans and 
receivables’. l oans and receivables are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less any impairment. interest income is recognised by 
applying the effective interest rate, except for short-
term receivables when the recognition of interest 
would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVt Pl , are 
assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance 
sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there 
is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more 
events that occurred after the initial recognition of 
the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows 
of the investment have been affected.
Derecognition of financial assets
t he Group derecognises a financial asset only when 
the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
asset expire; or it transfers the financial asset and 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the asset to another entity. if the Group neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership and continues to control the 
transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained 
interest in the asset and an associated liability for 
amounts it may have to pay.
Cash and cash equivalents
c ash, for the purposes of the cash flow statement, 
comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on 
demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
c ash equivalents are current asset investments which 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash at, 
or close to, their carrying values or traded in an active 
market, without curtailing or disrupting the business.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash represents funds held by the Group 
in bank accounts which cannot be withdrawn until 
certain conditions have been fulfilled. t he aggregate 
restricted funds balance is disclosed by way of a note 
to these financial statements and is classified as a 
current or non-current asset based on the estimated 
remaining length of the restriction.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either 
financial liabilities or equity instruments according to 
the substance of the contractual arrangements.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities. equity instruments issued 
by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised as either financial 
liabilities at FVt Pl , financial liabilities that are 
designated and effective as hedging instruments, 
or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVt Pl when 
the financial liability is either held for trading or it is 
designated as at FVt Pl . A fuel or foreign exchange 
hedging instrument is classified as held for trading if 
it is a derivative that is not designated and effective 
as a hedging instrument. A fuel or foreign exchange 
hedging instrument may be designated as at FVt Pl 
upon initial recognition if the instrument forms part 
of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities, 
or both, which is managed and its performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the 
Group’s documented risk management strategy, and 
information about the grouping is provided internally 
on that basis.
Financial liabilities at FVt Pl are stated at fair value, 
with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognised in profit or loss. t he net gain or loss 
recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest 
paid on the financial liability and is included in the 
‘unrealised gains and losses on fuel hedges’ line item 
or ‘other gains and losses’ line item in the income 
statement. Fair value is determined in the manner 
described in note 33.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are 
initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
with interest expense recognised on an effective yield 
basis. t he effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability 
and of allocating interest expense over the relevant 
period. t he effective interest rate is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash payments 
through the expected life of the financial liability, 
or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net 
carrying amount on initial recognition.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
t he Group derecognises financial liabilities when, 
and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or they expire.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event, it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle that obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
t he amount recognised as a provision is the best 
estimate of the consideration required to settle the 
present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking 
into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding 
the obligation. Where a provision is measured 
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present 
obligation, its carrying amount is the present value 
of those cash flows. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

3. Significant accounting policies 
continued
When some or all of the economic benefits required 
to settle a provision are expected to be recovered 
from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an 
asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will 
be received and the amount of the receivable can be 
measured reliably.
Leased aircraft maintenance provisions
t he Group incurs liabilities for maintenance costs 
in respect of aircraft leased under operating leases 
during the term of the lease. t hese arise from the 
contractual obligations relating to the condition of the 
aircraft when it is returned to the lessor. t o discharge 
these obligations, the Group will either need to 
compensate the lessor for the element of the life of the 
component or maintenance intervals used, or carry out 
the maintenance check before return of the aircraft to 
the lessor.
t he provisions recorded and charged to the income 
statement are dependent on the life of the component 
or maintenance interval used and the individual terms 
of the lease:
 > n o charge is recorded during the initial period 
of lease agreements where no compensation or 
maintenance is required prior to hand-back;
 > After a component or maintenance interval passes 
its half-life (or another measure depending on the 
individual lease) and compensation would be due to 
the lessor in accordance with the terms of the lease, 
a provision and matching income statement charge 
is recorded equal to the amount of compensation 
that would be required based on the hours or cycles 
flown at the balance sheet date; and
 > After a component or maintenance interval has 
passed the trigger point such that the Group is 
contractually obliged to carry out the specified 
work, a full provision for the cost of work is 
recorded. t o the extent that this provision 
represents an increase to the half-life compensation 
provision already recorded, a maintenance asset is 
recorded within property, plant and equipment. t he 
asset is depreciated over the expected period to the 
next half-life compensation point, or the end of the 
lease, whichever is sooner.
Where maintenance is provided under ‘power by the 
hour’ contracts and maintenance paid to maintenance 
providers to cover the cost of the work is deemed to be 
irrecoverable, these payments are expensed as incurred 
and maintenance provisions are reduced to reflect the 
fact that the Group has already paid for the related 
maintenance work. maintenance deposits which are 
refundable are recorded as other receivables.
estimates are required to establish the likely utilisation 
of the aircraft, the expected cost of a maintenance 
check at the time it is expected to occur, the condition 
of an aircraft and the lifespan of life-limited parts. 
t he bases of all estimates are reviewed once each year 
and also when information becomes available that is 
capable of causing a material change to an estimate, 
such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions, 
increased or decreased utilisation, or unanticipated 
changes in the cost of heavy maintenance services.
EU261 passenger delay compensation
Provision is made for passenger compensation claims 
when the group has an obligation to recompense 
customers under regulation eU261 where technical 
issues have caused flights to be delayed. Provisions are 
measured based on known eligible flights delays and 
historic claim rates and are expected to unwind across 
the claim window, which is six years. 
Leases
Operating leases
Rental charges on operating leases are charged to 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
life of the lease. in the event that lease incentives are 
received to enter into operating leases, such incentives 
are recognised as a liability. t he aggregate benefit 
of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental 
expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the 
lease term. 
At 31st march 2017, 67.5% of Flybe’s fleet was leased via 
operating leases from seven lessors (see page 30). t he 
aircraft are owned by the lessor (or a special purpose 
company they manage) and Flybe and the lessor enter 
into an operating lease agreement. Operating leases 
are less cash-intensive at delivery – contrasted to a loan 
with an initial deposit requirement – and remove aircraft 
residual value risk.
During the lease term Flybe is responsible for paying 
rent to the lessor and for the operation, maintenance 
and insurance of the aircraft. At the end of the lease 
term the aircraft is redelivered to the lessor in a 
condition described in the lease. s ome of the leases 
include extension rights which can be exercised to 
extend the lease by a further fixed term; the leases are 
not open-ended. maintenance provisions are discussed 
in the accounting policy on page 124.
Sale and leaseback
t he Group enters into sale and leaseback transactions 
whereby it sells aircraft, or rights to acquire aircraft, 
to a third party. Flybe subsequently leases the aircraft 
back, by way of an operating lease. Any profit or loss 
on the disposal, where the price that the aircraft is sold 
for is not considered to be fair value, is deferred and 
amortised over the lease term of the asset.
Finance leases
Where the Group enters into a lease which entails 
taking substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a ‘finance 
lease’. t he asset is recorded in the balance sheet as 
property, plant and equipment, and is depreciated 
over the estimated useful life to the Group. t he asset is 
recorded at the lower of its fair value, less accumulated 
depreciation, and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments at the inception of the finance lease. 
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance 
charges, are included as obligations under finance 
leases. Rental payments are apportioned between 
the finance element, which is charged to the income 
statement, and the capital element, which reduces 
the outstanding obligation for future instalments. t he 
finance charge is allocated to each period during the 
lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Onerous leases
Onerous lease provisions are made in respect of the 
present obligation arising under an onerous contract. 
t he provision recognised is for any unavoidable net 
loss estimated to arise from the contract, being the 
lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any 
compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil 
the contract. 
Taxation
c urrent and deferred tax are recognised in profit 
or loss, except when they relate to items that are 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax 
are also recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity respectively. 
Current tax
t he tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for 
the year. t axable profit differs from net profit as reported 
in the income statement because it excludes items of 
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in 
other years and it excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible. t he Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable on differences between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised, 
unless the deferred tax assets arise from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
t he carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

3. Significant accounting policies 
continued
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except when it relates 
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to set off current 
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current 
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Employee benefit costs
t he Group operates defined contribution and defined 
benefit pension schemes.
For the defined contribution schemes, the assets of 
the schemes are held separately from those of the 
Group in independently administered funds. t he 
amount charged to the income statement represents 
the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of 
the accounting period.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing 
benefits is determined using the Projected Unit c redit 
method, with actuarial valuations being carried out 
at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement 
comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of 
the asset ceiling and the return on scheme assets 
(excluding interest) are recognised immediately in 
the balance sheet with a charge to the statement of 
comprehensive income in the period in which they 
occur. Remeasurement recorded in the statement of 
comprehensive income is not recycled. n et-interest 
income (or expense) is recognised within finance costs 
and is calculated by applying a discount rate to the 
net defined benefit liability. t he Group presents the 
administration costs of the scheme in other operating 
costs in its consolidated income statement.
t he retirement benefit obligation recognised in the 
consolidated balance sheet represents the deficit 
in the Group’s defined benefit schemes. if a surplus 
resulted from this calculation it would be limited to the 
present value of any economic benefit available in the 
form of refund from the schemes or reduction in future 
contributions to the schemes.
Share-based payments
equity-settled share-based payments to employees 
and others providing similar services are measured at 
the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant 
date. t he fair value excludes the effect of non-market-
based vesting conditions. Details regarding the 
determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-
based transactions are set out in note 31.
t he fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based 
on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that 
will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, 
the Group revises its estimate of the number of 
equity instruments expected to vest as a result of 
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. 
t he impact of the revision of the original estimates, 
if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with 
a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
sAYe share options granted to employees are treated 
as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to 
the scheme. t his results in accelerated recognition of 
the expense that would have arisen over the remainder 
of the original vesting period.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability 
is recognised for the good or services required, 
measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At 
each balance sheet date until the liability is settled and 
at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is 
remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised 
in profit or loss for the year.
4. Critical accounting judgements in 
applying the Group’s accounting policies 
in the application of the Group’s accounting 
policies, which are described in note 3, the directors 
are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. t he estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and other factors 
that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
t he estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised if the revision affects only that period or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
t he following are the critical judgements that the 
directors have made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies and that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
financial statements:
Recognition of deferred tax assets
t he Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities 
based on the temporary differences between the 
financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reviewed 
regularly to assess potential realisation, and where the 
directors believe that realisation is not probable, that 
portion of the asset is not recorded. in performing 
this review, Flybe makes estimates and assumptions 
regarding projected future taxable income and the 
expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary 
differences. A change in these assumptions could cause 
an increase or decrease in the amount recognised 
resulting in an increase or decrease in the effective 
tax rate, which could materially impact the results of 
operations. Flybe expect to have available sufficient 
capital allowances arising from assets held at balance 
sheet date, such that taxable profits are not expected 
to arise within a reasonable outlook period. As a result, 
the net deferred tax position has moved from an asset 
of £11.3m to a liability of £(0.6)m at 31
st
 march 2017 
(see note 23).
Employee benefits
Accounting for pensions and other post–retirement 
benefits involves judgement about uncertain events 
including, but not limited to life expectancy and future 
pay inflation. Determination of the projected benefit 
obligations for the Group’s defined benefit scheme is 
important to the recorded amount of benefit expense 
in the income statement and valuation of the balance 
sheet. Details of the assumptions used are included 
in note 32. Any change in these assumptions could 
potentially result in a significant change to the pension 
assets/(liabilities), commitments and pension costs in 
future periods. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

metric as it was determined that forecasts are most sensitive to revenue movements. Only when the revenue per 
seat is decreased by 5.4% does the recoverable amount equal its carrying amount. Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

Where carried forward losses or unclaimed capital allowances are available, they are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
t he directors have exercised judgement in determining the extent of the realisation of these losses based upon 
estimates of future taxable income. Deferred tax assets relating to unclaimed capital allowances have not been 
recognised in the current year due to the length of time expected until they are likely to be utilised. 
£21.1m of deferred tax assets have not been recognised in the year (2016: £13.0m). if actual events differ from the 
directors’ estimates, or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future, any recognition in the future 
of previously generated assets would have a material impact on the Group’s effective tax rates.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

the year ended 31

the full amount of £22.5m into the retained earnings 
reserve therefore eliminating the accumulated deficit 
on the retained earnings reserve and creating a positive 
balance of distributable reserves in the company.
t his balance gave the Board the flexibility to 
proceed with a share grant of 5% of basic salary to 
all employees employed as at 31
st
 July 2016, giving 
employees a stake in the c ompany (see note 31 on

Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
Saad Hammad’s recruitment award
As part of his remuneration arrangements on joining Flybe, s aad Hammad received an award under the one-
off lti P which provided him with an entitlement to a cash payment based on the incremental growth in Flybe’s 
market capitalisation over a three-year period commencing on 1
st
 August 2013.
t o the extent the award vested at the end of the three-year performance period, 50% of the award was to be 
released after three years, with the remainder released after further deferral periods of six months (25% of the 
award) and 12 months (25% of the award).
Having assessed performance against the targets applicable to this award, the Remuneration committee 
determined that no portion of this award vested, resulting in the entire award lapsing in August 2016. t he lti P 
liability was therefore released, resulting in a less than £0.1m credit to the income statement (2015/16: £0.3m). 
Philip de Klerk’s recruitment award 
Philip de Klerk was granted a phantom option under the cash-based lti P on 22
nd
 August 2014 over 705,096 notional 
shares with an ‘opening price’ of £1.2126. t his award vests on the third anniversary of grant provided that the ‘closing 
price’ (i.e. the average share price over three months prior to the third anniversary of grant) is at least £1.6126. 
During the financial year an amount less than £0.1m was credited to the income statement as a result of the valuation 
movement in the lti P liability. t he lti P liability was valued at less than £0.1m at 31
st
 march 2016 and 31
st
 march 2017.
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
t he company has a share award scheme under which all employees of the Group may be granted awards. 
Awards are exercisable at nil consideration. t he vesting period is three years and awards are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group before the awards vest. 
t he vesting of these awards is subject to the performance of a Flybe share price hurdle at the end of the three-
year period. Awards will vest in full if Flybe’s three-month average share price at the end of the three-year 
performance period has met the share price performance hurdle.

Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
During 2016/17, the performance conditions for 
the 2015/16 bonus were assessed and £3.6m was 
determined not to be payable and was therefore 
released to the consolidated income statement. At the 
same time, a si P was announced which will cost £3.3m 
over the three years from grant date and is phased 
according to iFRs 2.
employees have been able to participate in the 
Group’s si P under which all eligible employees were 
awarded shares to the value of 5% of their basic salary 
up to a maximum of £3,600. t he shares are held in 
t rust by c apita iRG t rustees l imited in a plan called 
the ‘Flybe share incentive Plan’. if during the three-
year vesting period an individual ceases to be an 
employee, the shares will be forfeited.
if 5% of their basic salary exceeded £3,600, then 
additional shares have been awarded separately as a 
‘t op-up award’ in a Ps P. t hese top-up shares are held 
in a separate employee trust.
eligible employees were granted awards totalling 
6,422,968 shares in the si P with a grant date of 
26
th
 s eptember 2016, and 233,188 shares in the Ps P 
(see above) with a grant date of 29
th
 s eptember 2016. 
t he fair value of these awards is equal to the face 
value of these awards (the three-day average closing 
market price was 51.42p) spread over the three-year 
vesting period.
t he Group recognised expenses of £0.5m in relation to 
this award in the year to 31
st
 march 2017. 
Deferred bonus scheme for 2015/16
As disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration report 
on page 72 of the Group’s Annual Report for the 
financial year ended 31
st
 march 2016, the Remuneration 
committee and the executive directors agreed that 45% 
of the bonus should be payable in Flybe shares, subject 
to a one-year deferral period. t he fair value of these 
awards is equal to the face value of these awards, 38.0p 
on the date of grant of 2
nd
 August 2016, spread over the 
one-year vesting period. Although saad Hammad has 
left the Board (effective 26
th
 October 2017) and Philip 
de Klerk resigned post year end (his resignation was 
announced on 18
th
 April 2017 and he will remain in post 
until the end of september 2017), under the terms of 
their contracts, this scheme will still vest in July 2017.
t he Group recognised expenses of £0.2m in relation to 
this scheme in the year to 31
st
 march 2017. 
Summary
t he Group recognised total expenses of £1.4m in 
relation to share-based payments in the year ended 
31
st
 march 2017 (2015/16: £0.6m). in addition, less than 
£0.1m was credited to the income statement as a result 
of movement on valuation of lti Ps (2015/16: £0.4m). 
t he Group has recorded total liabilities in respect of 
the lti P schemes of less than £0.1m at 31
st
 march 2017 
(2016: less than £0.1m).
32. Retirement benefits
Defined contribution schemes
t he Group operates defined contribution retirement 
schemes for all qualifying employees in the United 
Kingdom. t he assets of the schemes are held 
separately from those of the Group in funds under 
the control of trustees.
t he total cost charged to the income statement 
of £5.4m (2015/16: £5.1m) represents contributions 
payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit scheme
t he defined benefit scheme operated by the 
Group was acquired on 5
th
 march 2007 as part 
of the acquisition of BA c onnect. t he scheme was 
closed to contributions during that year and most 
members now participate in the Group’s defined 
contribution scheme. 
t he triennial valuation is carried out for the t rustee 
by a professionally qualified independent actuary. 
t he purpose of the valuation is to design a funding 
plan to ensure that the scheme has sufficient funds 
available to meet future benefit payments. t he latest 
funding valuation was performed as at 31
st
 march 2016 
and showed a deficit of £(12.2)m which has resulted in 
a revised funding plan being agreed between the Group 
and the t rustee. As a result of this new agreement, the 
Group will pay annual deficit contributions of £0.83m 
(previously £0.5m) with the increased payments 
starting in June 2017. t he recovery plan payments 
along with the investment returns from return-seeking 
assets, is expected to make good this shortfall by 
31
st
 march 2028. 
At 31
st
 march 2017, the iAs 19 net accounting deficit has 
been recognised on the balance sheet. t he principal 
assumptions used for the purpose of the iAs 19

Pension s cheme (‘sAPs ’) tables and the continuous 
mortality investigation (‘cmi’) 2016 long-term rate 
projections of 1.5%, weighted by 95% (males) and 85%

Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value
t he fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
 > t he fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on 
active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices.
 > t he fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined 
with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable 
current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
 > t he fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, 
a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments 
for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives. Foreign currency forward 
contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates matching maturities of the contracts. interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash 
flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Financial instruments recorded at fair value at 31
st
 March 2017
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into l evels 1 to 
3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 > l evel 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities;
 > l evel 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within l evel 1 
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); 
and
 > l evel 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or 
liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information

t he fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from 
banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under 
finance leases, as well as other non-current financial 
liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows 
using rates currently available for debt on similar 
terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. 
Financial risk management objectives
t he Group is exposed to financial risks in respect of:
 > l iquidity and management of working capital;
 > Foreign currency;
 > interest rates;
 > c redit risk; and
 > commodities.
A description of each risk, together with the policy 
for managing risk, is given below. t o manage these 
risks, the Group uses various derivative financial 
instruments, including foreign currency forward 
contracts and commodity contracts. t hese derivative 
financial instruments are generally held to maturity 
and are not actively traded. t he Group enters into 
these arrangements with the goal of hedging its 
operational and balance sheet, income statements 
and cash flow risk. However, the Group’s exposure to 
commodity price and currency exchange fluctuations 
cannot be neutralised completely.
Liquidity and working capital risk management
t he Group manages its capital to ensure that entities 
in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns 
while maximising the return to stakeholders through 
the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. 
t he capital structure of the Group consists of debt, 
which includes the borrowings (see note 21), cash and 
cash equivalents (see note 18) and equity attributable 
to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued 
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in 
the consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
notes 25 to 27.
Capital management and gearing ratio
t he Group Board reviews the capital structure on 
a regular basis. As part of this review, the Board 
considered the cost of capital and the risks associated 
with each class of capital. t he gearing ratio at the 
year-end is as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Debt (188.3) (109.2)
c ash, cash equivalents and 
restricted cash 124.3 171.4
Net (debt)/cash (64.0) 62.2
Equity 153.5 154.2
Net debt to equity ratio 41.7% (40.3)%
Debt is defined as long-term and short-term 
borrowings as detailed in note 21. equity includes 
all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to 
equity holders of the parent.
Liquidity risk management
t he directors believe that the Group has adequate cash holdings to meet its short-term payables as they fall due. 
t he Group also arranges to borrow funds in order to finance purchase of aircraft and engines. t he following table, 
which does not take into account the discounting of cash flows and includes forecast interest payments, shows the

Foreign currency risk management
t he Group undertakes certain transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the 
leasing and purchase of aircraft, spare parts and fuel in 
Us dollars. Hence, significant exposures to exchange 
rate fluctuations arise to Us dollars. i n addition, certain 
sales and airport costs are incurred in euros. 
exchange rate exposures are managed within approved 
parameters by entering into a series of foreign 
exchange forward contracts. t hese contracts are used 
in conjunction with fuel derivatives to mitigate fuel 
procurement price risk. in addition, foreign exchange 
forward contracts are matched to planned purchases 
of aircraft, spare parts and lease costs. it is the policy 
of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange 
contracts to cover specific Us dollar payments to cover 
up to 90% of the exposure generated.
t he Group does not enter into significant euro foreign 
exchange forward contracts as the euro payment 
exposure is largely, though not entirely, offset by euro 
revenue receipts. t here were no euro contracts at 
31
st
 march 2017 or 31
st
 march 2016.

has resulted in more visibility of foreign currency balances. 
t he 2015/16 comparatives have therefore been restated to include 
all monetary non-derivative financial assets and liabilities.
Commodity price risk management
t he Group purchases fuel on the open market from 
recognised fuel suppliers in order to operate its 
fleet of aircraft and this constitutes a substantial 
portion of the Group’s activities (approximately 
14.8% and 17.6% of Flybe UK segment costs in the 
years ended 31
st
 march 2017 and 2016 respectively. 
t he prior year percentage has been restated from 
17.1% due to the foreign exchange restatement). 
t he Group engages in fuel price hedging and foreign 
exchange transactions from time to time to meet its 
policy of entering into forward fuel price exchange 
contracts and other related financial instruments 
to cover a significant percentage of its anticipated 
requirements for fuel over a 12-month period.
Aviation fuel is a variable cost which has had a material 
impact on the Group’s results during the period under 
review. A variety of external factors, such as changes 
in supply and demand for oil and oil-related products 
and the increasing role of speculators and funds in 
the futures markets, have played their part in making 
aviation fuel prices highly volatile. it is fuel price 
volatility which is the main driver of variances in the 
Group’s overall fuel costs.
t he Group operates a policy during normal trading 
conditions of managing this volatility by entering 
into derivative contracts representing a portion of its 
aviation fuel requirements a minimum of 12 months 
forward.
t he actual amount covered by such contracts 
amounted to 83.2% of the following year’s budgeted 
fuel consumption as at 31
st
 march 2017 (2016: 90%). 
t he actual number of emissions credits purchased 
for calendar year 2016 amounted to 593,119 tonnes, 
including free allowances of 222,778 tonnes; the 
average price of the purchased allowances was €7.77.
c arbon emissions requirements for calendar year 2017 
are currently expected to amount to 556,902 tonnes 
including free allowances of 222,778 tonnes. s o far the 
Group has purchased 100% of its requirement for 2017 
at an average cost of €4.86.

Percentage increase in cost of fuel 10% 10%

Cash flow hedge effectiveness
t he Group designates certain hedges of foreign 
exchange and fuel price risks on firm commitments 
as cash flow hedges. At 31
st
 march 2017, the Group 
has identified 132 (2016: 166) contracts for foreign 
exchange purchases and 125 (2016: 151) contracts for 
fuel purchases which have been designated as cash 
flow hedges. For these hedges, the changes in the 
fair value of the financial instruments were compared 
to market movement in the underlying hedged items 
and were found to be an effective offset. As a result an 
increase in the fair value of these financial derivative 
instruments of £35.8m (2016: £4.2m) was taken to 
equity through the hedging reserve.
Interest rate risk management
t he Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Group 
borrows funds in order to finance the purchase of 
aircraft and engines at both fixed and floating interest 
rates. t he risk is managed by the Group maintaining an 
appropriate mix that varies from time-to-time between 
fixed and floating rate borrowings based on current 
year conditions and debt levels.
t he Group’s exposure to interest rates in financial 
assets and financial liabilities is detailed in the liquidity 
risk management section of this note.
it is estimated that a general increase/ (decrease) in 
interest rates would (worsen)/ improve the Group’s 
result before tax and (decrease)/increase its equity by 
approximately:
2017 2016
Percentage increase 1% 1%
impact on (loss)/profit before tax 
and equity (£m) (1.1) (1.1)
Credit risk management
t he Group is exposed to credit risk arising from cash 
and deposits, derivative financial instruments and 
trade and other receivables. t he risk of loss of value 
due to a counterparty default is minimised by entering 
into transactions with counterparties that have a 
minimum credit rating of A (or equivalent) as awarded 
by moody’s, Fitch or standard and Poor’s. in addition, 
counterparties with a credit rating of B or above can 
be used provided the exposure to that institution does 
not exceed £5.0m.
t he maximum exposure to credit risk is all financial 
assets plus any financial guarantees.
34. Related parties
t he Group companies did not enter into any 
transactions with related parties which are not 
members of the Group.
Transactions with key management personnel
Directors of the company and their immediate 
relatives control approximately 0.5% of the voting 
shares of the c ompany (2016: 0.4%).
t he remuneration of the directors, who are the key

evaluating potential new solutions, but has not yet 
made a final decision on the future service provider. 
it remains likely that the Board will approve a change 
of provider and, once committed, this is likely to 
trigger a contract cost of approximately £6m in 
respect of the existing services. We expect that this 
will be confirmed in the first half of 2017/18.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information
