6 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 7 2. Proven ability to create 
value post‑acquisition 
ContourGlobal’s exceptional operating 
team has consistently reduced costs 
at projects, while improving operating 
efficiency and maintaining an excellent 
health and safety record. ContourGlobal 
has benchmarked in the top decile 
of operating performance in the 
global power industry over the 
past several years. 
Our team has also demonstrated the 
ability to increase contracted revenue 
through: (i) expansion opportunities, 
where marginal economics are even 
more accretive due to the utilization of 
existing infrastructure; (ii) repowering 
opportunities where technology has 
improved dramatically; and (iii) contract 
extensions that extract additional 
profitability from assets when their 
useful lives extend beyond the 
original contracted period. 
We have significant demand from 
financial investment partners seeking to 
make passive, minority investments in 
some of our assets on attractive terms 
for ContourGlobal. These “farm-downs” 
significantly bolster our project returns.
Board Appointments 
In preparation for the IPO, we 
welcomed Dr. Alan Gillespie and 
Alejandro Santo Domingo to the Board 
as Non-Executive Directors, both of 
whom bring significant UK plc and 
relevant industry experience. We were 
also delighted to appoint Ruth Cairnie as 
an additional Non-Executive Director 
in January 2018. Ruth has significant 
experience in the global energy sector 
and as a Non-Executive Director of 
UK-listed companies. Following Ruth’s 
appointment, our Board (excluding me 
as Chairman) comprises a majority of 
independent Directors, and we are 
confident that it has the right balance 
of skills and experience to support the 
executive team. More details on the 
Board and appointments can be found 
in the Governance section on pages 
50 to 53. 
Corporate Governance 
At IPO, the Company became subject to 
the corporate governance requirements 
of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules, 
and the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”). In the months 
leading up to the listing, much work 
was carried out to ensure that the 
Board had constituted appropriate 
Committees and adopted relevant 
policies and procedures to support the 
development of a robust governance 
structure and compliance with the 
Code. This work is described more 
fully in our Corporate Governance 
report on pages 54 to 59. The Board 
is satisfied that we have in place a 
robust governance structure, which 
is fit for purpose and in line with our 
listed status, and we will ensure that 
our governance arrangements will adapt 
if appropriate in connection with the 
new UK Corporate Governance Code 
anticipated to come into force in 2019. 
Dividends 
Our dividend policy is unchanged 
since the IPO (as described in detail 
on page 80). The Board is pleased to 
propose a final dividend of 2.6 cents 
(US dollar) per Ordinary share. The 
dividend will be paid, subject to 
shareholder approval at our 2018 
Annual General Meeting, on 31st May 
2018 to shareholders on the register 
as of 4th May 2018.
2017 Highlights 
2017 was a year of strong financial 
performance for the Company. We 
delivered year-on-year Adjusted 
EBITDA growth of 16.5% and achieved 
2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $513.2m 
and Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA of 4.1x, 
both consistent with our guidance. 
We significantly progressed a number 
of major projects, successfully 
integrated prior acquisitions, and ended 
the year on a strong financial footing, 
with significant liquidity for growth. 
ContourGlobal also achieved the 
lowest health and safety incident rate 
in our history, demonstrating our 
commitment to providing a safe 
working environment for employees, 
contractors and subcontractors. 
2018 Outlook 
The global power industry continues 
to grow rapidly and is experiencing 
significant change as nations pursue 
policies of energy security, economic 
development and decarbonization. As 
integrated power companies continue to 
rethink their global asset mix, I believe 
ContourGlobal, as a leader in the 
contracted power generation space, 
is well positioned to capitalize on our 
disciplined, opportunistic growth 
strategy. Our focus on wholesale, 
contracted power generation will 
continue to produce low-risk, long-term 
cash flows, while our extraordinary 
operating team continues to optimize 
and expand our portfolio.
2017 has been a significant year in the 
Company’s history and I feel privileged 
to be Chairman at this exciting time 
in ContourGlobal’s development. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank our management team and all 
of our nearly 2,000 employees across 
19 countries for their continued 
dedication and hard work. 
Craig A. Huff 
Chairman
Overview 
I am excited to introduce 
ContourGlobal’s 2017 Annual Report, 
our first as a public company. The IPO 
on the Main Market of the London 
Stock Exchange in November 2017 
was a significant milestone for our 
business, and we were pleased 
to attract a strong, high-quality 
investor base. 
As this is my first Chairman’s letter, 
I would like to highlight two important 
aspects of our business approach. These 
have been important contributors to 
ContourGlobal’s success as a private 
company and, I believe, will play an 
integral role in delivering robust returns 
for ContourGlobal’s public shareholders. 
1. Disciplined, opportunistic 
approach to allocating capital 
ContourGlobal has demonstrated 
operational and development expertize 
across seven fuel types and four 
continents. This capability allows us to 
focus exclusively on the most attractive 
risk-adjusted growth projects, without 
narrowing our scope by technology 
or geography.
We primarily look at transactions with 
long-term contracted cash flows to 
creditworthy counterparties.
These transactions often have 
complexities that make it difficult for 
other potential buyers to compete and 
create opportunities for our operating 
team to realize material value post-
transaction. 
In our short time as a public company, 
we have signed two significant 
agreements. In December, we signed 
commercial agreements with the 
Government of Kosovo for a 500 MW 
development project. This milestone 
occurred because ContourGlobal’s 
technological expertize, credibility, 
and experience led us to be the only 
company designated as the preferred 
developer to negotiate with the 
government on this transformative 
project for the country. In February, 
we signed an agreement to purchase 
a 250 MW concentrated solar power 
(CSP) operating portfolio in Spain from 
Acciona Energia, which was negotiated 
on a bilateral basis without an auction 
process. I expect these projects to 
produce attractive returns on equity 
and generate strong, contracted cash 
flows for 20 and 18 years, respectively. 
Our pipeline of attractive, opportunistic 
projects is robust, and we are excited 
about our accretive growth prospects 
over the next several years. If we ever 
find ourselves in a position where 
growth becomes unattractive, we 
will accelerate the return of capital 
to shareholders.
 Chairman ’ s 
letter
Our pipeline of attractive, opportunistic 
projects is robust, and we are excited 
about our accretive growth prospects 
over the next several years.
8 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 9 The cause of this miss was a tough 
blow – a car accident on an Armenian 
mountain pass near our Vorotan 
hydroelectric facility – an accident in 
which the other driver was conclusively 
“at fault.” The cruel realization even 
led some in the company to question 
whether this was “really” a lost time 
incident which should count as an LTI
3
 
– particularly as the incident didn’t 
occur in one of our power plants.
We embraced the failure, learning that 
failure teaches us the most when it is 
used to explain and not to blame. We 
launched a Five Whys into the traffic 
accident to understand the root cause 
and whether there was something that 
we could have done to either avoid or 
minimize the risk to our people. This 
was a serious incident, one which 
injured two of our people and caused 
one of them to undergo a painful 
surgery and hospitalization.
The findings revealed that there was 
more that we could do. The airbags 
did not deploy on our vehicle as they 
should have. It turns out that the 
vehicle had been involved in a 
previous accident in the years before 
we acquired the plant and the airbags 
had not been replaced. Would airbags 
have made a difference in this 
accident? Maybe, at least in terms of 
the severity of the injury. 
Despite this incident in Armenia, our 
health and safety achievements globally 
were extraordinary and record setting. 
We achieved a 0.03 LTIR and a 0.10 
Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR
4
). 
Missing Target Zero in its inaugural year 
taught us much – to inspect all vehicles 
and vehicle histories when acquiring 
a business. To obtain training records 
and introduce drivers’ training programs 
to encourage defensive driving and 
appropriate risk assessment particularly 
in remote areas. Embracing failure will 
make us better and safer. And with just 
a bit of luck, enable us to achieve 
Target Zero in 2018.
We also had a very strong operating 
year with better than target 
availabilities in our thermal fleet and 
most of our renewable fleet. In our 
thermal business, we are paid mainly 
to be available with virtually no 
volume risk. As a result, Equivalent 
Availability Factor (“EAF”) is the KPI 
that tells us how well we are operating 
and maintaining our thermal plants. 
2017 was a very good year in all 
thermal technology clusters, namely 
reciprocating engines, Combined 
Cycle Gas Turbines, Coal-fired plants 
and our Solutions’ quad-gen facilities. 
Thermal Fleet Equivalent Availability 
Factor for 2017 was 92.6% for the year, 
which is better than target and in line 
with recent performance. 
In our renewable business, we need to 
maintain high availabilities, but strong 
financial results also require the 
cooperation of the weather to produce 
acceptable irradiation, wind speeds 
and hydrology. As such we focus on 
two KPIs in our renewable business: 
EAF as in the thermal business but 
also Capacity Factor (“CF”), which 
measures the percentage of the time 
that the asset is generating electricity. 
EAF in the renewable business 
was excellent in our solar fields, 
hydroelectric facilities, and wind farms 
in Peru, Austria and the Caribbean. 
The exception came in our Brazil wind 
farms, where early post-construction 
teething challenges crystallized into 
something that became more systemic 
later in the year. We react strongly to 
failure and our approach to our Brazil 
wind farms has been no exception. 
We’ve made significant organizational 
and people changes in the country 
Companies only IPO once and 
that’s probably a good thing. 
The effort required to prepare 
a company to enter successfully 
the public markets requires 
an intensity and focus that is 
singularly disruptive of normal 
corporate life, yet requires that 
core business objectives be met 
as promised. This comes despite 
the distraction and knowledge 
that the outcome of the IPO will 
overwhelm normal measures of 
annual successes and failures. 
 CEO ’ s 
review
Performance Review
As such, it is very pleasing, and 
somewhat relieving, for me to report 
that 2017 saw both a successful listing 
on the premium segment of the 
London Stock Exchange as well as 
a strong year of performance, both 
operationally and financially, for 
ContourGlobal. Moreover, 2017 was 
an extraordinary year for our most 
important operating objective, our 
health and safety performance. We 
posted a record year with our key 
lagging indicator, our Lost Time 
Incident Rate
1
, ending the year at 
0.03 despite over nearly six million 
hours worked in 19 countries. These 
results were even more remarkable 
given that we acquired eight new 
businesses last year in Brazil and 
Italy, each with dramatically different 
expectations about safe operations 
and, as such, requiring intensive 
restructuring to embrace the 
ContourGlobal way of health and safety.
Despite this record setting achievement, 
we failed to achieve “Target Zero,” our 
health and safety goal adopted at the 
end of December 2016
2
. We missed 
our target but came ever so close.

10 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 11 Outlook
It is early days. Our year-end came just 
six weeks after our IPO and as such 
we cannot say much other than that 
we are where we expected to be at 
IPO and that 2017 continued a string of 
successful years. I am encouraged by 
our ability to post such strong results 
despite the major undertaking for 
the IPO. We are on track with the 
commitments made to the market as 
part of the IPO process – in health 
and safety, power plant operations and 
growth through proprietary greenfield 
development and acquisitions. In the 
new year, our announcement of the 
acquisition of a large portfolio of 
Concentrating Solar Power assets in 
Spain reinforces our expectation that 
we are ahead of our target to double 
EBITDA in five years with no new share 
issuances and our pipeline of greenfield 
and acquisition opportunities supports 
this expectation. We move into our first 
full year of operating as a public 
company with confidence about our 
ability to deliver promised results.

47 have been approved by the Board 
of Directors and signed on its behalf

Joseph C. Brandt
Chief Executive Officer
4th April 2018
and inside the renewable division, 
and are starting to see positive results 
from these measures in early 2018.
Capacity Factors were high in our 
solar fleet, which enjoyed much 
higher irradiation levels than normal 
and overproduced by 11%, while 
capacity factors in our hydroelectric 
facilities were below plan and wind 
performance was close to plan in 
Peru, slightly above plan in Austria 
and below plan in Brazil. 
In 2017, our financial results were better 
than target and displayed the resilience 
of an operations centric business 
model that diversifies risk across 
multiple geographies and technologies. 
By design, ContourGlobal’s financial 
results do not depend upon any one 
geography, technology or weather 
resource. We believe that this 
resilience creates a higher quality risk 
adjusted cash flow for shareholders. 
These diversification benefits were 
on display in 2017 as we were able to 
outperform our adjusted EBITDA target. 
Financial results were strong in all 
areas: revenue topped $1bn for the first 
time ever, an increase of 13% year-on-
year. Adjusted EBITDA and Funds from 
Operations (“FFO”) were $513m and 
$256m, an increase of 17% and 23% 
respectively. As targeted, liquidity and 
year-end net leverage ratio (4.1x) were 
within targeted levels.
Market Outlook and Growth
Our business is international with a 
concentration in three primary regions: 
Europe, Latin America and, to a 
lesser extent, Sub-Saharan Africa. 
We operate in the market for 
electricity generation infrastructure 
and participate in that market through 
our own development (“greenfield” 
development which involves creating 
an asset by taking it through the 
permitting, financing and construction 
processes) as well as the acquisition 
of existing power plants. We operate, 
develop and acquire power plants 
using conventional fuel-based 
technologies as well as those using 
renewable technologies (currently 
wind, solar and hydro). Within both 
categories, we focus on two broad 
categories of customers: national 
grids and the utilities that supply 
these grids, and commercial and 
industrial customers with substantial 
energy needs who prefer to procure 
their electricity supply directly from 
on-site facilities. 
Today’s electricity space is dynamic, 
with new technological and 
commercial approaches creating 
opportunities and challenges in both 
developed and developing markets. 
Within established markets such as 
Western Europe, incumbents have 
embarked upon broad reviews of 
strategy leading to a redefinition 
of their core businesses and 
accompanying divestitures of 
power assets, many of which are 
in markets that we know and like. 
Within developing markets, energy 
demand growth continues to outstrip 
supply and in certain world regions 
such as Sub-Saharan Africa energy 
supply remains woefully inadequate, 
leaving most of the population 
without electricity and its indirect 
benefits (such as clean water and 
stable infrastructure).
Intriguingly, one of our early 
development initiatives has become 
trendy. “Corporate PPAs” have been 
a recent focus of a renewable industry 
in search of new creditworthy 
counterparties to enter into long-term 
offtake contracts to facilitate the 
development of new projects. 
These agreements are generally 
financially settled long-term 
arrangements in which a corporate 
buyer pays a renewable generator 
for electricity delivered to the grid. 
Many corporations are increasingly 
procuring electricity with such 
structures and have grown 
significantly in the past three years. 
A decade ago, our ContourGlobal 
Solutions business was an early 
pioneer of the corporate PPA market. 
Working with Coca-Cola HBC 
(“CCHBC”), we first used thermal 
fuels and then renewable generation 
technologies. We developed highly 
efficient and innovative energy 
production facilities within Coca-Cola 
HBC’s bottling facilities in Europe and 
Africa that supply all of CCHBC’s 
energy needs for electricity, hot water, 
chilled water and, through innovative 
CO 2 capture technology incorporated 
into these power stations, carbonation. 
Later we worked with CCHBC to install 
substantial solar “fields” in Italy on 
the large rooftops housing their 
production and storage facilities, 
installing approximately 4.5 MW in 
five locations, using what today 
would be known as a “Corporate PPA”.
Last year we extended our Solutions 
business into Latin America where we 
acquired four cogeneration facilities in 
Brazil which directly supply commercial 
customers. Through this acquisition, we 
are extending this “what is old is new 
again” business from Europe and Africa 
to Latin America.
As we explore new growth, we 
remain impressed with the number 
of opportunities we see to make 
accretive acquisitions in Europe and 
Latin America, while at the same time 
remaining cautious about the prospects 
to build new generation in these same 
markets. Historically low and extended 
interest rates has led to capital 
deployment decisions in our industry 
that have driven returns on new build 
below that of acquired assets, resulting 
in an historic anomaly in the power 
sector. One should get paid more to 
take the development, permitting and 
construction risk to build a new asset 
than to acquire an already functioning 
business. Such anomalous pricing 
between new build and acquisition, 
renewables and thermal, is not justified 
by technology or cost improvements 
but rather reflects other more strategic 
imperatives. We continue to believe 
that this dynamic creates its own set 
of opportunities. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa, where we 
have long been active and successful, 
we are cautious outside of the 
industrial space. Despite much of the 
continent making impressive strides 
in governance and reform, the post 
financial crisis collapse in commodity 
prices has pressured the continent 
despite helpful interventions by the 
international development community. 
Although headline investment in new 
electricity capacity seems promising, 
projects across the continent struggle 
to make their way from signing to 
closing to full operations and, once 
operational, pressure on public 
finances challenges fragile states to 
meet their contractual commitments. 
With such a market backdrop we are 
very selective about new investment 
in this region.
Four important projects managed to 
reach critical milestones in the past 
several months. In Austria, the 
repowering of our wind farms began 
with two projects receiving feed-in-
tariff approval enabling them to begin 
repowering – a process that involves 
replacing older wind towers and 
turbines with newer technology. 
These two projects offer a startling 
illustration of the dramatic 
improvements that have been 
achieved in wind turbine technology 
in the thirteen years that have passed 
since these wind farms first entered 
operations. Using the same physical 
footprint as before, new tower and 
turbine technology will enable us to 
capture more wind and thereby 
produce 80% more energy annually 
than what was achievable just over a 
decade ago. We increasingly see the 
opportunities of repowering as a way 
to add value to our own and others’ 
existing assets. 
Elsewhere, across Austria’s southern 
border in Italy, we made good progress 
continuing to consolidate operating 
solar fields in the market, adding 43 MW 
through two acquisitions. We’ve been 
active in Italy for over eight years, 
seven of them in the solar sector and 
have a strong operating team which 
has improved availability, performance 
factor and fixed costs in every single 
acquisition to date. 
Finally, after many years of effort and 
close cooperation with the Government 
of Kosovo and international 
stakeholders, we achieved the critical 
milestone of “commercial close” for the 
Kosovo E Re power plant, a critically 
needed infrastructure project for a 
country that suffers with Europe’s worst 
pollution from two old lignite fueled 
power generation facilities. We will 
replace these facilities with efficient 
facilities, which will provide the 
necessary capacity to enable the 
Kosovarian energy market to develop 
and thereby catalyze economic growth 
in this poor, landlocked country. We do 
not take lightly our decision to sponsor 
a coal fired power plant. It is not our 
preferred fuel. But the needs and 
resources of Kosovo argue 
overwhelmingly in favor of developing 
this plant with this fuel now. Kosovo is 
Europe’s poorest country and its 
current installed electricity generation 
base is Europe’s largest single source 
of pollution including dust, other 
particulate matter, NO X, SO X and CO 2.
ContourGlobal has always viewed 
itself as an investor first – allocating 
capital to attractive opportunities in 
the contracted wholesale power 
generation space. As such, our 
strategy has been highly opportunistic, 
preferring to maximize risk-adjusted 
returns rather than invest in assets or 
development projects that meet some 
pre-defined, qualitative or strategic 
criteria. This has served us well over 
the years and we continue to see 
significant opportunities that will 
enable us to benefit from this 
approach. As an established, and now 
public, operator that has managed 
investor capital in the power business 
for over a decade, we have also 
received interest from institutional 
investors to acquire stakes in our 
existing assets. As we continue to 
grow our business, we see increasing 
opportunities to be the asset manager 
of choice in the global power sector.

Power generation
The electricity value chain has 
four main segments: generation, 
transmission, distribution and retail.
We focus on the wholesale power 
generation segment, both centralized 
and distributed.
We generate power using both thermal and 
renewable technologies.
Thermal and Renewable
On thermal technologies our portfolio includes 
natural gas, liquid fuel and coal. On renewable 
technologies it includes wind, hydro, solar 
photovoltaic and methane.
Contracted
Power generation can be defined as either 
merchant or contracted. Contracted plants 
have minimal exposure to market prices for 
the duration of the underlying contract because 
the price is negotiated and fixed upfront. This is 
done either through long-term power purchase 
agreements (PPAs), which typically have higher 
margins than market platforms, or prices are set 
under a regulatory regime. PPAs also typically 
de-risk the generator from demand volume 
volatility and other changes in market 
conditions such as inflation and changes 
in laws and regulations. Merchant plants 
sell electricity into market platforms at the 
prevailing energy price and are therefore 
subject to price volatility.
We concentrate on contracted 
power generation.
The demand for energy continues to grow 
and the underlying trends characterizing this 
growth fit well with our strategy of focusing 
on long-term contracted power generation 
in key markets around the world.

According to the International Energy 
Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 
2017, global electricity demand will 
increase by approximately 45% 
between 2015 and 2040, from 
23.4 TWh to 34.0 TWh, at an 
annual growth rate of 1.5%.
1
The majority of this rise in demand will 
occur in developing markets, especially 
in Asia, Latin America and parts of Africa 
that are experiencing urbanization, 
increasing electrification rates and 
economic and population growth.
Lower growth in electricity demand is 
expected for developed markets such 
as Europe and the United States, due 
to lower economic growth, energy 
efficiency policies and stabilized 
energy consumption patterns.
We expect to benefit from changes 
in global demand, particularly the 
accelerated growth in developing 
markets, as our footprint includes 
developing markets in Latin America 
and Africa. 
We also have the necessary in-house 
operational experience and the know-
how to capitalize on the wide range of 
opportunities in different technologies.
By 2040, global installed capacity is 
expected to increase from 6,383 GW 
to approximately 8,819 GW, with coal 
dropping to approximately 25% of 
the capacity mix as a result of 
decarbonization policies and the 
further increase in renewable 
installations. Renewables are 
expected to account for 42% of 
the global capacity. Natural gas is 
expected to account for 24%, nuclear 
for 6% and liquid fuels for 3%.

Key power market trends
We see certain trends running through the power market that favor ContourGlobal’s disciplined and opportunistic 
growth strategy:
In emerging markets, rapid 
electrification and expanding 
demand result in significant need 
for investment across all types of 
generation, providing interesting 
opportunities for power 
generation players.
Especially in Africa and 
Eastern Europe, there are few 
international operators actively 
pursuing opportunities and we 
expect to grow in these regions 
given our strong operational 
presence, track record and 
ability to creatively structure 
our projects both financially 
and contractually.
In these markets we will continue 
using Political Risk Insurance 
(PRI) to protect our investment.
The demand for new power and the transformation 
of governance in developing markets
Source: EIA
The generation sector 
in some jurisdictions 
can be micro-cyclical 
driven by economic 
fluctuations, availability 
of domestic capital 
and financing/capital 
markets volatility. The 
fluctuations can create 
a downward or upward 
pressure on returns. 
Remaining flexible 
around geographies, 
associated presence 
in and knowledge of 
high growth markets, 
and creativity on 
structuring projects 
create above market 
returns when 
cyclicality pressures 
returns upwards.
The value of generation assets varies 
over time depending on numerous factors 
including size, geography, technology and 
the differing strategies of potential investors. 
The opportunity set constantly evolves and 
the areas where the best risk-adjusted returns 
appear in the future are likely to be different 
from where they are today.
This gives advantage to investors, such as 
ContourGlobal, with the flexibility to invest 
opportunistically across markets and 
technologies. Our disciplined investment 
framework allows for internal competition 
for capital and the ability to deliver high 
value growth by remaining selective, 
in a very active M&A environment.
Markets periodically 
suffer micro-cyclicality
The changing relative value of 
different generation assets

Hydro and cogeneration 
acquisition in Brazil
ADJ. EBITDA: $42M
1
In March 2017 we closed the acquisition of 
206 MW operational portfolio – composed 
of 130 MW of hydro assets and 76 MW of 
cogeneration assets.
The cogeneration contracts are capacity-based, 
mostly denominated in US dollars and have a 
largely US dollar-denominated return. They are 
the type of contracts with commercial and 
industrial customers that our Solutions business 
pursue. The hydro PPAs are inside a regulated 
Brazilian hydrology protection scheme, which 
reduces individual hydro plant performance risk.
We will benefit from our experience in operating 
hydro and cogeneration plants and from our 
Brazilian platform to improve the operational 
performance of the assets and realize 
various synergies.
Kosovo
ADJ EBITDA: €250M  
(ON THE FIRST FULL YEAR  
OF OPERATIONS)
In December 2017, we have signed 
the commercial contracts with the 
Kosovo Government to build a new 
single unit lignite-fired power plant 
with a gross capacity of 500 MW, 
located in Obiliq, Kosovo. Total costs 
for the Kosovo Project are estimated 
to reach approximately €1.3bn. The 
power plant is expected to start 
operations in 2023 and will have 
a life expectancy of four decades. 
The activities in 2018 will be focused 
on the financing arrangements of 
the project with the aim to start 
construction activities in 2019.

We have been following a roll-up strategy to 
acquire mid-sized solar photovoltaic portfolios 
in Italy, a market that remains fragmented with 
many opportunities. Our operational strategy is 
to insource operation and maintenance during 
integration, reducing costs and improving the 
assets’ operational performance. 
In 2017 we closed a total of 19 MW and signed 
an additional 23 MW. The assets are mainly 
composed of solar photovoltaic plants located in 
Italy with geographical proximity to our existing 
solar photovoltaic assets. They also include one 
solar photovoltaic plant in Romania (7 MW) and 
two biogas plants in Italy (2 MW).

Greenfield development
Opportunistic development taking advantage of cyclical under 
supply of capital combined with development expertize to 
create opportunities for higher return.
2
Greenfield acquisitions
Purchasing assets without existing contracts, subject to the 
ability to put contracts in place. Involves similar, customized 
contractual risk profiles to our development assets but have 
the benefit of an operating history.
3
Strategic acquisitions
Purchasing assets with existing contracts where we have both:
(i)  a clear competitive advantage due to asset size, technology, 
asset diversity or complexity of process or market; and
(ii) an ability to improve operations.
4
Development in partnership projects
Developing projects with customized contracts in partnership 
with governments, utilities and corporations. These are in 
regions where there is need for reliable power infrastructure 
but insufficient capital and expertize.
5
Platform expansions
Developing expansions of existing projects leverages existing 
relationships with governments, offtakers, lenders and suppliers, 
replicating the same technology and structure. Platform 
expansions are typically low risk and high return, given the 
expertize already acquired and the synergies and cost 
reductions achieved by expanding the platform.
18 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 19 KPIs
We measure our progress against seven financial 
and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs).
Income from Operations ($m)
Adjusted EBITDA ($m)
Funds from Operations ($m)
Equivalent Forced  
Outage Rate (%)
Net Leverage ratio
1
 (×)
 
Income From Operations (IFO) is 
derived from the IFRS consolidated 
statement of income and corresponds 
to the sum of the following line items: 
Revenue, Cost of sales, Selling, 
general and administrative expenses, 
Other operating income – net and 
acquisition related items. This is a 
measure of profitability that includes 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
as well as development costs.
In 2017, IFO grew significantly from 
$221.8m in 2016 to $269.0m (+21%), 
reflecting the successful integration of 
new assets (acquired or which entered 
into operations) and close fixed costs 
monitoring during the period.
The Equivalent Forced Outage Rate 
(EFOR) is the ratio between hours of 
unit failure given as a percentage of 
the total hours in a set period.
Like the AF, the EFOR is widely used 
in the industry to measure technical 
performance.
Consistent strong downwards trend 
of forced outages rate in the last three 
years, reflecting improving operational 
performance results.
Adjusted EBITDA is the combined 
profit from continuing operations for 
all controlled assets before income 
taxes, net finance costs, depreciation 
and amortization, acquisition-related 
expenses and specific items adjusted 
for their size, nature or incidence, 
less ContourGlobal’s share of the 
profit from unconsolidated entities 
accounted for the equity method, 
plus the Company’s pro-rata portion 
of Adjusted EBITDA for such entities.
This is the key measure of the 
Company’s profitability.
In 2017, we achieved a significant 
improvement in Adjusted EBITDA. 
It rose by 17% from $440m in 2016 to 
$513m in 2017 thanks to operational 
and growth performances.
Funds From Operations is the 
cash flow from operating activities, 
excluding changes in working capital, 
less interest paid, maintenance 
capital expenditure and distribution 
to minorities.
This is the key measure of the 
Company’s strength of cash flow.
Strong operational performance and 
highly contracted cash flows allowed 
us to maintain and even improve the 
Group’s cash conversion.
The Company leverage ratio is 
measured as total net indebtedness 
(reported as the difference between 
Borrowings and Cash and Cash 
Equivalent under the IFRS statement of 
financial position) to Adjusted EBITDA.
This is the key credit measure of 
the Company.
The Company aims to maintain its 
leverage ratio on the long-term in 
a range from 4.0x to 4.5x. The 2017 
leverage ratio reached 4.1x 
compared to 4.8x in 2016.

are free of injuries. To this end we 
focus on risk reduction and awareness. 
In 2017, we achieved our best-ever 
results, although we ultimately missed 
our Target Zero. The single LTI (Lost 
Time Incident) that occurred in August, 
a vehicle incident in Armenia, was 
entirely preventable. Through our 
system of continuous improvement, 
we have implemented changes in our 
corporate guidance to increase 
control of hazardous activities. The 
aftermath of the incident initiated a 
period of deep reflection on our 
guidance and our training, with a 
renewed commitment to making the 
changes necessary to drive our 
culture toward zero injuries.
Integrating acquisitions 
In 2017, we also focused on integrating 
our new acquisitions in Brazil and Italy 
into our way of ensuring Health and 
Safety excellence. It can be 
challenging to bring new operating 
sites into our portfolio, when their 
existing Health and Safety cultures 
and standards of performance 
differ from ours. We tackle this by 
developing a risk matrix and tailoring 
our transition program to address any 
deficiencies identified in the existing 
structure. We implement our Power for 
HSE Excellence program to ensure 
compliance to the most rigorous 
Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) 
standards and to integrate the new 
personnel into our culture and 
working practices.

inspections conducted in our operating sites 
by operations and maintenance personnel
2017 Health and Safety Highlights
 ― All our operating sites achieved 
their targets for leading indicators 
– see KPIs below
 ― We achieved our lowest ever 
LTI (Lost Time Incident) rate, 
a 50% reduction from 2016
 ― TRIR (Total Recordable Incident 
Rate) well below the target 
representing the historical 
low incidence achieved for 
the Company
 ― We carried out a total of 11 Internal 
Health & Safety Audits in 2017
 ― We undertook three 
Safety Interventions, 
with positive results
 ― All sites implemented the 
Power for HSE Excellence 
program. As a result, more 
robust procedures and policies 
are in place consistently across  
the Company
 ― We rolled out mobile versions 
of our Incident and Hazard 
reporting process, for iOS 
and Android devices
Reducing risk and mitigating hazards 
Our risk reduction process centers on 
providing a hazard-free workplace. 
To this end we combine a series of 
interlinked KPIs to identify and remove 
hazards from the work environment in 
a timely manner, reducing workers’ 
exposure to hazardous conditions.  
We accomplish this by assigning target 
values to our leading indicators. 
Training 
Our Training Rate is set to ensure 
our employees are aware of the 
hazards they may face. By providing 
a minimum standard of training hours, 
set to a percentage of the total hours 
worked, we provide a consistent 
knowledge base for our employees. 
Safety inspections 
Training enables employees to  
produce more effective Safety 
Inspections, which is the second pillar  
of our hazard reduction mechanism.  
By setting a target number of total 
Level 2 inspections each site must 
perform, we ensure sufficient volume 
of safety inspections is performed. 
Identifying hazards 
The Hazard Identification Rate 
tracks how many safety hazards are 
recorded into our Safety Management 
Database, Intelex.
Our goal is to achieve a 30% ratio 
between the number of hazards 
recorded and the total number of 
inspections for all sites. This provides 
each site with a high quality list of 
safety hazards that may exist in the 
work environment.
Corrective and preventive actions 
Our final leading indicator, CAPA 
(Corrective And Preventive Actions) 
closure ratio, ensures that each site 
is committed to the process of not 
only recognizing hazards but also 
correcting them to remove the risk. 
In 2017, over 9,000 hazards were 
identified by our operating sites, 
and closed at a rate of 94% within 
one month of being recorded.
Implementing the same high 
standards around the world 
Mitigating physical hazards is not 
the only way we reduce risk. We 
implement a comprehensive and 
robust system of policies and 
procedures at each operating site to 
ensure work takes place in the safest 
possible environment. This includes 
stringent compliance with work 
permit procedures. These detailed 
procedures ensure that workers 
thoroughly examine the work site 
for threats that might impact the safe 
accomplishment of tasks. Each site 
has specific procedures in place, in 
the local language, to ensure that 
tasks are carried out only after the 
proper risk assessment has been 
conducted; the correct Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE) is used; 
employees are properly trained for the 
task; and hazardous energy sources 
and chemicals are prevented from 
causing harm. Our staff are permitted 
to perform their tasks only after 
carefully considering all the identified 
hazards and the risk mitigation 
measures have been implemented.

Our internal audit team scores each 
plant based on a protocol developed 
from our OHS standards. The minimum 
passing score is 75% and findings are 
categorized according to severity. All 
but one of our sites scored acceptably 
in 2017, with corrections defined for 
each plant. Our plant in Togo did not 
achieve a passing score and will be 
submitted for re-audit in 2018. As can be 
seen from the chart below, the finding 
severity is skewed slightly towards the 
lower end of the severity scale, with few 
Critical issues identified. This reflects the 
generally high state of preparedness 
at the plants and indicates a realistic 
picture of the safe conditions and 
procedural compliance.

Carrying out Health and Safety 
audits at our sites 
In 2016, an internal team of cross-
functional professionals began to 
conduct Health and Safety audits at 
our operating sites. We continued this 
process in 2017 by conducting 11 site 
audits. These audits assessed how 
well the sites comply with our OHS 
standards. The comprehensive 
assessment consists of both a detailed 
procedural review and a hazard 
analysis. The final result is tabulated 
and scored, so we can compare our 
sites and track the results.
Safety inspections by senior leaders 
In addition to the internal Health and 
Safety audits, we are also committed 
to senior leader engagement through 
the Level 1 Safety Inspection
1
 program. 
This is designed to ensure that our 
leadership team not only visits our 
operating plants but also engages in 
site inspections to record observations. 
In 2017, a total of 844 Level 1 safety 
inspections were conducted.

Recognizing excellence
We are committed to recognizing the achievements of our 
individual operating sites. In 2011, we introduced our annual 
Health & Safety awards, using the Olympic theme of award, 
Gold, Silver and Bronze. In 2015, we updated our award 
achievement guidelines, and renamed them to Everest, 
Denali, and Mont Blanc. In 2017, a record number of our 
sites achieved Health & Safety awards. This impressive 
result underlines our promise to all our employees and to 
their families that we cherish their well-being. Here are the 
sites that performed outstandingly in 2017:
EVEREST DENALI MONT BLANC BEST TURNAROUND
 ― Knockmore Hill  
(2nd year)
 ― Austria Wind
 ― Nogara & Oricola
 ― Radzymin
 ― Solar Italy

 ― Cupisnique
 ― Kramatorsk
 ― Talara
 ― Arrubal
 ― Asa Branca
 ― Bonaire
 ― Cap des Biches
 ― Benin
 ― Ikeja
 ― Ploiesti
 ― Saint Martin
 ― Vorotan
The safety awards are progressive, with each site able 
to earn the next higher award only if they achieve higher 
standards each year. The award for the first year of injury-
free performance, combined with an achievement in leading 
indicators, is the Mont Blanc.
The second consecutive year award is the Denali, and the 
highest award we have is the Everest, with achievements 
sustained at a higher level and for three years of injury-free 
performance. Once a site has achieved the Everest they can 
earn it in successive years, but only if the highest standards 
are achieved.
CASE STUDY
Transforming Health and Safety 
in Cap des Biches, Senegal
One year after starting operation,  
the Cap des Biches plant transformed  
its Health and Safety performance for 
the better.
In October 2016, our Cap des Biches 
plant was audited for Health and Safety 
(H&S) to benchmark its level against 
ContourGlobal standards at the start of its 
operation. The audit highlighted several 
critical items that needed to be corrected 
to bring the plant in line with the 
ContourGlobal guidelines and procedures 
and create the physical conditions to 
prevent hazards and risks. An action plan 
was developed to cover all the gaps and 
several checks were performed, including 
visits by senior management.
The management reinforced the 
importance of H&S being our first 
priority based on the Company culture, 
values and principles. 
As a result of the leadership and 
campaign, the plant had a complete 
turnaround in its H&S performance – 
successfully passing a new audit in 
July 2017 with a score of 85%.

26 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 27 In 2017, after achieving a significant 
improvement on its 2016 Health and 
Safety performance, our Vorotan 
plant won our “Best Turnaround 
Performance” award.
In 2015, we purchased the Vorotan 
hydro cascade. This 404 MW run 
off river Hydro cascade sits on the 
Vorotan River in eastern Armenia 
and has been operating continuously 
for more than 40 years. From mid 
2018 to the end of 2020, we will be 
carrying out an electromechanical 
refurbishment program in the three 
power plants with seven units for 
turbines, generators, auxiliary systems, 
transformers, protection & control 
systems, switchgear equipment and 
auxiliary electrical systems. The works 
will be performed in parallel with 
the normal operation. In 2016, we 
performed an internal H&S audit led 
by our internal team supplemented 
by a third-party audit firm to evaluate 
the plant preparedness for the 
refurbishment works ahead of us. 
The results were critical. Not only did 
we find a large number of hazardous 
conditions and behavioral issues, the 
compliance score was 58% – far 
below our internal target of 75%.
A failure of this magnitude was not 
simply due to missing procedures 
and a few poor conditions. It reflected 
a lack of active management and 
signaled a substandard Health and 
Safety culture, which was largely 
unchanged from when we acquired 
the plant. This required our 
management team to transparently 
engage, face the failures and develop 
a corrective plan that ensured future 
failures would never reoccur. The plan 
involved taking an approach centered 
on the ContourGlobal values and 
principles, the 3Cs (Communication, 
Collaboration and Coordination) and 
2Ts (Timely and Transparently), and 
relating them to every aspect of 
running the business. Hard decisions 
were made to replace key 
management staff, with the Plant 
Manager replaced by promotion from 
within, and the H&S Manager hired 
from within the country. About 15 key 
people from the Hydro cascade team 
were identified to become the 
leadership team of an organizational 
and behavioral change program. 
Individual development plans and 
language skill training were set up and 
a chain of promotions into new roles 
and responsibilities was started.
The Power for HSE excellence program 
was implemented in parallel, as well as 
the Basic Health and Safety strategy 
for success used at ContourGlobal. 
This required an intensive effort 
locally as well as frequent site visits 
and support from senior leaders.
In July 2017, the entire Vorotan complex 
was re-audited for Health and Safety, 
with outstanding results. The Tatev plant 
achieved a score of 85%, with Shamb 
and Spandaryan also achieving passing 
scores of 80%. This was a remarkable 
turnaround within half a year in terms of 
compliance to the stringent standards 
we set, and a testament to the resilience 
of the people involved. But there were 
even bigger changes noted in the 
attitudes and development of a 
compliance culture within the 
organization. And the lack of notable 
hazardous conditions demonstrated the 
behavioral changes, hard work and 
dedication of every member of the team.
We are proud of the work and 
impressive degree of improvement 
this team accomplished. To recognize 
this, the team at Vorotan was awarded 
the 2017 “Best Turnaround Performance”, 
with a special plaque developed to honor 
the commitment to the ContourGlobal 
values and principles of operation.

CASE STUDY
Adding to our 
hydro portfolio
In 2017 we added another seven 
hydro power plants with 130 MW 
of installed capacity to our hydro 
portfolio in Brazil. We have 
successfully integrated them into our 
operating portfolio, obtaining targeted 
operational synergies and facilitating 
internal talent development and 
promotions to operate the portfolio.
Hydro portfolio II
In March 2017 we acquired our  
Brazil Hydro Portfolio II, consisting of  
130 MW of small hydropower plants.
As a high growth business we’re committed to financial 
and operational excellence and continuous improvement. 
In 2017, we gained extremely valuable experience from 
overcoming challenges at some of our thermal and 
renewables power plants and applied this experience 
to our Company globally to enhance performance. 
Focusing on operations
The acquisition was part of our growth 
strategy in Brazil and increased our 
hydro presence in the country to 167 MW.
Our main focus pre-acquisition was  
to make sure that the teams in the 
plants received proper communication 
about ContourGlobal and to reassure 
them about their importance in our 
operating strategy for the country.
This led the way for the early 
implementation of ContourGlobal 
procedures and policies. This started 
with Health and Safety (H&S),  
compliance and internal control, but 
also focused on reporting practices, 
continuous improvement techniques  
and transferring the monitoring and 
control of the newly acquired hydro 
plants to our centralized control room. 
In parallel to implementing our 
operations and maintenance 
(O&M) practices, we applied our 
improvement plan, which focused on 
managing water through automation. 
This led to a more efficient use of 
water, as well as minimizing hydraulic 
losses and forced outages, thus 
increasing performance.
Our availability metrics, for example, 
increased from 91% in 2016 to 98% in 
2017, while the H&S target of Zero LTIs 
was successfully attained by all plants 
in the portfolio. 
Undertaking a greenfield project for a 500MW lignite power plant in Kosovo
ContourGlobal signed commercial 
agreements with the Government 
of Kosovo to build a 500 MW lignite 
power plant in the country on 
20th December 2017.
This important milestone had his origin 
in the early 2000s when early plans 
were developed to update the Kosovo 
power system. Around 2010 these plans 
became more concrete regarding the 
development of a new coal fired power, 
which is called Kosovo e Re Power 
Plant. There were many reasons that 
the development took such a long 
time. In between there was the global 
financial crisis and a lot of power 
companies, which attended the former 
bidding processes, changed their 
strategy. After multiple unsuccessful 
tender processes ContourGlobal was 
selected as the preferred bidder in 
December 2015 and signed a MoU 
with the government of Kosovo.
The new coal fired 500 MW power 
plant will be a light tower of Kosovo’s 
developing economy and will replace 
the existing inefficient and polluting 
Kosovo A Plant. Kosovo A will be shut 
down when Kosova e Re goes online. 
The new plant will provide vital 
economic impulses and will bring 
enough affordable electricity to 
power 1.5 million Kosovar homes and 
businesses. The enormous investment 
of about €1.3bn will increase the GDP 
of the country, spurring growth in 
the region. 
Although Kosovo’s coal reserves 
are considered as one of the richest 
in Europe, the country still suffers 
from lack of sustainable and stable 
energy supply. This lack of affordable 
and reliable energy is a notable 
disadvantage for the overall 
economic development.
The new power plant will reduce over 
all CO 2 emissions by about 37% per 
generated MWh – All other emissions 
are also drastically reduced, according 
to the latest EU Directive for Pollution 
Prevention and Control. This also 
means that the net plant efficiency 
level of min. 41% will be achieved. 
An important benefit and positive effect 
represents the decrease of environmental 
damage to the country and its people. 
The health of the Kosovar population 
and especially a healthy future for the 
children is one of the greatest goals 
of any modern civilization.
The negotiation teams on the side of 
the GoK and on CG side were very 
motivated to realize this important 
project. The objective was to negotiate 
and sign important contracts, like the 
power purchase agreement, the lignite 
supply agreement or the site transfer 
agreement and others by end of 2017. 
The GoK is also supported by the 
World Bank to meet their obligations 
under the power purchase agreement.
During our negotiation round in 
May 2017 we became aware that the 
Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo 
has voted on no-confidence vote to the 
current Government. At that time the 
official negotiation had been stopped 
until a new government was in place.
When the new government was in 
place we received very positive news 
that the new government was also in 
favor of the new power project.
On 13th December a high level 
delegation of CG including the CEO of 
CG were invited to meet the government 
in Kosovo. During the meeting it 
became obvious that only minor 
parts of the contracts were still under 
negotiation and could be solved fast. 
Also the GoK wanted to close the 
negotiations very fast. During a 
high level meeting with the President 
of Kosovo, the Prime Minister and 
CEO of CG it was decided to sign 
the contracts one week later on 
20th December during an official 
signing ceremony in Pristina.

We have been implementing our solar 
photovoltaic growth strategy since 2014 
– acquiring and integrating assets to 
decrease costs and increase availability.
We began implementing our solar 
photovoltaic growth strategy (Solar 
Rollup) in 2014 after the first boom in the 
solar photovoltaics (PV) plants built in 
Italy. At that time, we already had a 
13 MW presence in the country with our 
own O&M team in place. Since then, 
we have built a highly scalable Solar 
photovoltaic O&M platform, with an agile 
M&A process, allowing us to add on 
new mid-sized portfolios, where 
operational synergies can be gained. We 
have grown Solar photovoltaic in Europe 
to 85 MW, applying a strategy anchored 
in operational excellence, fully insourcing 
the O&M while increasing availability 
and, in turn, power generation.
CASE STUDY
Continuing to grow our European solar photovoltaic platform
After every acquisition we perform our 
proven integration plan, focusing on 
implementing our culture and values; 
applying our processes, with a 
special focus on Health & Safety and 
monitoring systems, and vigorously 
implementing the business case 
created during the M&A phase. As a 
result, we considerably decrease 
fixed costs while increasing the 
plants’ availability.
Acquiring high quality, long-term 
contracted solar photovoltaic 
assets in 2017
In late 2017, we acquired a 19 MW 
solar photovoltaic portfolio in Italy, 
increasing the capacity of our solar 
photovoltaic portfolio by 30%. Our 
total European solar photovoltaic 
portfolio is now 85 MW. The 
integration process and business plan 
implementation has been successfully 
completed, with the insourcing of all 
O&M activities, implementation of our 
performance monitoring system and 
refinancing of the portfolio.
The new plants are located 
close to our existing Italian solar 
photovoltaic portfolio. There is a 
significant opportunity to create 
value by enhancing operational 
performance, achieving fixed 
cost savings and optimizing 
the capital structure.
Continuously striving  
to improve
In line with our operational philosophy 
and long-term strategy, we continuously 
strive to beat our own historical technical 
performance results and to maintain 
outstanding levels of performance 
that matches or beats the top decile 
of peers on the market. Operating to 
our corporate values and principles, we 
make every possible effort to learn from 
our successes and failures, discussing 
them in a timely and transparent way 
at all levels within the Company 
and producing valuable tools for 
improvement, notably Lessons Leaned 
and 5Whys documents. As a result, we 
ensure we can replicate our successes 
with significantly better effect in the 
future and also make sure our failures 
never recur. 
Tackling and learning from 
technical challenges
The operational failures on our wind 
farms in Brazil had an impact on the 
average technical availability of our 
portfolio towards the second half of 
the year. Our operational team reacted 
quickly to the technical challenges – 
immediately intervening to troubleshoot, 
rectify failed areas and resolve issues. 
At the same time the team carried out 
a thorough assessment of the problem, 
made several root-cause analyzes and 
investigations at all levels and produced 
a number of Lessons Learned and 5Whys 
analyzes, which were shared and 
broadly discussed inside the Company.
Maintaining consistent  
thermal availability
The technical availability of our 
thermal cluster was good and in line 
with the budgeted targets for the year. 
Compared to previous periods, the 
thermal fleet maintained consistent 
availability levels, in line with the long- 
term Global Operations and Maintenance 
(O&M) Strategy. The thermal fleet 
availability factor in 2017 was lower 
than in 2014-2016 primarily due to a 
higher amount of anticipated planned 
maintenance works performed in the 
year, as required by the planned 
maintenance cycle program. During 
the year maintenance campaigns were 
carried out at the Arrubal, Maritsa, 
KivuWatt and Togo power plants with a 
notable share of works performed by 
internal resources. 
In 2017 we faced a technical issue with 
a connecting rod failure at Unit 4 of 
the EA-Guadeloupe power plant. With 
the preliminary root-cause being a 
manufacturing defect, as a preventive 
measure, a replacement of connection 
rods was performed on other engines 
to prevent future possible failures. 
Together with MAN we developed a 
repair strategy, which minimized our 
losses to an insignificant amount. 
Strong financial performance
In 2017, our consolidated revenue 
exceeded $1bn – for the first time 
in the Company’s history. At $1,023m, 
consolidated revenue was $118m more 
than in 2016. Moreover, in 2017, we 
achieved a significant improvement 
in Adjusted EBITDA – one of our key 
financial profitability metrics. It went 
up from $440m in 2016 to $513m in 
2017. This 17% growth was primarily 
driven by acquisitions in 2017 and a 
full year of operations of the power 
plants commissioned in 2016.
Read more in the Finance Review 
on pages 36 to 39.
In 2017, we successfully integrated a 
portfolio of assets, including a total 
of 130 MW hydro plants and thermal 
cogeneration plants totaling 76 MW, 
following the Brazilian acquisition.
On 28th November 2016, we signed 
the Brazil acquisition from Neoenergia. 
The hand over to a new Chief 
Implementation Officer started on 
11th January 2017 and ended on 17th 
March. Our central control room in Asa 
Branca started operating the newly 
acquired hydro assets as planned on 
30th April. The last steering committee 
meeting for handover to operations 
was held on 3rd May.
Integrating the assets was a big 
challenge, not least because of the 
lack of readiness, collaboration and 
structure on takeover. We quickly rose 
to the challenge and made sure the 
integration was a success. This was 
due to a number of factors, including 
a dedicated project team with a clear 
understanding of roles; a high level 
of communication and transparency; 
and the prioritization of the main 
objectives and risks ensuring the 
right level and timely attention to 
the most important topics.

Our expectations for excellence extend 
beyond our people, physical equipment, 
and operational KPIs.
Minimizing our impact on the environment
We place great emphasis on developing the skills and 
capabilities of our people around the world. We want 
everyone at ContourGlobal to excel and go far, so they 
can realize their own individual goals and also achieve 
more as part of a close‑knit multinational team.
Developing our people
Generating electricity has impacts 
on many environmental aspects: the 
air we breathe, the water we share, 
and the flora and fauna that exist 
on our planet.
We strive for excellent performance 
when it comes to our environmental 
responsibilities, seeking to minimize 
negative environmental impacts and, 
where possible, repair or reverse  
existing degradation.
Our policy on social responsibility and 
environmental sustainability provides 
the framework under which we work 
responsibly, both environmentally and 
socially. Our policy is aligned with the 
International Finance Corporation 
(“IFC”) Performance Standards and 
promotes environmental stewardship, 
including pollution prevention and 
abatement, biodiversity conservation 
and sustainable natural resource 
responsible management. Specifically, 
we focus on managing environmental 
impacts across all phases of business 
operations through proper planning 
and execution.
ContourGlobal’s environmental 
strategy is to minimize environmental 
impacts through planning and 
innovation, and we do this by:
 ― Complying with all environmental 
regulations and global best 
practices
 ― Maintaining or decreasing our 
carbon air and waste footprint
 ― Training and developing our 
workforce to understand 
our environmental and 
social procedures
 ― Launching targeted social 
investments aligned to 
core business
The CO 2 emissions ratio shows 
a continuously improved trend on 
reduction of the GHGs produced by 
the Company (improved CO 2 tonnes 
per Mwh). Despite the thermal fleet 
production being driven by the client’s 
dispatch patterns, we as a Company 
make all efforts to maintain a downward 
trend, in particular, through diversifying 
the portfolio and fuel mix composition.

for its own use.
Learning and improving together 
We’re keen to encourage personal 
development, close collaboration and 
continuous improvement throughout 
our Company. One of the ways we do 
this is by enabling our people to 
participate in intercultural and cross-
country exchanges, so they can 
broaden their experience and share 
best practices with colleagues around 
the world. 
Through our Worker Exchange 
Program (WEP) for example, our 
people undertake limited duration 
assignments at another ContourGlobal 
site. Launched in 2012, the WEP 
enables participants to transfer their 
knowledge and provide expert 
support on a particular activity or a 
project under development. It’s a 
great way to boost learning and 
cross-fertilize ideas for improvement.
The Program participants are required 
to follow and complete a pre-defined 
agenda, which is validated by both 
their direct manager and their tutor 
on the host site, with regular status 
follow-ups ensured by local HR 
representatives. On returning to their 
home country, participants usually 
become the best ambassadors of this 
unique exchange experience, sharing 
their experiences locally with their 
colleagues as well as providing 
constructive feedback to help us 
further improve the Program. 
In 2017, 26 participants engaged in 
assignments in ten different countries. 
With a total duration of 487 working 
days spent outside of their normal 
function and usual location, each 
of the 26 participants dedicated 
on average 19 working days to 
exchange activities.

CASE STUDY
Responding to hurricanes in the Caribbean
When hurricane Irma struck Saint 
Martin we were quick to restore vital 
power to the island and to help 
residents and businesses recover 
from the devastation. 
On 6th September 2017, our Energies 
Saint Martin power plant was shut 
down due to hurricane Irma. The 
hurricane significantly damaged the 
island of Saint Martin including most 
of the electrical transmission lines, 
causing a general blackout. The 
grid was partially restored by 11th 
September. After tests performed on 
all the plant’s engines, engines 2 and 
3 were available from September 11th 
while engine 1 needed air compressor 
maintenance works and was available 
from 15th September. Our team 
concentrated on ensuring that the 
engines could support the energy 
needs of the island as soon as part of 
the grid was back available and 
connected to the plant.
Just a few days after the Hurricane 
struck, we were able to provide some 
initial assistance by boat, delivering 
people and materials from Guadeloupe 
to Saint Martin. The obstacles were 
tremendous, as the airport and shipping 
port were closed to commercial freight 
and the social situation was not easy. 
Once back in Guadeloupe, we assisted 
the Red Cross in setting up a camp at 
the airport and providing food and 
supplies to refugees from Saint Martin. 
Three months later and Saint Martin 
was still slowly working to get back on 
its feet. The daunting task of clearing 
debris and rebuilding what was lost 
will likely take a long time to complete. 
We stepped in to help wherever we 
were needed most. 
This included filling a 20-feet shipping 
container with water, non-perishable 
food, diapers, tarpaulins, holiday gifts 
for the kids and many other essential 
items. Thanks to the tireless work of 
the Caribbean team, everything came 
together flawlessly, on-schedule and 
on-budget! Help also came from Paris 
and Luxembourg, where our teams 
collected and wrapped children’s gifts.
Clearing hurricane debris in the 
Réserve Naturelle On 7th December, 
the ContourGlobal team met at Galion 
Beach, a part of Saint Martin’s Natural 
Reserve. Approximately 15 volunteers, 
including three staff members from the 
reserve, helped to clear the beach, 
removing eight large truck loads of 
debris using tools purchased by 
ContourGlobal, and we were able 
to return a portion of the beach 
to its beautiful, natural state.

Distributing much-needed supplies
On 8th December, we supported a 
long time partner, the local community 
organization, Watt de 9, in distributing 
supplies sent in our container. Together 
with the organization’s leader Yeba 
Oyeniran and her team, we identified 
the residents most in need of food, 
water and basic supplies. We made 
several trips, packing cars full of goods 
and traveling to different neighborhoods 
to deliver essential items to thankful 
residents. We were able to distribute 
2,500 bottles of water, 4,600 
containers of food, 1000 toiletry 
items, 140 packages of baby food and 
diapers and 240 boxes of mosquito 
repellent and many other goods.

Revenue
In 2017, ContourGlobal’s revenue  
exceeded $1bn for the first time, 
to reach $1,022.7m (+13%). This is  
another significant milestone for 
the Company as we pursue our 
objective of continuous growth. 
The rise in revenue was mainly the 
result of successfully integrating our 
recently constructed power plants 
(Cap des Biches I and II) and the 
businesses acquired in 2017, including 
the Brazilian renewable and thermal 
portfolio as well as the new Italian 
solar photovoltaic portfolio.
Income From Operations (IFO)
IFO is an IFRS measure derived from the audited 
consolidated statement of income. IFO has 
significantly increased during 2017, increasing 
by more than 21% as compared to 2016 (+$47.2m). 
This performance was achieved despite the 
expected increase of Depreciation and 
amortization expenses (+$16.2m) resulting in 
particular from assets integrated to the Group 
during the period. The IFO performance was 
primarily driven by the full-year impact of assets 
which came into operation during year 2016 
and by new acquisitions closed in 2017, as 
well as our close monitoring of fixed costs, 
in particular of employee costs, operation 
and maintenance costs (excluding non-cash 
concession construction costs recognized in 
2016 under IFRS standards), facility costs and 
professional fees which remain fairly stable 
despite the growth of the Group.

Adjusted EBITDA
In 2017, we saw another year of strong 
growth of Adjusted EBITDA, rising by 
17% to $513.2m – above the middle of 
the range announced during the listing 
process ($500 to $520m). Growth was 
achieved in both thermal and renewables. 
Corporate and other costs were reduced.
Thermal Adjusted EBITDA increased 
by $50.2m, or 18%, to $332.0m for 
the year ended 31st December 2017, 
from $281.8m for the year ended 
31st December 2016. This growth was 
first the result of the growth strategy, 
including the full-year effect of the 
COD of Cap des Biches in Senegal 
(+$14.1m) and the acquisition of a 
Thermal Solutions fleet in Brazil in 
March 2017 (+$12.2m). The growth 
in thermal was also driven by organic 
growth (+$17.6m) including revenue 
related to SO
2
 and NO
X
 environmental 
investments in Maritsa and the impact 
of a bad debt recovery following a 
positive second instance judgment 
on French Caribbean assets (+$6.4m). 
This trend is the result of nearly fully 
contracted thermal power generation 
across different technologies and 
geographies, stable or lower fixed costs 
and strong operational performance.
In addition, we continued to focus in 
2017 on mitigating our exposure to 
unexpected changes in Adjusted 
EBITDA. In particular:
 ― 75% of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA is 
denominated either in Euros or 
US dollars, and a portion of the 
Brazilian reals exposure is 
hedged to US dollars
 ― No technology cluster represents 
more than 26% of 2017 Adjusted 
EBITDA and the current expected 
acquisition of a 250 MW concentrated 
solar photovoltaic power (CSP) 
portfolio in Spain would further 
diversify our technology profile
 ― Almost all of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA 
is generated under PPA concluded 
with Investment Grade offtakers or 
non-Investment Grade offtakers 
under political risk insurance. The 
expected acquisition of the Spanish 
CSP portfolio would reinforce the 
Investment Grade profile of our 
investments
We believe the presentation of 
Adjusted EBITDA enhances investor 
understanding of ContourGlobal’s 
financial performance. It enables 
investors to assess, from period 
to period, ContourGlobal’s ability 
to generate cash from operations 
sufficient to pay taxes, service debt, 
undertake capital expenditures and 
pay dividends.
We use Adjusted EBITDA for 
business planning and to measure 
our performance relative to competitors. 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as 
combined profit from continuing 
operations for all controlled assets 
before income taxes, net finance 
costs, depreciation and amortization, 
acquisition-related expenses and 
specific items which have been 
identified and adjusted by virtue of 
their size, nature or incidence, less 
ContourGlobal’s share of profit from 
unconsolidated entities accounted 
for on the equity method, plus 
ContourGlobal’s pro rata portion of 
Adjusted EBITDA for such entities. 
In determining whether an event or 
transaction is specific, we consider 
quantitative as well as qualitative 
factors such as the frequency 
or predictability of occurrence. 
Adjusted EBITDA is not a 
measurement of financial 
performance under IFRS.
The thermal fleet reached an average 
annual availability of 92.6% in 2017, 
way above the minimal contractual 
thresholds required for eligibility to 
capacity payments. This structure 
allows Adjusted EBITDA to be 
improved in periods of lower 
production by lowering fixed costs, 
for instance in the Togo power plant 
in 2017. It also includes recovery in the 
tariff of some significant environmental 
investments such as an SO
2
 and NO
X
 
upgrade in Maritsa.
Renewable Energy Adjusted EBITDA 
increased by $18.0m, or 9%, to $211.1m 
for the year ended 31st December 
2017, from $193.1m for the year ended 
31st December 2016. Renewable fleet 
performance was also positively 
impacted by the growth strategy after 
the acquisition of seven hydro power 
plants in Brazil in March 2017, which 
contributed $21.3m to Adjusted 
EBITDA growth in 2017. The change in 
scope also included the full-year 
effect of the sale of Czech solar 
photovoltaic assets in 2016, which 
negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA 
by $2.9m. Excluding these two 
acquisition and sale effects, 
Renewable Adjusted EBITDA slightly 
decreased by $0.5m, impacted by a 
combination of severe weather 
conditions in Peru in 1Q 2017 (flooding) 
and low wind and hydro conditions in 
Brazil combined with technical issues 
in the summer in the Brazil wind fleet. 
This was offset by a strong 
performance of the Inka wind farms 
from 2nd to 4th quarters and by the 
strong performance of Austrian wind 
farms and European solar photovoltaic 
farms (Italy and Slovakia) throughout 
2017. The combination of contracted 
revenue, diversified energy type 
(solar photovoltaic, wind, hydro) and 
diversified geographies allowed the 
Group to mitigate the lower than 
expected wind and hydro resources 
in Brazil and, for the first quarter of 
2017, in Peru. 
Corporate and other costs 
decreased to $(29.9)m for the year 
ended 31st December 2017, from 
$(34.6)m for the year ended 31st 
December 2016. This reduction was 
achieved despite the continuous 
growth of the Company thanks to the 
reinforced monitoring of fixed costs, 
including allocating a dedicated task 
force to growth projects such as the 
Kosovo and Austria repowering 
projects, which both reached 
significant milestones in 2017.

The Company reports non-underlying items in the Income Statement to show 
one-off items and to allow better interpretation of the underlying performance 
of the business. In relation to the 2017 and 2016 financial years, these included 
one-off and non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA is a more accurate reflection of the 
business performance of the Company and allows the Company’s results to be 
compared from period to period and with peer companies.
Funds from operations
Funds from operations is a non-IFRS measure that is calculated as follows:
In $ millions 2017 2016
Cash flow from operations 420.6 532.6
Change in Working Capital 39.4 (135.6)
Interest paid (169.2) (154.3)

Cash distributions to minorities (16.2) (20.3)
Funds From Operations (FFO) 255.9 207.9
Cash conversion rate (%) 50% 47%
Fund from operations (FFO) significantly improved in 2017, growing by 23% 
compared to 2016. This performance is the consequence of the continuous 
growth of Adjusted EBITDA discussed earlier and an efficient capital structure 
implemented by ContourGlobal through a mix of project level and corporate 
level financing to lower its cost of capital. The cash conversion rate, which 
compares FFO to Adjusted EBITDA, improved during the period essentially as 
a result of the new acquisitions (new Brazilian portfolio), the low leverage 
of certain highly cash generating assets and the capacity to keep maintenance 
capital expenditures at a low level despite the growth.
Leverage ratio
2
Leverage ratio table
Year
2016 4.8x
2017 4.1x
The Company leverage ratio is measured as total net indebtedness (reported as 
the difference between Borrowings and Cash and Cash Equivalent under IFRS 
statement of financial position) to Adjusted EBITDA. Whenever significant, such a 
ratio is adjusted to reflect the full-year impact of acquisitions or for financial debt 
of projects under construction which do not generate EBITDA. No such adjustment 
was made in 2017. ContourGlobal aims to maintain its leverage ratio on the 
long-term in a range from 4.0x to 4.5x. As of 31st December 2017, the leverage 
ratio significantly dropped to 4.1x from 4.8x in the previous year. This change 
mainly resulted from the primary proceeds following the listing of ContourGlobal 
plc, net of costs, of approximately $368m and from the high level of cash 
conversion during the period. As of 31st December 2017, ContourGlobal has a 
total of $781.1m of cash and cash equivalents, a significant portion of which sits 
at corporate level and is available to finance the future growth of the Company.
One-off items
One-off items are reported under 
Acquisition related items and Other 
income (expenses) – net in the IFRS 
Consolidated statement of income. 
Acquisition related items essentially 
include pre-acquisition costs and other 
incremental costs incurred as part of 
completed or contemplated 
acquisitions. It represented a total 
amount of $9.5m in 2017. The Company 
has mainly incurred such costs in 2017 
in relation to a number of acquisition 
projects in Brazil, Mexico, Italy, Peru 
and Spain in particular. Other income 
(expenses) of $(12.7) million are fully 
related in 2017 to the non-capitalized 
portion of costs incurred as part of the 
listing of ContourGlobal plc on the UK 
market. In 2016, a $15.6m income was 
recognized and related to the impact 
of the sale of Solutions Kiev power 
plant to Coca Cola Hellenic and the 
sale of three solar photovoltaic energy 
plants in Czech Republic, representing 
a total of 6.0 MW, in November 2016. 
Finance costs – net
Finance costs – net increased from 
$201.9m in 2016 to $220.7m in 2017. 
Interest expenses remained relatively 
stable (+3.6%) at $176.3m in 2017 
despite the growth. This is mainly the 
result of access to attractive project 
financing (for instance Cap des Biches 
in 2016 and 2017) and refinancing of the 
corporate bond in June 2016 at a 
much lower cost. Other financing costs 
were mainly impacted by the foreign 
exchange variations during the period 
(Euro/US dollars and Brazilan Real/US 
dollar), which affected the derivative 
fair value and revaluation of loans 
denominated in a currency other than 
the functional currency at corporate 
level. The increase related to foreign 
exchange was partially offset by 
one-off costs in 2016, notably the 
called premium paid and accelerated 
amortization of deferred financing 
costs following the refinancing of 
ContourGlobal’s $500m bond 
in June 2016.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax remained relatively 
stable at $40.6m in 2017 (-5%). Adjusted 
for the negative effect of listing costs 
and realized and unrealized foreign 
exchange movements recognized in 
the statement of income during the 
period, profit before tax would have 
reached $84.3m (+107%) movement.
Taxation
The Company recognized a tax 
charge of $27.1m in 2017 as compared to 
$22.1m in 2016 as a result of increasing 
taxes in Brazil (extended portfolio), the 
French Caribbean and Bulgaria (higher 
taxable profits).
1 Refer to note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (combining remaining items in one line).
2 IFRS net debt derived from Consolidated statement of Financial Position adjusted for CG share 
of Net Debt at Termoemcali and Sochagota.
Non-current assets
Non-current assets mainly comprise 
of Property, plant and equipment and 
financial assets. The increase of non-
current assets by $284.1m to $3,203.5m 
as of 31st December 2017 was mainly 
due to the acquisition of the Brazilian 
hydro and Solutions portfolio in Brazil 
(+$230.7m) and solar assets in Italy 
(+$75.7m), as well as change in foreign 
exchange, partially offset by normal 
depreciation over the period.
Equity and  
non-controlling interests
Equity and non-controlling interests 
increased by $331.7m to $773.5m as 
of 31st December 2017 mainly as the 
result of the primary proceeds received 
following the listing process on the 
London Stock Exchange, net of related 
costs recognized directly in equity 
(+$382.4m), increased by profit of 
the period ($13.5m) and contribution 
received in Brazil from non-controlling 
interests ($54.4m), partially offset by 
dividends paid to sole shareholder prior 
to the listing ($75.5m), items directly 
recognized in Other comprehensive 
income ($20.3m) and acquisition of 
non-controlling interests ($9.8m).
Borrowings
Current and non-current borrowings 
increased by $360.2m to $2,890.1m, 
mainly as a result of new or acquired 
borrowings (+$367.9m, including bond 
tap in February 2017, financing acquired 
or drawn for the acquisitions closed in 
Brazil in March and Italy in December, 
and Cap des Biches final issuance), 
foreign exchange changes (+$169.6m), 
partially offset by scheduled repayment 
($160.5m) and early repayment of loan 
at Galheiros hydro plant ($13.4m).
Dividend
The declaration and payment by the 
Company of any future dividends and 
the amounts of any such dividends will 
depend upon ContourGlobal’s ability to 
maintain its credit rating, its investments, 
results, financial condition, future 
prospects, profits being available 
for distribution, consideration of 
certain covenants under the terms of 
outstanding indebtedness and any other 
factors deemed by the Directors to be 
relevant at the time, subject always to 
the requirements of applicable laws. The 
Directors expect that dividends will be 
distributed bi-annually, with one-third 
of expected dividends payable at 
the first bi-annual distribution, and 
two-thirds payable at the second 
bi-annual distribution.
As at the date of this report, the 
Directors expect to pay (i) a dividend of 
approximately $17.5m in May 2018 for 
the year ended 31st December 2017, to 
be approved at the 2018 annual general 
meeting; and (ii) dividends totaling 
approximately $75.0m for the year 
ending 31st December 2018, one-third of 
which is expected to be paid in August 
2018 and two-thirds of which is expected 
to be paid in May 2019, after the 2019 
annual general meeting. The Directors 
also expect to increase the dividend by 
a minimum of high single-digit growth 
rate each year over the next five years, 
in line with ContourGlobal’s 
operational scale. 
2017 Corporate 
transactions 
In 2017 we pursued our strategy 
of opportunistic acquisitions at 
very competitive returns.
Acquisition of a thermal and a 
renewable portfolio in Brazil
On March 2017, we closed the acquisition 
of 80% of a 206 MW Brazilian portfolio 
of hydro and thermal power plants. The 
portfolio consists of seven hydroelectric 
plants totaling 130 MW in the states of 
Bahia, Goiás and Rio de Janeiro and four 
high-efficiency cogeneration facilities 
totaling 76 MW in Paraná, Rio de Janeiro 
and São Paulo. The total consideration 
amounts to BRL 576.8m (or $182.4m) 
including certain price adjustments.
Additional solar photovoltaic 
portfolio acquisition
In December 2017, we closed the 
acquisition of 19.1 MW of operational 
solar photovoltaic plants in Italy from 
ErgyCapital S.p.A. The plants, located in 
the regions of Puglia, Piemonte, Lazio 
and Campania, are close to our existing 
Italian solar photovoltaic portfolio and 
benefit from approximately 12 years of 
Feed-in-Tariff. The total consideration 
for the shares amounted to €9.6m 
(or $11.4m).
Acquisition of non-controlling 
interests which did not result 
in a change of control
We completed the acquisition of 15% and 
5% minority interests in Chapada I and 
Chapada II projects in 2017 for a total 
consideration for the shares of $9.8m. 
After this transaction, ContourGlobal 
owns 51% of those projects. 
We also completed the acquisition of 
19.7% minority interests in ContourGlobal 
Hydro Cascade CJSC (Vorotan project) 
for a consideration of $16.3m. After this 
transaction, the Company owns 100% of 
the Vorotan project.
Sale of Kramatorsk 
Ukrainian business
We decided to exit Ukraine by selling 
our Kramatorsk Ukrainian power plant. 
The sale of the asset was closed in 
February 2018.
Outlook
We remain heavily focused on 
developing, acquiring and operating 
power generation facilities under 
long-term contracts providing 
significant protection from the risks 
associated with volumes, commodity 
prices or merchant energy prices. 
As we continue to pursue our growth 
strategy, we are active on both 
construction and acquisition projects. 
Recent developments include:
 ― In December 2017, we signed

38 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 39 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK DIAGRAM:
The Company’s risk management 
framework consists of a risk register of 
all key risks, a risk map and risk ID 
cards detailing all key elements such 
as qualitative analysis of the main 
causes and impacts. The register also 
summarizes the risk management in 
place, including its strength. The risk 
register and ID cards are prepared 
based on direct input from the Group’s 
key senior business leaders. They are 
approved by the senior management 
team and presented to the Audit and 
Risk Committee and the Board.
Focusing on the major risks
This section of the strategic report 
provides a risk overview focusing on 
the major risk factors related to 
implementing the Company’s strategy 
and business model. It is not an 
exhaustive list of all possible risks. 
Additional uncertainties exist, some 
of which may not be known to the 
Company and may have a negative 
effect on the Company’s financial 
position and performance.
Reducing uncertainties
The Company’s focus on contracted 
power generation across different 
technologies reduces uncertainties 
relating to medium-term operational 
results. We closely monitor residual 
risks related to governmental 
regulations and changes in market 
conditions through the risk 
management framework.
Controlling risks
The Company faces a broad range of 
risks based on operating, maintaining 
and refurbishing power generation 
facilities. These include operational, 
health and safety and environmental 
risks. In line with our culture of 
operational excellence and safety, we 
make sure all the resources are 
available to control these risks at the 
right level.

Risk Radar mapping presents the top 
nine risks ContourGlobal is facing. 
They are all major risks for the Group. 
The risk radar has three levels of 
residual risk: high, moderate and low.
Each level is a combination of 
inherent risk significance (potential 
impact and likelihood) and risk 
response in place.
Inherent risk is the risk to an entity in 
the absence of any direct or focused 
actions by management to alter its 
severity/significance.
Residual risk is the risk remaining 
after management has taken action to 
alter its severity/significance.
High: residual risk remaining likely 
to have a strong impact on the 
achievement of strategic objectives 
even if risk management measures 
in place.
Moderate: risk that could strongly 
affect the achievement of the 
objectives for which level of control is 
high enough to conduct to a moderate 
residual risk. Additional actions are 
being taken to alter risk significance 
further.
Low: risk that may have limited 
impact on the business given that 
control mechanisms are in place 
together with relevant monitoring 
and assessment measures.

Risk Response 
(management and mitigation)
R01 – STRATEGY – GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS
The risk that governmental actions or 
changes in regulations will have negative 
impacts due to our contracted assets’ 
significant dependence on regulated tariffs 
(primarily feed-in-tariffs) or other long-term 
fixed rate arrangements (primarily PPAs) in 
partnership with governments, utilities and 
corporations. 
This includes political instability in non-
OECD countries in Eastern Europe, Latin 
America and Sub-Saharan Africa (72% of 
ContourGlobal’s capacity) together with 
changes in laws and regulations in OECD 
countries e.g. Italy and Slovakia.
Deterioration of financial performance 
including loss of revenue and an increase 
in expenses.
Loss of business/growth opportunities:
 ― Termination of agreements
 ― Inability to obtain, maintain or renew 
required governmental permits/
licenses 
 ― Inability to receive permits for 
extension of existing capacities
PPAs are with state-owned, regulated or 
other off-takers, the majority of which are 
rated by Standard & Poor’s, with a 
weighted average credit rating of BBB- 
(weighted by capacity). 
PRI policies (from OPIC and commercial 
insurers) in place for several projects in 
case of events that can affect our assets 
in particular the loss of invested capital. 
In some cases, these cover a return on 
our capital. These include: 
Maritsa (private market), Vorotan (private 
market), KivuWatt (private market), Togo 
(OPIC), Nigeria (OPIC), Cap des Biches 
(OPIC), TermoemCali (private market), 
Sochagota (private market), Inka (private 
market), Slovakia (private market), 
Brazilian businesses (private market).
Close relationships with energy lawyers 
and associations to anticipate any 
potential changes in regulation and lobby 
our interests.
Partnerships with multilateral 
development banks for both equity and 
debt which makes governments reticent 
to renegotiate.
Investment in local communities and 
hiring locally.
Sovereign credit rating is A+ post PRI 
impact (based on the individual sovereign 
ratings determined by Standard & Poor).
R02 – OPERATION AND EXECUTION – PROJECT EXECUTION (CAPEX)
The risk that inefficient project 
management and execution of greenfield 
construction or refurbishment investment 
projects will result in delays or 
unanticipated cost overruns.
Financial impact e.g.:
 ― Overrun of project costs (including 
financing fees) vs. investment case 
impacting projected cash flows and 
IRR
 ― Liquidated damages/penalties/
litigations
 ― Reduced revenue due to construction 
delays
 ― Potential defaults on financing and 
debt repayment before COD
Image and reputation impact resulting 
from a loss of credibility with 
counterparties, lenders and other 
stakeholders.
Minimizing the risk of exceeding 
construction budgets by entering into 
fixed price contracts with engineering, 
procurement and construction (EPC) 
contractors with proven track records.
EPC contracts also contain back-to-back 
liquidated damages provisions which 
protect ContourGlobal against 
construction delays and other breaches 
by EPC contractors.
Contract monitoring and management 
with legal support.
External support for permitting process. 
Project Review Procedure: monthly 
review of the project organized by the 
Project Management Team (including the 
Group COO) and presented to Project’s 
Steering Committee. 
Controlling methodology: provides 
guidance and best practices to ensure 
strict and real time project cost control, 
enabling cost overruns to be identified 
early and mitigation actions put in place.

Risk Response 
(management and mitigation)
R03 – OPERATION AND EXECUTION – ASSET INTEGRITY AND OPEX
The risk that lack of appropriate assets 
maintenance in line with O&M plan will 
prevent the power plants from delivering 
electricity and ensuring availability at the 
levels defined in the long-term PPAs. This 
could be inadequate maintenance of 
power plants or business disruption as a 
result of damage caused to the 
infrastructure (transmission line and 
substation).
Deterioration of operational performance:
 ― Business interruption and power 
outages
 ― Performance below expected 
efficiency and output levels
 ― Inability to deliver electricity or 
ensure availability defined in long-
term PPAs
Reduced profitability and cash flows:
Increase of expenses (OPEX & CAPEX)
 ― Unplanned O&M and capital 
expenditures
 ― Loss of revenue and PPA penalties
 ― Liquidated damages
 ― Reduction in distribution and inability 
to service debt
Reputational impact.
Business interruption insurance.
O&M strategy focusing on HSE, O&M 
Organization, O&M performance 
management, benchmark and KPIs.

between local plant managers and 
operators.
R04 – OPERATION AND EXECUTION – RESOURCES CLIMATE CHANGE
The risk that climate change (changes in 
temperature, wind patterns and 
hydrological conditions etc.) will have an 
adverse effect on financial and operating 
performance.
Deterioration of financial performance 
including a loss of revenue and/or an 
increase in expenses (O&M costs).
Impact on the operational performance 
with a strong deviation of actual 
renewable generation vs. projections in 
the investment case specifically for wind 
and hydro.
Diversified portfolio of assets: 
Thermal and Renewable.
Extensive weather phenomena study and 
due dilligence before the acquisition.

by a reputable advisory firm.
R05 – HEALTH AND SAFETY (H&S) AND ENVIRONMENT – PREVENTION AND REGULATIONS
The risk of failure to prevent H&S and 
environment incidents and/or to comply 
with relevant regulations due to inherent 
risks related to ContourGlobal activities 
(fuel types, technology and equipment in 
more than 20 different countries), which 
will have a material adverse impact on 
our operations, financing conditions 
and reputation.
These could include accidents during 
transportation and handling of electricity, 
natural gas/biogas, liquid fuels and 
hazardous materials arising from a lack of 
expertize/training and/or involvement, 
inadequate assessment, poor equipment, 
insufficient supervision of H&S aspects, for 
example.
These could result from poor monitoring of 
compliance to local H&S and environment 
laws and regulations as well as their 
changes.
Human and environmental impact:
 ― LTIs (Lost Time Incidents) and 
fatalities of ContourGlobal employees 
and contractors or local communities 
around the facilities due to incidents 
at the power plants
 ― Environmental accidents on site and 
in local communities
Reputational impact due to poor H&S 
management.

(management and mitigation)
R06 – REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE – FRAUD, BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION
The risk that lack of transparency, threat of 
fraud, public sector corruption and other 
forms of criminal activity involving 
government officials will result in a failure 
to comply with anti-corruption legislation, 
including the UK Bribery Act 2010 and 
other international anti-bribery laws.
Financial impact:
 ― Financial losses as a result of 
fraudulent activities

R07 – INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY – INTEGRITY AND RELIABILITY OF CORPORATE IT SYSTEMS
Many of the Company’s activities are highly 
sensitive to IT systems in their day-to-day 
operations (including cloud-based 
SharePoint applications, accounting and 
reporting systems). The risk is that an 
insufficiently robust and stable IT operating 
environment (including physical security, 
logical access management, incident 
management, system development and 
change control and monitoring of system 
performance) will result in business 
disruption and loss of data reliability.
Organizational and operational impact:
 ― Disruptions to business operations
 ― Compromise of data integrity in core 
systems 
Financial impact:
 ― Potential for fraudulent activity due to 
segregation of duties conflicts
 ― Penalties related to non-compliance 
with data-related laws and 
regulations

Risk Response 
(management and mitigation)
R08 – INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY – CYBER SECURITY
The risk is that insufficient IT security 
measures will expose the Company, which 
relies on IT systems in its day-to-day 
operations, to cyber intrusions. This can 
have a negative impact on information 
systems as well as electronic control 
systems used at the generating plants, and 
can disrupt business operations, result in 
loss of service to customers, and expense 
to repair security breaches or system 
damage.
Organizational and operational impact:
 ― Impact on corporate or operational 
systems
 ― Loss of confidence in system integrity
 ― Ongoing threat to process integrity
Deterioration of financial performance:
 ― Loss of revenue due to disruption of 
operations or compromised business 
process
 ― Unpredicted expenses to repair 
security breaches
 ― Financial losses due to external 
fraudulent activities
Deterioration of competitive advantage 
through loss of sensitive business data.

been assigned to consolidate IT 
management approach in the plants 
under a global framework of IT security 
policies and procedures.
R09 – PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATION – CONSTRAINED STAFFING MODEL AND SUCCESSION PLANNING
The risk that given a constrained 
staffing model with high dependency 
on productivity and expertize of key 
individuals, the departure or removal of 
key46staff and failure to appoint adequate 
successors will have an adverse effect on 
Company’s ability to deliver on its strategic 
objectives. This could have a negative 
impact on all the Company’s performance 
indicators.
Removal or departure of key individuals 
could result in operational disruption, 
while competition for employees could 
lead to higher than expected increases 
in the cost of recruitment, training and 
employee costs.
Focused action to attract, retain and 
develop high caliber employees. 
Delivering initiatives which reinforce 
behaviors to generate the best outcomes 
for customers, partners and employees.

Report on page 60.
Viability Statement:
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over a period 
significantly longer than 12 months. The Directors believe that an assessment period of three years is appropriate based 
on management’s reasonable expectations of the position and performance of the Company over this period, taking 
account of its short-term and longer-range plans.
Taking into account the Group’s current position and its principal risks, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over three years. In particular, 
the Group’s financial performance has been assessed as relatively predictable given more than 90% of revenue and 
related cash flows are fully contracted with no material contracts expiring during this period.
The Directors’ assessment included a review of the financial impact of the most severe but plausible scenarios that could 
threaten the viability of the Company and the likely effectiveness of the potential mitigations that management reasonably 
believes would be available to the Company over this period.
In assessing the prospects of the Company, the Directors noted that such assessment is subject to a degree of 
uncertainty that can be expected to increase looking out over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be 
guaranteed or predicted with certainty.
Going concern statement:
The Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period 
of at least 12 months from the date of this report. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Group and Company financial statements. 
In reaching this conclusion, the Directors have considered:
 ― The financial position of the Group as set out in this report and additional information provided in the financial statements 
including note 4.14 (Management of financial risk), note 4.21 and 4.23 (Cash and cash equivalents and Borrowings) and 
note 4.15 (Derivative financial instruments)
 ― The resources available to the Group taking account of its financial projections and existing headroom against committed 
debt facilities and covenants
 ― The principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed, as set out on pages 40 to 46, the likelihood of 
them arising and the mitigating actions available

52 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 53 Corporate Governance Report
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to introduce our first 
Corporate Governance report.
As we stated in our IPO Prospectus, 
the Directors support high standards 
of corporate governance and it is a 
policy of the Company to comply with 
current best practice in UK corporate 
Governance to the extent appropriate 
for a Company of its size. 
ContourGlobal listed its Ordinary 
shares on the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange on 
14th November 2017. The Listing Rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority, 
including the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”), have 
therefore applied to the Company 
since that date. In the months leading 
up to the listing, much work was 
carried out to ensure that the Board 
had constituted appropriate 
Committees and adopted relevant 
policies and procedures to support 
the development of a robust 
governance structure and compliance 
with the Code and other obligations of 
a Company listed on the London Stock 
Exchange’s Main Market.
Since listing ContourGlobal LP 
(ultimately owned and controlled by 
Reservoir Capital) continues to be the 
majority shareholder of the Company. 
The Board believes that the Board and 
the Board Committees, with the addition 
of the new independent Non-Executive 
Directors will provide the appropriate 
corporate governance balance in light 
of the interests of both the majority 
shareholder and the new minority 
shareholders. The Remuneration and 
also the Audit and Risk Committee 
consists solely of independent 
Non-Executive Directors and a 
Relationship Agreement is in place 
between the Company, ContourGlobal 
LP, the Reservoir Funds, Reservoir 
Capital and the Company President 
and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph C. 
Brandt (the Relationship Agreement).
Under the Relationship Agreement 
Reservoir Capital is able to appoint 
two Non-Executive Directors to the 
Board while it continues to control 
25% or more of the Company’s shares. 
Further details of the Relationship 
Agreement can be found on pages 57 
and 81. The first such appointees by 
Reservoir Capital are myself and 
Gregg M. Zeitlin. As Co-Chief Executive 
Officer of Reservoir Capital, I therefore 
did not meet the independence criteria 
set out in the Code. The Board believes, 
however, that given the benefits for 
the Company of my longstanding 
experience with the Group and in the 
power industry that I should continue 
as Chairman. Following a transition 
period while the Company establishes 
itself as a premium listed Company the 
Board expects that it will seek to 
appoint an independent Non-
Executive Chairman.
This Report includes a description 
of how the Company has applied the 
principles and provisions of the Code 
since 14th November 2017 and how 
it intends to apply those principles 
throughout 2018.
Craig A. Huff
Chairman
4th April 2018
Chairman’s Introduction

high standards of 
corporate governance 
and it is a policy of the 
Company to comply 
with best practice 
in UK Corporate 
Governance to the

The Company adopted the UK 
Corporate Governance Code on 
14th November 2017 on admission of 
its shares to the UKLA’s Official List 
and listing on the Main Market of 
the London Stock Exchange.
Since that date, the Company has 
applied all of the main principles 
of the Code that are applicable to it 
and has complied with all relevant 
provisions of the Code except 
as indicated adjacent: 
Provision Explanation

The Company’s governance structure

It also approves the strategic plan, 
monitors performance, and ensures 
that appropriate financial and human 
resources are in place for the

Board is also responsible for ensuring 
that appropriate systems, procedures 
and controls are in place to support

54 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 55 Key Board roles and 
responsibilities 
Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer
As required by the Code there is a 
clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer. The roles of the 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
are held by different people (Craig A. 
Huff and Joseph C. Brandt, respectively) 
and the purpose of each role is clear 
and distinct and set out in respective 
job descriptions. Although the Board 
agrees that there should be a clear 
division of responsibilities, it 
recognizes that overly prescribing the 
responsibilities of the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer may reduce 
their flexibility to act in unforeseen 
circumstances. The following list of 
responsibilities sets out the division 
of responsibilities but is not intended 
to provide a definitive list of the 
individual responsibilities of each 
of the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer.
Senior Independent Director
Alan Gillespie was appointed as 
Senior Independent Director prior to 
admission. In this role, Alan provides a 
sounding board for the Chairman, and 
will lead the Non-Executive Directors’ 
appraisal of the Chairman on an 
annual basis. Alan will attend sufficient 
meetings with a range of major 
shareholders to develop a balanced 
understanding of their issues and 
concerns. He is also available to 
shareholders if they have concerns 
which contact through the normal 
channels of the Chief Executive 
Officer or Chairman has failed to 
resolve or for which such contact may 
not be appropriate. When appropriate, 
the Senior Independent Director will 
support the Nomination Committee 
in ensuring orderly succession for 
the Chairman.
Non‑Executive Directors 
The Non-Executive Directors have 
been appointed to provide objective 
and constructive challenge to 
management and to help develop 
proposals on strategy. The Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors will 
meet regularly without the Executive 
Director present. Their role includes 
upholding the highest standards of 
integrity and probity and support to 
other Directors in instilling the 
appropriate culture, values and 
behaviors in the Boardroom and 
beyond. They will also scrutinize the 
performance of the management in 
meeting agreed goals and objectives 
and monitor the reporting performance.
Pursuant to the Relationship 
Agreement entered into between 
the Company, ContourGlobal LP, the 
Reservoir Funds, Reservoir Capital and 
the Company President and Chief 
Executive Officer, Joseph C. Brandt, 
Reservoir Capital is able to appoint 
two Non-Executive Directors to the ⊲ 
CG Power Plant, Togo
⊳ Board while it continues to control 
25% or more of the Company’s Shares. 
The two such appointees as non-
independent Non-Executive Directors 
are the Chairman, Craig A. Huff and 
Gregg M. Zeitlin.
The Company therefore complies 
with provision B.1.2 of the Code as 
at least half the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, comprise Non-Executive 
Directors determined by the Board 
as independent. 
The Company does not comply with 
provision A.3.1 of the Code which 
requires that the Chairman should, on 
appointment, meet the independence 
criteria set out in provision B.1.1 of the 
Code. As Co-Chief Executive officer 
of Reservoir Capital the Chairman, 
Craig A. Huff, did not meet the 
independence criteria set out in the 
Code. The Board believes, however, 
that given the benefits for the 
Company of his longstanding 
experience with the Group and in the 
power industry that he should 
continue as Chairman. Following a 
transition period while the Company 
establishes itself as a premium listed 
Company the Board expects that it will 
seek to appoint an independent 
Non-Executive Chairman.
Relationship Agreement 
On 9th November 2017 , the Company, 
ContourGlobal LP, the Reservoir 
Funds, Reservoir Capital and the 
Company President and Chief 
Executive Officer, Joseph C. Brandt 
entered into a Relationship 
Agreement. The principal purpose 
of the Relationship Agreement is to 
ensure that the Company can carry on 
an independent business as its main 
activity. The Relationship Agreement 
contains, among others, undertakings 
from the Major Shareholder, the 
Reservoir Funds and Reservoir Capital 
that: (i) transactions and agreements 
with it (and/or any of its controlled 
affiliates) will be conducted at arm’s-
length and on normal commercial 
terms; (ii) neither it nor any of its 
controlled affiliates will take any 
action that would have the effect 
of preventing the Company from 
complying with its obligations under 
the Listing Rules; and (iii) neither it 
nor any of its controlled affiliates will 
propose or procure the proposal of 
a shareholder resolution which is 
intended or appears to be intended to 
circumvent the proper application of 
the Listing Rules (the “Independence 
Provisions”). Furthermore, Reservoir 
Capital has agreed to procure the 
compliance of its associates with 
the Independence Provisions. The 
Company’s President and Chief 
Executive Officer, Joseph C. Brandt, 
has given similar undertakings.
The Relationship Agreement will 
continue for so long as: (i) the shares 
are listed on the premium listing 
segment of the Official List and traded 
on the London Stock Exchange’s Main 
Market for listed securities; and (ii) the 
Reservoir Funds and the Major 
Shareholder and their controlled 
affiliates hold an interest in 10% or 
more of the issued Ordinary Share 
capital of the Company (or which 
carries 10% or more of the aggregate 
voting rights in the Company from time 
to time). The Directors believe that the 
terms of the Relationship Agreement 
will enable the Group to carry on its 
business independently of Reservoir 
Capital, the Reservoir Funds and the 
Major Shareholder.
The Company has complied with 
the undertakings of the Relationship 
Agreement throughout the period 
under review and, so far as it is aware, 
the controlling shareholder and its 
associates have also complied with 
the provisions including any 
procurement obligation.

56 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 57 Board Process 
The Board did not meet between 
Admission and the period ended 
31st December 2017. The Board has 
met formally on two occasions in 2018, 
so far, with key matters discussed 
including reviewing the Group budget, 
reviewing the risk register, reviewing 
corporate transactions, convening the 
AGM and approving the 2017 Annual 
Report and Financial Statements. 
The Board intends to meet formally at 
least five times a year, with ad hoc 
meetings called as and when required 
at short notice. The Board has an 
annual calendar of agenda items to 
ensure that all matters are given due 
consideration and are reviewed at the 
appropriate point in the regulatory and 
financial cycle. At least once a year, 
the Board will undertake a full strategic 
review of the business operations as 
part of the budget review.
All Directors are expected to attend all 
meetings of the Board and any 
Committees of which they are 
members, and to devote sufficient 
time to the Company’s affairs to fulfill 
their duties as Directors. In signing 
their letters of appointment each 
Non-Executive Director has confirmed 
that they are able to allocate sufficient 
time to the Company to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively. 
Non-Executive Directors will need to 
attend scheduled and emergency 
Board and Committee meetings, at 
least one site visit per year, the AGM 
and any other general meetings of the 
Company. In addition, the Non-
Executive Directors are expected to 
commit appropriate preparation time 
ahead of each meeting.
Where Directors are unable to attend 
a meeting, they are encouraged to 
submit any comments on papers to be 
considered at the meeting to the 
Chairman in advance to ensure that 
their views are recorded and taken 
into account during the meeting. The 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
will meet without the Executive 
Director present on a number of 
occasions throughout the year.
Appointment and Election
The Board considers all Directors to 
be effective, committed to their roles 
and have sufficient time to perform 
their duties. Accordingly, all members 
of the Board will be offering 
themselves for re-election at the 
Company’s first Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”) on 25th May 2018. 
All of the Directors have service 
agreements or letters of appointment 
and the details of their terms are set 
out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on page 73.
Training and Induction
In preparation for listing, all Directors 
received an induction briefing from 
the Company’s legal advisor, Davis 
Polk and Wardwell London LLP, on 
their duties and responsibilities as 
directors of a publicly quoted 
company. A full, formal and tailored 
induction program will be developed 
for new Directors joining the Board. 
The Chairman, with the support of the 
Company Secretary, will ensure that 
the development and ongoing training 
needs of individual Directors and the 
Board as a whole are reviewed and 
agreed at least annually. After the first 
Board meeting the Directors all 
received an “Orientation Session” 
where the senior management met 
with the Board members and 
presented to them on their business 
areas. Each Board meeting also 
includes a section covering legal, 
regulatory and governance 
development updates.
Evaluation and Effectiveness
Given that the Company listed in 
November 2017 and the majority of 
the Directors were only appointed 
in October 2017, the Board did not 
consider it appropriate to carry out a 
performance evaluation process prior 
to publication of the 2017 Annual 
Report. The Board believes that a 
meaningful evaluation can only take 
place after it has been working 
together for a reasonable time, and 
therefore an agreed approach to 
evaluation will be developed and 
implemented before the end of the 
2018 financial year and annually 
thereafter. This will include 
consideration as to whether it is 
appropriate to carry out an externally 
facilitated evaluation process.
Conflicts of Interest
The Company’s Articles of Association 
set out the policy for dealing with 
directors’ conflicts of interest and are 
in line with the Companies Act 2006. 
The Articles permit the Board to 
authorize conflicts and potential 
conflicts, as long as the conflicted or 
potentially conflicted Director is not 
counted in the quorum and does not 
vote on the resolution to authorize. 
The Board has a procedure by which 
Directors are briefed on their duty 
to avoid conflicts of interests and 
required to immediately notify the 
Company Secretary when a conflict 
or potential conflict does arise in 
order that Board authorization can be 
sought. If the Board determines that 
a conflict or potential conflict can be 
authorized, it may impose additional 
conditions to manage such conflicts 
of interest. In addition, Directors are 
reminded at the beginning of each 
Board meeting to notify the Board 
of any further conflicts of interest in 
accordance with sections 175, 177 
and 182 of the Companies Act 2006.
Information and Support
Agendas and accompanying papers 
are distributed to the Board and 
Committee members in advance of 
each Board or Committee meeting. 
These include reports from members 
of senior management and external 
advisors. Members of senior 
management are invited to attend 
meetings to present relevant matters 
to the Board. Directors have direct 
access to senior management should 
they require additional information on 
any of the items to be discussed. 
The Board and the Audit and 
Risk Committee also receive further 
regular and specific reports to allow 
the monitoring of the adequacy of the 
Company’s systems of internal controls. 
The information supplied to the Board 
and its Committees will be kept under 
review and formally assessed on an 
annual basis as part of the Board 
evaluation exercise to ensure it is fit 
for purpose and supports the Directors 
in effectively discharging their duties 
under the Companies Act, Listing and 
Disclosure Rules and the Code.
Relations with Shareholders
As part of its ongoing investor 
relations program, the Group aims to 
maintain an active dialogue with its 
stakeholders including institutional 
investors to discuss issues relating 
to the performance of the Group 
including strategy and 
new developments. 
The Non-Executive Directors are 
available to discuss any matter 
stakeholders might wish to raise, and 
the Chairman and independent Non-
Executive Directors will attend meetings 
with investors and analysts as required. 
Investor relations activity will be a 
standing item on the Board’s agenda 
and ensuring a satisfactory dialogue 
with shareholders and receiving reports 
on the views of shareholders is a matter 
reserved for the Board.
The Company’s first Annual General 
Meeting since Admission will take place 
on 25th May 2018 at 1 Silk Street, 
London EC2Y 8HQ. The Chairman, and 
the Chairs of the Audit and Risk and 
Remuneration Committee, will be 
present to answer questions put to them 
by shareholders. The Annual Report and 
Financial Statements and Notice of the 
Annual General Meeting will be sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days 
prior to the date of the meeting. To 
encourage shareholders to participate 
in the Annual General Meeting process, 
the Company proposes to offer 
electronic proxy voting through the 
CREST service and all resolutions will 
be proposed and voted on at the 
meeting on an individual basis by 
shareholders or their proxies. Voting 
results will be announced through the 
Regulatory News Service and made 
available on the Company’s website.
Acting with integrity
We are deeply committed to acting 
with integrity throughout our 
business. This is not only the right 
thing to do, it is also a key part of our 
advantage across all of our operations 
– from ensuring health and safety 
to building a culture of compliance 
that protects our investments and 
corporate reputation. To this end, we 
set and follow the highest standards 
of ethical conduct.
Detecting and preventing corruption
Much like our Health and Safety 
Program, our Anti-Corruption 
Compliance Program is designed to 
ensure our workers and employees do 
the right thing and are protected. It is 
designed to detect and prevent 
corruption in our Company – upholding 
the tenth principal of the United Nations 
Global Compact, to which we are 
signatories: “Businesses should work 
against corruption in all its forms, 
including extortion and bribery.” Our 
anti-corruption commitment begins with 
the tone-at-the-top. In town-hall 
meetings and in-person training, our 
senior management regularly reinforce 
the message to our employees and 
third parties that corruption or other 
unethical conduct will not be tolerated 
even where it could facilitate the 
Company’s immediate business 
objectives. 
The Board and Audit & Risk Committee 
oversee the Compliance Program 
through quarterly reporting on the 
program, key performance indicators, 
initiatives, and developments in the 
field by the Executive Vice President, 
General Counsel & Chief Compliance 
Officer, who oversees the program. We 
cascade the commitment throughout 
the Company by delivering training on 
our values, policies and procedures to 
our offices, plants and functions. In 
2017, we provided 25 such in-person 
training sessions. These sessions were 
supplemented by an online anti-
corruption course that employees are 
required to take upon joining the 
Company and periodically thereafter. 
Our Anti-Corruption Policy and its 
accompanying Anti-Corruption 
Compliance Guide are the cornerstones 
of our program. A 60-page booklet 
revised in 2015 and distributed to all 
employees in all 16 ContourGlobal 
languages, the Guide provides an 
overview of the program, applicable 
laws, our expectations and employees’ 
responsibilities. Employees are 
required to sign the Guide soon after 
they join the Company and periodically 
thereafter, acknowledging that they 
have read, understood and agree to 
abide by it. Moreover, we distribute the 
Guide to targeted third parties and 
require that they too sign it as part of 
our risk-based due diligence process. 
This ensures that our business partners 
understand our expectations and that 
working with us means working 
according to our values. 
Focusing on third parties
Managing third party risks is a key 
element of our program. We do so 
according to our Policy for Engaging 
Suppliers and Third Party Service 
Providers, which requires that all third 
parties, with the exception of certain 
low-risk suppliers, receive risk-based 
due diligence through the Compliance 
Third-Party Intake Portal. All third 
parties must first be approved by 
Compliance before being engaged by 
the Company. In 2017, we analyzed 
approximately 2,635 third parties for 
corruption risk. 
Using the Portal, our Compliance team 
can conduct routine auditing, monitor 
third party engagements and update 
due diligence when required. In 2017, 
we re-reviewed and conducted 
refreshed due diligence on 
approximately 645 legacy third 
parties engaged by the Company.
Company‑wide commitment
In line with our Company-wide 
commitment, we analyze 
social responsibility projects, 
acquisitions, joint ventures and 
new developments for corruption 
risk. We make sure appropriate 
due diligence is conducted 
before proceeding.

Role and Responsibilities
The role of the Nomination Committee

Board in discharging its responsibilities 
relating to the composition of the Board 
and its committees. The Committee is 
responsible for evaluating the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience 
on the Board, the size, structure and 
composition of the Board, retirements 
and appointments of additional or 
replacement Directors. The Nomination 
Committee is also responsible for 
making recommendations to the Board 
concerning succession planning.
Specific duties of the Nomination 
Committee include:
 ― Regularly reviewing the structure, 
size and composition (including the 
skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity) of the Board and making 
recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any changes
 ― Putting in place plans for orderly 
succession of appointments to the 
Board and senior management, 
taking into account the challenges 
and opportunities facing the 
Company and the skills and 
experience needed within the 
Board and the Company
 ― Leading the process for Board 
appointments as and when they arise, 
identify and nominate candidates 
and make recommendations for 
Board approval
 ― Review annually the time required 
from Non-Executive Directors
Meetings
It is intended that the Nomination 
Committee will meet at least twice 
per year and otherwise as required 
in order to discharge its duties. 
Only members of the Nomination 
Committee have the right to attend 
meetings, but other Directors, 
executives or advisors may be 
invited to attend all or part of 
any meeting as appropriate.
Dear Shareholders 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present the Company’s first Audit 
and Risk Committee report. 
The Audit and Risk Committee is 
responsible for establishing, monitoring 
and regularly reviewing the Company’s 
internal controls and risk management 
framework, as well as overseeing the 
work of the external auditor and the 
internal audit function. 
The membership of the committee 
comprises three independent Non-
Executive Directors with at least 
one member having recent and 
relevant financial experience and 
the Committee as a whole has 
competence relevant to the sector.
We met once prior to the year end 
just after listing and have met twice 
since the year end. These meetings 
have focused primarily on setting 
our schedule of activity for 2018, 
establishing key policies and 
procedures in support of the control 
environment, reviewing the risk 
management framework, the external 
audit and the approval of the 2017 
Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Further details on the activities of the 
Committee during the year and how it 
has discharged its responsibilities are 
provided in the report below.
Ronald Trächsel
Chairman of the Audit and 
Risk Committee
4th April 2018
The Nomination Committee met 
once in the period between IPO and 
31st December 2017 to consider the 
appointment of a further Independent 
Non-Executive Director following the 
IPO. The process of searching for 
Non-Executive directors had 
commenced prior to the IPO and Egon 
Zehnder, a Company unconnected 
with the Group, were responsible 
for seeking Non-Executive Director 
candidates leading up to the IPO 
process and all members of the 
Committee were in attendance 
at the meeting.
Diversity
The Company recognizes that no 
individual should be discriminated 
against on the grounds of race, color, 
ethnicity, religious belief, political 
affiliation, gender orientation, sexual 
orientation, national origin, ancestry, 
age, medical condition, physical or 
mental disability, marital status, 
worker’s compensation status, veteran 
status, citizenship status, or any other 
legally protected status and this 
extends to Board appointments. The 
Board further recognizes the benefits 
of diversity, including gender diversity, 
on the Board, although it believes that 
all appointments should be made on 
merit, while ensuring that there is 
an appropriate balance of skills and 
experience within the Board. Since 
the year end a female Director has 
been appointed to the Board (January 
2018). The Board currently consists of 
12.5% (1) female and 87.5% (6) male 
Board members. Across the Group 
employees are geographically diverse 
and many of the Group offices are 
populated with many nationalities.
Annual Evaluation
As the Nomination Committee has only 
been established for a short time, a 
formal performance evaluation has not 
been conducted. It is intended that a 
performance evaluation will be 
conducted in 2018 and reported on in 
the Company’s 2018 Annual Report.
Craig A. Huff
Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee
4th April 2018
Role and Responsibilities
The Audit and Risk Committee’s role 
is to assist the Board in discharging 
its responsibilities in relation to 
internal and external audits and 
controls, including reviewing the 
Group’s annual financial statements, 
considering the scope of the annual 
audit and the extent of the non audit 
work undertaken by external auditors, 
advising on the appointment of 
external auditors and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the internal control 
systems in place within the Group. 
The ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the annual 
report and accounts and the half-
yearly reports remains with the Board. 
The Audit and Risk Committee will 
give due consideration to laws and 
regulations, the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the 
requirements of the Listing Rules.
The Audit and Risk Committee is also 
responsible for advising the Board 
on the Company’s risk strategy, risk 
policies and current risk exposures, 
overseeing the implementation and 
maintenance of the overall risk 
management framework and systems, 
and reviewing the Company’s risk 
assessment processes and capability 
to identify and manage new risks.
The Audit and Risk Committee’s duties 
and responsibilities are set out in its 
terms of reference which are available 
on the Company’s website.
Composition and Meetings 
The Audit and Risk Committee is chaired 
by Ronald Trächsel, and its other 
members are Daniel Camus and Alan 
Gillespie. All members of the Committee 
are independent Non-Executive 
Directors, and the Board is satisfied that 
Ronald Trächsel has recent and relevant 
financial experience. The Audit and Risk 
committee as a whole has competence 
relevant to the sector in which the 
Company operates. Consequently, the 
Board has determined that the 
composition of the Committee complies 
with provision C.3.1 of the Code.
The Audit and Risk Committee will 
normally meet no fewer than three times 
a year. Further meetings may be called 
as required. The internal and external 
auditors will be invited to attend some 
of the meetings. Outside of the formal 
meeting program, the Audit and Risk

Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
external audit lead partner and the head 
of internal audit.

The Audit and Risk Committee met 
once in the period between IPO and 
31st December 2017, and has met 
twice since the year end. All members 
of the Committee attended all of the 
meetings. The Audit and Risk 
Committee’s activity in these meetings 
included:
 ― Considering the Committee’s Terms 
of Reference
 ― Considering the Group’s policy on 
the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditors
 ― Review of the Company’s risk 
register and considering the 
process to support the long-term 
viability statement
 ― Reviewing the Group’s 
whistleblowing arrangements
 ― Reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems
 ― Reviewing the Annual Report 
and Financial statements and 
recommending their approval 
by the Board
⊳ senior management and the 
Board. The results of Operations 
(financial and non-financial) are 
reviewed against budget and prior 
year on a monthly basis. 
Management monitors financial and 
business activities through budget, 
forecasts and annual objectives. The 
annual budget is approved by the 
Board. The Group prepares its 
financial statements under IFRS and 
will issue financials annually and 
half-yearly.
 The Group has a comprehensive 
Reporting and Accounting Manual 
(“RAM”), covering a wide range of 
policies and procedures, including 
accounting policies, reporting and 
KPIs and key cycles in order to 
provide reliable and timely 
consolidated financials.
 ― Compliance: ContourGlobal 
Management is committed to acting 
with integrity and transparency, 
and enforces this through a strong 
tone-at-the-top. The Company has 
a dedicated Compliance function 
that is headed by the Executive Vice 
President, General Counsel and 
Chief Compliance Officer who reports 
directly to the CEO and who also 
has direct access to the Board and 
the Audit and Risk Committee. 
All employees are required to 
acknowledge and adhere to a 
number of Compliance policies and 
take Compliance training as part of 
their commitments to the Company.
 Further details on Compliance are 
provided in the Business Review 
section on pages 22 to 35.
 ― Information systems: A risk 
management process exists within 
IT to monitor and manage IT specific 
risks at a granular level. A suite of IT 
policies and procedures has been 
established by management. A 
framework is in place to ensure 
these policies are appropriately 
reviewed, updated and approved 
on a periodic basis.
 In February 2017, the Company 
engaged a third party to undertake 
a cyber security assessment. 
Management has subsequently 
initiated several cyber security 
projects with a focus on existing 
scanning capabilities, updating 
security policies, implementing 
a security information and event 
management system (“SIEM”), 
hardening of the network devices 
and encryption of corporate systems 
and equipment. A Senior IT Security 
Analyst was hired in January 2018.
 ― Debt Compliance: The Debt 
Compliance monitoring process 
is designed to ensure that there 
are no unexpected covenant 
compliance issues. This process 
is managed by the VP Debt 
Compliance, under the responsibility 
of the two Divisional CFOs for asset 
level debt and the Group CFO for 
corporate level debt. The role of 
the VP Debt Compliance is to 
coordinate the monitoring of CG’s 
financial agreements and corporate 
bond and ensure timely compliance 
with both financial and non-financial 
covenant reporting deadlines, 
general requirements and debt 
payments. CG has developed a debt 
monitoring tool within SharePoint 
called CG Debts. The tool tracks 
all requirements of external debts 
across the Group, including financial 
and non-financial covenants as 
well as positive and negative 
undertaking in the agreements.
 ― Hedging: The Treasury department 
has put a hedging policy in place, 
which is overseen by the Hedging 
Committee. The hedging policy 
clarifies the rules and 
responsibilities for any hedging 
activity. The hedging policy is 
reviewed bi-annually by the 
Hedging Committee, whose 
members have the necessary 
knowledge and experience to 
assess the financial impact of each 
hedge transaction. Any new 
significant hedging transaction 
requires approval from the Hedging 
Committee before being executed. 
All hedging contracts are managed 
centrally and are executed by the 
Treasury department. Hedging 
transactions are tracked by the 
Treasury department on a monthly 
basis to monitor the realized gains/
losses and the Mark To Market 
positions. Treasury collaborates 
closely with Accounting teams to 
ensure proper accounting treatment 
of the hedging contracts.
The Audit and Risk Committee, on 
behalf of the Board, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the internal control 
systems and risk management 
processes in place, taking account of 
any material developments since the 
year end. The Committee has not 
identified, nor been advised of, any 
failings or weaknesses that it has 
determined to be significant. As part 
of its review, the Committee noted that 
no matters had been raised by PwC in 
the context of the annual audit. As part 
of their review the Audit and Risk 
Committee has considered the FRC’s 
2014 “Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting”.
Significant issues relating to the financial statements
Significant issues and accounting judgments are identified by the finance team 
and the external audit process and are reviewed by the Audit and Risk 
Committee. The detailed work was performed by management and reviewed by 
external auditors and the Audit and Risk Committee based their review on the 
joint work performed. The significant issues considered by the Committee in 
respect of the year ended 31st December 2017 are set out in the table below.
Significant issues and judgments How the issues were addressed
Impairment of property, plant and 
equipment, and financial assets – as 
of 31st December 2017, the Group has 
$2,350.3m of property, plant and 
equipment, the majority of which relates 
to power plant assets, and $617.7m 
of financial assets, the majority of which 
relate to concession arrangements. 
Impairment assessments of these assets 
requires significant judgment including 
assumptions of future cash flows, 
discount rates and inflation which 
are by essence judgmental.
The Audit and Risk Committee has reviewed 
the indicators of impairment and main 
assumptions retained and described in the 
financial statements. The Audit and Risk 
Committee concurred with the 
testing performed with regards to wind 
farms and hydro power plants in Brazil, and 
agreed that an impairment charge 
was necessary for the Kramatorsk power 
plant considering the purchase price agreed 
to sell the asset. 
Accounting for business combinations and 
valuation of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed – The Group completed two 
acquisitions in 2017 related to hydro 
and thermal portfolio in Brazil and 
Solar Photovoltaic portfolio in Italy. 
The Audit and Risk Committee considered 
the appropriateness of the items to which 
the purchase price has been allocated as 
well as main assumptions used in relation 
with discount rates and future cash flows. 
Accounting for power purchase 
agreements (PPA) – As part of the 
acquisitions completed during the 
period, the Group assessed the 
accounting treatment of the long-term 
contracts under IFRS rules and determined 
whether a lease was embedded, and if 
that was the case, whether such lease is 
an operating or a finance lease.
The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the 
conclusions of the technical analyzes that 
resulted in considering no lease, operating 
leases and financial lease depending on 
assets acquired, together with the main 
items that led to such conclusions. The 
Audit and Risk Committee concurred with 
the accounting treatment retained.
IFRS 15 – Revenue recognition – The 
Group discloses in its 2017 consolidated 
financial statements a range of potential 
impact of the new IFRS 15 standard that 
will be applicable starting 1st January 2018.
The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the 
conclusions of the technical analyzes 
conducted for the vast majority of the Group’s 
existing assets. The Audit and Risk Committee 
considered and concurred with the changes 
that this new standard would result in relation 
with its concession agreements, as well for 
specific topics in relation with Arrubal and 
Maritsa power plants.
Internal Controls and 
Risk Management
The Board acknowledges ultimate 
responsibilities for the effective 
management of risk across the Group 
and for reviewing their effectiveness. 
The Board has undertaken a robust 
assessment of the principal risks. The 
Board has delegated responsibility 
for this review to the Audit and Risk 
Committee. The Audit and Risk 
Committee will provide oversight and 
advice to the Board on current risk 
exposures and future risk strategy. 
Further details of the Group’s risk 
management approach, structure 
and principal risks are set out in the 
Strategic report on pages 2 to 47.
The main features of the Internal 
Control and Risk management 
systems in relation to the financial 
reporting process, which were in 
place for the year under review and 
up to the date of approval of the 
annual report and accounts, include: 
 ― Internal control: Internal Control 
department has designed and 
formalized the Book Of Internal 
Control Rules (BOICR) to enforce a 
Company way of working together 
by using common working practices 
in line with the essential internal 
control standards. This proposes 
a set of operations, reporting and 
compliance control activities 
(including IT systems) that each 
entity should apply and comply with 
in the full extent of their capabilities.
 The Company has maintained a high 
level of Internal Control environment 
and documentation from Corporate 
to business level, central to which is 
the internally developed Internal 
Control Online Tool (“ICOT”), used to 
document and monitor the operation 
of key internal control procedures. 
The tool serves as a record of 
every instance of controls being 
performed and reviewed.
 The Internal Control function 
performs bi-monthly spot checks 
and one mid-year review on the 
operation of the key controls across 
the Group, achieving coverage 
across controls and divisions.
 In addition, an Internal Control 
Monthly Status Report to CEO and 
CFO was implemented early 2017 with 
the objective of reinforcing monitoring 
and reporting. The report provides 
the main KPIs and results of spot 
checks reviews as well as qualitative 
analysis for the main processes.

62 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 63 Internal Audit
There was no Internal Audit function 
in the Group during the year. During 
the review of financial position, 
prospects and procedures performed 
in the course of IPO pre-requisites, the 
Group contemplated the opportunity 
to implement an Internal audit 
function. It was decided to co-source 
this function led by an Internal Audit 
Director. This organization was 
selected in order to optimize costs, 
provide access to deep expertize 
and skilled resources on an as-
needed basis. In 2018, the Audit and 
Risk Committee intends to hire an 
Internal Audit Director and appoint a 
co-sourced firm. The objective of the 
Committee is to initiate a first cycle 
of review in order to define a rolling 
internal audit plan which will be 
approved during the year and will 
ensure an appropriate coverage 
of all audit units. 
External Auditor
The Audit and Risk Committee is 
responsible for overseeing the 
Group’s relationship with its 
external independent auditor, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. This 
includes the ongoing assessment of 
the auditors’ independence and the 
effectiveness of the external audit 
process, the results of which inform 
the Committee’s recommendation 
to the Board as to the auditors 
appointment (subject to shareholder 
approval) or otherwise.
Appointment and Tenure
The French firm of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers was first 
appointed as the external auditor of 
the Group in 2013. The UK firm was first 
appointed at the time of the IPO, so has 
just commenced its tenure and hence 
the UK firm was the first appointee 
to the audit of ContourGlobal plc. 
Matthew Hall is the current lead 
audit partner.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is required to 
rotate the lead audit partner every five 
years for a listed client. Therefore, a 
new lead audit partner is expected to 
be selected for the 2022 audit. 
The Committee intends to put the 
external audit out to tender at least 
every 10 years.
Non‑Audit Services
The engagement of the external 
audit firm to provide non-audit 
services to the Group can impact on 
the independence assessment, and 
the Group has therefore adopted a 
policy for the approval by the Audit 
and Risk Committee of any such 
non-audit services. The policy 
specifies prohibited services which 
cannot be carried out by the external 
auditor (generally activities that would 
involve the external auditor taking on 
management responsibility), and sets 
the framework within which non-audit 
services may be provided. All requests 
to utilize the external auditors for 
non-audit services must be reviewed 
by the Chief Financial Officer up to a 
trivial level and above a certain limit 
must be approved by the Audit and 
Risk Committee Chairman and above 
a further limit by Audit and Risk 
Committee. Details of all non-audit 
services approved by the Chief 
Financial Officer or Audit and Risk 
Committee Chairman are reported 
and ratified at the next meeting of 
the Audit and Risk Committee.
During the year ended 31st December 
2017, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
were engaged mainly to provide 
certain non-audit services in respect 
of the IPO. These included the 
preparation of reports on the 
Company’s Financial Position and 
Prospects, Working Capital and a 
report to the Company’s sponsors 
regarding the Company’s business 
and operations. In approving the use 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to 
provide these services, the Board took 
the view that PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP’s knowledge of the Company and 
its operations meant that it was best 
placed to provide the services, and 
was comfortable that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s 
independence would not be 
compromised. The fees paid to 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 
respect of non-audit services during 
the year totaled $6.7m, representing 
74% of the total auditors’ fees. $5.7m 
of the non-audit fees was for services 
in respect of the IPO. 
Having reviewed the auditor’s 
independence and performance 
the Audit and Risk Committee 
has recommended that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be 
re-appointed as the Company’s auditors 
at the next annual general meeting.
Whistleblowing
The Company maintains a web and 
telephone-based reporting hotline for 
employees and third parties to report 
potential violations of Company policy 
or the law, including related to matters 
of financial reporting or controls. The 
whistleblowing policy applies to all 
employees of the Group, and allows 
for anonymous reporting, where 
permitted by local law. 
The Audit and Risk Committee is 
responsible for monitoring the 
Group’s whistleblower policy, and the 
policy is reviewed periodically by the 
Board. The Audit and Risk Committee 
believes that the policy and its 
oversight are effective, facilitate 
the proportionate and independent 
investigation of reported matters, 
and allow appropriate remedial 
measures to be taken.
Annual Evaluation
As the Audit and Risk Committee has 
only been established for a short time 
with its current membership and 
responsibilities, a formal performance 
evaluation has not been conducted. It 
is intended that a performance 
evaluation will be conducted in 2018 
and reported on in the Company’s 
2018 Annual Report.
Fair, balanced and understandable
At the request of the Board, the Audit 
and Risk Committee has conducted a 
review of the Annual Report to assess 
whether it presents a fair, balanced 
and understandable view of the 
Company’s position and prospects. 
The Audit and Risk Committee’s 
review took account of the process by 
which the Annual Report is prepared 
which includes analysis of changes 
to applicable reporting requirements 
and standards, and a robust schedule 
of review and verification by senior 
management and external advisors 
to ensure disclosures are accurate. 
The Audit and Risk Committee is 
satisfied that the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business 
model and strategy and has advised 
the Board accordingly.

Annual Statement from the Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholder,
As the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, I am pleased to present our 
first Directors’ Remuneration Report as 
a listed company following the IPO on 
14th November 2017. This report sets out 
ContourGlobal plc’s remuneration policy 
for Directors from the date of incorporation 
of 26th September 2017. No remuneration 
was payable for the period from 
incorporation to 17th October 2017, the 
date the Company became part of the 
Group. This report therefore sets out the 
remuneration of the Executive Director 
from 17th October 2017 and remuneration 
for Non-Executive Directors from 23rd 
October 2017, the date of appointment, 
and how we intend to apply the policy 
in 2018.
The report is split into three sections: 
 ― This annual statement – this 
summarizes the key decisions 
made in respect of the remuneration 
of Directors in the period from 
incorporation to the date of this 
Directors’ Remuneration Report 
 ― Directors’ Remuneration Policy –  
this set outs the remuneration policy 
for the Executive Director, Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors. The 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy will 
be put to a binding shareholder 
vote at the forthcoming AGM and is 
consistent in its principles with that 
set out in the Admission Prospectus
 ― Annual Report on Remuneration –  
this sets out the remuneration 
received by Directors for the period 
from incorporation to 31st December 
2017 and how the policy will be 
applied in 2018. The Annual Report  
on Remuneration and this Chairman’s 
Statement will be subject to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the AGM
Key activities of the Committee
2017 was a year of significant transition 
for the Company in preparation for 
listing on the London Stock Exchange. 
In the lead up to the IPO, the Company 
carried out a detailed review of 
remuneration policy and of the 
executive and non-executive pay 
arrangements to ensure they were 
appropriate for a listed company. 
The Remuneration Policy has been 
designed to provide a competitive 
package of fixed and variable pay to 
ensure the Company can attract, retain 
and motivate executives with the right 
skills and experience to deliver the 
Company’s strategic goals and business 
objectives. In line with this objective, 
a significant proportion of executive 
remuneration is tied to Company 
performance through an annual bonus 
and Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). 
The Policy has also been developed 
taking into account the expectations of 
UK institutional shareholders, and 
includes several best practice features 
that ensure strong long-term alignment 
with shareholders. These include bonus 
deferral, a post-vesting LTIP holding 
period, and share ownership guidelines. 
The incentive plans also include 
recovery and withholding provisions 
to ensure no rewards for failure.
The Committee’s key activities to the 
date of this Directors’ Remuneration 
Report included:
 ― Agreement of the Committee’s 
terms of reference
 ― Adoption of formulation of the 
Company’s first Remuneration 
Policy as a listed company
 ― Determining the level of bonus 
payments in respect of the 2017 
financial year
 ― Determining the performance metrics 
and targets to apply to the 2018 
annual bonus
 ― Consideration of the performance 
metrics and targets to apply to the 
awards to be made in 2018 under the 
Company’s new LTIP
 ― Approving the Company’s first 
Directors’ Remuneration Report as 
a listed company
Performance and reward for the 2017 
financial year
The remuneration arrangements in 
place prior to the IPO were based on 
a very different structure to the one we 
have today. Our company was listed on 
the London Stock Exchange on 14th 
November 2017, so there has only been 
less than two months of “life as a public 
company” during 2017. Taking into account 
that the Company was operating as a 
privately owned business for most of 
2017, we honored the commitments of 
the Company to its employees during 
this year by applying the remuneration 
policies (including annual bonus) which 
existed before the Company was listed, 
with the exception of the CEO who 
agreed to accept a cap of 100% on his 
annual bonus in 2017. In this context, the 
President & CEO received an annual 
bonus of 75% of his base salary for 2017, 
recognizing the strong financial and 
operational performance of the Company 
and his personal performance over the 
year and he elected to have 20% of this 
deferred into shares (at the current 
market price on the date the bonus was 
agreed) to be held for two years.
Legacy equity arrangements
Certain members of management 
(including the President & CEO) held 
interests in a “Private Incentive Plan” 
(“PIP”) established by the majority 
shareholder in the Company prior to the 
IPO (ContourGlobal LP) in connection 
with its initial investment in the business. 
The number of shares ultimately 
receivable could be substantial and will 
depend on the performance of the 
Company’s share price. In addition, 
the Company understands that 
ContourGlobal LP may make further 
awards in 2018 under the PIP. 
The Company is not a party to the PIP. 
Nonetheless, any payment to a Director 
of the Company under the PIP will be 
disclosed as part of their remuneration 
and therefore our Remuneration Policy 
covers both the existing interests and 
any future awards to be made. 
Amendment to the LTIP
The Committee has decided that for any 
new Executive Director it is imperative 
that the Company has the ability to make 
normal annual awards at up to a market 
competitive level of 200% and therefore 
a change to the rules of the LTIP to 
increase the normal annual limit from 100% 
to 200% is being put to shareholders at 
the AGM on 25th May 2018 to enable the 
policy to be implemented. There is no 
current intention to increase the limit that 
will apply to the current President & CEO 
of 100% (as outlined in the Prospectus).
How the policy will be implemented 
for the 2018 financial year
The President & CEO’s salary will remain 
unchanged in 2018. 
His annual bonus opportunity will be 100% 
of salary, and measures and weightings 
will be based on a mix of Corporate and 
Personal objectives. Any bonus pay-out 
above the target bonus level will be 
deferred into shares to be held for 
two years.
An LTIP award of 100% of salary will be 
granted to the President & CEO in 2018, 
and will be subject to performance 
conditions (still to be finalized) to be 
satisfied over a three-year period to 
31st December 2020. A two-year 
holding period will apply to any vested 
share awards in line with the Policy.
Conclusion
The Remuneration Committee has spent 
considerable time in developing the 
executive remuneration policy to ensure 
a smooth transition following listing, and 
is keen to maintain an open and 
transparent dialogue with shareholders 
to understand their views on all matters, 
including on remuneration. I welcome 
any comments or feedback you may 
have either in the lead up to, or at, the 
AGM and throughout the year.
I hope that you find the information in 
this report helpful and I look forward to 
your support at the Company’s AGM.
Yours sincerely

Policy
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This part of the Remuneration Report 
sets out the Remuneration Policy for 
Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors. The Policy will be put to a 
binding shareholder vote at the AGM 
on 25th May 2018 and, subject to 
shareholder approval, will take formal 
effect from that date. It is intended 
that the Remuneration Policy will apply 
for three years following approval.
Key considerations when setting 
the Remuneration Policy
When setting the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, the Committee took into account 
the overall business strategy and 
long-term interests of the Company, 
with a view to attracting, retaining and 
motivating high quality individuals and 
delivering rewards to shareholders.
Consistent with these principles, 
the Committee has designed a 
Remuneration Policy which will:
 ― Attract, retain and motivate high 
quality executives in order to deliver 
the Company’s strategic goals and 
business objectives
 ― Align the interests of executives with 
those of shareholders and other 
external stakeholders
 ― Be simple and understandable, 
both internally and externally
 ― Have a significant proportion tied 
to the achievement of stretching 
performance conditions to ensure 
individuals are rewarded fairly for 
success, while ensuring prevention 
of rewards for failure
 ― Provide an appropriate balance 
between short- and long-term 
performance targets linked to the 
delivery of the Company’s strategic 
plan and aligned with the Company’s 
risk appetite
 ― Take account of good governance 
and promote the long-term success 
of the Group
 ― Consider the wider pay environment, 
both internally and externally
In seeking to achieve the above 
objectives, the Committee is mindful 
of the views of a broad range of 
stakeholders and accordingly takes 
account of a number of factors when 
setting remuneration, including market 
conditions, pay and employment 
conditions across the Group, the 
expectations of institutional 
shareholders and feedback from 
shareholders and other stakeholders.
Remuneration Policy table
The table below sets out, for each 
element of pay, a summary of how 
remuneration is structured and how 
it supports the Company’s strategy.
Executive Directors
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary
To help recruit and retain 
executives of suitable caliber to 
deliver the Company’s strategic 
goals and business outputs.
Reflects the individual’s 
experience, performance 
and responsibilities within 
the Company.
Salaries are normally reviewed 
annually with any changes taking 
effect from 1st January each year.
Salaries are set taking into 
consideration number of factors, 
including:
 ― Individual and Company 
performance
 ― Skills and experience of 
each individual
 ― Responsibilities and 
accountabilities of each role
 ― Mix of package of the 
individual
 ― Salary increases for the 
overall employee population
 ― Changes in size or complexity 
of the Company
 ― Market competitiveness
 ― External indicators, such 
as inflation
The Committee aims to set levels 
that are broadly aligned with 
equivalent roles at relevant peers 
and other companies of broadly 
comparable size and complexity, 
taking into account the country 
in which the Director is based 
where appropriate.
In considering any increase 
in base salary, if any increase 
is to be made the Committee 
is guided by the general 
increase for the broader 
employee population.
However, more significant 
increases may be awarded from 
time to time in certain 
circumstances. For example, an 
increase in the individual’s role 
or responsibility, an increase in 
the scale or complexity of the 
Company, or when an individual 
has been appointed to a new 
role at a below market salary 
while gaining experience.
Executive Director performance 
is a factor considered when 
determining salaries.

assurance and income protection.
Under certain circumstances, 
additional benefits in relation to 
relocation or expatriation may 
be provided.

introduced for the wider workforce 
on broadly similar terms.
Any reasonable business related 
expenses (including tax thereon) 
incurred in connection with the 
role may be reimbursed.
There is no formal maximum 
limit as benefit costs can

changes in provider cost 
and individual circumstances
Not performance related.
Pensions
To provide a market 
competitive pension package 
to assist with recruitment and 
retention of Executive Directors 
of suitable caliber.
The Company may make 
contributions, or payment in 
lieu of contributions, to a 
pension scheme.
The current President & CEO 
does not receive any pension 
contributions.
Up to 20% of base salary 
per annum. 
Not performance related.
Annual performance bonus
To incentivize and reward 
the achievement of annual 
strategic business priorities. 
Delivery of a proportion 
of remuneration in shares 
reinforces retention and 
provides alignment with 
the interests of shareholders 
over the longer-term.
Annual bonuses are subject 
to achievement of stretching 
performance conditions, which 
are set by the Committee at the 
start of each financial year. At the 
end of the year, the Committee 
determines the extent to which 
these were achieved.
Annual bonuses are payable 
in cash, with any bonus earned 
in excess of the target bonus 
deferred into shares which vest 
after at least two years subject 
to continued employment. 
Participants may also be entitled 
to receive dividend equivalents 
on share awards that vest.
Bonus payments, including 
deferred bonus awards, are 
subject to recovery and 
withholding provisions in certain 
circumstances, including in the 
event of a material misstatement 
of accounts, an error in assessing 
the performance condition, 
serious misconduct, or any other 
exceptional circumstances which 
the Committee considers justify 
the operation of the recovery and 
withholding provisions.
The maximum bonus opportunity 
is 100% of base salary with 50% 
of maximum payable for on-
target performance and 25% 
of maximum payable for threshold 
performance.
Performance is measured over 
the financial year. 
Performance measures and 
weightings are determined by 
the Committee each year and 
may vary to take into account 
changes in the business strategy.
At least 70% of the bonus will 
be subject to corporate 
objectives (such as EBITDA, 
cash flow, growth targets, Health 
& Safety and other corporate 
measures) with the balance 
being subject to measurable 
individual objectives.
The Committee may adjust the 
bonus outcome if it considers 
that the pay-out is inconsistent 
with the Company’s overall 
performance, taking into 
account any relevant factors. 
The Committee will consult 
with major shareholders if 
appropriate before any exercise 
of its discretion to increase the 
bonus outcome. 
In addition, the Committee has 
absolute discretion as to the 
amount of any bonus outcome, 
notwithstanding achievement of 
the measures applicable to the 
bonus, which may take into 
account the Company’s 
underlying performance.

Awards will normally be granted 
annually to Executive Directors in 
the form of conditional free shares 
or nil (or nominal) cost options 
that normally vest after three 
years subject to performance 
conditions and continued service. 
Following vesting, awards will 
normally be subject to a holding 
period whereby vested awards, 
net of tax, must be retained for 
at least a further two years.
Participants may also be entitled 
to receive dividend equivalents 
on awards that vest.
Awards are subject to recovery and 
withholding provisions in certain 
circumstances, including in the 
event of a material misstatement 
of accounts, an error in assessing 
the performance condition, 
serious misconduct, or any other 
exceptional circumstances which 
the Committee considers justify 
the operation of the recovery 
and withholding provisions.
The maximum award level is 
100% of base salary per annum.
No more than 25% of each 
performance element may vest 
for threshold performance.
Performance is normally 
measured over three years.
The performance metrics for the 
initial awards have not yet been 
finalized. The Committee has 
the flexibility to vary measures 
and weightings, including 
introduction of new measures, 
for each award taking into 
account business priorities at 
the time of grant. 
The Committee may reduce the 
vesting outcome if it considers 
that the level of vesting is 
inconsistent with the Company’s 
overall performance, taking into 
account any relevant factors.
Share ownership guidelines
To encourage Executive 
Directors to build a meaningful 
shareholding in the Company 
so as to further align interests 
with shareholders.
Executive Directors are required 
to retain at least half of any share 
awards vesting (net of tax) under 
the Company’s discretionary 
share based employee incentive 
schemes until the guideline is met.

Prior commitments and PIP
For the duration of this Policy, the Company will honor any commitments made in respect of current or former Directors 
before the date on which either: (i) the Directors’ remuneration policy becomes effective; or (ii) an individual becomes a 
Director, even where such commitments are not consistent with the policy set out in this report or prevailing at the time any 
such commitment is fulfilled. For the avoidance of doubt, all outstanding historical awards that were granted in connection 
with, or prior to, listing including those made by ContourGlobal LP under the PIP remain eligible to vest based on their 
original or modified terms. In addition, the Policy will cover any additional awards to be made by ContourGlobal LP 
under the PIP.
Performance measures and target setting
The Committee determines performance conditions for incentives that are appropriately challenging and tied to the delivery 
of key business objectives and the Company’s overall strategy. The Committee retains flexibility in the Policy on the specific 
measures used for each award to ensure alignment with the strategic priorities prevailing at the time they are set. 
Annual bonus measures are determined at the start of each financial year, based on the key business priorities for the 
year ahead. LTIP measures are determined at the time of grant of each award, and are selected to support the Company’s 
long-term strategy and align with the long-term goal to create value for shareholders. 
Targets for the annual bonus and LTIP are reviewed annually to ensure they remain sufficiently challenging but 
achievable, taking into account a range of internal and external reference points, including internal budgets and analyst 
consensus forecasts. 
Recovery and withholding provisions
Awards under the annual bonus, including deferred bonus awards, and the LTIP are subject to recovery and withholding 
provisions which permit the Committee, in its discretion, to reduce the size of any future bonus or share award granted to 
the employee, to reduce the size of any granted but unvested share award held by the employee, or to require the 
employee to make a cash payment to the Company. The circumstances in which the Company may apply the provisions 
include a material misstatement of accounts, an error in assessing the performance condition, serious misconduct on the 
part of a participant, or any other exceptional circumstances which the Committee considers justify the operation of the 
recovery and withholding provisions.
In respect of cash bonus payments, the recovery and withholding provisions apply for one year from the date of payment 
of the bonus (or, if later, the date of publication of the Company’s financial results for the year following the relevant year 
over which the bonus was earned).
In respect of deferred bonus awards, the provisions apply up until the third anniversary of the date on which the relevant 
award was granted, and in respect of any other awards under the LTIP, the provisions apply up until the third anniversary 
of the date on which the relevant award vests. 
Committee discretion
The Committee operates under the powers it has been delegated by the Board. In addition, it complies with rules that are 
either subject to shareholder approval (Long-Term Incentive Plan) or by approval from the Board (annual performance 
bonus scheme). These rules provide the Committee with certain discretions which serve to ensure that the 
implementation of the remuneration policy is fair, both to the individual Director and to the shareholders. The Committee 
also has discretions to vary the level of the various components of remuneration. The extent of such discretions is set out 
in the relevant rules, and the maximum opportunity or performance metrics section of the policy table above. To ensure 
the efficient administration of the variable incentive plans outlined above, the Committee will apply certain operational 
discretions.
These include the following:
 ― Selecting the participants in the plans on an annual basis
 ― Determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payments
 ― Determining the quantum of awards and/or payments (within the limits set out in the policy table above)
 ― Determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance
 ― Determining whether malus or clawback shall be applied to any award in the relevant circumstances and, if so, the 
extent to which it shall be applied
 ― Making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances, for instance for changes in capital structure
 ― Determining “good leaver” status for incentive plan purposes and applying the appropriate treatment
 ― Undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance measures and setting targets for the annual bonus plan and 
other incentive schemes, where applicable, from year to year
If an event occurs which results in the annual bonus plan or LTIP performance conditions and/or targets being deemed no 
longer appropriate (e.g. material acquisition or divestment), the Committee will have the ability to amend the performance 
conditions and/or targets, provided that the revised conditions are not materially less challenging that the original 
conditions. Any use of the above discretion would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.

Approach to recruitment or promotion 
The Committee’s approach when considering the remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a new Executive Director 
is to take account of the caliber, expertise and responsibilities of the individual, his or her remuneration package in their 
prior role, and market rates, without paying more than is necessary to facilitate their recruitment. The remuneration 
package for a new Executive Director will be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved remuneration 
policy in force at the time of appointment and the maximum limits set out therein subject to any variation in or additional 
elements as set out below:
Salary The Committee has the flexibility to set the salary of a new Executive Director at a discount to the 
market level initially, with a view to increasing it in phases over the following few years to bring the 
salary to the desired positioning, subject to individual performance. In exceptional circumstances, the 
Committee has the ability to set the salary of a new Executive Director at a rate higher than the market 
level to reflect the criticality of the role and the experience and performance of the individual.
Benefits The Company may award certain additional benefits and other allowances including, but not limited to, 
those to assist with relocation support, temporary living and transportation expenses, educational 
costs for children and tax equalization, to allow flexibility to secure the best candidate, including an 
overseas national.
Pension Any new Executive Director may be eligible to receive a pension or pension allowance, insurance and 
other benefit programs in line with local practice. 
Variable pay Maximum bonus and LTIP award opportunities for any new Executive Director shall, notwithstanding 
the maximum opportunities specified in the policy table above, be 150% of salary for bonus and 200% 
of salary for LTIP awards. Depending on the timing and responsibilities of the appointment, it may be 
necessary to set different performance measures and targets, and different vesting and/or holding 
periods, as applicable to other Executive Directors in the year of appointment. 
Replacement awards In addition to the above, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based awards in order 
to “buy-out” remuneration forfeited on leaving a former employer, where necessary to facilitate the 
recruitment of a new Executive Director. Any such payments would be limited to what is felt to be a fair 
estimate of the value of the remuneration foregone when leaving the former employer, and would be 
structured so as to be, to the extent practicable, no more generous in terms of fair value and other key 
terms than the awards it is replacing, including time to vesting and any performance conditions.
Internal appointments Remuneration will be set in line with the policy detailed above as amended by the additional 
provisions for external recruits. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their 
appointment in respect of their prior role, the Company will continue to honor these arrangements.
The terms of appointment for a Non-Executive Director will be in accordance with the remuneration policy for Non-
Executive Directors as set out in the policy table.
70 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 71 Service contracts and termination policy
In accordance with long-established policy, Executive Directors have rolling service agreements which may be terminated 
in accordance with the terms of these agreements. The period of notice for Executive Directors will not normally exceed 
12 months. Executive Directors’ service agreements are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours.
Generally, in the event of termination, the Directors’ service contracts provide for payments of base salary, pension and 
benefits over the notice period. The Company may elect to make a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) equivalent in value to 
basic salary, benefits and pension for any unexpired portion of the notice period. PILON payments may be made in 
monthly instalments or as a lump sum. The individual is expected to take reasonable steps to seek alternative income to 
mitigate the payments. 
Any outstanding incentive awards will be treated in accordance with the plan rules as follows: 
Plan Treatment on cessation
Cash annual bonus There is no contractual right to any bonus payment in the event of termination; however, the Committee 
may exercise its discretion to pay a bonus for the period of employment, based on performance 
assessed after the end of the financial year. Any bonus paid will normally be pro-rated for time.
Deferred bonus Any outstanding deferred bonus award will ordinarily vest in full on the normal vest date (or, in the case 
of death or in any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, at the date of cessation). 
However, if a participant ceases to be employed due to their dismissal for serious misconduct, the 
awards shall lapse.
LTIP The default treatment is for any outstanding LTIP award to lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, if a participant is deemed to be a “good leaver” in certain prescribed circumstances such as 
injury, disability, retirement, their employing Company or the business for which they work being sold 
out of the Group or other circumstances at the Committee’s discretion, their awards will ordinarily vest 
on the original vesting date to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied, and will 
normally be subject to time pro-rating for the proportion of the vesting period served.
Alternatively, the Committee may determine that awards for good leavers will vest early on cessation, 
subject to performance conditions measured at that time and ordinarily pro-rating for the proportion 
of the vesting period served. Such treatment shall apply in the case of death.
In the event of a Change of Control, awards will vest early subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions, and will normally be time pro-rated for the proportion of the vesting period served.
PIP Unvested shares will ordinarily be forfeited in the event of resignation prior to the relevant vesting date.

Joseph C. Brandt 14th November 2017 n/a 6 months either party
The President & CEO’s service contract states that, in certain circumstances, he is entitled to any cash annual bonus 
earned but unpaid in respect of the prior financial year, and he is also entitled to certain benefits for a period of up to 
six months following termination. His service contract also states that any PILON would be payable in a lump sum. 
The Company is unequivocally against rewards for failure; the circumstances of any departure, including the individual’s 
performance, would be taken into account in every case. Statutory redundancy payments may be made, as appropriate. 
Service agreements may be terminated summarily without notice (or on shorter notice periods) and without payment in 
lieu of notice in certain circumstances, such as gross misconduct or any other material breach of the obligations under 
their employment contract. The Company may require the individual to work during their notice period or may place 
them on garden leave during which they would be entitled to salary, benefits and pension only.
Any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination (including, at the 
discretion of the Committee, reimbursement for legal advice and provision of outplacement services) would be paid 
as necessary.
Policy on external appointments
The Board believes that it may be beneficial to the Group for executives to hold Non-Executive Directorships outside the 
Group. Any such appointments are subject to approval by the Board, and will be determined based on the impact on their 
role within the Company. The Board will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the Directors will be permitted to 
retain any fees arising from such appointments. The President & CEO currently does not hold any external directorships.
Non‑Executive Directors’ terms of engagement
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for a three-year term. In any event, each 
appointment is terminable by either party on one month’s written notice. All Non-Executive Directors are subject to 
annual re-election at each AGM. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are only entitled to fees accrued to the 
date of termination.
The dates of appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors serving at 31st December 2017 are summarized in the 
table below.

Directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business 
hours and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee receives regular updates throughout the year on pay and conditions applying to employees across the 
Company, and takes these into account when setting remuneration for Executive Directors. The Committee seeks to 
ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions on Executive Directors’ pay are consistent with 
those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken. In particular, the Committee takes into account the 
general base salary increase for the broader employee population when determining any annual salary increases and the 
remuneration packages for the Executive Directors.
While the Committee does not currently consult directly with employees regarding its policy for Directors, the Committee 
will consider the proposals being introduced as part of the FRC’s updated UK Corporate Governance Code in 2018 and 
will determine accordingly the best method of bringing the employee voice to the Boardroom.
The remuneration of senior managers below Board is reviewed by the Committee on an annual basis. The remuneration 
packages of these executives are broadly consistent with the policy outlined above, with selected senior managers 
eligible to participate in the LTIP, save that different bonus and LTIP opportunities may be applicable and performance 
measures may vary to ensure relevance to individuals. Bonus deferral will apply to the significant majority of senior 
managers but the two year holding period under the LTIP will not apply. Unlike Executive Directors, senior managers may 
receive awards of restricted shares without performance conditions. The remuneration of employees that are not senior 
managers generally include market based salary, benefits, and discretionary bonuses. 
Consideration of shareholders’ views 
The Committee is committed to open dialogue with shareholders and will seek to engage directly with them and their 
representative bodies when considering any material changes to remuneration arrangements. In addition, shareholder 
feedback received in relation to the AGM, as well as any additional feedback and guidance received during the year, will 
be considered by the Committee as it develops the Company’s remuneration framework and practices going forward. 
Assisted by its independent advisor, the Committee actively monitors developments in the expectations of institutional 
investors and their representative bodies. 
72 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 73 External advisors to the Committee
Material advice or services were provided to the Committee during the year by the following advisor who was appointed 
by the Committee. The advisor was selected based on the firm’s extensive knowledge of the Company and policies 
based on their work during the IPO process. The Remuneration Committee solicited a proposal from the advisor that 
was reviewed at the Committee and the Committee will review the objectiveness and independence of the advisor on 
an annual basis.
Advisor Area of advice/services provided
Remuneration Consultants – Aon Independent remuneration consultants to the Committee. Provisions of advice on all aspects 
of executive remuneration including development of remuneration policy, design and 
implementation of incentive plans, guidance on performance metrics and targets, benchmarking 
exercises, and updates on developments in best practice and market practice. Aon advised the 
Company on remuneration-related matters in advance of the Listing and received fees of 
£141,000 in respect of this advice.
Aon does not have any other connection with the Group and therefore the Committee is satisfied 
that they provide objective and independent advice. Aon is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and is a signatory to its voluntary Code of Conduct, which requires its advice 
to be objective and independent.

2017 Annual Bonus
In 2017 there was no approved Remuneration Policy for a public company in place. Bonus targets were set in the manner 
that had applied historically in the Company. The targets applying to the annual bonus for the year ended 31st December 
2017 related to the Company’s growth and key operational and financial metrics including Adjusted EBITDA performance. 
As these were set in the context of the Company being a privately owned company and being unlisted for the vast 
majority of the financial year the full details of the actual targets are not disclosed.
For the President & CEO, the bonus opportunity depended on achievement of corporate objectives (70%) and individual 
objectives (30%) as set out in the following table together with the result achieved.

Introduction 
This section sets out details of the 
remuneration of the Executive Director 
and Non-Executive Directors (including 
the Chairman) earned between 26th 
September 2017 and 31st December 
2017 and also describes the operation 
of the Remuneration Committee. The 
Annual Report on Remuneration will, 
together with the Annual Statement of 
the Remuneration Committee 
Chairman on page 65, be proposed 
for an advisory vote by shareholders 
at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) to be held on 25th May 
2018. Where required, data has been 
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP and this is indicated where 
appropriate. In preparing this report, 
consideration has been given to any 
legal requirements, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the UK Listing 
Rules, and the GC100 and Investor 
Group Directors’ Remuneration 
Reporting Guidance.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee’s 
responsibilities are set out in its 
Terms of Reference which are 
available to shareholders on 
request from the Company Secretary 
and on the Company’s website  
(www.ContourGlobal.com). Its 
role includes:
 ― Setting the remuneration policy for 
all Executive Directors and Senior 
Management of the Company, and 
the Chairman of the Board, including 
pension rights and any compensation 
payments and their cost, and 
recommending and monitoring the 
level and structure of remuneration 
of the Senior Management
 ― Within the terms of the agreed 
remuneration policy and in 
consultation with the Chairman of 
the Board and/or Chief Executive, as 
appropriate, determine the total 
individual remuneration package of 
each Executive Director and the 
Chairman of the Board and other 
senior management including 
bonuses, incentive payments and 
share option or other share awards
 ― Approve the design of, and 
determine targets for, any 
performance related pay schemes 
operated by the Company, review 
performance against such targets 
and approve total annual payments 
made under such schemes
 ― Ensure that contractual terms on 
termination, and any payments 
made, are fair for the individual, and 
the Company, that failure is not 
rewarded and that the duty to 
mitigate loss is fully recognized
In carrying out its duties the 
Remuneration Committee takes into 
account any legal requirements, the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and 
UK Listing Rules. Determining the fees 
of the Non-Executive Directors is a 
matter for the Board as a whole on the 
recommendation of the Chairman and 
President & CEO.
Annual Report  
on Remuneration
74 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 75 The Committee determined that the corporate targets were all met or exceeded, with outstanding performance on safety. 
On individual performance, successful delivery of the IPO was a key outcome. Overall, the Committee determined that the 
President & CEO’s bonus for 2017 was 75% of his salary.
At the request of the President & CEO and taking into account the introduction of bonus deferral in the new policy being 
adopted, a bonus of $720,000 was payable in cash and the balance of $180,000 was deferred into shares for two years.
In the future, bonuses will be set in line with the approved Remuneration Policy in place at that time, and details of 
measures, weightings, targets and performance achieved against the targets will be disclosed retrospectively in the 
following year’s Annual Report on Remuneration to the extent that they are no longer commercially sensitive.
Long‑term incentive awards with performance periods ending in the year (audited information)
There were no long-term incentive awards capable of vesting in relation to performance in the year.
Long‑term incentive awards granted in 2017 (audited information)
There were no awards granted under the LTIP during FY2017. The first awards under the new LTIP will be made during 
FY2018. 
Percentage change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer
As the Company listed and was incorporated during 2017, there is no disclosure of remuneration relating to prior years. 
Accordingly, this Report does not set out the percentage change in remuneration between 2016 and 2017. Full disclosure 
of the year on year change will be provided in future remuneration reports.
Comparison of overall performance and pay
The chart below shows the Company’s Total Shareholder Return performance compared with that of the FTSE 250 over 
the period from the date of the Company’s admission onto the London Stock Exchange to 31st December 2017. The FTSE 
250 Index has been chosen as an appropriate comparator as it is the index of which the Company is a constituent and as 
the Company currently falls within this index by market capitalization. TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained 
from holding a company’s shares over a period. It includes dividends paid, the change in capital value of the shares and 
any other payments made to or by shareholders within the period.

The operation of the annual bonus for 2018 will be consistent with the framework detailed in the policy section of this 
report. The maximum opportunity for the year ending 31st December 2018 will be 100% of salary for the President & CEO. 
Awards will be based 70% on a number of corporate objectives (adjusted EBITDA, Funds from Operations, Growth, 
Operational excellence and Health & Safety), and 30% on personal objectives. 
Target levels have been set to be challenging relative to the 2018 business plan. Specific targets are deemed to be 
commercially sensitive at this time. However, the Committee intends to disclose these retrospectively in next year’s 
Remuneration Report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive. 
In line with the Policy, any bonus earned above the target bonus level (50% of salary) will be deferred in shares vesting 
after two years. Recovery and withholding provisions will apply to cash and deferred bonus awards in certain 
circumstances, including in the event of a material misstatement of accounts, an error in assessing the performance 
condition, or serious misconduct.
LTIP
The operation of the LTIP for 2018 will be consistent with the framework detailed in the policy section of this report. 
The award to the President & CEO in 2018 will be 100% of salary. Vesting of the award will be subject to performance 
achieved over a three-year period from 1st January 2018 to 31st December 2020, based on terms and performance 
conditions to be determined. These will be disclosed when awards are made. 
The award vests after three years, with any vested awards subject to a further two-year holding period during which the 
post-tax number of shares cannot be sold. In line with the Policy, recovery and withholding provisions will apply to awards 
in certain circumstances, including in the event of a material misstatement of accounts, an error in assessing the 
performance condition, or serious misconduct.

there is no historical voting to disclose on the Company’s Executive remuneration. Details of the 2018 AGM voting results 
on the Policy and on the Annual Report on Remuneration will be disclosed in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee will engage with the Company’s major investors concerning the Company’s

dividends payable at the first bi-annual 
distribution, and two thirds payable at 
the second bi-annual distribution. The

Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities in relation 
to the Annual Report and 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law 
the Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The 
Financial Reporting Standard applicable 
in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, and 
applicable law). Under Company law 
the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and Parent Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group and Parent 
Company for that period. In preparing 
the financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 ― Select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently
 ― State whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union 
have been followed for the Group 
financial statements and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 102, have been 
followed for the Company financial 
statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements

keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group and Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and 
Parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and Parent Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
Parent Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of

Report on the audit of the Group financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, ContourGlobal plc’s Group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 ― Give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31st December 2017 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
 ― Have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 ― Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the consolidated 
statement of financial position as at 31st December 2017; the consolidated statement of income and other comprehensive income, 
the consolidated statement of cash flows, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and non-controlling interests for the year 
then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group.
Other than those disclosed in note 4.32 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group in the 
period from 1st January 2017 to 31th December 2017.
Our audit approach
Context
These are the first financial statements of the Group since the completion of the initial public offering of shares on the Main Market of 
the London Stock Exchange on 14th November 2017. While the Company was newly incorporated during the year on 26th September 
2017, the Group consolidated financial statements are prepared on a predecessor basis for the full year from 1st January 2017 to 
31st December 2017. This is explained in more detail in note 1 to the financial statements. 
Overview
Key audit
matters
Audit scope
Materiality
 ― Overall Group materiality: $12.5 million based on 2.5% of Adjusted EBITDA as defined in note 4.1 
to the financial statements
 ― We conducted our audit work over 14 components located in 14 countries
 ― We visited component auditors in four locations, covering all of the financially significant components, 
and one further component
 ― 10 components were subject to an audit of their complete financial information due to their size
 ― Specific audit procedures were performed on certain balances and transactions in respect of 
four components
The key audit matters are:
 ― Accounting for power purchase agreements – year of acquisition or renegotiation
 ― Accounting for business combinations – valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
 ― Risk of fraud in revenue recognition
 ― Impairment of property, plant and equipment and financial assets
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgments, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, 
and considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. We designed 
audit procedures to respond to the risk, recognizing that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher 
than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or 
intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We designed audit procedures that focused on the risk of non-compliance 
related to UK Company law as applicable to the financial statements. Our tests included discussions with legal counsel, reviewing 
disclosures in the financial statements against the specific legal requirements and involving technical experts to help us assess the 
compliance of disclosures against relevant legislation, for example within the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Corporate 
Governance Report. We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of 
our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting for power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) – 
year of acquisition or renegotiation (notes 2.3, 2.4 and 3.2)
The Group’s power plants sell their output under PPAs and other 
long-term arrangements.
Accounting for acquisitions and/or the renegotiation of PPAs 
is complex with a number of judgments required to assess the 
accounting standards applicable to each agreement. These 
include whether the arrangement contains a lease under IFRIC 4 
“Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease” or 
constitutes a service concession to be accounted for under 
IFRIC 12 “Service concession arrangements”. Once the basis of 
accounting has been initially determined, this does not change 
over time.
For those arrangements determined to be or to contain a lease, 
further judgment is required to determine whether the 
arrangement is a finance or operating lease. Lease classification 
is assessed at the inception of the lease and is primarily 
determined on the substance of the PPA and on the nature of 
the assets being leased, including an evaluation of where the 
substantial risks and rewards of ownership reside.
These judgments impact the measurement and classification of 
assets, the basis for revenue recognition under the PPA, and the 
related disclosures in the financial statements.
During the year, the Group acquired the shares of new asset 
portfolios in Brazil and Italy for consideration of $182.4 million 
and $11.4 million respectively. No PPAs were renegotiated during 
the year.
We have evaluated management’s assessment of the PPAs for 
the acquired plants in Brazil and Italy. In one case, such features 
as the arrangement containing a public service obligation, the 
offtaker regulating the prices, and the residual interest to be 
transferred to the offtaker at an agreed value at the end of the 
PPA period led management to reach the conclusion that the 
arrangement should be accounted for under IFRIC 12. We 
concurred with this conclusion.
In another case, management reached the conclusion the 
arrangement should be accounted for as a finance lease under 
IFRIC 4 because of features such as the offtaker having the 
ability to access and control the asset and there is no possibility 
to sell the electricity generated outside of the contract. We 
concurred with this conclusion.
Based on assessment of the PPAs, we evaluated the accounting 
for revenue recognition and determined this to be reasonable. 
We also evaluated the classification of assets acquired on the 
balance sheet and found the classification to be appropriate.
From our review of the new PPAs in the year and other audit 
evidence obtained, we found that the judgments made in 
determining the appropriate accounting framework for the 
PPAs were reasonable, and the associated measurement 
and classification of related balances and disclosures in the 
financial statements were consistent with the requirements 
of the relevant accounting standards.
Accounting for business combinations – valuation of assets 
acquired/liabilities assumed (notes 2.3, 2.4, 4.5, 4.10, 4.11, 4.25)
As discussed above, the Group acquired new power plant 
portfolios in Brazil and Italy during the year. Accounting for 
acquisitions can be complex, with judgment required in both the 
identification of assets acquired, including any intangible assets, 
and the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in 
accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”.
The calculation of fair value is subjective due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in the valuation of assets and liabilities, and 
this requires the application of judgment by management and 
technical expertize. In particular the method of valuation, future 
forecasts and underlying assumptions all have a material impact 
on the valuation of assets and liabilities, including the value of 
property, plant and equipment which typically represents the 
most significant asset acquired.
Under IFRS 3, an intangible asset must be recognized on 
an acquisition where it arises from contractual or legal rights 
acquired and is separable from the business. Due to the complex 
nature of the acquisition agreements and related power purchase 
agreements there is often judgment in determining the legal and 
contractual rights associated with the PPA and therefore there is 
a risk that intangible assets acquired may not be recognized.
In addition to reading the PPAs, we read the sale and purchase 
agreements (“SPAs”) associated with the acquisitions in Brazil and 
Italy, and performed audit procedures over both the identification 
of assets acquired (including any potential intangible assets) and 
the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
We involved our specialists in our audit of the valuation of assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. Our work included assessment of 
the appropriateness of the valuation models used, assessment 
of the discount rate used in the models, and the evaluation of 
future cash flow forecasts for each of the power plants acquired. 
The discount rate was assessed by reference to comparable assets.
We considered the completeness of the intangible assets 
identified by management with reference to the specific legal 
and contractual rights associated with the SPAs.
From our review and assessment of the SPAs, and audit 
procedures performed over the valuation of assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed, we found that the judgments made 
surrounding the identification of assets and liabilities acquired 
were appropriate, and that estimates used in the valuation of 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were reasonable.
86 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 87 How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of multiple reporting components, comprising the Group’s operating locations 
(including operating and related financing entities) and other centralized functions.
The Group’s reporting components vary significantly in size and we identified ten components that, in our view, required an audit of 
their complete financial information due to specific risk criteria and/or their size and contribution to the Group. Specific risk based 
audit procedures were performed at four further reporting components, based on the contribution of each to specific financial 
statement line items.
Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit 
work at those entities to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been obtained as a basis for our opinion on 
the Group financial statements as a whole. The Group engagement team visited the three largest components and one further full 
scope component in the year. These visits involved discussing the audit approach and any issues arising from our work, as well as 
meeting local management. We also reviewed the component team’s audit working papers. For all components we received detailed 
reporting on the findings of their audit work and held a number of calls with the component teams before, during and after the 
completion of their work. 
The Group consolidation, including the consolidated financial statement disclosures, and certain centrally managed entities were 
audited at the head office by the Group audit engagement team.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality $12.5 million
How we determined it 2.5% of Adjusted EBITDA as defined in note 4.1 to the financial statements
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
We applied Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in note 4.1 to the financial statements) as the benchmark 
for materiality and we consider that this is the key profit based measure used by management in 
both assessing the performance of the business and reporting performance of the business to 
stakeholders. Management use this measure as it allows the underlying profitability of the Group’s 
core business activities to be assessed year on year as it eliminates balances related to the initial 
acquisition of assets (which are not directly related to ongoing performance of the assets) and 
certain other items which give rise to fluctuations in results which are not directly linked to the 
performance of the asset (for example IPO costs)
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The 
range of materiality allocated across components was between $2.5 million and $9.0 million. Certain components were audited to 
a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $500,000 as 
well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect of the 
Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the Directors’ 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern over 
a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all 
future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to going concern in accordance with 
Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition (notes 2.3, 2.4 and 4.2)
In addition to the judgments set out above regarding the basis of 
accounting for revenues under the different PPA arrangements, 
there is a risk that revenues recognized in the financial period 
may be misstated due to fraud or error.
The majority of revenues earned are from power sales 
comprising both capacity payments and energy payments. 
These are calculated based on predetermined criteria set out in 
the PPAs, which typically include fixed contracted capacities as 
well as contracted prices. Amounts are billed on a regular basis 
and typically collected during the following month. These revenues 
are not considered to give rise to heightened risk as there is 
little judgment involved in the calculation of these revenues.
However, in some PPAs a portion of revenue is inherently 
more judgmental, for example capacity payments in relation to 
certain renewable plants, and may include specific performance 
obligations set out in the PPA such as minimum supply agreements. 
The failure to meet these obligations could give rise to a 
reduction in revenues earned under the PPA.
We examined the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting 
policies surrounding revenue recognition and we assessed the 
consistency of the application of the revenue recognition policy 
across all operating locations in scope for the Group audit.
In order to test the accuracy and occurrence of revenue from 
power sales, we obtained the periodic invoices for capacity 
and energy payments for each component and traced these to 
subsequent cash collected. For the largest component (which 
represents approximately 30% of Group revenue), we also 
reperformed the calculation of revenue based on the formulae 
set out in the contract.
We also tested accounts receivable by agreeing balances 
through to post-year end cash receipts.
In respect of renewables plants where PPAs include revenues 
linked to uncertain future performance obligations (for example 
capacity payments which are dependent on future weather), we 
have tested revenue to ensure that revenues are not recognized 
where these remain contingent on future performance obligations 
which are outside management’s control.
We also tested journal entries posted to revenue accounts to 
identify any unusual or irregular items.
Based on the work performed we found that the application of 
revenue policies was consistent, the basis for recognition was 
appropriate, and judgments made in respect of PPAs containing 
uncertain future performance obligations were reasonable.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
financial assets (notes 2.3, 2.4, 4.11 and 4.12)
The Group has $2.35 billion of property, plant and equipment, 
the majority of which relates to power plant assets, and $0.62 
billion of financial assets, the majority of which relate to 
concession arrangements.
Impairment assessments of these assets requires significant 
judgment and there is the risk that potential impairment triggers 
may not be identified by management and, in the event that 
there is an impairment trigger there is a risk that the calculation 
of the recoverable amount of the asset is incorrect and therefore 
the valuation of the assets may be misstated.
In the event that an impairment trigger is identified, the 
recoverable value of assets is assessed by either a value in use 
calculation (which is based on future cash flow forecasts and 
related valuation assumptions), or by reference to expected sale 
proceeds less costs to sell (where a decision has been taken to 
sell the related asset). Forecasts and assumptions used in value 
in use calculations are inherently judgmental and therefore 
typically give rise to increased risk of misstatement.
Impairment indicators were identified in the current year for the 
Brazilian wind and hydro power plants following operational 
performance issues. These were tested for impairment using 
value in use calculations and no impairments in the underlying 
assets’ carrying value were identified. Separately, the Kramatorsk 
(Ukraine) power plant was subject to sale and, when compared 
to the share purchase agreement, an impairment in the asset 
carrying value of $3.3 million was required and has been 
recognized in the financial statements. There was no significant 
judgment involved in calculation of this impairment as the sale 
proceeds and costs to sell have been agreed with the acquirer 
prior to year end.
With regard to the overall impairment assessment performed, we 
evaluated the completeness of the impairment triggers identified 
by management by reviewing performance data by power plant, 
considering significant variances in performance against 
forecasts, and from meetings with operational management to 
discuss individual plant performance. No impairment triggers 
other than those already noted by management were identified 
from our assessment.
We assessed the value in use calculations prepared by 
management for the Brazilian wind and hydro power plants.
We used PwC valuation specialists to assess the discount rate 
used in the valuation. We benchmarked this to comparable 
assets and considered the underlying assumptions based 
on our knowledge of the Group and its industry.
We assessed the accuracy of management’s forecasting by 
reference to the accuracy of historical forecasts compared to 
actual cash flows. We also validated key assumptions related 
to future capacity by reference to resource forecasts specific 
to wind and hydro assets.
We tested management’s sensitivity analysis to ensure 
appropriate judgment had been applied.
Based on our audit procedures performed we found the 
methodology and assumptions used in the calculation of value 
in use for the Brazilian wind and hydro power plants were 
reasonable, and that the impairment recorded in respect of the 
Kramatorsk power plant was appropriate and consistent with the 
subsequent proceeds received for this asset less costs to sell.
We also reviewed the disclosures around the impairment 
assessments performed, and were satisfied with the nature 
and extent of commentary provided.

88 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 89 Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31st December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
 ― The Directors’ confirmation on page 47 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity
 ― The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated
 ― The Directors’ explanation on page 47 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); 
and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group its environment 
obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:
 ― The statement given by the Directors, on page 83, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group obtained in the course of performing our audit
 ― The section of the Annual Report on page 62 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee
 ― The Directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 83, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

ContourGlobal plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by and adopted for use by 
the European Union (EU), IFRS Interpretation Committee 
(IFRS IC) interpretations and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on the going concern basis under the 
historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of 
financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of the IFRS financial statements requires 
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the 
consolidated financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. 
Although these estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results 
may differ from those estimates, as noted in the critical 
accounting estimates and judgments in note 2.4.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements are set out in note 
2.3. These policies have been consistently applied to the 
periods presented, unless otherwise stated. The financial 
information presented is at and for the financial years 
ended 31st December 2017 and 31st December 2016. 
Financial year ends have been referred to as 
31st December throughout the consolidated financial 
statements as per the accounting reference date of 
ContourGlobal plc. Financial years are referred to as 2017 
and 2016 in these consolidated financial statements.
On 17th October 2017, the Company obtained control of the 
entire share capital of ContourGlobal Worldwide Holdings 
S.à.r.l. from ContourGlobal L.P. via a share-for-share 
exchange. The principal operating subsidiary undertakings 
of the Group are owned directly or indirectly by 
ContourGlobal Worldwide Holdings S.à.r.l. There were no 
changes in rights or proportion of control exercised as a 
result of this transaction. Although the share-for-share 
exchange resulted in a change of legal ownership, this was 
a common control transaction and therefore outside the 
scope of IFRS 3. In substance, these financial statements 
reflect the continuation of the pre-existing Group and the 
financial statements have been prepared by applying the 
principles of predecessor accounting. As a result, and 
because the Company was incorporated in 2017, the 
comparatives presented in these financial statements are 
the consolidated results of ContourGlobal Worldwide 
Holdings S.à.r.l. In each period, the financial statements 
have been prepared by applying the principles underlying 
the consolidation procedures of IFRS 10 “Consolidated 
Financial Statements” (“IFRS 10”).
The prior year balance sheet reflects the constituent parts 
of equity required to be separately disclosed under IAS 1, 
based upon the consolidated position prior to the capital 
reorganization, and Non-Controlling Interests. As it is not 
meaningful to show the share capital for the predecessor 
Group, the remaining equity of the predecessor Group is 
represented by the cumulative investment of ContourGlobal 
L.P. in the Group (shown as “Invested Capital”). The current 
period balance sheet presents the legal change in ownership 
of the Group, including the share capital of the Company 
and the capital reorganization described in note 4.22. The 
revised capital structure is also presented in the current 
period statement of changes in equity, which reflects the 
share for share exchange, capital reduction and cancellation 
of deferred shares that occurred during the year. 
As the capital reorganization occurred in 2017, it is not 
meaningful to measure earnings per share based on the 
invested capital of the predecessor Group. In order to 
comply with the requirements of IAS 33 “Earnings per 
Share” however, a proforma calculation of earnings per 
share as at 31st December 2016 has been disclosed, using 
the weighted average number of shares in issue at 
31st December 2017 (note 4.9).
The financial information is prepared in accordance with IFRS 
under the historical cost convention, as modified for the 
revaluation of certain financial instruments. The financial 
information is presented in millions of US dollars, with one 
decimal. Thus numbers may not sum precisely due to rounding.
2.  Summary of significant 
accounting policies
2.1  Application of new and revised International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
No new standards were applied for the first time from 
1st January 2017. There were only a few amendments of 
standards applying mandatorily to periods beginning 
in 2017:
 ― Amendments to IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”
The adoption of IAS7 amendment has resulted in additional 
disclosures as included on note 4.23.
 ― Amendments to IAS 12 “Income Tax”– Recognition of 
Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses
These amendments clarify how an entity should evaluate 
whether there will be sufficient taxable profits against 
which it can utilize a deductible temporary difference. The 
Group already assesses the sufficiency of future taxable 
profits in a manner consistent with these amendments and 
hence the adoption of this amendment has had no impact.
2.2  New standards and interpretations not yet 
mandatorily applicable
The Group has not applied early the following standards 
and interpretations that could impact the Group and of 
which application was not mandatory at 1st January 2017:
 ― IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
 ― IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
 ― IFRS 16 “Leases”
 ― IFRIC 22 “Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance 
Consideration”
 ― IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over income tax treatments”.
Among the above mentioned standards, the following might affect the ContourGlobal’s future consolidated financial information:
Standard/Interpretation 
(application date for the Group) Description
IFRS 9 
Financial instruments 
(1st January 2018) 
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments IFRS 9 is effective from 1st January 2018. In summary, it has an impact on three areas:
−  Classification and measurement – the rules based approach of IAS 39 is replaced by a principles based 
approach with refers to the asset’s cash flow characteristics and the business model in which it is held.
− Impairment of financial assets – this moves to a more forward looking expected loss model.
−  Hedge accounting – the changes align the accounting treatment with the Company’s risk management 
activities. As a result of the adoption of this standard, the measurement basis for most of the Group’s 
financial assets is unchanged, although the classification and corresponding disclosures of financial 
assets in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts will be impacted. The changes to impairment and 
hedge accounting are not expected to have a material impact on the results of the Group. 
IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts  
with Customers 
(1st January 2018)
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and clarifications. The Group will adopt IFRS 15, Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers, from 1st January 2018. IFRS 15 introduces a five-step model to be applied to all 
contracts with customers. In addition a number of new disclosures will be required. When IFRS 15 is adopted in 
2018, the Group will use the modified retrospective approach. T o determine the impact of IFRS 15 on the Group, 
management grouped power purchase agreements with similar contractual terms, and performed a detailed 
revenue accounting assessment for each Group. This exercise identified the following main impacts for the 
Group as being:
i) An increase in revenue from grossing up certain costs that are currently being netted down, 
which will result in higher revenue and a corresponding increase in cost of sales.
ii) An additional performance obligation being identified for service concession contracts.
iii) A minor modification to a contract in Maritsa that will be recognized prospectively. 
The impact of IFRS 15 on revenue in 2018 is expected to be an increase of between $14m and $20m, the vast 
majority of which is driven by the grossing up of certain costs on the Arrubal contract in Spain, for which costs 
will be grossed up for the same amount. IFRS 15 is not expected to have a material impact on the profitability 
(adjusted EBITDA, income from operations or profit before tax) of the Group.
IFRS 16 
Leases 
(1st January 2019)
This standard relates to the accounting for leases and will be compulsory applicable from 1st January 2019. 
This standard will mainly change the lease accounting for lessees with the recognition of an asset and a 
liability which represents the right of use granted by the lessor.
ContourGlobal is still assessing the impacts where it acts as lessee or lessor.
IFRIC 22 
Foreign currency transactions  
and advance consideration  
(1st January 2018)
This standard relates to purchase or sale transactions that must be translated at the exchange rate prevailing 
on the date the asset or liability is initially recognized. In practice, this is usually the date on which the advance 
payment is paid or received. In the case of multiple advances, the exchange rate must be determined for 
each payment and collection transaction.
The interpretation is mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1st January 2018, subject to its 
adoption by the European Union. Its implementation is not expected to have a significant impact on the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 23 
Uncertainty over  
income tax treatments 
(1st January 2019)
This standard clarifies the recognition and valuation principles applicable to income tax risks. These risks arise 
when there is uncertainty related to a tax position adopted by the Group that could be challenged by the tax 
administration. This interpretation is applicable for financial years beginning on 1st January 2019, subject to 
its adoption by the European Union and subject to retrospective application, with or without comparative 
information restatement for the first year of application. ContourGlobal is still assessing the impacts.
2.3  Summary of significant accounting policies
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include both the assets and liabilities, and the results and cash flows, of the Group and its 
subsidiaries and the Group’s share of the results and the Group’s investments in associates. 
Inter-company transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated.
(a) Subsidiaries
Entities over which the Group has the power to direct the relevant activities so as to affect the returns to the Group, generally 
through control over the financial and operating policies, are accounted for as subsidiaries. Interests acquired in entities are 
consolidated from the date the Group acquires control.
(b) Associates
Where the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence over entities, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% 
and 50% of the voting rights, they are accounted for as associates. The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated 
into the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The Group’s investment in associates includes 
goodwill identified on acquisition. 
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If there 
is evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the investment in the 
associate and its carrying value and recognizes this amount in “share of profit of associates” in the consolidated statement of income.
96 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 97  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Energy payments under PPAs are recognized in revenue in all cases as the contracted output is delivered.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s 
net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Acquisition related items
Acquisition related items include notably pre-acquisition costs such as various professional fees and due diligence costs, earn-outs 
and other related incremental costs incurred as part of completed or contemplated acquisitions.
Finance income and finance costs
Finance income primarily consists of interest income on funds invested. Finance costs primarily comprise interest expense on 
borrowings, unwinding of the discount/step up on financial assets and provisions, interests and penalties that arise from late payments 
of suppliers or taxes, swap margin calls, bank charges, changes in fair value of the debt payable to non-controlling interests in our 
Bulgarian power plant, changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and unrealized and realized 
foreign exchange gains and losses.
Property, plant and equipment
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less depreciation, or at fair value if acquired in the context of a business 
combination. Historical cost includes an initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on 
which it is located, when the entity has a present legal or constructive obligation to do so.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is carried at the lower of market value and the present value of the 
related minimum lease payments. 
Costs relating to major inspections and overhauls are capitalized. Minor replacements, repairs and maintenance, including planned 
outages to our power plants that do not improve the efficiency or extend the life of the respective asset, are expensed as incurred. 
The Group capitalizes certain direct preconstruction costs associated with its power plant project development activities when it has 
been determined that it is more likely than not that the opportunity will result in an operating asset. Factors considered in this 
determination include: (i) the availability of adequate funding; (ii) the Group is likely to be awarded with the project or the barriers 
are not likely to prohibit closing the project: and (iii) there is an available market and the regulatory, environmental and infrastructure 
requirements are likely to be met. Capitalized costs include initial engineering, environmental and technical feasibility studies, legal 
costs, permitting and licensing and direct internal staff salary and travel costs, among others. Capitalized costs are charged to 
expense if a project is abandoned or if the conditions stated above are not met. Construction work in progress (“CWIP”) assets are 
transferred out of CWIP when construction is substantially completed and the power plant achieves its commercial operations date 
(“COD”), at which point depreciation commences. 
Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
Useful lives as of 
31st December  
2016 and 2017
Generating plants and equipment
Lignite, coal, gas, oil, biomass power plants 12 to 40 years
Hydro plants and equipment 25 to 75 years
Wind farms 16 to 25 years
Tri and quad-generation combined heat power plants 15 years
Solar plants 14 to 22 years
Other property, plant and equipment 3 to 10 years
The range of useful lives is due to the diversity of the assets in each category. 
The asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least annually and if expectations differ from previous estimates.
Intangible assets and goodwill
Goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units 
(“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or Group represents the 
lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
The reporting units (which generally correspond to power plants) or group of reporting units have been identified as its cash-generating units.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken at least annually.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets include licenses and permits when specific rights and contracts are acquired. Intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. When the power plant achieves its commercial operations date, the 
related intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the PPA, generally over 20 years (excluding 
software). Software is amortized over three years. A different amortization method may be used if it better reflects the pattern of 
economic benefits derived from the asset over time.
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Business combinations
The acquisition consideration is measured at fair value which is the aggregate of the fair values of the assets transferred, the 
liabilities incurred or assumed and the equity interests in exchange for control. The consideration transferred includes the fair value 
of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the 
Group is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are 
recognized in the statement of income. Where the consideration transferred, together with the non-controlling interest, exceeds the 
fair value of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the excess is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition related 
costs are expensed as incurred and classified as “Acquisition related items” in the consolidated statement of income.
Goodwill is capitalized as a separate item in the case of subsidiaries and as part of the cost of investment in the case of associates. 
Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the operation acquired.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a gain or loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – 
that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and 
the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Functional and presentation currency and currency translation 
The assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into US dollars, the Group’s presentation currency, at the year-end 
exchange rates. The results of foreign undertakings are translated into US dollars at the relevant average rates of exchange for the 
year. Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognized directly in the currency translation reserve.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and from the translation of monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized at period end exchange rates in the statement of income 
line which most appropriately reflects the nature of the item or transaction. 
The following table summarizes the main exchange rates used for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of ContourGlobal:
Closing rates Average rates
Year ended  
31st December
Year ended  
31st December
Currency 2017 2016 2017 2016
EUR/USD 1.2005 1.0517 1.1299 1.1070
BRL/USD 0.3024 0.3069 0.3134 0.2884
BGN/USD 0.6138 0.5377 0.5774 0.5658
Operating and Reportable Segments
Operating segments are reported based on the organizational structure and financial information provided to the Chief Executive 
Officer, who represents the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”). The Group’s organizational structure reflects the different 
electricity generation methods, being Thermal and Renewables. A third category, Corporate & Other, primarily reflects costs for 
certain centralized functions including executive oversight, corporate treasury and accounting, legal, compliance, human resources, 
IT, political risk insurance and facilities management and certain technical support costs that are not allocated to the segments for 
internal management reporting purposes. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business excluding amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties such as sales taxes, goods and services taxes and value added taxes.
Revenue is recognized when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and these benefits can be measured 
reliably. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
The Group revenue is mainly generated from the following:
(i) revenue from power sales;
(ii) revenue from operating leases;
(iii) revenue from financial assets (concession and finance lease assets); and
(iv) construction revenue from concession arrangements.
Certain Group power plants sell their output under Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) and other long-term arrangements. Under 
such arrangements it is usual for the Group to receive payment for the provision of electrical capacity or availability whether or not 
the offtaker requests the electrical output (capacity payments) and for the variable costs of production (energy payments). In such 
situations, revenue is recognized in respect of capacity payments as:
(a)  Service income in accordance with the contractual terms, to the extent that the capacity has been made available to the 
contracted offtaker during the period. This income is recognized as part of revenue from power sales; 
(b)  Financial return on the operating financial asset where the PPA is considered to be or to contain a finance lease or where the 
contract is considered to be a financial asset under interpretation IFRIC 12: “Service Concession Arrangements”. 
Under finance lease arrangements, those payments which are not included within minimum lease payments are accounted for as 
service income (outlined in (a) above). 
98 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 99  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
arrangement. Infrastructure used in a public-to-private 
service concession arrangement for its entire useful life 
(a whole of life asset) is within the scope of IFRIC 12 if 
the conditions in a) are met.
The Group entered into three concession arrangements 
under the scope of IFRIC 12 in Rwanda, Senegal and Togo, 
which comply with the “financial asset” model 
requirements. Under this model, the operator recognizes a 
financial asset, attracting interest in consideration for the 
services it provides (design, construction, etc.). This model 
is based on input assumptions such as budgets and cash 
flow forecasts. Any change in these assumptions may have 
a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable 
amount and could result in reducing the value of the asset. 
Such financial assets are recognized in the Statement of 
Financial Position in an amount corresponding to the fair 
value of the infrastructure on first recognition and 
subsequently at amortized cost. The receivable is settled 
by means of the grantor’s payments received. The financial 
income calculated on the basis of the effective interest 
rate, equivalent to the project’s internal rate of return, is 
reflected within the “Revenue from concession and finance 
lease assets” line in the note 4.2 “Revenue” to the 
consolidated financial statement. Cash outflows relating 
to the acquisition of financial assets under concession 
agreements are presented as part of cash flow from 
investing activities. Net cash inflows generated by the 
financial assets’ operations are presented as part of 
cash flow from operating activities.
The Group acquired a concession arrangement under the 
scope of IFRIC 12 in Brazil which complies with the 
“intangible asset” model requirements. Under this model, 
the operator recognizes an intangible asset in accordance 
with IAS 38 to the extent that it has a right to charge users 
of the public service. Such intangible asset is recognized 
in the Statement of Financial Position at cost on first 
recognition and subsequently measured over its useful 
economic life at cost less accumulated amortization and 
impairment losses. Net cash inflows generated by the 
intangible asset’s operations are presented as part of 
cash flow from operating activities.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or 
contains, a lease is based on the substance of the 
arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the 
fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of 
a specific asset or assets and whether the arrangement 
conveys the right to use the asset, or assets.
Accounting for arrangements that contain a lease 
as lessee
(i) Accounting for finance leases as lessee 
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group 
holds substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
are classified as finance lease and such assets are 
capitalized at the commencement of the lease term at the 
lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments 
or the fair value of the leased asset. The asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset 
and the lease term. The obligations relating to finance 
leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, 
are recognized as liabilities. Leases are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method.
(ii) Accounting for operating leases as lessee
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards 
are held by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals are charged to the statement of income on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Accounting for arrangements that contain a lease as lessor 
– Power purchase arrangements (“PPA”) and other long-
term contracts may contain, or may be considered, leases 
where the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on 
the use of a specific asset such as a power plant and the 
arrangement conveys to the customer the right to use that 
asset. Such contracts may be identified as either operating 
leases or finance leases.
(i) Accounting for finance leases as lessor
Where the Group determines that the contractual 
provisions of a long-term PPA contain, or are a lease and 
result in the offtaker assuming the principal risks and 
rewards of ownership of the power plant, the arrangement 
is a finance lease. Accordingly the assets are not reflected 
as PP&E and the net investment in the lease, represented 
by the present value of the amounts due from the lessee is 
recorded as a Financial asset as a finance lease receivable. 
The capacity payments as part of the leasing arrangement 
are apportioned between minimum lease payments 
(comprising capital repayments relating to the provision of 
the plant and finance income) and service income. The 
finance income element is recognized as revenue, using a 
rate of return specific to the plant to give a constant rate of 
return on the net investment in each period. Finance 
income and service income are recognized in each 
accounting period at the fair value of the Group’s 
performance under the contract.
(ii) Accounting for operating leases as lessor
Where the Group determines that the contractual 
provisions of the long-term PPA contain, or are, a lease, 
and result in the Group retaining the principal risks and 
rewards of ownership of the power plant, the arrangement 
is an operating lease. For operating leases, the power plant 
is, or continues to be, capitalized as property, plant and 
equipment and depreciated over its useful economic life. 
Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement.
Inventories 
Inventories consist primarily of power generating plant fuel 
and spare parts that are held by the Group for its own use. 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using a first-in, 
first-out method, and net realizable value, which is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, 
less applicable selling expenses.
Emission quotas
Some companies of the Group emit CO 2 and have as a 
result obligations to buy emission quotas on the basis of 
local legislation. The emissions made by the Company 
emitting CO 2 which are in excess of any allocated quotas 
are purchased at free market and shown as inventories 
before their effective use. If emissions are higher than 
allocated quotas, the Company recognizes an expense and 
respective liability for those emissions. At the end of each 
reporting period, CO 2 quotas that remain available to the 
Company are revalued based on available market prices.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value, 
which is usually the invoiced amount, and subsequently 
carried at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and 
current balances with banks and similar institutions and 
short-term investments, all of which are readily convertible 
to cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in 
value and have an original maturity of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts are included within current Borrowings.
2.  Summary of significant 
accounting policies continued
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. An 
impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less costs of disposal (market value) and value in use 
determined using estimates of discounted future net cash 
flows of the asset or group of assets to which it belongs. 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are 
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely 
independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). 
Financial assets
Classification of financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following 
categories: at fair value through statement of income and 
loans and receivables. The classification depends on the 
purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of its financial 
assets at initial recognition. 
(a) Financial assets at fair value through statement of income
Financial assets have been acquired principally for the 
purpose of selling, or being settled, in the short term. 
Financial assets at fair value through statement of income 
are “Restricted cash”, “Cash and cash equivalents” and 
derivatives held for trading unless they are designated 
as hedges. 
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets 
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in 
an active market. They are included in current assets, 
except those that mature greater than 12 months after the 
end of the reporting period, which are classified in non-
current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables 
comprise “Trade and other receivables” and “Financial 
assets” in the consolidated statement of financial position. 
Recognition and measurement of financial assets
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are 
recognized on the trade-date, which is the date on which 
the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial 
assets carried at fair value through statement of income are 
initially recognized at fair value, and transaction costs are 
expensed in the statement of income. Financial assets are 
derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from 
the investments have expired or have been transferred and 
the Group has transferred substantially all risks and 
rewards of ownership. Loans and receivables are 
subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method. 
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses loans and receivables at the end of 
each reporting period to determine whether there is 
objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. 
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit 
losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the 
financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss 
is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. If a 
loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest 
rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss 
is the current effective interest rate determined under 
the contract. 
Unless otherwise stated carrying value approximates to fair 
value for all financial assets.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
As part of its overall foreign exchange and interest rate risk 
management policy, the Group enters into various hedging 
transactions involving derivative instruments. 
In connection with the Group’s hedging policy, the Group 
uses forward exchange contracts for currency risk 
management as well as foreign exchange options, interest 
rate swap contracts for interest rate risk management in 
order to hedge certain forecasted transactions and to 
manage its anticipated cash payments under its variable 
rate financing by converting a portion of its variable rate 
financing to a fixed rate basis through the use of interest 
rate swap agreements, and a cross currency swap contract 
for both currency and interest rate risk management. 
Items qualifying as hedges
The Group formally documents all relationships between 
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategies for undertaking 
hedge transactions and the method used to assess hedge 
effectiveness. Hedging transactions are expected to be 
highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash 
flows and are regularly assessed to determine that they 
actually have been highly effective throughout the financial 
reporting periods for which they are implemented.
When derivative instruments qualify as hedges for 
accounting purposes, as defined in IAS 39 “Financial 
instruments: recognition and measurement”, they are 
accounted for as follows:
 ― The effective portion of the gain or loss on an 
outstanding hedge is recognized directly in the 
consolidated statement of other comprehensive income 
(“OCI”), while any ineffective portion is recognized 
immediately in the consolidated statement of income
 ― Amounts recognized directly in OCI are reclassified to 
the consolidated statement of income when the hedged 
transaction affects the consolidated statement of income
 ― If a forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer 
expected to occur, amounts previously recognized in OCI 
are reclassified to the consolidated statement of income 
as Finance income or Finance costs
If a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its 
designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously 
recognized in OCI remain in accumulated OCI until the 
forecast transaction or firm commitment occurs, at which 
point they are reclassified to the consolidated statement 
of income. 
Concession arrangements
The interpretation IFRIC 12 governs accounting for 
concession arrangements. An arrangement within the 
scope of IFRIC 12 is one which involves a private sector 
entity (known as “an operator”) constructing infrastructure 
used to provide a public service, or upgrading it (for 
example, by increasing its capacity) and operating and 
maintaining that infrastructure for a specified period 
of time. 
IFRIC 12 applies to public-to-private service concession 
arrangements if:
(a)  The “grantor” (i.e. the public sector entity – the offtaker) 
controls or regulates what services the operator must 
provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide 
them, and at what price; and
(b)  The grantor controls through ownership, beneficial 
entitlement or otherwise any significant residual interest 
in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the

Provisions
The Group makes provisions when an obligation exists, 
resulting from a past event and it is probable that cash will 
be paid to settle it, but the exact amount of cash required 
can only be estimated on a reliable basis. Major provisions 
are detailed in note 4.25. The main estimates relate to site 
decommissioning and maintenance costs, and 
environmental remediation for various sites owned. 
Site decommissioning, maintenance and environmental 
provisions are recognized based on management’s 
assessment of future costs which would need to be 
incurred in accordance with existing legislation or 
contractual obligations to restore the sites or make good 
any environmental damage. These costs are measured at 
the present value of the future expenditures expected to 
be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount 
rate which reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. 
Management apply judgment in the estimation of future 
cash flows to settle these obligations and in the estimation 
of an appropriate pre-tax discount factor. The pre-tax 
discount rate used varies from 5.0% to 11.0%. If this was to 
decrease by 1% it would increase decommissioning, 
environmental and maintenance provisions by $3.2 million.
Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in a business combination
Business combinations are recorded in accordance with 
IFRS 3 using the acquisition method. Under this method, 
the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
are recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Therefore, through a number of different approaches and 
with the assistance of external independent valuation 
experts for acquisitions as considered appropriate by 
management, the Group identifies what it believes is the 
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at 
the acquisition date. These valuations involve the use of 
judgment and include a number of estimates. Judgment is 
exercised in identifying the most appropriate valuation 
approach which is then used to determine the allocation of 
fair value. The Group typically uses one of the cost 
approach, the income approach and the market approach.
Each of these valuation approaches involve the use of 
estimates in a number of areas, including the determination 
of cash flow projections and related discount rates, 
industry indices, market prices regarding replacement cost 
and comparable market transactions. While the Group 
believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the 
valuation methodologies are reasonable, different 
assumptions could result in different fair values.
Taxes
Significant judgment is sometimes required in determining 
the accrual for income taxes as there are many transactions 
and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The 
Group recognizes liabilities based on estimates of whether 
additional taxes will be due. These areas include, but are not 
limited to, the deductibility of interest on certain borrowings 
used to finance acquisitions made by the Group and the 
price at which goods and services are transferred between 
Group companies. Where the final tax outcome of these 
matters is different from the amounts that were recorded, 
such differences will impact the current and deferred 
income tax provisions, results of operations and possibly 
cash flows in the year in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax assets are recognized on tax loss carry-
forwards when it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the tax loss carry-forwards can be 
utilized. Estimates of taxable profits and utilizations of tax 
loss carry-forwards are prepared on the basis of profit and 
loss forecasts as included in the medium-term business 
plan and, if necessary, on the basis of additional forecasts. 
Critical accounting judgments 
Assessing property, plant and equipment for 
impairment triggers
The Group’s property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
for indications of impairment (an impairment “trigger”). 
Judgment is applied in determining whether an impairment 
trigger has occurred, based on both internal and external 
sources. External sources may include: market value declines, 
negative changes in technology, markets, economy, or laws. 
Internal sources may include: obsolescence or physical 
damage, or worse economic performance than expected, 
including from adverse weather conditions for renewable 
plants. In the current year, impairment triggers were noted 
for Brazilian wind power plants and Brazilian hydro power 
plants (see note 4.11).
Accounting for long-term power purchase agreements 
and related revenue recognition 
When power plants sell their output under long-term power 
purchase agreements (“PPA”), it is usual for the operator of 
the power plant to receive payment (known as a capacity 
payment) for the provision of electrical capacity whether 
or not the offtaker requests electrical output. There is a 
degree of judgment as to whether a long-term contract 
to sell electrical capacity constitutes a service concession 
arrangement, a form of lease, or a service contract. This 
determination is made at the inception of the PPA, and is 
not required to be revisited in subsequent periods under 
IFRS, unless the agreement is renegotiated. 
Given that the fulfillment of the PPAs is dependent on the 
use of a specified asset, the key judgment in determining if 
the PPA contains a lease is the assessment of whether the 
PPA conveys a right for the offtaker to use the assets. In 
practice, the key criteria in assessing if that right exists 
is the judgment whether there is only a remote possibility 
that parties other than the offtaker will take more than an 
insignificant amount of the power output and the price the 
offtaker will pay is neither fixed nor at market price rates. 
In assessing whether the PPA contains a service concession, 
the Group considers whether the arrangement: (i) bears a 
public service obligation; (ii) has prices that are regulated 
by the offtaker; and (iii) the residual interest is transferred 
to the offtaker at an agreed value. 
All other PPAs are determined to be service contracts. 
Concession arrangements – For those agreements which 
are determined to be a concession arrangement, there are 
judgments as to whether the infrastructure should be 
accounted for as an intangible asset or a financial asset 
depending on the nature of the payment entitlements 
established in the agreement. 
Concession arrangements determined to be a financial 
asset – The Group recognizes a financial asset when demand 
risk is assumed by the grantor, to the extent that the 
contracted concession holder has an unconditional right to 
receive payments for the asset. The asset is recognized at 
the fair value of the construction services provided. The fair 
value is based on input assumptions such as budgets and 
cash flow forecasts. The inputs include in particular the 
budget for fixed and variable costs. Any change in these 
assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement 
of the recoverable amount and could result in reducing the 
value of the asset. The financial asset is subsequently 
recorded at amortized cost calculated according to the 
effective interest rate method. Revenue for operating and 
managing the asset is recorded as revenue in each period. 
2.  Summary of significant 
accounting policies continued
Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options 
are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
The premium received on the issue of shares in excess 
of the nominal value of shares is credited to the share 
premium account and included within shareholders’ equity.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash includes cash balances which have 
restrictions as to withdrawal or usage of funds. In particular, 
maintenance reserves held for the purpose of covering 
long-term major maintenance and long-term deposits kept 
as collateral to cover decommissioning obligations are 
excluded from cash and cash equivalents and included in 
non-current assets.
Provisions
Provisions principally relate to decommissioning, 
maintenance, environmental, tax and legal obligations and 
which are recognized when there is a present obligation as 
a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the 
amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are re-measured at each statement of financial 
position date and adjusted to reflect the current best 
estimate. Any change in present value of the estimated 
expenditure attributable to changes in the estimates of the 
cash flow or the current estimate of the discount rate used 
are reflected as an adjustment to the provision. The 
increase in the provisions due to passage of time are 
recognized as finance costs in the Consolidated statement 
of income.
Financial liabilities
(a) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value of amounts 
received, net of transaction costs. Borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method; any difference between the 
proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
value is recognized in the statement of income over the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
(b) Trade and other payables 
Financial liabilities within trade and other payables are 
initially recognized at fair value, which is usually the 
invoiced amount, and subsequently carried at amortized 
cost using the effective interest method.
Unless otherwise stated carrying value approximates to fair 
value for all financial liabilities.
Government grants
Grants from the government are recognized where there is 
a reasonable assurance that the conditions associated with 
the grants have been complied with and the grants will be 
received.
Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and 
deferred tax. Tax is recognized in the statement of income, 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in 
other comprehensive income. In this case, the tax is also 
recognized in other comprehensive income.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of 
the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
statement of financial position date in the countries where 
the Group and its subsidiaries operate and generate 
taxable income. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in 
which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It 
establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of 
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognized on temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial 
statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not 
recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of 
goodwill; deferred income tax is not recognized if it arises 
from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
other than a business combination that at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or 
loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the statement of financial position date and are expected to 
apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized 
or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred 
income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority on either the same 
taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an 
intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in 
line with the Group’s accounting policies set out in note 2.3 
involves the use of judgment and/or estimation. These 
judgments and estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, giving 
consideration to previous experience, and are regularly 
reviewed and revised as necessary. Actual results may differ 
from the amounts included in the consolidated financial 
statements. The estimates and judgments that have the most 
significant effect on the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities are presented below. 
Critical accounting estimates
Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment
Where an impairment trigger has been identified (see critical 
accounting judgments section), the Group makes significant 
judgments in its impairment evaluations of long-lived assets. 
The determination of the recoverable amount is typically the 
most judgmental part of an impairment evaluation. The 
recoverable amount is the higher of: (i) an asset’s fair value 
less costs of disposal (market value); and (ii) value in use 
determined using estimates of discounted future net cash 
flows (“DCF”) of the asset or group of assets to which it 
belongs. 
The Group generally uses value in use to derive the 
recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment. 
Management applies considerable judgment in selecting 
several input assumptions in its DCF models, including 
discount rates and capacity/availability factors. These 
assumptions are consistent with the Group’s internal 
budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Examples of the 
input assumptions that budgets and cash flow forecasts are 
sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth 
rates, inflation, exchange rates, and, in the case of 
renewables plants, environmental factors such as wind, 
solar and water resource forecast. Any changes in 
these assumptions may have a material impact on the 
measurement of the recoverable amount and could result 
in impairing the tested assets. See note 4.11 for further 
information on the impairment tests performed.

Additional solar portfolio acquisition
In December 2017, the Group closed the acquisition of 100% of a 19.1 MW operational solar photovoltaic plants in Italy from 
ErgyCapital S.p.A. The plants, located in the regions of Puglia, Piemonte, Lazio and Campania, are in close proximity to 
ContourGlobal’s existing Italian solar portfolio and benefit from approximately 12 years of Feed-in-Tariff. The total consideration 
amounts to €9.6 million (or $11.4 million) corresponding to acquisition of shares.
Subsequent to the closing the Group refinanced the portfolio and issued new facilities for a total of €55.8 million (or $66.4 million), 
of which €38.8 million (or $46.2 million) has been drawned in 2017, at an interest rate of Euribor 6M+2.35% per annum, 70% of which 
is swapped at 0.653%+2.35% per annum, maturing on 30th June 2028.
On a consolidated and annualized basis, had this acquisition taken place as of 1st January 2017, the Group would have recognized 
2017 consolidated revenue of $1,032.9 million and consolidated net profit of $14.3 million.

The acquisition contributed to consolidated revenue and net result for respectively $0.5 million and $0.6 million.
Acquisition of non-controlling interests which did not result in a change of control
The Group also completed in 2017 the acquisition of 19.7% minority interests in ContourGlobal Hydro Cascade CJSC (Vorotan 
project) for a consideration of $9.8 million. After this transaction, the Group owns 100% of the Vorotan project.
This transaction did not result in a change of control and have therefore been accounted for within shareholder’s equity as 
transactions with owners without change of control acting in their capacity of owners. 
4.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements
4.1 Segment reporting
The Group’s reportable segments are the operating segments overseen by distinct segment managers responsible for their 
performance with no aggregation of operating segments. 
Thermal Energy for power generating plants operating from coal, lignite, natural gas, fuel oil and diesel. Thermal plants include 
Maritsa, Arrubal, Togo, Kramatorsk, Cap des Biches, KivuWatt, Energies Antilles, Energies Saint-Martin, Bonaire and our equity 
investees (primarily Termoemcali and Sochagota). Our thermal segment also includes plants which provide electricity and certain 
other services to beverage bottling companies.
Renewable Energy for power generating plants operating from renewable resources such as wind, solar and hydro in Europe and 
South America. Renewables plants include Asa Branca, Chapada I, II, III, Inka, Vorotan, Austria Portfolio 1 & 2 and our other European 
and Brazilian plants.
The Corporate & Other category primarily reflects costs for certain centralized functions including executive oversight, corporate 
treasury and accounting, legal, compliance, human resources, IT, political risk insurance and facilities management and certain 
technical support costs that are not allocated to the segments for internal management reporting purposes.
The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on Adjusted EBITDA which is defined as profit for the 
period from continuing operations before income taxes, net finance costs, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related 
expenses and specific items which have been identified and adjusted by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. In determining 
whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency 
or predictability of occurrence.
The CODM does not review nor is presented a segment measure of total assets and total liabilities.
All revenue is derived from external customers. 
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Leases – For those arrangements determined to be or to contain leases, further judgment is required to determine whether the 
arrangement is finance or operating lease. This assessment requires an evaluation of where the substantial risks and rewards of 
ownership reside, for example due to the existence of a bargain purchase option that would allow the offtaker to buy the asset at 
the end of the arrangement for a minimal price.
3.  Major events and changes in the scope of consolidation
3.1  2016 transactions
Sale of Czech assets
On 14th November 2016, the Group sold 100% of its stake in Czech solar assets representing a total of 6.0 MW. The sale resulted 
in a gain in the statement of income of $3.0 million.
The cession contributed to consolidated revenue and net result for respectively $3.4 million and $1.2 million.
Termination of CG Solutions Kiev
In August 2016, Coca Cola Beverages Ukraine, the offtaker of the Ukrainian Solutions power plant under the master agreement 
signed with Coca-Cola Hellenic, terminated the local agreement between ContourGlobal Solutions Ukraine LLC and Coca Cola 
Beverages Ukraine resulting in the transfer of the ownership of the power plant and spare parts to Coca Cola Beverages Ukraine. 
Consequently, and as contractually agreed in such situation, ContourGlobal Solutions Ukraine LLC sold the related assets to the 
offtaker and received the remaining discounted cash flows due under the Power Purchase Agreement, resulting in a gain in the 
statement of income of $12.1 million.
The cession contributed to consolidated revenue and net result for respectively $2.7 million and $(2.7) million.
3.2  2017 transactions
Acquisition of a thermal and a renewable portfolio in Brazil
On 17th March 2017, the Group closed the acquisition of 80% of a 206 MW Brazilian portfolio. The portfolio consists of seven 
hydroelectric plants totaling 130 MW in the states of Bahia, Goiás and Rio de Janeiro and four high-efficiency cogeneration facilities 
(“Solutions”) totaling 76 MW in Paraná, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The total consideration amounts to BRL 576.8 million (or 
$182.4 million) including certain price adjustments. A total of BRL 547.3 million (or $173.1 million) was paid in cash at the closing date. 
On a consolidated and annualized basis, had this acquisition taken place as of 1st January 2017, the Group would have recognized 
2017 consolidated revenue of $1,037.9 million and consolidated net profit of $18.5 million.

1  The Group operates plants in Togo, Rwanda and Senegal which are in the scope of the financial model of IFRIC 12 “Service Concession Arrangements”.
 Our Togo power plant was commissioned in 2010 and is operated under a power purchase agreement with a unique offtaker, Compagnie Energie Electrique 
du Togo (“CEET”) which has an average remaining contract life of approximately 17.8 years as of 31st December 2017 (31st December 2016: 18.8 years). At 
expiration, the Togo plant, along with all equipment necessary for the operation of the plant, will be transferred to the Republic of Togo. This arrangement is 
accounted for as a concession arrangement and the value of the asset is recorded as a financial asset. The all-in base capacity tariff under the Togo power 
purchase agreement is adjusted annually for a combination of US, Euro and local consumer price index related to the cost structure. 
 Our Rwanda power plant consists of the development, construction and operation of Gas Extraction Facilities (“GEF”) and an associated power plant. The GEF 
is used to extract methane and bio gas from the depths of Lake Kivu in Rwanda and deliver the gas via submerged gas transport pipelines to shore-based 
power production facilities totaling 26 MW of gross capacity. The PPA runs for 25 years starting on the commercial operation date and ending in 2040.
 Our Cap des Biches power plant in Senegal consists of the development, construction and operation of five engines with a flexi-cycle system technology 
based on waste heat recovery totaling about 86MW. A PPA integrating all the Cap des Biches requirements and agreements on price was signed for 20 
years starting on the commercial operation date of the project and ending in 2036.
2 Relates to financial leases where the Group acts as a lessor, and includes our Bonaire plant in the Dutch Caribbean and our Saint Martin plant in the French 
Territory. Bonaire has an average remaining contract life of approximately 7.6 years as of 31st December 2017 (31st December 2016: 8.6 years); Saint Martin 
has an average remaining contract life of approximately 5.3 years as of 31st December 2017 (31st December 2016: 6.3 years).
 No losses from impairment of contracted concessional assets and financial lease receivables in the above projects were recorded during the years ended 
31st December 2017 and 2016 (refer to note 4.11).
 Cash outflows relating to the acquisition of financial assets under concession agreements amounted to $35.4 million as of 31st December 2017 (31st December 
2016: $49.0 million). Net cash inflows generated by the financial assets’ operations amounted to $52.7 million as of 31st December 2017 (31st December

the year ended 31st December 2016.
In 2016, the Group did not capitalize any borrowing costs in relation to project financing.
Impairment tests on tangible and intangible assets
For the years ended 31st December 2016 and 2017 certain triggering events were identified primarily driven by lower performance 
of the assets, change of regulation and local environment, requiring an impairment test of the relevant assets.
The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the value in use determined by the discounted value of future cash flows 
(discounted cash flow method or “DCF”, determined by using cash flows projections consistent with the following year budget and 
the most recent forecasts prepared by management) and the fair value (less costs to sell), determined on the basis of market data 
(comparison with the value attributed to similar assets or companies in recent transactions).
For the year ended 31st December 2016 impairment tests were performed in relation with Brazilian wind power plants, Bonaire 
(financial asset) and Ukrainian power plant and confirmed the carrying value of the assets.
Impairment tests were performed for the year ended 31st December 2016 using the following assumptions and related sensitivity analysis.

The sensitivity calculations show that an increase by 1% of the discount rate and a wind scenario at P75 for Brazilian wind power 
plants assets or a 5% cut in operating cash flows for Bonaire and Kramatorsk assets would not have a material impact on the results 
of impairment tests or, therefore, on the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of 31st December 2016.
For the year ended 31st December 2017, in relation to the sale of its Ukrainian power plant, the Group conducted an impairment test 
which resulted in an impairment charge of $3.3 million based on the sales proceeds.
For the year ended 31st December 2017 impairment tests were performed in relation with Brazilian wind and hydro power plants and 
confirmed the carrying value of the assets.

impairment tests or, therefore, on the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of 31st December 2017.
The P-factor quantifies the uncertainty of annual energy yield predictions. P75 is the energy level that wind turbines are 75% likely 
to produce over an average year, given the uncertainties in the measurement, analysis and wind turbines operation. P50 is the 
average annual energy yield predicted for wind farms, which corresponds to the annual energy output that wind farms are most 
likely to achieve.
Changes to be made to the key impairment test assumptions to reduce the value in use to net book value would not correspond to 
the definition of a reasonable change as defined by IAS 36.

If there is no independent rating, the Group assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, 
past experience and other factors. 
Trade receivables can be due from a single customer or a few customers who will purchase all or a significant portion of a power 
plant’s output under long-term power purchase agreements. This customer concentration may impact the Group’s overall exposure to 
credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the customers may be affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions.

As of 31st December 2017, $65.4 million (31st December 2016: $12.2 million) of trade receivables and $27.2 million (31st December 2016: 
$17.4 million) of CO 2 quotas receivables were outstanding in connection with our Bulgarian power plant, Maritsa East 3 of which 
$16.8 million was overdue as of 31st December 2017 and fully paid in January 2018. 
Past due up to 90 days also included $8.4 million from Cap de Biches project which were fully paid in January 2018.
The Group deems the associated credit risk of the trade receivables not overdue to be suitably low.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group not being able to meet its obligations. The Group mainly relies on long-term debt obligations to 
fund its acquisitions and construction activities. All significant long-term financing arrangements are supported locally and covered 
by the cash flows expected from the power plants when operational. The Group has, to the extent available at acceptable terms, 
utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and 
acquire its electric power plants and related assets. 
On 6th September 2017, the Group also entered into a €50 million revolving credit facility available for general corporate purposes, 
maturing in September 2020, and which remains undrawn as of 31st December 2017.
A rolling cash flow forecast of the Group’s liquidity requirements is prepared to confirm sufficient cash is available to meet 
operational needs and to comply with borrowing limits or covenants. Such forecasting takes into consideration the future debt 
financing strategy, covenant compliance, compliance with internal statement of financial position ratio targets and, if applicable 
external regulatory or legal requirements – for example, cash restrictions.
The subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of the holding company 
indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds 
available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments. Some of the Group’s subsidiaries guarantee indebtedness under one 
or more credit facilities and certain of the holding company outstanding debt securities.

4.14 Management of financial risk
The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk arises primarily from our long-term borrowings. Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable 
rates, partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Interest rate risk is managed through entering into interest rate swap agreements, 
entered into with commercial banks and other institutions. The interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedges. Their duration matches 
the duration of the debt instruments. Approximately 30.7% the Group’s existing debt obligations carry variable interest rates in 2017 
(2016: 28.9%) (taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps). 
These agreements involve the receipt of variable payments in exchange for fixed payments over the term of the agreements without 
the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. The main interest rates exposure for the Group relates to the floating rates with 
the TJLP, EURIBOR and LIBOR (refer to note 4.23). A change of 0.5% of those floating rates would result in an increase in interest 
expenses by $4.5 million in the year ended 31st December 2017 (2016: $3.7 million).
Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the Euro, Brazilian Real and Bulgarian Lev. 
Currency risk comprises (i) transaction risk arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain financial debt denominated 
in a currency other than the currency of the operations; (ii) transaction risk linked to investments or mergers and acquisitions; and 
(iii) translation risk arising on the consolidation in US dollars of the consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries with a functional 
currency other than the US dollar. 
To mitigate foreign exchange risk: (i) most revenues and operating costs incurred in the countries where the Group operates are 
denominated in the functional currency of the project Company; (ii) the external financial debt is mostly denominated in the currency 
that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk; and 
(iii) the Group enters into various foreign currency sale/forward and/or option transactions at a corporate level. The analysis of financial 
debt by currency is presented in note 4.23. 
Potential sensitivity on the post-tax net result for the year linked to financial instruments is as follows:
 ― If the US dollar had weakened/strengthened by 10% against the Euro, post-tax loss for the year ended 31st December 2017 would 
have been $0.5 million higher/lower (2016: $1.0 million higher/lower)
 ― If the US dollar had weakened/strengthened by 10% against the Brazilian Real, post-tax loss for the year ended 31st December 
2017 would have been $2.2 million higher/lower (2016: $4.6 million higher/lower) 
Commodity pricing risk
The Group’s current and future cash flows are generally not impacted by changes in the prices of electricity, gas, oil and other fuel 
prices as most of the Group’s non-renewable plants operate under long-term power purchase agreements and fuel purchase 
agreements. These agreements generally mitigate against significant fluctuations in cash flows as a result in changes in commodity 
prices by passing through changes in fuel prices to the offtaker. 
Credit risk
Credit risk relates to risk arising from customers, suppliers, partners, intermediaries and banks on its operating and financing 
activities, when such parties are unable to honor their contractual obligations. Credit risk results from a combination of payment risk, 
delivery risk (failure to deliver services or products paid for) and the risk of replacing contracts in default (known as mark to market 
exposure – i.e. the cost of replacing the contract in conditions other than those initially agreed). The Group analyzes the credit risk 
for each new client prior to entering into an agreement. In addition, in order to minimize risk, we contract Political Risk Insurance 
policies from multilateral organizations or commercial insurers which usually provide us with insurance against government defaults. 
Such policies cover our project companies in Armenia, Bulgaria, Colombia, Nigeria, Peru, Rwanda, Togo, Senegal and Slovakia.
We restrict exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moody’s and S&P and 
by defining the types of financial instruments which may be entered into. The minimum credit ratings the Group generally accepts 
from banks or financial institutions are BBB- (S&P) and Baa3 (Moody’s). For offtakers, where credit rating are CCC+ or below, the 
Group generally hedges its counterparty risk by contracting Political Risk Insurance. 
116 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 117  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
The notional principal amount of:
 ― The outstanding interest rate swap contracts and cross currency swap qualified as cash flow hedge amounted to $572.0 million 
as of 31st December 2017 (31st December 2016: $475.1 million)
 ― The outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts amount to $92.8 million as of 31st December 2017 (31st December 
2016: $225.7 million)
The Group also entered in 2015 into a cross currency swap in our Cap des Biches project in Senegal. The fair value of the instrument 
as of 31st December 2017 amounts to $20.9 million (31st December 2016: $4.3 million). The accounting and risk management policies, 
and further information about the derivative financial instruments that we use, are set out in note 4.14.
The cross currency swap subscribed for 2016 to protect the Group from a change of interest rates and foreign exchange rates on 
the Cap des Biches project before project financing disbursement which occurred in January 2017 was settled in January 2017 and 
had a notional value of $21.8 million as of 31st December 2016.
The Group recognized a loss of $12.1 million in 31st December 2017 in relation with its interest rate and cross currency swaps within 
Finance costs net (31st December 2016: income of $5.5 million).
4.16 Fair value measurements
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety as defined below:
 ― Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has the ability to 
access at the measurement date
 ― Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly
 ― Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability
There were no transfers between fair value measurement levels between 31st December 2016 and 2017.
When measuring our interest rate, cross currency swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts at fair value on a recurring 
basis at both 31st December 2017 and 2016, we have measured these at level 2 in the fair value hierarchy with the exception of the debt 
to non-controlling interests which is level 3. The fair value of those financial instruments is determined by using valuation techniques. 
These valuations techniques maximize the use of observable data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity 
specific estimates.
The Group uses a market approach as part of their available valuation techniques to determine the fair value of derivatives. 
The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions.
The Group’s finance department performs valuation of financial assets and liabilities required for financial reporting purposes as 
categorized at level 2. The Group’s only derivatives are interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange 
option contracts and cross currency swap contracts in our Cap des Biches project in Senegal.

The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in operating performance, indicate that 
the Group has sufficient financial resources, together with assets that are expected to generate free cash flow to the Group. As a 
consequence, the Group has reasonable expectation to be well placed to manage its business risks and to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future (at least for the twelve month period from the approval date of these financial statements). 
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Capital risk management
The Company considers its capital and reserves attributable to equity shareholders to be the Company’s capital. 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern while providing 
adequate returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure to optimize the cost of capital. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. It may also increase debt provided that the funded venture provides 
adequate returns so that the overall capital structure remains supportable. 
4.15 Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on our borrowings, a foreign exchange 
forward contract to mitigate its currency risk and cross currency swap contracts in Cap des Biches project in Senegal to manage

1 Interest rate swap – cash flow hedge relates to the hedging of the variable elements for certain project financing.
2 Upon execution of the share purchase agreement in November 2016 for the expected acquisition of the new Brazilian portfolio described in note 3.2, the 
Group entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge against increases (caused by any future appreciation of the BRL against the US dollar) in the total 
expected cash investment to be paid at closing of the acquisition. The nominal value of this acquisition hedge was $164.0 million as of 31st December 2016; 
hedge accounting has not been applied. On 17th March 2017, at acquisition date, the Group settled the acquisition hedge which resulted in a net gain of 
$11.7 million recognized in the income statement, of which $5.7 million in 2017.
3 The Group has also executed a series of offsets to protect the value, in US dollar terms, of the BRL-denominated expected distributions from the new Brazilian 
portfolio. The first two years of BRL-denominated distributions have been hedged using a series of forward exchange contracts and the distributions expected 
in years three to five have been protected against material depreciation of the BRL using option contracts. Hedge accounting does not apply, change in fair 
value is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.

As at 31st December 2017 670,712,920 0.01 6.7 8.9
On incorporation, 26th September 2017, the Company issued 100 ordinary shares with a nominal value of £1.00 to its Parent 
Company, ContourGlobal LP. The amount due was settled through an intercompany receivable.
On 17th October 2017, the Company issued to its Parent Company, ContourGlobal L.P. 1,002,000,000 ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of £1.00 each as payment for its acquisition of ContourGlobal Worldwide Holdings S.à.r.l. 
On 19th October 2017, the Company passed a special resolution supported by a solvency statement to reduce its share capital 
under s641(a) of the Companies Act 2006 by reducing the share capital of the Company of $1,320,736,335 divided into 
1,002,000,100 ordinary shares of £1.00, each fully paid, to $13,207,366 divided into 1,002,000,100 ordinary shares of £0.01, each fully 
paid, by the cancellation of the paid up share capital to the extent of £0.99 per share upon each of the 1,002,000,100 ordinary 
shares reducing the nominal amount of all such shares from £1.00 to £0.01.
On 8th November 2017, the Company passed a resolution to consolidate the 1,002,000,100 ordinary shares of £0.01 each in the 
share capital of the Company into 1 ordinary share of £10,020,001 and the sub-division of that share into 547,600,980 ordinary 
shares and 454,399,120 deferred shares each of £0.01. 
On 14th November, the Company completed the pricing of its initial public offering of ordinary shares at £2.50 per share, comprising 
122,399,020 new shares and 54,026,083 existing shares. The Company also issued additional 712,920 new shares subscribed by its 
management. The issuance of these new shares resulted in the recognition of a share premium of £306.5 million ($400.7 million), 
net of listing costs deducted of $19.9 million, resulting in total share premium of $380.8 million.
The Group restructure resulted in a $353.0 million debit to retained earnings and other reserves, which represents a capital 
reorganization reserve.
Finally, the Company canceled all existing 454,399,120 deferred shares, resulting in a total net ordinary shares of 670,712,920 
shares as of 31st December 2017.
Retained earnings and other reserves comprise retained earnings of ($7.9 million) (2016: ($621.7 million)) and capital reorganization 
reserve of $353.0 million (2016: nil).
During the year the Group paid dividends of $54.2 million on 19th April 2017 and $21.3 million on 8th November 2017 to 
ContourGlobal L.P. Due to the fact that both of these were paid out prior to the IPO and full restructuring of the shares, dividends 
per share in relation to each payment has not been disclosed as it would not be relevant to the user of the accounts.

1  Debt to non-controlling interests: in 2011, the Group purchased a 73% interest in Maritsa power plant. NEK owns the remaining 27% of Maritsa power plant. 
The shareholders’ agreement states that all distributable results available should be distributed to their shareholders, with no unconditional right to avoid 
dividends. Consequently and in accordance with IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: presentation”, shares held by NEK do not qualify as equity instruments and 
are recorded as a liability to non-controlling interests in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position. The fair value of the debt to non-controlling interest is 
determined using a discounted cash flow method based on management’s current best estimate of the future distributable profits to the minority shareholder 
NEK over the PPA period. This debt is discounted using a European risk free rate and adding the credit default swap (“CDS”) spread for Bulgaria.
The change in the debt to Maritsa non-controlling interest is presented below:

Site decommissioning provisions are recognized based on assessment of future decommissioning costs which would need to be 
incurred in accordance with existing legislation to restore the sites. Environmental provisions primarily relate to obligations of our 
Spanish power plant. Maintenance provisions mainly relate to our maintenance obligations under our concession agreement contract 
in Togo and Senegal. 
Legal and other provisions include amounts arising from claims, litigation and regulatory risks which will be utilized as the obligations 
are settled and includes sales tax and interest or penalties associated with taxes.
Other than the provision in Togo and Senegal for the overhaul which are expected to start respectively in 2021 and 2019, the other 
provisions have some uncertainty over the timing of cash outflows.

4.30 Financial commitments and contingent liabilities
(a) Commitments
The Group has contractual commitments with, among others, equipment suppliers, professional service organizations and EPC 
contractors in connection with its power projects under construction that require payment upon reaching certain milestones. As of 
31st December 2017, the Group has completed all its construction projects and had $3.5 million of firm purchase commitments of 
property plant and equipment outstanding in connection with its Maritsa facilities. The Group has also contractual arrangements with 
Operating and Maintenance (O&M) providers and transmission operators as it relates to certain of its operating assets.
Maritsa has a long-term Lignite Supply Agreement (LSA) with Maritsa Iztok Mines (MMI) for the purchase of lignite. According to the 
agreement, Maritsa has to purchase minimum monthly quantities, amounting to 6,187 thousand standard tons per calendar year. The 
total commitment through the remaining term of the LSA (February 2024) is 37,638 thousand standard tons, equal to $381.2 million 
at December 2017 prices ($10.13 per standard ton), as compared to 43,825 thousands standard tons equal to $388.8 million at the 
end of 2016 ($8.87 per standard ton). In the event of a failure on the part of CG Maritsa East 3 AD (ME-3) to take a minimum monthly 
quantity in any month, ME-3 shall, except in cases caused by Force Majeure and certain actions of Bulgarian authorities as 
described in the contract, pay to MMI an amount equal to the difference between (i) the aggregate amount paid or payable in 
respect of lignite delivered during such month and (ii) the aggregate amount that would have been payable had the minimum 
monthly quantity been taken during such month.
Pursuant to Vorotan acquisition, the Group has agreed to refurbish the hydro power plants and intends to invest approximately 
$70 million over six years in a refurbishment program started in 2017 to modernize Vorotan and improve its operational 
performance, safety, reliability and efficiency. As of 31st December 2017 Vorotan disbursed $9.8 million of which $9.5 million was an 
advance payment to the EPC contractor.
(b) Contingent liabilities 
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Group reviews these 
matters in consultation with internal and external legal counsel to make a determination on a case-by-case basis whether a loss from 
each of these matters is probable, possible or remote. These claims involve different parties and are subject to substantial 
uncertainties. 
Operation & Maintenance contractor litigation (Energies Antilles) 
In 2011, Energies Antilles (“EA”) was forced to pay to EDF, the offtaker under the PPA, a €5 million penalty in relation to damages 
following labor strikes by the operator’s employees and related disruptions. EA subsequently raised a claim against the power 
plant’s operation and maintenance (“O&M”) contractor for the same amount and collected certain amounts under related 
performance bonds. On 5th June 2015, EA received a favorable judgment in its proceeding against the O&M contractor, as the court 
awarded EA substantially all of the amounts claimed, including both the unpaid portion of the performance bond and all other 
penalty amounts not covered by the performance bonds. The O&M contractor appealed the decision. In April 2017, the Court of 
Appeal confirmed the first instance favorable judgment. The O&M contractor brought the claim to the Supreme Court in May 2017. 
No decision from the Supreme Court is expected before 2018.
In 2010, a €5 million legal claim was brought against EA by the O&M contractor in relation to cost overruns following changes in 
French labor laws (“IEG status” – Industries Electriques et Gazières). Last briefs have been filed in January 2017. On 22th February 
2018 the Paris Commercial Tribunal fixed the pleading hearings on 24th May 2018.
Minority shareholder litigation (ContourGlobal Latam S.A.) 
In July 2015, CG Latam S.A. received a notice of arbitration under International Chamber of Commerce rules from a minority 
shareholder in the Inka project alleging fraud in the negotiation and performance of that project’s investment agreement and 
shareholder agreement, seeking nullification of those agreements and return of the majority shareholding in Energía Eólica S.A. 
(“EESA”), the entity that owns the project, or, in the alternative, restitution of an amount equivalent to the value of EESA. CG Latam 
S.A. received the claimant’s statement of claim in January 2017 and filed its statement of defense on 14th August 2017. An 
evidentiary hearing of fact witnesses was held in early February 2018, and the tribunal will schedule a second hearing for expert 
witnesses. The Group expect the second hearing to be scheduled for the second quarter of 2018. 
No provision has been recorded as of 31st December 2017 in relation to the above claims as the Group considers that it is less than 
probable that liabilities will arise from these claims.
The Group from time to time is involved in disputes in relation to ongoing tax matters in a number of jurisdictions around the world. 
Where appropriate, provisions are recorded, based on the assessment of each case.
(c) Lease commitments
Operating lease as a lessee
The Group is lessee under non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for office space and land to conduct its business. The future 
aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

The Group and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine part of 
the Group’s business activities. Such contracts generally indemnify the counterparty for tax, environmental liability, litigation, and other 
matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties, and covenants set forth in the agreements. In many cases, the Group’s 
maximum potential liability cannot be estimated, since some of the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential liability.
The Group also acts as guarantor to certain of its subsidiaries and obligor with respect to some long-term arrangements contracted 
at project level. 
For the financial guarantees and letters of credit, refer to note 4.23 Borrowings.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not 
provided to the Group or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 4.32 to the consolidated financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the 
Group and its subsidiaries in the period from 1st January 2017 to 31st December 2017.
Our audit approach
Context
The parent company was newly incorporated during the period on 26th September 2017 and hence these are the first financial 
statements of the parent company. The parent company was incorporated for the purposes of the initial public offering on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange on 14th November 2017.
Overview
Key audit
matters
Audit scope
Materiality
Overall materiality: $8.0 million, based on 1% of total assets, however, reduced to $8.0 million to ensure 
the parent company did not have a higher materiality than the overall Group materiality allocation
We scope the audit, based on materiality, by financial statement line item. As the entity is a holding 
company and there are no branches or other locations for the entity, no scoping by location is performed
We have no key audit matters to report
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgments, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the parent company and the industry in which it 
operates, and considered the risk of acts by the parent company which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including 
fraud. We designed audit procedures to respond to the risk, recognizing that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due 
to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for 
example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. We designed audit procedures that focused on the risk of 
non-compliance related to UK Company law as applicable to the financial statements. Our tests included discussions with legal 
counsel and reviewing disclosures in the financial statements against the specific legal requirements. We did not identify any key 
audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of 
internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We determined that there were no key audit matters 
applicable to the parent company to communicate in our report. 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which it operates. 
The entity is a holding company and there are no branches or other locations to be considered when scoping the audit. As a single 
entity, there are no Group scoping considerations and the entity is audited on a full scope basis and hence testing has been 
performed on all material financial statement line items.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our 
audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall materiality $8.0 million
How we determined it 1% of total assets
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
We believe that total assets is an appropriate benchmark for the parent company as this entity is 
principally a holding company. For the purpose of the audit of the Group financial statements 
however, we determined a component materiality for the parent company of $8.0 million on the basis 
the parent company should not have a higher materiality than the overall Group materiality allocation
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $500,000 as 
well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in respect of the 
Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and the Directors’ 
identification of any material uncertainties to the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all 
future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee 
as to the parent company’s 
ability to continue as a 
going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating to going concern in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
138 Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2017 ContourGlobal plc 139 Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 83, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 ― We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 ― Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 ― Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 ― The financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Appointment
We were appointed by the Directors on 13th December 2017 to audit the financial statements for the period ended 31st December 
2017 and subsequent financial periods. This is therefore our first period of uninterrupted engagement.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of ContourGlobal plc for the year ended 31st December 2017.

Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the period ended 31st December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the parent company and of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the parent company
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
 ― The Directors’ confirmation on page 47 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the parent company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity
 ― The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated
 ― The Directors’ explanation on page 47 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the parent company, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the parent company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the parent company and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the parent company. Our 
review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process 
supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding 
of the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
 ― The statement given by the Directors, on page 83, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the parent company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the parent company obtained in 
the course of performing our audit
 ― The section of the Annual Report on page 62 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee
 ― The Directors’ statement relating to the parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)

Companies Act 2006. The Company was incorporated on 
26th September 2017 and adopted FRS 102 from that date.
2. Statement of compliance 
The financial statements of ContourGlobal plc have been 
prepared in compliance with United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102, 
“The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United 
Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the 
Companies Act 2006. 
3.  Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation 
of these financial statements are set out below. The 
policies have been consistently applied throughout the 
period presented. 
3.1. Basis of preparation
The Company financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, as modified for the 
revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities through 
profit or loss. The current year financial information 
presented is for the period ended 31st December 2017. As 
the Company was incorporated on 26th September 2017, 
no comparative period is presented. 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity 
with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its 
judgment in the process of applying the Company’s 
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the financial statements are set 
out below.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, 
an entity profit and loss account is not included as part of 
the published consolidated financial statements of 
ContourGlobal plc. 
3.2. Exemptions for qualifying entities under FRS 102
The Company has taken advantage of the following FRS 
102 disclosure exemptions available to qualifying entities:
 ― The requirements of Section 4 Statement of Financial 
Position 4.12 (a) (iv);
 ― The requirements of Section 7 Statements of Cash Flows;
 ― The requirements of Section 3 Financial Statement 
Presentation paragraph 3.17 (d); and
 ― The requirements of Section 11 Financial Instruments 
paragraphs 11.41(b), 11.41(c), 11.41(e), 11.41 (f), 11.42, 11.44, 
11.47, 11.48(a)(iii), 11.48(a)(iii), 11.48(a)(iv), 11.48(b) and 11.48(c).
3.3. Foreign currency
(i) Functional and presentation currency
The Company’s functional and presentation currency is the 
US Dollar.
(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
functional currency using the spot exchange rate at the 
dates of the transactions.
At each period end foreign currency non-monetary items 
measured at historical cost are translated using the 
exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
3.4. Critical accounting judgments 
and estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires management to exercise their 
judgment in the process of applying the Company’s 
accounting policies. The area involving a higher degree of 
judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the financial statements is:
 ― Carrying value of investments
The Company considers annually whether there is 
any indication of impairment in the carrying value of 
investments in accordance with the accounting policy 
stated. Assessments of this nature involve judgment over 
the economic performance of individual investments, 
changes in the market in which they operate or where 
there are indications that the value of the underlying assets 
have declined during the period which are significantly 
more than expected as a result of the passage of time or 
normal use.
In the event that there is an indicator of impairment, the 
Company performs an impairment assessment to determine 
if the carrying value of the investment is supported by its 
recoverable amount. The determination of the recoverable 
amount is typically the most judgmental part of an 
impairment evaluation. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of: (i) an investment’s fair value less costs of 
disposal (market value); and; (ii) value in use determined 
using estimates of discounted future net cash flows (“DCF”) 
of the investment.
3.5. Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost, less any 
provision for impairment. Annually, the Directors consider 
whether any events or circumstances have occurred that 
could indicate that the carrying amount of fixed asset 
investments may not be recoverable. If such circumstances 
do exist, a full impairment review is undertaken to establish 
whether the carrying amount exceeds the higher of net 
realizable value or value in use. If this is the case, an 
impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value 
of the related investment.
3.6. Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown 
in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
3.7. Taxation
UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be 
paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
3.8. Financial instruments
The Company has chosen to adopt Sections 11 and 12 of 
FRS 102 in respect of financial instruments.
a) Financial assets
Financial assets include trade and other receivables and 
cash and bank balances are initially recognized at transaction 
price and are subsequently carried at amortized cost using 
the effective interest method.

Accounting Policies continued
At the end of each reporting period financial assets 
measured at amortized cost are assessed for objective 
evidence of impairment. If an asset is impaired the 
impairment loss is the difference between the carrying 
amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows 
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. 
The impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the 
impairment is reversed.
The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does 
not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had 
the impairment not previously been recognized. The 
impairment reversal is recognized in profit or loss.
Financial assets are derecognized when: (a) the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are 
settled; or (b) substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the ownership of the asset are transferred to another 
party: or (c) despite having retained some significant risks 
and rewards of ownership, control of the asset has been 
transferred to another party who has the practical ability 
to unilaterally sell the asset to an unrelated third party 
without imposing additional restrictions.
b) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities include trade and other payables 
(including from intercompany Group companies).
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services 
that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business 
from suppliers.
Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if 
payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are 
presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are 
recognized initially at transaction price and subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method.
3.9. Dividend distribution
Dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognized 
as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders in the case of final dividends. In respect of 
interim dividends, these are recognized once paid.
4.  Directors’ Emoluments 
and employees
The Company has no employees other than the Directors. 
Full details of the Directors’ remuneration and interests 
are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 
74 to 78.

The amounts payable to the Company’s auditors in respect 
of the statutory audit were $24,000.

Shareholder information
Warning about unsolicited 
approaches to shareholders and 
“Boiler Room” scams
In recent years, many companies have 
become aware that their shareholders 
have received unsolicited phone calls 
or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. These are 
typically from overseas based 
“brokers” who target UK shareholders, 
offering to sell them what often turn 
out to be worthless or high risk shares 
in UK investments. These operations 
are commonly known as “boiler rooms”. 
These “brokers” can be very 
persistent and persuasive. 
ContourGlobal plc shareholders are 
advised to be extremely wary of such 
approaches and advised to only deal 
with firms authorized by the FCA. You 
can check whether an enquirer is 
properly authorized and report scam 
approaches by contacting the FCA on 
www.fca.org.uk/scams (where you may 
also review the latest scams) or by 
calling the FCA Consumer Helpline: 
0800 111 6768.
