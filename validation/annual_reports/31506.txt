Chairman’s Statement
Clive Carver
“
During the year under review we met
all internal and external targets for the
business. We are confident in our ability
to continue to increase both our
capabilities and shareholder value
moving forward
”
I am pleased to report to shareholders in respect of the year
ended 31 December 2017.
The year under review saw the Company make encouraging
progress to its longer-term objective of being a leading
international provider of regulatory compliance software and
professional services.
Our current focus is on the corporation tax software and
services market in the UK and Ireland. In this business we met
all internal and external targets including increasing our
revenue, contracted annuity base and number of new
customers. Of particular note has been the level of cash
generated from the business, which has allowed us the reduce
debt levels faster than initially planned. Further details of our
progress in 2017 is set out in the following CEO and CFO
reports.
We made significant investments during 2017 to maintain,
update and de-risk our solutions and services in light of the
increasing regulatory landscape. Over time we expect more
demand for automation and process control which is where
we want to provide enhanced functionality and value.
We look forward to extending our technology offering by way
of continued product development and targeted acquisitions.
In particular, in the shorter term, to broaden the range of
taxes covered.
The integration of OSMO, acquired in April 2017, was largely
completed and considered a successful transition. OSMO’s
leading edge technology is now embedded as part of our
core value proposition and helps organisations automate the
collection of data from large accounting / ERP systems. 
We firmly believe we are well placed to exploit the
opportunities that will arise from the ever-greater digitalisation
of tax compliance and in compliance more generally.
We look forward to the future with confidence.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held on
20 June 2018 at 11 am at the offices of K&L Gates, One New
Change, London EC4M 9AF.

04 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
“
I am delighted to report on a
successful year, delivering against our
strategic objectives of growth, retention,
acquisitions, debt reduction and
operational transformation. 
”
2017 has been a year of significant and exciting activity for the
Company on the transformational journey to develop and
upgrade our products and services in order to support our
customer base of large corporates and accountancy firms in
meeting the increasing demands of tax compliance.
Growth: 
During 2017, we achieved year-on-year revenue growth of
17% (10% comparable organic growth) and contracted
annuity base growth of 12% (6% comparable organic growth)
through 114 new annuity licenses added and average order
value growth of 9%. 
This growth was achieved through a combination of activities
including the appointment of a seasoned sales and marketing
director, increased sales and pre-sales activity, incentivisation
of sales staff, better customer negotiation and the launch of
new solutions and services. 
New order intake was driven by additional technology
modules, increased user licenses and cross selling other
portfolio solutions to existing customers. In addition, several
new customers were won. 
New solutions and services launched in the year included
‘Data Entry’ which is designed to help accountancy firms
streamline the process of collecting information from data
owners, and a new service to help organisations with country-
by-country reporting.
We can further improve the sales and marketing engine but
to achieve these results without substantial investment has
been a great success and a credit to the team. 
Retention: 
During 2017, customer retention remained strong at a rate
of 95%, in line with management’s expectations. The high level
of retention is largely due to two factors, the first being that
our core technology solution (Alphatax) continues to deliver
for our customers. 2017 saw the release of the largest finance
bill in UK history and our tax content team did an outstanding
job ensuring the legislation was successfully encoded into our
core product within a timely manner. The architecture of the
technology enables us to do this on a continual basis with a
team that is well versed in the practice with documented
processes and procedures. The second is the focus and quality
of our local support teams, the members of which are
experts in both customer service and tax. These teams are
proud of our Company, solutions and services and have a real
desire to ensure our customers are responded to effectively
and efficiently.
As well as strong customer retention, we also continued to
retain our expert employees. Key activities completed in the
year included restructuring the organisation and individual
accountabilities, establishing the core leadership team,
promoting several internal staff, recruiting new talent, a change
of headquarters, modernisation of the Company brand and
the adoption of ‘agile’ development methodologies. 
I am very pleased with the way employees have embraced
change and would like to thank everyone for their
contribution. We all continue to be excited about the future
and working together to achieve our potential. 
Acquisitions: 
During 2017, we defined our vision and strategy which, along
with having a greater understanding of the market and
customer demand, highlighted a need to quickly provide a
solution to automate the collection of data – the fundamental
building block of any compliance process. 
Having evaluated various options, we completed the
acquisition of OSMO in April 2017 in return for the issue of
4.7 million ordinary shares of the Company, valuing OSMO
at £3.2 million. 
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Gavin Lyons
248502 Tax Systems pp01-pp05  17/05/2018  10:55  Page 04 STRATEGIC REPORT
05 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
OSMO is a leading provider of automated data extraction
services that currently connects to 310 versions of accounting
software packages, whether they be cloud, on premise or
enterprise versions. Using OSMO’s technology, finance and
tax teams can significantly decrease the manual workload
associated with data collection, reduce errors and risk from
re-keying data and increase the speed and accuracy of data
production. OSMO’s solution is an ideal add-on to the existing
software and services that Tax Systems already provides. 
I am pleased with OSMO’s progress to date; the team
delivered against its 2017 performance expectations and have
fitted in well both technically and culturally. We have one final
stage of the integration left which is moving OSMO’s core IT
systems and processes onto our standard operating platform
within shared services. This activity has begun and is expected
to be finished by the end of H1 2018. At that point we can
consider the business fully integrated. 
In addition, further acquisition targets were identified and
considered during the year. Disappointingly we declined to
proceed with two potential targets after finalising the due
diligence process but in both cases it was the right decision
for the business. 
We continue to actively evaluate other acquisition
opportunities but will only proceed where we believe a
business is the right strategic fit and will enhance both the
Company’s offering and shareholder value. 
Debt reduction: 
During 2017, we reduced our net debt by 16% to £20.5m as
a result of our revenue growth, customer retention rate and
excellent cash conversion. In addition, we were also successful
in recovering £0.6m of VAT relating to the fees payable on
the acquisition of T ax Computer Systems Limited (“TCSL”) in
July 2016. 
Net debt at the end of the year represented less than 3x
Adjusted EBITDA. By continuing to focus on sustainable
growth and customer retention we will be able to further
reduce our debt or utilise the facilities to fund further
acquisitions. 
Operational transformation: 
A key focus of the business has been on achieving operational
excellence through its people, processes, systems and facilities
– an absolutely critical requirement of any business but often
over looked and lacking due to the size and complexity of the
implementation of a target operating model. 
Significant time and effort has been put into defining and
achieving this, and, though there is still some tasks to be
completed, I am pleased that the majority of this work has
been done. 
Outlook: 
In summary, I’m pleased to report that we delivered against
all key strategic objectives in the year with the headlines being
revenue growth of 17% and debt reduction of 16%. Moving
forward, the Company will continue to focus on the execution
of its strategy in order to deliver against its goals and vision.
Whilst there is still work to be done to get the business to
where we would like it to be in order to maximise the market
opportunity, I am confident in our ability to achieve this. 
We believe we have the right technology platform from which
to continue to grow, in no small part thanks to the hard work
and talent of our people, whom I would like to thank for their
dedication and contribution to the ongoing success of the
business.
The Board remains confident in the ability of the business to
deliver increasing shareholder value over the coming years. I
look forward to 2018 and beyond with continued passion and
excitement.

06 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
Market Overview
Regulators and media coverage: 
A key focus of the Government, together with the regulators
is to increase tax revenues, reduce tax evasion and ensure
businesses are paying their fair share to support government
spending, reduce national debt and reduce annual deficits
without the need to raise taxes. UK debt levels were at
£1,720 billion for the financial year ending March 2017 which
represented 86.7% of Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”). UK
deficit levels were at £46.9 billion for the same period. 
As a result, there is an ever-increasing collaboration between
governments and agencies, especially since the financial crisis
of 2007 and Panama Papers in 2016. Furthermore, regulators
are introducing a new wave of local and international
compliance obligations along with investing in sophisticated
digital platforms for greater data gathering and analysis, all of
which will assist them in achieving their objectives both
efficiently and sustainably. 
In addition, and due to tax becoming an ever-increasing
headline in the media, how businesses communicate their
approach to tax and the amount of tax paid is a key
component in building trust, reducing reputational risk and
maintaining a good relationship with regulators, shareholders
and customers. 
When it comes to tax, a business’ focus is no longer just about
calculating and submitting the correct tax number, rather
having an agile tax function that can protect it from financial
penalties or reputational damage. This tax function needs to
be able to respond efficiently and accurately to the regulator
in the event of non-compliance or an audit notification whilst
offering proactive expert tax advice on strategic activities such
as mergers and acquisitions, disposals and geographical and
operational structures. 
Growing reporting and transparency
obligations:
In 2017 alone, the UK’s Finance (No.2) Act 2017 was the
longest in recent memory, stretching to 665 pages compared
to 187 pages in Finance Act 2018.
New international reporting including the OECD’s Common
Reporting Standard (“CRS”) and Base Erosion and Profit
Shifting (“BEPS”) have come in to force in both the UK and
Ireland. BEPS requires organisations with a group turnover of
greater than €750 million to submit detailed transactional
information on operations and group transfer pricing for each
country they operate in, on an annual basis.
Furthermore, from 2019, HMRC’s Making T ax Digital (“MTD”)
initiative will modernise the way tax is reported, starting with
VAT and then corporation tax which will result in a four-fold
increase in reporting obligations. The Irish Revenue will be
introducing real-time reporting of payroll taxes from January
2019. 
Last but not least, there is now a legal requirement for all large
businesses operating in the UK to publish their tax strategy if,
in the previous tax year, the business had a turnover above
£200 million or a balance sheet over £2 billion. For groups
and sub-groups, it’s the combined totals of all the relevant
bodies that must be used. 
Regulator investment into digital platforms: 
Regulators are leading the way in creating new digital
platforms for the submission and gathering of tax data.
Submission requirements will vary based on each specific
country, but most will specify a file format, a deadline, along
with the tax and transactions to be included. 
The powerful part of collecting and storing data digitally is
what can then be done by the regulators using analytical
software. Data can be mined, matched and shared to
ultimately find ways of increasing tax collections and creating
new reporting obligations to help meet their objectives. Due
to the level of data regulators will hold, the number of audit
notices is likely to increase which will require swift responses
from businesses and a greater level of quality and accuracy. 
Ultimately, as with any data project, this will end up with the
regulator wanting to consume more and more data so that
they can digest it and analyse how best to monetise the facts
presented. Ultimately, we will end up with the regulator
wanting to ‘drill down’ from any submitted tax number to see
how it has been calculated and via what transactions.

07 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
Customer Challenge Overview
Pain points currently impacting the current
tax function: 
The most commonly cited factors affecting the ability of a tax
team to execute are five-fold which, in no particular order, are
as follows: 
The first is coping with the increased volume and complexity
of regulations so that the business is protected from financial
penalties or reputational damage in the event of non-
compliance. Linked to this is the ability to manage compliance
across multiple jurisdictions and the ability to respond to tax
authorities when under scrutiny. 
The second is the managing of the speed and accuracy of
data – most data is supplied by spreadsheet and requires
manual collaboration between the tax and finance teams both
locally and internationally. Getting consistent and correct data
to be input into tax computations takes time and the difficulty
in obtaining it can affect the quality of data.
The third is the substantial manual effort required and often
a lack of defined and documented activities, processes and
controls in order to ensure that a business is compliant with
the relevant rules and regulations. 
The fourth is underinvestment in technology to automate
manual activities, enforce processes and controls, manage the
risk associated with the completion of the compliance cycle,
provide insight into continuous improvement and calculate
and submit tax computations. 
Last but not least is the level of resources available and the
changing nature of the skillset required from tax professionals.
Such professionals need to have both the technical skills as
well as an ability to adapt to and assist with the continuous
improvement of processes, controls and technology. 
Preparing for future workload:
Due to the changing regulatory and media landscape,
businesses need ensure they have an appropriate tax function
in place that is capable of dealing with the increased pressure
and workloads arising from external compliance and
reporting, an increasing requirement for internal advice
relating to strategic activities as well as increasing internal
governance demanding effective processes. 
Ultimately, the tax function of the future should have the ability
to manage the end to end core tax compliance cycles with
limited risk, supply accurate data in real time (both externally
and internally) and respond to tax enquiries in an efficient and
cost-effective manner. 
Ideally a tax function should have the ability to use the same
data and methodology in relation to all major tax processes
and outputs, be that direct tax, indirect tax or tax provisioning
to name a few. In addition, the tax function of the future
should be fully integrated with the finance function in terms
of data, workflows and controls thereby increasing efficiency
and decreasing the risk of error in exchanging information. 
Technology will be key to achieving all of the above, and Tax
Systems is ideally placed to be able to build on its existing
product set as well as look to develop or acquire new
products in order to help businesses do so.
The customer challenge – outsource,
insource or co-source the tax function? 
The increased regulatory and media attention and resulting
change to tax operating models is driving businesses to
question whether they should outsource, in-source or co-
source their tax function.

continued
STRATEGIC REPORT
08 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
Outsourcing the tax function to an advisor ensures that the
widest range of skills and the highest level of tax expertise
can be leveraged, provides assurance on the output and
removes the effort and challenges associated with finding,
hiring and retaining an internal tax team. However, this can
come at a significant cost. In addition, advisors sometimes do
not have an in-depth understanding of the complexity of each
individual business and so the onus is still on the ‘client’ to
ensure the right data is collected and validated. 
Insourcing helps businesses retain control, drive their own
processes and mitigate tax risk. Investing in technology and
process as opposed to additional headcount delivers an
automated tax function with improved data access, reliability
and accuracy along with greater business insight. 
Businesses looking to do this will need a solution set such as
ours, hence this presents a good opportunity for T ax Systems.
Co-sourcing is a hybrid whereby the business has the benefit
of controlling and managing its core end to end compliance
cycle using technology that they own but still use an external
advisor for what would be considered ‘value add’ and complex
areas.

09 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
Business Overview
Our history and heritage:
T ax Systems’ core operating business was formed in 1991 and
has built up an excellent reputation as a trusted supplier of
corporation tax technology solutions and services. We have
achieved local market leadership, based on the success of our
suite of corporation tax software solutions and services, led
by our flagship offering Alphatax. Since then our solutions have
been continually developed and shaped to serve the evolving
needs of corporation tax departments.
The root cause of the company’s continued success is
fourfold: 
� Our focus on customer service 
� Employing expert resources 
� Substantial intellectual property rights investment creating
a high barrier to market entry 
� Continuously improving the accuracy of our highly
complex compliance engines and complementary
solutions 
Our purpose:
The reason we exist is to help our customers be compliant
with the regulations in the most efficient manner possible and
provide tangible intelligence to continuously improve both the
end to end compliance process and utilisation of expert
resources. We enable customers to do this by developing and
supporting innovative technology and expert service offerings.
Our market and geographical focus:
We operate in the corporation tax compliance and reporting
market serving companies in the UK and Ireland. We sell
directly to our customers via a sales force - we do not sell via
any third-party distributors or resellers. 
Our customer focus:
We currently serve and target large multi-national corporate
companies, accountancy firms, and credit lenders. We have
over 800 corporate clients including 43% of the FTSE 100,
over 200 accountancy firms including 23 out of the top 25
and 8 high profile credit lenders.
Our customers’ key buying criteria:
Over the years, customers have made it clear that their key
buying criteria focus is on the quality, accuracy and reliability
of the product as well as technical expertise. Value for money
is also considered to be very important but overall there is
demand for quality and accuracy rather than low cost. The key
aspects to get right for our customers are: 
� Quality and accuracy of product 
� Ease of use / user experience 
� Technical expertise
� Customer service
� Value for money
Customer loyalty:
We have a customer retention rate of over 95% which
demonstrates that we are delivering against their
requirements above. In the event we lose a customer
(invariably a corporate customer rather than an accountancy
firm) it is due to one of three reasons: 
� If a company decides to outsource the compliance
process to a third party (accountancy firms) 
� If a company wants to move to a single global tax solution
i.e. one company supplying multiple compliance process
solutions 
� If we do not have a solution to a customer need 
Our revenue streams:
We generate revenue from the licensing of software solutions
(multiple products) and sale of professional services. A high
proportion of our revenue comes from annual licensing of
software which means we have good visibility of revenue due
to its recurring nature. 
Our cost structure:
Our business is relatively simple in the sense that circa 75%
of our costs relate to people and the remaining costs are
associated with infrastructure (offices and IT, etc).

Business Overview
continued
Our relationship with HMRC:
We are committed to working closely with HMRC to ensure
a seamless transition to the new ways of working for our
current and future users. We have witnessed and experienced
multiple changes in the UK corporation tax regime before
including when XML and Inline Extensible Business Reporting
Language (“iXBRL”) were introduced. We worked closely with
HMRC to ensure that we brought to market a fully tested
and aligned solution and were the first major corporation tax
software supplier to e-file under both XML and iXBRL.
Our goals:
As a public company we remain continually focused on
delivering value for both our shareholders and customers and
have four goals that drive our business: 
� Increase shareholder value 
� Deliver our market forecasts 
� Define and deliver our customer requirements
� Live and breathe our culture and values
Our vision:
Longer term, we see ourselves as a software and services
company specialising in international regulatory compliance
technology. 
Our business is currently made up of three types of
technology assets: 
Compliance engines and statutory reporting
solutions – technologies that automate regulation into
databases to drive a compliance output and reporting. Right
now, we have two main compliance engines and over time
we expect to develop or acquire other compliance engines. 
Data management engines – technologies that automate
and filter data to work with compliance engines. Right now,
we have three data management engines and over time
expect the data management engines to be able to work
seamlessly with all of our compliance engines so that data is
automatically populated into compliance engines for increased
efficiency and accuracy. 
Process management and Intelligence solutions–as
a result of providing both compliance and data management
engines we will naturally provide other complementary
solutions around the core compliance process that are
required by customers. We currently have solutions to help
organisations manage their end to end compliance process
which also provide intelligence to help people improve this
process, over time we expect to add to that capability. 
In summary, over time, we see the business becoming a
‘RegT ech’ company with multiple compliance engines that help
bridge the gap between companies and regulators by
providing innovative technology and expert services – all of
which will use our data management engines to automate as
much of the process as possible. There is still work to be done
in order to achieve this vision but we are well underway. 
Strategy:
The chosen strategy to help achieve our vision and drive
growth is a ‘buy, build and partner’ strategy. 
Buy – meaning that Tax Systems will look to acquire
companies that will complement our existing or future
customer value proposition. 
Build – meaning that Tax Systems will invest in resources to
grow organically by selling existing and new solutions and
services to existing and new customers. T ax Systems currently
has over 1,000 customers across a range of verticals and has
plenty of scope to ‘retain and penetrate’ those customers with
further solutions as well as acquire new customers. During
2017, we invested over 70% of our wage bill into technical
related resources in order to maintain and re-architect
existing solutions, develop new solutions, new SaaS platform
delivery mechanisms and drive interoperability between them.

complementary third parties to generate revenue and profit
from white labelling i.e. other companies integrating our
technology with theirs as long as it is complementary and
does not dilute our business. During 2017, we explored five
different partnering opportunities but concluded that, in the
short term, alternative acquisition options were our
preference.

The results
1
for the year ended 31 December 2017, which is
the first full year of operations of the Group since the
acquisition of TCSL, were in line with expectations. Cash
generation was particularly strong which resulted in a
reduction in net debt of 16% from £24.4m as at
31 December 2016 to £20.5m as at 31 December 2017.
1 The results for the year ended 31 December 2017 are comprised of the
results for Tax Systems plc and TCSL for the full year together with the
results for OSMO for the nine months from acquisition on 3 April 2017.
The results for the year ended 31 December 2016 are comprised of the
results for Tax Systems plc for the full year together with the results for
TCSL for the five-month period from acquisition on 26 July 2016.
Early adoption of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from
Contracts with Customers’
The new reporting standard on revenue recognition, IFRS 15
‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (“IFRS 15”) has an
effective date of 1 January 2018. However, the Group has
early adopted this standard with an initial application date of
1 January 2017. The early adoption of IFRS 15 has resulted in
changes in the timing of recognition of revenue.
Previously, the licence fee element of software licence
agreements was recognised in the month in which the
agreement commenced. The early adoption of IFRS 15 for the
year ending 31 December 2017 has resulted in a change in
our accounting policy to one of recognising revenue from
software licence agreements evenly over the term of the
agreement. 
The change in policy to IFRS 15 does not impact on the
lifetime profitability of contracts nor the cash flows associated
with contracts.
The main consequences of the change in accounting
policy are:
� Revenue is phased over the life of the software licences
in line with the delivery of outcomes to clients and,
consequently, the timing of profits is re-profiled;
� An increased level of deferred income was recognised. At
31 December 2017, the Group’s balance sheet includes
deferred income of £6.9m in relation to contracts where
outcomes are being delivered over time. The majority of
deferred income will unwind within 12 months and is
expected to be replaced by similar levels, subject to
changes to the contract portfolio; and
� Tax assets increased by £0.8m as a result of the change
in accounting policy.
As permitted by IFRS 15, the Company has applied the
change using a modified retrospective approach for which the
comparative results for 2016 have not been restated. Instead,
a cumulative adjustment has been recognised to opening
retained earnings at 1 January 2017 in relation to agreements
which still required performance by the Group at that date. 
Revenue and gross margin
Revenue for the year to 31 December 2017 amounted to
£15.1m (2016: £5.8m) from a mixture of sales of licenced
software solutions and services mostly to large blue-chip
corporates and major accountancy firms. 89% (2016: 87%) of
revenue was derived in the UK with the balance from Ireland.
Revenue from annually renewable software licences
amounted to £13.5m (2016: £5.0m), representing 90% (2016:
86%) of total revenue. This revenue stream provides the
Group with a strong recurring revenue model.
The acquisition of OSMO contributed £1.0m to total
revenue, comprised of £0.8m from licences and £0.2m from
professional services.
Gross profit amounted to £14.0m (2016: £5.4m) after
accounting for cost of sales which comprised of directly
attributable staff costs and third-party hosting costs. The
corresponding gross margin is 93% (2016: 93%).
Operating costs
T otal operating costs for the year were £14.2m (2016: £8.6m).
The increase was largely driven by the full year impact of the
248502 Tax Systems pp06-pp17  17/05/2018  10:57  Page 12 STRATEGIC REPORT

operating costs of TCSL, the costs of OSMO since acquisition
and the full year charge for amortisation and depreciation of
£6.4m.

T otal operating costs 14.2 8.6
Operating loss, EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA
The operating loss for the year was £0.2m (2016: loss £3.2m).
The Directors use Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure
in order to assess the underlying performance of the Group
and to incentivise management. This measure allows
management and investors to compare performance without
the potentially distorting effects of one-off items, non-
operational items and the charge for non-cash share based
payments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating profit or
loss before exceptional items, depreciation, amortisation and
share-based payments.
Adjusted EBITDA amounted to £7.0m (2016: £2.7m) for the
year. A reconciliation of operating loss to Adjusted EBITDA is
as follows:
2017 2016
£’m £’m
Operating loss (0.2) (3.2)
Amortisation and depreciation 6.3 2.6 
EBITDA 6.1 (0.6)
Share based payments 0.2 – 
Transaction and restructuring costs 0.7 3.3 
Adjusted EBITDA 7.0 2.7 
Net finance costs
Net finance costs for the year amounted to £1.6m (2016:
£0.8m), principally made up of interest payable on bank
borrowings and unsecured loan notes of £1.2m (2016:
£0.6m), together with a non-cash effective interest charge of
£0.4m (2016 £0.2m) on the equity settled element of the
cost of the loan notes.
Loss before tax
The Group reported a loss before tax of £1.9m in 2017
(2016: £4.0m). The loss for the year is after accounting for an
amortisation charge of £6.3m (2016: £2.6m) as a result of the
significant value of intangible assets attributed to customer
contracts and intellectual property rights.
Tax
The tax credit for the year was £1.4m (2016: £0.3m). The
credit for 2017 was principally represented by adjustments in
respect of prior years, which mainly arose from the submission
of enhanced R&D tax claims.
Statutory loss after tax
The reported loss after tax was £0.5m (2016: loss £3.7m).
Earnings per share
Basic loss per share was 0.59p (2016: 9.82p). 
OSMO acquisition
On 3 April 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of
the entire issued share capital of OSMO for £3.2m settled by
the issue of 4,701,492 ordinary shares of 1p each in the capital
of the Company (“Ordinary Shares”) at a price of 68p per
share.
Long T erm Incentive Plan and warrants
The Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) was
established to incentivise certain directors and senior
executives of the Group. 
On 2 August 2017, the number of warrants issued to MXC
Capital Limited (“MXC”) was adjusted to reduce the
entitlement of MXC to 4% of the fully diluted share capital,
down from 6%, so that the pool available to management
under the LTIP could be increased from 6% to 8% of
shareholder value created.

STRATEGIC REPORT
14 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
The LTIP awards are structured as Growth Shares in Tax
Systems Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company. Beneficiaries will share in a pool of up to 8% of
shareholder value which is defined as the growth in value in
the market capitalisation of the Company from the date of
its re-admission to trading on AIM on 26 July 2016 as adjusted
for further share issuance and capital returns if any. At the
reporting date, LTIP awards equal to 8.0% (2016: 5.3%) of the
growth in value have been made.
At 31 December 2017 MXC had warrants to subscribe for
3,362,641 Ordinary Shares (2016: 4,851,184 Ordinary
Shares) at a price of 67p and 61p per share. The Company
also has granted the Business Growth Fund (“BGF”) an option
to subscribe for 5,970,149 Ordinary Shares at a price of 67p. 
The Board intends, in due course, to purchase a limited
number of Ordinary Shares to set up a new LTIP scheme
principally for the benefit of existing employees not included
in the current scheme and staff either yet to join or who will
become part of the Group by way of acquisition.

STRATEGIC REPORT
15 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term performance.
The Board has overall responsibility for managing risk. Risks are formally identified and recorded in a risk register which is reviewed
by the Board and appropriate processes are in place to implement and monitor mitigating controls. The Group has a delegation of
authorities that clearly sets out the approval required for key activities, including those restricted to the Board and the Executive
Directors.
The Audit and Risk Committee, which includes the independent Non-Executive Directors, monitors and promotes the highest
standards of integrity, financial reporting, risk management and internal control.
As reported in the CEO statement, there has been a significant level of activity at an operating level during 2017 including
documenting the Group’s longer term goals, vision, strategy and target operating model. From a risk perspective we have a fully
aligned organisation with individual accountability and objectives in place to not only grow the business but also manage risk. The
Executive Directors are closely involved in the day-to-day management of the business and have oversight of all the controls the
business has in place, including financial, operational and compliance controls, as well as overseeing risk management. 
In addition, in order to assist with the management of risks, the Group continues to recruit individuals who are expert in our
markets, technology and support disciplines. 
Data protection and privacy practices are essential for the Group. The implementation of the EU General Data Protection
Regulations ("GDPR") planned for May 2018 is therefore a critical project for us. We are working to ensure that we are ready, and
to help our customers be ready too. Subject to specific local data laws, GDPR will be the standard against which we will assess all
of our future data protection activities. The key risks to which the Group is exposed are set out on the following page.
Risk area and potential impact T arget Operating Model linkage Management of risks
Market competition and
product development
The market in which the Group
operates is technology driven and
competitive. The Group may fail to
develop its technology portfolio to meet
customer demand. Developments by
competitors, new entrants and alliances
may render the Group’s current and
proposed products and services
obsolete. Superior technology and
increased competition may cause price
reductions, reduced margins and loss of
market share.
Technology interoperability and
architecture contains five objectives.
Product & services performance and
investment decisions contains four
specific objectives.
Market, product & services analysis
contains five specific objectives.
For all of the above, the CTO is
accountable for delivery with delegation
of responsibility down to team
members.
The Group is building an integrated end
to end tax compliance solution by
making substantial investment in the
development of its products and
services in order to meet the challenge
of ever increasing levels of technological
advancements. This also has the effect of
reducing the Group’s reliance on
Alphatax. The Group also continually
monitors the market place for
competitor developments.

Risk area and potential impact T arget Operating Model linkage Management of risks
Breach of data integrity and
confidentiality
There may be threats to the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of
the information systems and information
that the Group holds about and on
behalf of its customers and staff. This
could impact the Group’s operations,
result in fines and undermine customer
trust in the Group’s business and brand
leading to a loss of customers.
End to end systems, data and security
infrastructure contains four specific
objectives.
For all of the above, the CFO is
accountable for delivery with delegation
of responsibility down to team members.
The Group implements and maintains
controls, processes and tools that ensure
continuity of information systems and
the confidentiality and integrity of
confidential and sensitive information.
The Group’s technical team includes a
number of experienced IT security
professionals, and the Group uses third
party providers’ expertise as
appropriate.
Governmental developments
Governments may introduce new tax
compliance portals and procedures
requiring changes to the Group’s
technology suite. Revision of the
frequency and timing of the Chancellor’s
budget statements may impact the
Group’s ability to respond with updates
leading to product inoperability due to
non-current tax rules being
incorporated in the software. This may
lead to loss of customers and faith in the
Group’s products.
Legislation development is a
fundamental core of the entire business
and doesn’t need to be transformed
under the Target Operating Model. This
is therefore listed as a ‘maintain’
function which links in with release
management. 
For all of the above, the CTO is
accountable for delivery with delegation
of responsibility down to team members.
The Group is a member of HMRC’s
software development group and
therefore it keeps up to date with and
has advanced warning of potential
changes to the corporation tax regime
and timing thereof, allowing it to adapt
and update its products in a timely
fashion. Our products are continually
being upgraded and extended in order
to ensure that we meet timing and
transparency demands.
Undetected defects in the
software
The Group’s business involves providing
customers with reliable software. If the
software contains undetected defects
when first introduced or when upgraded
or enhanced, the Group’s customers
may suffer incorrect tax computations.
As a result, the Group may lose
customers or become liable to its
customers for damages.
Product quality contains two specific
objectives.
Product & services release management
contains two specific objectives.
Product & services maintenance
contains two specific measures.
For all of the above, the CTO is
accountable for delivery with delegation
of responsibility down to team members.
The Group has dedicated tax and
technical teams which focus on product
integrity and testing to help reduce
errors in tax computations. The Group
also continues to invest in best of breed
development and test automation
technologies to ensure there is full
visibility and traceability of the end to
end software development and
management process.

strategy.
Employer recruitment, experience,

Management & leadership development
contains four specific objectives.
For all of the above, the CFO is

The Group has a senior management
team and places a significant emphasis
on staff retention. Key management and
staff are incentivised via bonus plans and
share schemes; a new Long Term
Incentive Scheme was established during
the year under review to achieve this.
Acquisitions
The Group may fail to execute its
acquisition and partnerships strategy
successfully which may impact on the
Group’s ability to build an end to end tax
solution and consequently on the
Group’s financial performance.
Corporate development contains four
specific objectives. 
For all of the above, the CEO is
accountable for delivery with delegation
of responsibility down to team members.
The Group continually monitors market
developments and together with its
M&A advisor and broker, regularly
evaluates potential acquisitions and
partners. Before an acquisition is made,
the Group commissions financial and
legal due diligence to highlight potential
risks and mitigate them where possible.

Corporate Governance Report
The Board is committed to the maintenance of high standards
of corporate governance and seeks to implement best
practice as appropriate for smaller listed companies by
reference to the provisions of the Quoted Companies
Alliance’s Corporate Governance Code for Small and Mid-
Size Quoted Companies. 
The Board of Directors and Committees
The Board is responsible for setting the overall strategy of the
business, reviewing management performance and ensuring
the Group has sufficient financial and human resources to
meet its objectives. It directs the Group’s activities in an
effective manner through general Board meetings and
monitors performance through timely and relevant reporting
procedures. Where it deems necessary, the Board requests
reports on specific areas outside the normal reporting regime.
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board
and ensuring its effectiveness. 
The Board at present comprises two Executives (the CEO
and the CFO) and three Non-Executive Directors. The size
of the Board is considered to be appropriate to the current
size and character of the Group. Clive Carver and Linda Beal
are independent of management and any business or other
relationships which would interfere with the exercise of their
independent judgement.
Authority for the execution of the business plan and the daily
running of the business is delegated to the Executive
Directors and the senior management team, who meet
regularly to review current business performance, sales
activity, operational projects, customer service, human

Role and responsibilities
The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring
the integrity of the Company’s financial statements, reviewing
significant financial reporting issues, reviewing the effectiveness
of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems,
monitoring the need for or the effectiveness of the internal
audit function and overseeing the relationship with the
Auditor (including advising on their appointment, agreeing the
scope of the audit and reviewing the audit findings). The Audit
and Risk Committee also reviews the nature and amount of
non-audit work undertaken by the Auditor, if any, to satisfy
itself that there is no effect on its independence. The
Committee is satisfied that Crowe Clark Whitehill is
independent.
Composition of the Audit and Risk
Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee comprises Linda Beal, Clive
Carver and Paul Gibson and is chaired by Linda Beal. The
Committee meets at least twice a year at appropriate times
in the reporting and audit cycle and otherwise as required.
The Committee also meets regularly with the Company’s
Auditor.
Risk management and internal controls
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal
controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The
implementation and maintenance of the risk management and
internal control systems are the responsibility of the Executive
Directors and senior management. Such systems are designed
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board confirms that there are ongoing processes for
identifying, evaluating and mitigating the significant risks faced
by the Group.
The key procedures that have been established for internal
controls are as follows:
➢ An established operational management structure with
clearly defined responsibilities and regular performance
reviews; 
➢ A comprehensive system for reporting financial and non-
financial information to the Board, including review of
annual budgets and strategy plans;
➢ Detailed monthly budgeting and reporting of trading
results, balance sheets and cash flows, with regular review
by management and the Board of variances from budget;
➢ The control of key financial risks through appropriate
authorisation levels and segregation of accounting duties;
and
➢ Review of reports issued by the external auditor.
The Committee regularly reviews the overall assessment of
the principal risks and the management actions and mitigation
in place as set out in the Risk Register. The Risk Register is
presented to the Board for formal review on a biannual basis
and progress on matters is presented throughout the year
through executive reporting.

shareholders. The Company believes it is important to explain
business development and financial results to its shareholders
and to ensure that suitable arrangements are in place so that
the issues and concerns of major shareholders are heard and
understood.
Copies of the Annual Report and Accounts are issued to all
shareholders who have requested them and copies are
available on the Group’s investor website
www.taxsystems.com. The Group’s interim results are also
made available on the Company’s website. The Group makes
full use of its investor website to provide information to
shareholders and other interested parties.
Shareholders are given the opportunity to raise questions at
the Annual General Meeting and the Directors are available
both before and after the meeting for further discussion with
shareholders. As a matter of policy, the level of proxy votes
(for, against and vote withheld) lodged on each resolution is
declared at the meeting.
The CEO and CFO are primarily responsible for investor
relations. Meetings are offered to major institutional
shareholders to discuss strategy, financial performance and
investment activity immediately after the full year and interim
results announcements. All the Non-Executive Directors are
available to meet with major shareholders if such meetings
are required. Feedback from such meetings with shareholders
is provided to the Board to ensure the Directors have a
balanced understanding of the issues and concerns of major
shareholders. Trading updates and press releases are issued as
appropriate and the Group’s brokers provide briefings on
shareholder opinion and compile independent feedback from
investor meetings.
External auditors
The Audit and Risk Committee reports to the Board on the
effectiveness of the Auditor and receives information from
the Executive team in this regard. The Audit and Risk
Committee and the Board also consider the appointment of
the Auditor annually prior to recommending the appointment
of the Auditor at the Annual General Meeting in June.
Significant reporting and accounting matters
The Committee met over the course of the year to receive
and consider:
➢ Updates on financial reporting and significant accounting
matters. The change of accounting policy for revenue
recognition was addressed in preparing the Group’s
financial statements;
➢ Significant costs were incurred on the business
transformation activities for the move to a new operating
model and the recognition of these costs as non-recurring
items has been an area of focus; 
➢ The appropriateness of the accounting treatment applied
for the acquisition of OSMO together with the
judgements and estimations applied;
➢ Impairment testing and the recoverability of goodwill was
considered including the key inputs to forecast future cash
flows, discount rates and growth rates.
Following the completion of each of these areas, the
Committee was satisfied that the accounting policies,
judgements and estimates applied and the disclosures made
about them in the financial statements were appropriate.

General policy
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee determines,
on behalf of the Board, the Company’s policy for executive
remuneration and the individual remuneration packages for
the Executive Directors. The Remuneration and Nomination
Committee determines the detailed terms of service of the
Executive Directors, including basic salary, incentives and
benefits and the terms upon which their service may be
terminated.
The Group’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors is
designed to attract, retain and motivate executives of the
highest calibre to ensure the Group is managed successfully
to the benefit of shareholders.
In setting remuneration levels, the Remuneration and
Nomination Committee takes into consideration
remuneration within the Group and the remuneration
practices in other companies of a similar size in the markets
and locations in which Tax Systems operates. The packages
are designed to be competitive in value to those offered to
the Directors of similar sized public companies in related
sectors. It is the Board’s policy to align the long-term interests
of managers with those of our shareholders in the granting
of options and other equity rewards.
Remuneration of Executive Directors
The remuneration packages comprise the following
components:
� Basic salary
Basic salary is based on a number of factors including
market rates together with the individual director’s
experience, responsibilities and performance. Car
allowances form part of an Executive Director’s basic
salary.
� Bonus scheme
The Company operates an annual performance related
bonus scheme for Executive Directors. The bonus scheme
is discretionary and dependent on the performance of
the individual and the Group. The performance criteria
for the year are set by reference to targets for Adjusted
EBITDA and net debt.
� Pensions
The Company makes payments into defined contribution
Personal Pension Plans on behalf of the Executive
Directors. These payments were at a rate of 1% and with
effect from 1 April 2018 will be at 2% of basic salary.
� LTIP
Under the LTIP participants are entitled to receive a share
of shareholder value created, subject to achievement of
share price and employment related performance criteria.
Further information can be found in the Directors’ Report
on page 26 and in note 24 of the financial statements.
� Other benefits
The Executive Directors are entitled to receive the
benefit of private medical insurance and income
protection insurance.
The CEO and CFO are engaged under service contracts
which require a notice period of six months.

Directors’ Report
The Directors present their report and the audited financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. This
Directors’ Report contains certain statutory, regulatory and
other information and incorporates, by reference, the
Strategic Report and Governance Review included earlier in
this document.
Strategic report
This Annual Report and Accounts has been prepared to
provide shareholders with a fair and balanced review of the
Group’s business and the outlook for the future development
of the Group as well as the principal risks and uncertainties
which could affect the Group’s performance.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the Group during the year was the
supply of tax compliance software and services to large
corporates and the accountancy profession in the UK and
Ireland.
Results and dividends
Details of the Group’s results are set out in the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income on page 33. The
Group’s loss for the year after taxation amounted to £0.5m
(2016: loss £3.7m). The Directors do not propose a dividend
for the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: £nil).
Directors
The current Directors of the Company are shown on
pages 18 and 19. Clive Carver and Linda Beal, as Non-
Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Director respectively,
were considered to be independent of management and any
business or other relationships which could interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement.
Kevin Goggin and Paul Gibson were appointed to the Board
on 3 April 2017.
Directors’ interests in shares
At 31 December 2017, Gavin Lyons held 149,254 ordinary
shares representing 0.2% of the issued share capital. No other
director had a beneficial interest in the ordinary shares.
LTIP
An LTIP scheme was introduced in July 2016 to provide an
effective mechanism for senior executives to participate in the
Company’s equity, aligning their interests with those of
shareholders. The LTIP scheme was amended in August 2017
to increase the participation available to management from
6% to 8%. At the same time, MXC agreed to reduce its
warrants over the fully diluted share capital of the Company
from 6% to 4%. There was therefore no change to the overall
dilution to shareholders as a result of this modification. Details
of the LTIP are set out in note 24 to the financial statements.
The directors participating in the scheme at the date of this
report and their respective entitlement to the growth in value
of market capitalisation of the Company are as follows:
Gavin Lyons 3.2%
K Goggin 0.5%
Paul Gibson 1.0%
Directors’ indemnity and insurance
The Group maintained insurance cover during the year for its
Directors and Officers under a Directors and Officers liability
insurance policy against liabilities that may be incurred by
them while carrying out their duties.
Substantial shareholders
At 29 March 2018, shareholders with a beneficial holding of
more than 3% of the Company’s issued share capital were as
follows:
Number % of issued
of ordinary share
shares capital
1798 V olantis 16,004,466 19.8%

Share capital and reserves
Details of changes in the authorised and issued share capital
and reserves of the Company are shown in note 23 to the
financial statements.
On 3 April 2018, Tax Systems completed the acquisition of
OSMO in return for the issue of 4,701,492 ordinary shares
in the capital of the Company. Further details are set out in
note 30 to the financial statements.
Employees
As at the date of this report, the Group employed 90 people.
The Group’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees
matters likely to affect employees’ interests. The Group
systematically provides employees with information on
matters of concern to them, consulting them or their
representatives regularly, so that their views can be taken into
account when making decisions that are likely to affect their
interests. Employee involvement in the Group is encouraged,
as achieving a common awareness on the part of all
employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the
Group plays a major role in maintaining its relationship with
its staff.
The Group is committed to employment policies which
follow best practice, based on equal opportunities for all
employees, irrespective of ethnic origin, religion, political
opinion, gender, marital status, disability, age or sexual
orientation. 
Applications for employment by disabled persons are fully
considered, bearing in mind the respective aptitudes and
abilities of the applicants concerned. In the event of members
of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that
their employment with the Group continues and that
appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group
that the training, career development and promotion of
disabled employees should, as far as possible, be identical with
that of other employees.
Environmental policy
The Group acknowledges the importance of environmental
matters and where possible uses environmentally friendly
policies in its offices, such as recycling and energy-efficient
practices.
Health and safety
The Group aims to provide and maintain a safe working
environment for all colleagues and visitors to its premises, and
to comply with all relevant UK health and safety legislation.
Health and safety matters are delegated to representatives
within the business, who can raise any issues arising via a
number of means, including the corporate risk register whose
highest rated risks are reviewed periodically by the Board.
Financial risk management objectives and
policies
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies
are described in note 3 to the financial statements.
Research and development
The Group capitalised £1.2m (2016: £0.4m) during the year
on development of software products.
Charitable and political donations
The Group has made no charitable or political donations in
the year (2016: £nil).
Going concern
The Directors, having made suitable enquiries and analysis of
the accounts, consider that the Group has adequate resources
to continue in business for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the financial statements. In making this
assessment, the Directors have considered the Group’s
budget, cash flow forecasts, available banking facilities and
levels of recurring revenue.
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this
Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are aware, there
is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s
auditor is unaware; and all Directors have taken the steps that
they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s
auditors are aware of that information.

28 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual
Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the
Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial
year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare
the financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the
European Union and applicable law.
Under Company law, the Directors must not approve the
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors
are required to:
➢ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
➢ make judgements and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
➢ state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union have been followed subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained; and
➢ prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy
at the time the financial position of the Company and enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.
The Directors are further responsible for ensuring that the
Strategic Report and Report of the Directors and other
information included in the Annual Report and financial
statements are prepared in accordance with applicable law in
the United Kingdom.
The maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial
information included on the Company’s website is the
responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve the consideration of these matters
and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any
changes that may have occurred to the financial statements
since they were presented on the website. Legislation in the
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 11 a.m. on
20 June 2018. Details and an explanation of the resolutions
to be proposed are contained in the Notice of Annual
General Meeting and explanatory notes either sent to
shareholders with the Annual Report or available on the
Company’s website, www.taxsystems.com.
Auditors
Crowe Clark Whitehill LLP have expressed their willingness
to continue in office as auditors and a resolution to appoint
them and authorise the Directors to determine their
remuneration for the ensuing year will be proposed at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Tax Systems plc
(the “Parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for
the year ended 31 December 2017, which comprise:
� the Group statement of comprehensive income for the
year ended 31 December 2017;
� the Group and parent company statements of financial
position as at 31 December 2017;
� the Group and parent company statements of cash flows
for the year then ended;
� the Group and parent company statements of changes in
equity for the year then ended; and
� the notes to the financial statements, including a summary
of significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in
the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law
and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as
adopted by the European Union.
In our opinion:
� the financial statements give a true and fair view of the
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company's affairs
as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the
period then ended;
� the group financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union; 
� the parent company financial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted
by the European Union as applied in accordance with the
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
� the financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements section of our report. We are
independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters
in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you
when:
� The directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements
is not appropriate; or
� The directors have not disclosed in the financial
statements any identified material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the parent
company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months
from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue. 
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
In planning and performing our audit we applied the concept
of materiality. An item is considered material if it could
reasonably be expected to change the economic decisions of
a user of the financial statements. We used the concept of
materiality to both focus our testing and to evaluate the
impact of misstatements identified.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined overall
materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to
be £350,000, which represents 5% of Adjusted EBITDA
(2016: £300,000).  We used that benchmark because of the
importance of Adjusted EBITDA for shareholders in assessing
the performance of the Group.
Independent Auditor’s report
to the members of Tax Systems Plc
248502 Tax Systems pp29-pp32  17/05/2018  11:12  Page 29 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
30 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
Independent Auditor’s report
to the members of Tax Systems Plc continued
We use a different level of materiality (“performance
materiality”) to determine the extent of our testing for the
audit of the financial statements.  Performance materiality is
set based on the audit materiality as adjusted for the
judgements made as to the entity risk and our evaluation of
the specific risk of each audit area having regard to the internal
control environment.  
Where considered appropriate performance materiality may
be reduced to a lower level, such as, for related party
transactions and directors’ remuneration.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all
identified errors in excess of £10,000. Errors below that
threshold would also be reported to it if, in our opinion as
auditor, disclosure was required on qualitative grounds.
Overview of the scope of our audit
Tax Systems Plc and its subsidiaries are accounted for from
one operating location in the UK. Our audit was conducted
from the main operating location and all subsidiary companies
were within the scope of our audit testing, including Osmo
Data Technology Limited which was acquired by the Group
in April 2017.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the
financial statements of the current period and include the
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement
(whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the
overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit;
and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these
matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How the scope of our audit addressed the key audit matter
We performed substantive testing to determine whether the change
of accounting policy on adoption of IFRS 15 had been correctly
applied. We also performed substantive testing with respect to the
revenue recognised during the year, including deferred revenue.
We assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the
financial statements, including disclosures related to the adoption of
IFRS 15.
Revenue recognition
The board of the Parent Company elected to early
adopt IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with
Customers’ for the year ended 31 December 2017. The
Group has applied the consequent change in accounting
policy using a modified retrospective approach in which
the comparative results for 2016 have not been
restated, instead a cumulative adjustment has been
recognised through retained earnings at 1 January 2017
in relation to agreements which still required
performance by the Group at that date.
248502 Tax Systems pp29-pp32  17/05/2018  11:12  Page 30 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
Key audit matter How the scope of our audit addressed the key audit matter
We obtained management’s impairment review of the existing
goodwill and intangible assets recognised on acquisition of TCSL in
the prior year and consider that this continues to support the carrying
values of these assets, details of which are included in Note 12 to the
financial statements.
We obtained management's assessment of the fair values of the net
assets of OSMO acquired by the Group during the year, together with
the valuation of the intangible assets and goodwill arising, as further
explained in Note 30 to the financial statements. We challenged
management on the valuation basis and assumptions.
We also tested the additions and carrying value of the capitalised
development costs, set out in Note 12.
Carrying value of goodwill and other
intangible assets
The Group acquired Tax Computer Systems Ltd
(“TCSL”) in the prior year and OSMO Data T echnology
Ltd (“OSMO”) in the current year.  As a result,
intangible assets and goodwill have been recognised in
the financial statements. 
TCSL also recognises an intangible asset arising from
capitalised software development costs.
Our audit procedures in relation to these matters were
designed in the context of our audit opinion as a whole. They
were not designed to enable us to express an opinion on these
matters individually and we express no such opinion.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The
other information comprises the information included in the
annual report, other than the financial statements and our
auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify
such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements,
we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement
of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of
our audit 
� the information given in the strategic report and the
directors' report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial
statements; and
� the directors’ report and strategic report have been
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by
exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and
the parent company and their environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material
misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,
in our opinion:
� adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or
� the parent company financial statements are not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
248502 Tax Systems pp29-pp32  17/05/2018  11:12  Page 31 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
32 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
� certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified
by law are not made; or
� we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of the directors for the
financial statements
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities
statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they
give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation
of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are
responsible for assessing the group’s and parent company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to
liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
39 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
1. General information
T ax Systems plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the Group”) are leading suppliers of corporation tax and associated
software and services to large corporates and accountancy firms in both the UK and Ireland. The Group is headquartered in the
UK and during the year ended 31 December 2017 operated ventures in the UK and Ireland.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded on
the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (“AIM”). The registered number of the Company is 04998151 and its registered
office is Magna House, 18-32 London Road, Staines-upon-Thames TW18 4BP .
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. The policies
are the same as those used in preparing the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2016, unless otherwise stated.
2.1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of T ax Systems plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS as adopted by the EU”), IFRS Interpretations Committee and the
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared
under the historical cost convention, as modified, where applicable, by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities
(including derivatives) at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies (see note 4).
The results for the year ended 31 December 2017 are comprised of the results for Tax Systems plc and Tax Computer Systems
Limited and its subsidiaries (“TCSL”) for the full year together with the results for Osmo Data Technology Limited (“OSMO”) for
the nine months from acquisition on 3 April 2017. The results for the year ended 31 December 2016 are comprised of the results
for Tax Systems plc for the full year together with the results for TCSL for the five-month period from acquisition on 26 July 2016.
2.1.1. Going concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The Group meets its day to day working
capital requirements through its existing cash resources and borrowing facilities which are sufficient to meet currently maturing
obligations as they fall due. The Directors have reviewed the Group’s financial projections including sensitivities for at least the next
12 months and have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly these financial statements are prepared
on the going concern basis.
2.1.2. New standards and interpretations
New standards adopted in year
The Company has reviewed the way that it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers and has early adopted the new
reporting standard on revenue recognition, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (“IFRS 15”). The Company has
applied a consequent change in accounting policy by using a modified retrospective approach in which the comparative results for
2016 have not been restated, instead a cumulative adjustment has been recognised through retained earnings at 1 January 2017
in relation to agreements which still required performance by the Company at that date. Further details in relation to the changes
are set out in note 32.

40 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Future standards
The Directors have considered those Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in the Financial Statements but
are relevant to the Group’s operations, that are in issue but not yet effective and, with the exception of IFRS 16 and IFRS 9 referred
to below, do not consider that any will have a material impact on the future results of the Group.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. Under the provisions of the standard most leases,
including the majority of those previously classified as operating leases, will be brought onto the statement of financial position, as
both a right-of-use asset and a largely offsetting lease liability. The right-of-use asset and lease liability are both based on the present
value of lease payments due over the term of the lease, with the asset being depreciated in accordance with IAS 16 ‘Property,
Plant and Equipment’ and the liability increased for the accretion of interest and reduced by lease payments.
The substantial majority of the Group’s operating lease commitments, approximately £1,074,000 on an undiscounted basis (see
note 28) would be brought on balance sheet and depreciated separately. There will be no impact on cash flows although the
presentation of the cash flow statement will change significantly. Management is currently working on its detailed assessment of the
impact of compliance with this accounting standard.
The Directors are in the process of considering the potential changes that may occur to the financial statements under IFRS 9
‘Financial Instruments’, which will apply to periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. It is not expected that the application
of IFRS 9 will have a material impact on the Group’s results. There are no other new or amended accounting standards relevant
to the Group that were effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2017 that have a material impact on
the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
2.2. Consolidation
The financial information consolidates the financial statements of Tax Systems plc and the entities controlled by the Company. 
Subsidiaries are all entities over whose financial and operating policies the Group has the power to govern so as to obtain economic
benefits from its activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and
effect of the potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group
controls another entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to
the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Accounting
policies of subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. The consideration transferred
for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests
issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date
fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is
recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Gains on acquisitions may arise where the acquisition date fair
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree exceeds the book value of that interest.

41 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.2. Consolidation (continued)
The Company completed the acquisition of the entire shareholding of OSMO on 3 April 2017 for £3,197,000 by the issue of
shares. The Company completed the acquisition of the entire shareholding of TCSL on 26 July 2016 for an enterprise value of
£73,000,000, a reverse acquisition under the AIM Rules. Both acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method
of accounting. See note 30 for more details.
2.3. Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received and receivable for the sale of goods and services provided to customers,
net of discounts and value added taxes. Revenue is disaggregated into revenue from the sale of licenced software solutions and
revenue for professional services.
Revenue from licenced software solutions
Customers predominantly enter into software licences to use the Group’s software products. Software licenses are contractual
arrangements whereby the customer purchases the right to continuously exploit the licenced functionality of the Group’s products,
including the right to be kept continuously updated and supported by the Group, over a fixed term of predominantly, 12 months.
Revenue from software licences is recognised evenly over the period of the licences.
This represents a change in accounting policy for software licences as a consequence of adopting IFRS 15. Previously the Group’s
policy had been to recognise revenue from software licences predominantly on commencement of the licence period. 
Further details of the changes are set out in note 32.
Revenue from professional services
The Group derives revenues from the sale of professional services separate to licensed software solutions. The most significant
components of professional services revenues are currently derived from iXBRL tagging and from projects involving implementation
and installation management and the provision of technical support. Contracts with customers for the sale of professional services
are predominantly of a short duration and have specific outcomes which the Group considers to comprise its performance obligations.
Contracts for the sale of professional services can be contracted on a time and materials or fixed fee basis. Revenue from both
types of contract are recognised on fulfilment of the relevant performance obligation and are invoiced on the agreed basis.
Amounts which meet the Group’s revenue recognition policy which have not yet been invoiced are accounted for as accrued
income whereas amounts invoiced which have not met the Group’s revenue recognition criteria are deferred and are accounted
for as deferred income until such time as the revenue can be recognised. Management makes an assessment of the certainty of
any accrued revenue amounts in determining how much revenue to recognise.
2.4. Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. During the year
ended 31 December 2017, the Group had one single operating segment, being the provision of software and services to corporates
and accountancy firms.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.5. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or creation of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income during the financial year in
which they are incurred.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their costs, over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Estimated useful lives 
Fixtures and fittings 4 years 
Computer equipment 3 – 4 years 
Leasehold improvements Lower of 10 years or the term of the lease to the first break 
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed for impairment, and adjusted if appropriate, at each year end reporting
date. Impairment is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
is the higher of an asset’s fair value, less costs to sell, and the value in use, by reference to discounted future cash flow. Any impairment
is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within the
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Fully depreciated assets are been treated as disposals as they have no residual value.
2.6. Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. It
is held in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued at the closing rate at the reporting date. Goodwill on acquisition of
subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the profit or loss recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on disposal.
2.7. Other intangible assets
Expenditure incurred in the development of software products, and their related intellectual property rights, is capitalised as an
intangible asset only when technical feasibility has been demonstrated, adequate technical, financial and other resources exist to
complete the development, which the Group intends to complete and use, future economic benefits expected to arise are deemed
probable, and the costs can be reliably measured. Research costs and development costs not meeting these criteria are expensed
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred. Capitalised development costs are amortised as a charge to the Statement
of Comprehensive Income within amortisation on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives. Capitalised development
costs for assets which are not yet in use are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate a potential impairment. Separately acquired licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation.

recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. These assets have finite useful lives and are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation.
Amortisation on the assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
Customer relationships 10 years 
Intellectual property rights 10 years 
Purchased software licences 3 – 7 years 
Capitalised development costs 3 – 7 years 
2.8. Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment,
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation
or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped into cash-generating units at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Goodwill is allocated to each cash-generating unit (“CGU”) for the purpose of impairment reviews (see note 12). The Group
currently operates under a single CGU, which reflects the way that the businesses are managed. Non-financial assets other than
goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
2.9. Financial instruments
2.9.1. Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets, and cash and cash equivalents, as loans and receivables. The classification depends on the
purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial
recognition.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of reporting period date.
These are classified as non-current assets.
The Group’s financial assets are disclosed in notes 14, 15, 16 and 22. Impairment testing of trade receivables is described in note 14.
2.9.2. Financial liabilities
The Group has two categories of financial liabilities, which are financial liabilities measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (designated on initial recognition). Both categories are
classified as non-current when payments fall due greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. 
Financial liabilities are described in further detail in notes 18, 20 and 22.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.9. Financial instruments (continued)
2.9.2. Financial liabilities (continued)
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends
on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group does
not currently designate any derivatives as hedging instruments. Gains and losses on derivative instruments that are not designated
as hedge instruments are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within finance costs.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. The
Group uses a variety of methods to determine the fair value, including pricing models which reflect the specific instrument.
Management uses judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are based on market conditions existing
at the end of the reporting period as well as internal information regarding a variety of probable outcomes.
2.10. T rade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method. Trade receivables with standard payment terms of 30 days are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced
or recoverable amount. Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost. Provision is made
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full, the amount of the provision being the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original
effective interest rate. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
2.11. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash balances are excluded from cash and cash equivalents.
2.12. Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Share premium recognised on the issue of share capital is stated as the excess consideration received over the nominal value of
shares issued, net of any costs directly attributable to the issue.
2.13. Trade and other payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.14. Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at
least 12 months after the reporting date.

45 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.15. Current and deferred income tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in
the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Current and deferred tax are recognised
in the profit and loss except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in
which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is not provided on
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, if at the time of the transaction
there is no effect on either accounting or taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset or liability is released or settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.16. Pension obligations
The Group operates defined contribution plans. The Group pays contributions to privately administered pension insurance plans
on a contractual basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions
are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent
that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
2.17. Share-based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled long term incentive plan (“LTIP”). The fair value of the employee services received in exchange
for the grant of the LTIP awards is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined
by reference to the fair value of the LTIP awards granted. At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the amount of
LTIP awards that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The grant by the Company of LTIP awards over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group
is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value,
is recognised over the vesting period as an increase in investments in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The fair value is determined by use of the Black Scholes model method.
2.18. Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive
Income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The Group does not hold any assets under finance leases.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.19. Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands
of Pounds (£’000), unless otherwise stated, which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s presentational currency.
b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end rates are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income. Foreign exchange gains and losses on borrowings, investments and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income within finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented within operating results.
c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all subsidiaries (none of which have the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a
functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
i) assets and liabilities for each Statement of Financial Position presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;
ii) income and expenses for each Statement of Comprehensive Income are translated at average exchange rates (unless this
average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which
case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity within the foreign exchange reserve.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of borrowings
and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to other comprehensive income. When a
foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income as part of the gain or loss on sale. 
2.20. Investments
Investments held by the Company in its subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Impairment reviews are performed if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
2.21. Exceptional items
These are items which, in management’s judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or nature in order for the user to
obtain a proper understanding of the financial information and the underlying business performance.
2.22. Alternative performance measures (“APMs”)
In reporting financial information, the Group presents APMs, which are not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS.
The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures, provide
stakeholders with additional helpful information on the performance of the business. The APMs are consistent with how the business
performance is planned and reported within the internal management reporting to the Board. The key APMs that the Group uses
include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and net debt.
Certain adjustments are made to the statutory profit measures in order to derive the APMSs.The Group's policy is to exclude
items that are considered to be significant in both nature and/or quantum and where treatment as an adjusted item provides
additional useful information to assess the trading performance. 
The reconciliation between operating loss and Adjusted EBITDA is shown on the face of the Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

3. Financial risk management
3.1. Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks arising from its use of financial instruments: credit risk, liquidity risk and
market risk.
This note describes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure
them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
The principal financial instruments held by the Group, from which financial instrument risks arise, are as follows:
� trade and other receivables;
� cash at bank; and
� trade and other payables.
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies and, whilst
retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the
effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Group’s finance function. The Board reviews regular finance reports
from the Chief Financial Officer through which it evaluates any risk exposures with a view to minimising any potential adverse
effects on the Group’s financial performance. Transactions that are speculative in nature are expressly forbidden.
Details regarding the policies that address financial risk are set out below:
(a) Credit risk
The nature of the Group’s operations means that most of its current key customers are large corporates and accountancy firms.
The credit risks are minimised due to the nature of these customers. The Group continually reviews its credit risk policy, taking
particular account of future exposure to developing markets and associated changes in customers’ credit risk profiles.
The Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are
performed on all customers requiring credit. At the balance sheet date there was no significant concentration of credit risks. The
maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet. In particular
the Group benefits from the fact that most of its customers are required to settle contracts before rights under them are transferred.
The carrying amount in the Statement of Financial Position, net of any applicable provisions, represents the amount exposed to
credit risk and hence there is no difference between the carrying amount and the maximum credit risk exposure.
(b) Liquidity risk
Management strive to ensure that there are sufficient levels of committed facilities, cash and cash equivalents to enable the company
at all times to meet its financial commitments. The policy is to finance operations through working capital. They consider that cash
and cash equivalents are equivalent to their fair value, largely due to their short term status.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash within the Group to allow it to meet its liabilities when they
become due and to have such funds available for its operations. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity
reserve which comprises cash and cash equivalents (note 16) on the basis of expected cash flow. At the reporting date, these
projections indicate that the Group expects to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonable expected
circumstances for the forthcoming year. The Group continues to monitor its liquidity position through budgetary procedures and
cash flow analysis.

reporting date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows:

1 year years years 5 years
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Trade and other payables 1,874 – – –
(c) Market risk
Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest-bearing and foreign currency financial instruments. There is the risk that the fair
value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest rate risk), or foreign
exchange rates (currency risk).
(i) Interest rate risk
Interest payable on the Group’s bank borrowings is calculated with reference to pre-agreed margins above the London Interbank
Overnight Rate (“LIBOR”). The interest payable on the loan notes is based on a fixed coupon which is not subject to change.
Overall risk is not regarded as significant and the effect of a 100 bps increase in the LIBOR during the year would have resulted in
an increase in post-tax loss for the year of £275,000 (2016: increase of £113,000) and a decrease in equity of £275,000 (2016:
decrease of £113,000).
(ii) Currency risk
The Group’s main exposure to foreign exchange is to the Euro exchange rate arising from the Group’s overseas operation in
Ireland. The level of risk is reviewed regularly throughout the year. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions,
recognised assets and liabilities, and net investments.
In order to reduce the foreign exchange risk arising, the Group’s policy is to allow the operations to settle liabilities denominated
in their functional currency with the funds obtained from the activities arising in that currency. Given the current scale and natural
hedging of the Group’s overseas operations, overall foreign currency risk remains relatively low. 
A 4% (2016: 8%) appreciation in the average Euro exchange rate would have increased the Group’s loss after tax by £69,000
(2016: increase of £13,000). At 31 December 2017, the effect on retained earnings of a 4% (2016: 8%) appreciation in the closing
Euro exchange rate would be a decrease of £90,000 (2016: decrease of £77,000). The effect on the foreign exchange reserve of
a 4% (2016: 8%) appreciation in the closing Euro exchange rate would be an increase of £21,000 (2016: increase of £64,000).

3. Financial risk management (continued)
3.2. Capital risk management
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
future returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost
of capital. The Group seeks to maintain, at this stage of its development, sufficient funding drawn primarily from debt and equity to
enable the Group to meet its working capital and strategic needs. The Group may issue new shares or realise value from its existing
investments and other assets as deemed necessary.
The Group centrally manages borrowings, investment of surplus funds and financial risks. The objective of holding financial
investments is to provide efficient cash and tax management and effective funding for the Group. 
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Group to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Directors
base their estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that they believe are reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
4.1 Accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements, of which the following
are deemed to have the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Revenue
As explained in note 32. the sale of the software licence itself is not considered distinct from the provision of access and the
provision of continuous software upgrades and support are not considered to be separate performance obligations. The Group’s
software licenses are therefore considered to be right of access arrangements for a period of time. Since control of goods and
services is transferred to customers over time the Group considers that the delivery of access to the software product constitutes
a single performance obligation satisfied over lime.
Revenue for professional services is recognised when the right to consideration is earned as each project progresses. Provisions
against accrued income are made as and when management becomes aware of objective evidence that the amount of time worked
will not be recoverable in full.
Acquisitions accounting and goodwill
Where the Group undertakes business combinations, the cost of acquisition is allocated to identifiable net assets and contingent
liabilities acquired and assumed by reference to their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. The remaining amount is
recorded as goodwill. The valuation of identifiable net assets involves an element of judgement related to projected results. Fair
values that are stated as provisional are not finalised at the reporting date and final fair values may be determined that are materially
different from the provisional values stated.
Judgement was exercised on use of the acquisition method of accounting in respect of the acquisition of TCSL in 2016 which
constituted a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules for Companies and for the acquisition of OSMO in 2017. An adjustment of
£87,000 was made to finalise the provisional fair values recorded at 31 December 2016 in respect of the acquisition of TCSL,
Further details of the acquisitions are set out in note 30 and sensitivity analysis on the carrying value of goodwill is set out in
note 12.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
4.1 Accounting judgements (continued)
Impairment of assets
Management undertakes an annual test for impairment of assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill and, for assets with finite
lives, to test for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable.
Impairment testing is an area involving considerable management judgement. requiring as it does an assessment as to whether the
carrying value of assets can be supported by the fair value less costs to sell or net present value of future cash flows derived from
those assets discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain assumptions
are required to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including management’s expectations of growth and discount rates.
Development costs
The Group has capitalised internally generated intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38. Management has exercised judgement
in assessing the expected contribution to be generated from these assets and determined that no adjustment is required to the
carrying value of the assets.
Amortisation of intangibles
Acquired intangible assets, principally customer contract and intellectual property rights, are amortised over an estimated useful
life of 10 years based on historical analysis of customer retention. Judgement has been exercised in estimating those useful lives.
Deterred tax
The recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities requires management to exercise judgement in determining the amounts to
be recognised. In particular. judgement is used when assessing the timing and level of future taxable income.
Share-based payments
Details of share-based payments and the assumptions applied are disclosed in note 24. Judgement is exercised in selecting the
appropriate methodology and variables to use in arriving at the fair value of the awards.
Fair value measurement of other financial instruments
Judgement has been applied in determining the fair value of the loan notes and associated equity instruments issued to the Business
Growth Fund plc (“BGF”), in order to bifurcate the equity and debt elements. Judgement has also been applied in determining the
fair value of warrants granted to MXC Capital Markets LLP (“MXC Capital”). Further details are set out in note 23.
4.2 Accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made a number of estimates, of which the following
are deemed to have the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Revenue
Management has made estimates in measuring revenue from professional services including the point at which the right to
consideration is earned as each project progresses and provisions required against accrued income as and when management
becomes aware of objective evidence that the amount of time worked will not be recoverable in full,
Development costs
The recoverable amount of the assets has been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates.
Management reviews the assets for impairment on a regular basis.

in the valuation model applied including the appropriate risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility of the market price of
the Company’s shares and the number of awards expected to vest
Fair value measurement of other financial Instruments
Estimates have been applied in determining the variables applied in assessing the fair value of financial instruments and in bifurcating
debt and equity elements of financial instruments including appropriate cost of capital, discount rates and share price volatility.
5. Segmental information
Reportable segments
Tax Systems’ operating segments are reported based on the information reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for the
purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. The Board of Directors is the Group’s chief operating decision maker.
The Board of Directors considers revenue, cost of sales, operating costs, exceptional costs and EBITDA of the Group as a whole
when assessing the performance of the business and making decisions about the allocation of resources. In addition, the Board
reviews revenue split by business unit, products and geographies to assist with the allocation of resources. During the current financial
year the Group had a single class of business being the provision of software and services to corporates and accountancy firms.
The results from continuing operations, in the format as provided to the Board, has not been reproduced below and can be found
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on page 33.
Geographical disclosures
In presenting information on the basis of geography, revenue is based on the location of the customers. Non-current assets are

Reconciliation of effective tax rate
Changes to the UK corporation tax rates include reductions to the main rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 April
2020. As these changes had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date their effects are included in these financial statements.
The credit for the year is lower (2016: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.25% (2016: 20.00%). The

10. Loss per share
Basic and diluted
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of
Ordinary shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares, represented by the LTIP awards, warrants and
convertible loan notes. As the Group was loss-making, any options and warrants were considered to be ‘anti-dilutive’ and, as such,
there is no separate calculation for diluted loss per share.

The remaining amortisation period for customer contracts and intellectual property rights is 9 years (2016: 10 years).
The Company does not have any intangible assets.
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the CGU that is expected to benefit from that business
combination.
In order to determine whether impairments are required, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU. The calculation
is based on projecting future cash flows and a discount factor is applied to obtain a ‘value in use’ which is the recoverable amount.

12. Intangible assets (continued)
Impairment tests for goodwill
Key assumptions
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGU. The cash flow projections cover
five years based on management-approved financial budgets for the first year, and reflect management’s expectations of the medium-
term operating performance of the CGU and its growth prospects for the subsequent years. Cash flows beyond the five year
period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the revenue growth rates which directly influence the forecasted operating
cash flows, as well as the discount rate applied. In determining the key assumptions, management has taken into account the current
economic climate and the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates, as applicable to the Group’s business and industry.
Average annual revenue growth rates used reflect past experience and are considered appropriate. The discount rate applied
represents a pre-tax rate that reflects the Group’s internal rate of return, adjusted for specific risks associated with the CGU.
Key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as follows:
2017 2016
Group Group
CGU CGU
Discount rate 13.3% 13.3%
Medium-term cash flow growth rate 1.5% 1.5%
Long-term growth rate 3.0% 3.0%
Sensitivity analysis
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the CGU. The Board has considered
downside scenarios, including reductions in growth and increases to operating costs. The following table sets out the impact of the
individual sensitivities on goodwill and other intangible assets:
2017 2016
Group Group
Decrease in medium term growth rate 1.0% 1.0%
Potential impairment 0.0% 0.0%
Sensitised discount rate 2.0% 2.0%
Potential impairment 0.0% 0.0%
Any potential impairment would be charged against the assets allocated to that CGU. It would first be allocated against goodwill
balances summarised above, then to other assets allocated to that CGU.A change of 1% to the medium term growth rate or 2%
change to the discount rate does not result in any impairment to the goodwill does not result in any potential impairment to
goodwill.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2017 is the carrying value of each class of receivables mentioned above.
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the
circumstances of the individual receivable. Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in
excess of that stated above for doubtful receivables. Other receivables principally comprise deposits and non-interest bearing loans
in respect of the LTIP holders (see note 29).
The value of trade and other receivables quoted in the table above also represents the fair value of these items. Trade receivables
arise from contracts with customers.
Trade receivables are considered impaired if they are not considered recoverable. As at 31 December 2017, trade receivables of
£952,000 (2016: £876,000) were past due but not impaired. The Group considers any change in the credit quality of trade
receivables from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the
quality of the customer base.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables and impairment is as follows:

The Group has revolving and term loan facilities, which are available until 30 June 2021. The term loan is being amortised evenly
over the five year term. Interest payable in respect of the revolving credit facility ranges between 1.75% to 3.25% per annum above
the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and for the term loan facility between 2.0% to 3.5% above LIBOR. 
The Company entered into a £10,000,000 unsecured fixed rate loan notes agreement with the BGF with a 6.5 year term from
26 July 2016. Repayment will be made in four equal instalments semi-annually from 30 June 2021. The Company also granted the
BGF an option to subscribe for 5,970,149 Ordinary Shares at a price of 67p at any time before 26 July 2023.
In accordance with IAS 32, the loan notes and options issued to the BGF are deemed to be linked and are treated as a single
financial instrument and shown at fair value. The fair value of the loan element was originally calculated at £7,203,000 using a
discounted cash flow model over the term of the instrument and an effective borrowing rate of 13%, deemed by the Directors to
be an appropriate market rate, reflecting the 6% coupon interest payments and the capital repayment profile of the loan notes.
The balance of £2,797,000 was deemed to be the fair value of the equity element and was credited to Other Reserves.
The Group’s borrowings are all denominated in Pounds Sterling.
An effective interest of £399,000 (2016: £173,000) has been taken on the loan notes during the year.

Share capital and share premium
At 31 December 2017 the share capital of Tax Systems plc consisted of 80,703,381 (2016: 76,001,889) fully paid Ordinary shares
with a nominal value of 1p per share. All shares are equally eligible to receive dividends and the repayment of capital and represent
one vote.
On 26 July 2016, the Company issued 67,164,180 New Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of 1p at 67p each raising £45,000,000,
before costs, as part of its funding of the acquisition of TCSL. At the same time the Company undertook a capital restructuring in
order to reduce the number in shares in issue. The capital restructuring was effected by way of a consolidation, subdivision and
reclassification of every 50 existing ordinary shares of 1p each into one new ordinary share of 1p each and one deferred share of
49p each. The deferred shares were then acquired by the Company and cancelled.
On 3 April 2017 the Company issued 4,701,492 Ordinary Shares for the acquisition of the entire share capital of OSMO.

23. Ordinary shares, share premium and other reserves (continued)
Other reserves
For the purposes of presentation on the Consolidated and Company Statements of Financial Position, the share-based payment
reserve, the equity element of loan notes and the other reserve have been combined and disclosed as ‘Other reserves’.
The other reserve is comprised of the fair value of warrants issued.
As set out in note 20, the Company has granted the BGF an option to subscribe for 5,970,149 Ordinary Shares at a price of 67p
at any time before 26 July 2023.
By a warrant instrument dated 23 December 2015 (the “Warrant Instrument”), the Company agreed to issue to MXC Capital
such number of warrants to subscribe for Ordinary Shares created pursuant to the Warrant Instrument that shall at all time be
equal to 6 per cent. of the issued share capital of the Company. 441,885 warrants were issued in December 2015 (the “Initial
Warrants”) and a further 4,409,299 warrants were issued in July 2016 (the “Transaction Warrants”) so that the number of warrants
issued to MXC Capital at 31 December 2016 was 4,851,184. 
A further 195,896 Transaction Warrants were issued on 3 April 2017 in respect of the share issue for the acquisition of OSMO.
On 2 August 2017 the Company announced that it had entered into a deed of amendment and restatement whereby MXC
Capital had agreed to reduce its warrants over 6 per cent. of the fully diluted share capital of the Company to 4%, Therefore
1,684,439 Transaction warrants have been cancelled and MXC Capital now holds 3,362,641 warrants to subscribe for Ordinary
Shares in the Company.
The movement on the Initial Warrants and the Transaction Warrants was as follows:

for ten consecutive trading days is equal to or greater than 85.50p. The Transaction Warrants are exercisable on or after 26 July
2019 if, at any time on or before that date, the average share price for ten consecutive trading days is equal or greater than 93.80p.
If these conditions are not met, the vesting period will be extended for a further 24 months from the first vesting dates.

23. Ordinary shares, share premium and other reserves (continued)
Other reserves (continued)
The fair value of the Transaction Warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes model. The performance conditions related to
the Transaction Warrants take into account factors specific to the warrants, such as the vesting period. The share price performance
condition related to the scheme, being a market condition, has been incorporated into the measurement by means of binomial
modelling. Expected volatility used in the valuation is based on the historical share price volatility. The following principal assumptions
were used in the valuation: 
Grant date 26 Jul 2016
Share price at issue date 79.5p
Exercise price 67.0p 
Fair value per option 15.41p 
Dividend yield –

The foreign exchange reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign subsidiaries.
The Group share-based payment reserve at 31 December 2017 is £226,000 (2016: £38,000) and is discussed in detail in note 24.
24. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments plan
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based payment plan. A summary of the main terms of the arrangement is given below,
with particular reference made to the terms of those grants for which the share-based payment expense has been recognised.
On 2 August 2017 and 26 July 2016, the Group made awards to certain directors and employees under its LTIP scheme.
The Group recognised total expenses in relation to share-based payments as follows:
2017 2016
£’000 £’000
Equity-settled share-based payments 188 38 
T otal 188 38 
The beneficiaries of the LTIP are entitled to receive a share in a pool of up to 8% (2016: 6%) of the shareholder value created
since the re-admission of the Company to AIM, subject to share price performance criteria and staff remaining employed by the
Group for a minimum of three years.
Shareholder value creation is defined as the growth in the market capitalisation of the Company from the base value of at least
three years from 26 July 2016, taking into account dividends and capital returns, if any. The base value is defined as the aggregate
value of all Ordinary shares in the capital of the Company in issue on 26 July 2016 as adjusted for the issue or cancellations of new
Ordinary shares after that date.
The LTIP is implemented by way of an Employee Growth Shares scheme in T ax Systems Holdings Limited. At 31 December 2017,
awards of 8% (2016: 5.3%) of shareholder value created have been made.

24. Share-based payments (continued)
Equity-settled share-based payments plan (continued)
Participants at 31 December 2017 are entitled to share in a pool equivalent to 8% (2016: 5.3%) of shareholder value created in
excess of the base value of the Company as at 26 July 2016, subject to the share price performance of T ax Systems plc. Share price
performance will initially be measured at 26 July 2019 (being the 3rd anniversary of the re-admission), with an extension to 26 July
2021 if the performance condition is not met by that date. The share price performance criterion is a share price equal to or
greater than 93.8p over five consecutive trading days.
As the share price hurdle for the Employee Growth Shares has not been met, there are no options at the year end that can be
determined and there is no movement during the year.
Assumptions used in the valuation of share-based payment arrangements.
The fair value of the LTIP was determined using a Black-Scholes model. The performance condition related to the LTIP takes into
account factors specific to the share incentive plans, such as the vesting period. The share price performance condition related to
the scheme, being a market condition, has been incorporated into the measurement by means of binomial modelling. Expected
volatility used in the valuation is based on the historical share price volatility. The following principal assumptions were used in the
valuation:

30. Acquisitions (continued)
T ax Computer Systems Limited
On 26 July 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of TCSL, a leading supplier of tax software and
services to the large corporate sector and the accounting profession in the UK and Ireland for an enterprise value of £73,000,000
settled entirely in cash from the proceeds from the equity placing of new ordinary shares, banking borrowings and loan notes. The
acquisition constituted a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules for Companies. The acquisition method of accounting has been
used as the Company is the acquirer, the consideration was paid wholly in cash and the former shareholders of TCSL exited the
business on acquisition and have no interest in the enlarged group.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:

escrow funds, which were treated as restricted cash at 31 December 2016.
£58,350,000 of customer related and intellectual property rights intangible assets were capitalised as part of the acquisition of
TCSL and will be amortised over ten years. A deferred tax liability of £10,386,000 on the capitalisation of the intangible assets was
created on acquisition.

30. Acquisitions (continued)
Osmo Data T echnology Limited
On 3 April 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of OSMO, a supplier of software solutions to
the financial services industry in return for the issue of 4,701,492 ordinary shares in the Company, which valued OSMO at
£3,197,000.
OSMO contributed revenue of £1,027,000 and a loss after tax of £193,000 to the Group for the period from acquisition to
31 December 2017.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, combined Group revenue and loss after tax for the year would have been
£15,420,784 and £500,000.
The Group made this acquisition in order to gain automation technology to extract data from accounting packages into its core
tax technologies.
One-off costs relating to the acquisition of £204,000 have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
Income within ‘Exceptional items’.
The Directors made an initial provisional assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities at 3 April 2017. The acquisition
had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:

Notes to the Financial Statements

30. Acquisitions (continued)
Osmo Data T echnology Limited (continued)
The intangible assets capitalised as part of the acquisition of OSMO can be analysed as follows:
£’000
Customer relationships – amortised over ten years 645 
Technology related intangibles - amortised over ten years 946 
1,591 
The calculation of provisional fair values of consideration, assets and liabilities such as goodwill and intangible assets as well as the
assessment of any impairment to fair values generally, involve estimations of likely future cash flows delivering from or accruing to
those assets and liabilities.
The fair value of receivables acquired, which principally comprised trade receivables, were not different from the gross contractual
amounts. The best estimate of contractual cashflows not expected to be collected is £nil.
Goodwill arose on this acquisition because the consideration paid effectively included amounts in relation to the benefit of expected
synergies, revenue growth and future market development. These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill because
they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets.
Judgement is also involved in selecting appropriate discount rates for determining the present value of those future cash flows.
Final fair values may differ materially from those provisional values stated.
31. Company statement of comprehensive income
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own Statement of Comprehensive
Income and related notes. The loss for the financial year of the Company was £1,777,000 (2016: £4,026,000).
32. Adoption of IFRS 15 and change in accounting policy
The Group is a leading provider of corporation tax software and services in the UK and Ireland. The Group licenses its proprietary
tax compliance software to corporate customers and accounting and tax advisory practices to facilitate the tax compliance process –
from data extraction, collection and management to compliance reporting through different calculation engines embedded in the
Group’s range of products.
Licenced software solutions
Customers predominantly enter into software licences to use the Group’s software products. Software licences are contractual
arrangements whereby the customer purchases the right to continuously exploit the licenced functionality of the Group’s products,
including the right to be kept continuously updated and supported by the Group, over a fixed term of predominantly, 12 months.
Revenue from the sale of software licences, including the provision of access, continuous software upgrades and support represents
approximately 90% of the group’s revenues.
The sale of the software licence itself is not considered to be distinct from the provision of access and continuous software upgrades
and support, which are not considered to be separate performance obligations. The Group’s software licences are therefore
considered to be right of access arrangements with control of goods and services transferred to customers over the period of the
contractual arrangement. The Group therefore considers that the delivery of access to software products constitutes a single
performance obligation satisfied over time.

75 TAX SYSTEMS PLC Annual Report 2017
32.Adoption of IFRS 15 and change in accounting policy (continued)
Professional services
The Group also derives revenues from the sale of professional services separate to its’ licensed software products. The most
significant components of professional services revenues are currently derived from iXBRL tagging and from projects involving
implementation and installation management and the provision of technical support.
Revenue from the sale of professional services represents approximately 10% of the Group’s revenues.
Contracts with customers for the sale of professional services are predominantly of a short duration and have specific outcomes
which the Group considers to comprise its performance obligations. Contracts for the sale of professional services can be contracted
on a time and materials or fixed fee basis. Revenue from both types of contract are recognised on fulfilment of the relevant
performance obligation and are invoiced on the agreed basis; either time and materials or fixed fee. 
The Group’s revenues are disaggregated by service and geography as set out in note 5.
Accounting policy change
The Group has reviewed the way that it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers and has elected to early adopt the
new reporting standard on revenue recognition, IFRS 15.
Following its review, the Company has changed its accounting policy with respect to revenue from the sale of software licences,
including the provision of access, continuous software upgrades and support in order to recognise revenue evenly over the period
of the licence. Previously the Group’s accounting policy for the sale of software licences had been to recognise revenue
predominantly on commencement of the licence period. 
The new accounting policy most closely reflects the substance of the arrangements to provide access and services over the period
of the licence. 
Effect of accounting policy change
The Group has applied the change in accounting policy by using a modified retrospective approach as permitted by IFRS 15, in
which the comparative results for 2016 have not been restated. Instead, a cumulative adjustment has been recognised through
retained earnings at 1 January 2017 in relation to agreements which still required performance by the Group at that date as follows:
As previously Accounting Adjusted
reported adjustments balance
£’000 £’000 £’000 
Deferred tax asset 13 831 844
Trade and other receivables 2,880 412 3,292
Deferred income (1,518) (4,765) (6,283)
Deferred income will unwind through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income within a twelve month period and
is expected to be replaced by a similar level of deferral  into future periods.
