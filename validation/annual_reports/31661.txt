 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The political mathematics are such that there 
is no realistic prospect of housing the fast growing 
population within 100 miles of London without an increased 
contribution from large sites. That involves two basic 
imperatives: shortening the period to first house completion 
and accelerating quality delivery thereafter. Our Master 
Developer model is demonstrably addressing both.

STRATEGY
As a Master Developer which focuses on the delivery of strategic sites, we seek to 
provide a tangible financial dividend for our investors and a social dividend for our 
stakeholders across our entire portfolio. We believe in doing things right and we 
define ourselves by the quality of our projects.

Accelerate the volume of serviced 
residential and employment 
parcels for the market
The combination of our own capital from commercial 
property sales and additional funding provided by 
the HCA has allowed us to accelerate the delivery 
of infrastructure across our strategic sites, bringing 
forward additional points of sale ahead of those 
previously appraised.
Progress
By the end of 2017:
• The HCA has committed £138 million of 
infrastructure funding across Alconbury, Rugby, 
Newark and Corby, of which we have already 
drawn £86 million.
• At Rugby, work has commenced on the western 
end of the link road with the full road scheduled 
to open in early 2019. This seven-year 
acceleration ahead of programme means 
discussions with our housebuilder customers on 
a new point of sale at Rugby, some 1.5 miles from 
the existing hub, have already commenced.
• By actively encouraging more local housebuilders 
such as Hopkins Homes, Morris and Davidsons, 
we have diversified the market for our serviced land 
parcels, which is reflected in those housebuilders 
requesting further plots or operating across 
multiple sites.

Secure additional strategic 
sites/consents
We continue to be a market leader in the delivery  
of strategic sites and are actively pursuing further 
sites within 100 miles of London to achieve our 
previous target of 40,000 dwellings, predominantly 
through off-market negotiations and, if brought 
forward sensibly, through public procurement.
Progress
By the end of 2017:
•  We formed a joint venture with the Nuffield Trusts 
to acquire and deliver 2,800 units at Wintringham 
Park in St Neots, further leveraging our existing 
relationships in Cambridgeshire.
• Working with the Homes and Communities 
Agency (“HCA”) we acquired Priors Hall from the 
joint administrators and will be taking forward the 
delivery of the existing consent for 5,095 units.
• We are actively bidding on additional off-market 
and public procurement opportunities.

was completed for the redevelopment of 
Westside Wolverhampton, creating a clear 
forward commercial pipeline.
•  In Manchester, there have been strong

to underpin shareholder return whilst delivering a real 
difference to the communities in which we are working. 
Progress
By the end of the 2017 financial year:
• EPRA NAV per share +7.1 per cent 
(+35.7 per cent from Listing).
• Total shareholder return of 16.0 per cent 
(2016: (15.0) per cent).
• Wholesale discount starts to reverse as forecast 
from 71.0p at March 2017 to 68.0p (further explained 
in the Chief Executive’s statement).
• 52 plot completions, 17 exchanges and a further 
42 reservations during the financial year.

— CHAIRMAN’ S S T A TEMENT
I am very pleased to be able to report continued 
advancement across the course of the financial 
year and beyond. The Group has made significant 
additional strides since September with the sale 
of almost half of our remaining commercial and 
leisure assets and the redeployment of some of the 
proceeds into the important purchase of Priors Hall 
in Northamptonshire. The project is one that our 
management team has been tracking for several 
years and which we worked hard to buy.
Urban&Civic was established for the very purpose 
of challenging the standard approaches to large‑scale 
housing delivery. We are determined that strategic 
sites can make an increased contribution in our 
chosen markets within 100 miles of London and 
the largest provincial cities. Our Master Developer 
model places a premium on quality and accelerated 
delivery and has gained real traction with our 
housebuilder customers. The model involves faster 
planning through taking project responsibility, 
then working with expansionist housebuilders 
to shorten the period between consent being 
granted and first construction. The licence structure 
encourages build‑ out by those housebuilders, whilst 
contracted minimum annual payments underpin 
the Group’s future cash flows. The arrangements 
are capital‑ light to our customers and, at the same 
time, provide Urban&Civic with a good future 
security of income.
Priors Hall is part constructed and slots at the 
front of a chronology of what are now six strategic 
projects. The purchase will enable us to preserve 
balance by taking on some new major propositions 
that are not yet adopted in Local Plans.
The much publicised Oxford to Cambridge rail line 
is being designed to encourage incremental 
housing as well as to re‑ establish transport links 
across the middle of the country. Those clear 
objectives play to the strengths of our management 
in combining placemaking with transport.
Shareholders should not take the recent realisations 
as a sign that we are giving up on commercial 
development. Instead the intention is that 
anything of scale will be forward funded in future. 
The stamp duty increase to five per cent announced 
in the March 2016 Budget has gone a large way to 
negating any yield advantage on the sale of investment 
properties. Certainly that is the case in the area in 
which we are most competitive, large town/small 
city retail and leisure schemes, promoted by the 
relevant local authority, which is often also the 
existing landowner.
Institutional pre‑ funding is also consistent with 
the Board’s stated policy of a high level of financial 
prudence. Gearing is moving up a little as strategic 
spend increases but substantively all of the Group’s 
project facilities are from the Homes and Communities 
Agency, whose interests are aligned closely with 
ours. The stature of our partnerships with Aviva, 
Dioceses of the Church of England, the Ministry of 
Defence (via Defence Infrastructure Organisation) 
and Trusts from Nuffield College and Oxford 
University are testimony to our financial approach 
and our insistence on doing things the right way.
Jon Di‑ Stefano, the chief executive of Telford Homes Plc, 
has joined the Board as a Non‑ Executive Director. 
He brings knowledge and understanding both of 
quality housebuilding and adapting a business to 
incorporate high levels of institutional partnership 
funding. We are delighted to have him as we are sad 
to see Bob Dyson stand down at the forthcoming AGM 
in February. Bob was on the Board of Terrace Hill 
originally and has played a key role in transitioning 
through to the current positioning for future growth. 
He leaves with our grateful thanks. A circulation 
of our Non‑ Executive Directors will continue, in 
accordance with good practice in the UK Code 
of Corporate Governance.
Conditions are not getting any easier and uncertainties 
abound. Equally, the barriers to large‑ scale housing 
projects are considerable and we have moved far in 
a comparatively short time. Employment levels in 
our selected areas of high population growth are at 
record highs. There is much now in the corporate 
tank but still more that can be achieved. 
We continue to work to that end.

IN SUMMARY
• Outcomes reflect stated intentions 
and unique Master Developer 
licence model.
• EPRA NAV up 7.1 per cent to 
304.4p per share.
• Large site discount starting to 
reverse as forecast. Alconbury and 
Rugby pro-rata discount estimated 
at £99 million, based on CBRE 
150-unit parcels. Equivalent to 
68p per share against 71p per 
share at March 2017.
• Practical advantages of Master 
Developer facilitating large-scale 
residential build strengthened by 
our five-year licences that are capital 
efficient to housebuilders but which 
require minimum annual payments 
that transparently underwrite annual 
forward receipts to Urban&Civic. 
• Post balance sheet events reinforce 
clarity: switch from Stansted Hotel 
into Priors Hall. Meanwhile, political 
mathematics direct increasingly 
towards large sites, witness housing 
reset in the Autumn Budget.
• Increased final dividend of 
2p per share, recognising 
progress and positive outlook. 
Full year 3.2p per share: up 
10.3 per cent. 
NIGEL HUGILL — CHIEF EXE CUTIVE
No silver bullet but 
significant positives.
Introduction
Good results. Significant positives to our enlarging business 
base underlined by further advantageous post balance sheet 
transactions and public pronouncements. EPRA net assets 
per share were up 7 .1 per cent to 304.4p as at 30 September 2017 . 
EPRA net assets reached £439.3 million, as compared with 
£409.8 million at 30 September 2016. Unlike last year , the growth 
was divided pretty equally across the two periods. Reported 
pre‑ tax profits of £7.9 million, whilst down on £25.9 million in 
the 12 months to 30 September 2016, also showed a maturing 
profile. Residential property sales contributed £5.7 million to 
profits and will rise from here. Post balance sheet sales of the 
bulk of the remaining commercial assets aggregating £70 million 
will lift pre‑ tax profits above trend in the first half of the 
current year.
The core reason for establishing Urban&Civic was to provide 
new housing choices and accelerate supply through Master 
Development. In accordance with our strategy, that involves 
creating environments in which people actively want to live 
and a delivery structure that encourages speed and quality 
from those housebuilders looking to expand output. Our results 
demonstrate the extent to which the Master Developer 
model can be seen to be working financially as well as 
philosophically. The recent commercial asset realisations 
reflect the determination of the Board to position the balance 
sheet in the direction that the Company holds clear competitive 
advantage. A proportion of sales proceeds was redeployed 
almost immediately in the acquisition of Priors Hall in 
Northamptonshire at a cost of £40.5 million. Buying from 
administrators is never straightforward and our new project 
purchase demonstrates the ability of Urban&Civic to work 
through large site challenges that other developers often 
find too daunting.
Following the off‑ market purchase earlier in the year of a 
33 per cent equity interest in the near 3,000 unit Wintringham 
project at St Neots, Cambridgeshire, there can be no mistaking 
where your Company has set its stall. The 400‑ acre site had 
been in the ownership of trusts associated with Nuffield College, 
Oxford, since the 1940s and was bequeathed by the late Lord 
Nuffield. Urban&Civic has taken charge of project delivery with 
a collective determination that the partnership can provide an 
appropriate financial and environmental legacy. The related 
opportunity lies in the prospect of taking our Master Developer 
model and harnessing the Nuffield experience of creating 
healthier lifestyles to show just what well‑ structured new 
large‑ scale projects can contribute when improved wellbeing 
is prioritised from the outset. 13 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  14 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Much of the difference in relative performance 
comes from careful project selection in the 
more affordable locations within 100 miles 
of London, supported by good transport 
links and recognised demographics of 
high employment and population growth. 
The remainder is grounded on disciplined 
on‑ site procedures honed over 30 years 
of large and complex project delivery. 
We have learnt our ways from commercial 
development and we are sticking with them. 
Our Master Developer differentiator is 
paving the way for new policy assumptions 
in the process. Following recent commercial 
asset sales, substantively all Group project 
loans are ten‑ year facilities from the 
UK Government’s Homes and Communities 
Agency. The recent National Infrastructure 
Commission recommendations followed 
by the November Budget could not have 
been more categoric as to the requirement 
for additional strategic housing provision 
across a brain belt between Cambridge and 
Oxford. There is nobody better equipped 
in this country to deliver in those areas and 
at that scale than Urban&Civic.
No real negatives to report, other than 
perhaps, the pipeline of Catesby 
monetisations has become a little held up 
including by post‑ appeal judicial challenges. 
Introduction continued
Adjusting for post balance sheet disposals 
and the acquisition of Priors Hall, 80 per cent 
of property assets of the Company are 
now invested in strategic projects with a 
further 6 per cent in Catesby. I can also 
relay increasing enthusiasm amongst 
our housebuilder customers as to the 
reciprocal benefits of the Urban&Civic 
Master Developer model. Your Company 
is absolutely succeeding in setting aside the 
shibboleths too often attaching to strategic 
residential sites in the past. Our projects are 
rigorously managed with key infrastructure, 
schools, cycleways, footpaths, roads, planting 
and playgrounds all delivered early to reduce 
any sense of pioneering amongst incoming 
residents. Our licences encourage housing 
quality and the signs are that delivery will 
be faster. We are on track to double historic 
industry averages. 15 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc

Master Developer and security of income
As Master Developer, Urban&Civic retains 
project responsibility and licenses fully serviced 
plots in typical lot sizes of 150 to 200, ready 
for the housebuilders to commence early 
construction. We receive around one‑ third 
of sales value when houses are sold; subject 
to the underpinning condition that we are 
paid a minimum annual drawdown, typically 
35 to 40 plots per year, at fixed prices 
irrespective. Our housebuilder customers 
can accelerate sales and payments to us 
but they cannot slow down beyond the 
contracted minimums. Put another way, 
our licence arrangements see us sell 
roughly five years forward for a basic 
consideration paid annually plus overage. 
Urban&Civic is acting as wholesaler to our 
housebuilder customers but with better 
security over contracted income.
We are now five years forward sold 
across four sites to a range of successful 
housebuilders with licence participations 
or overage in practically all instances. 
First agreements have been contracted 
with Avant and Bellway at Newark and will 
contribute a further minimum £2.8 million 
per year . Meanwhile, receipts from contracted 
sales at Priors Hall were estimated on 
acquisition at approximately £11.8 million, 
of which £4.2 million is expected to be 
received in the current financial year. 
With the addition of Priors Hall receipts, 
contracted sales are expected to raise 
around £17.0 million in the current year, 
on flat house price assumptions. It is that 
security of income, in combination with 
the potential for accelerated delivery, 
which underwrites our confidence to 
realise commercial assets for further 
reinvestment into strategic projects.
The likelihood is that we will have at least 
17 separate agreements with housebuilders 
at the March 2018 interim stage. We delayed 
the start of our own building to allow our 
primary customers first run. The Civic Living 
designs are more contemporary and will 
feature a higher proportion of apartments. 
We are confident they will help broaden 
the product mix alongside housebuilders 
already on site. Construction has begun 
at Alconbury to be followed by Rugby and 
Newark in the first half of 2018.
Operating highlights 
The principal operating highlights during 
the year were the start on site at Alconbury 
of Morris Homes and Redrow, with 
continuing strong sales from Hopkins 
Homes, (53 completions and a further 15 
reservations or exchanges from start on site 
in April 2016), and the Davidson’s show house 
now being open at Rugby (15 reservations), 
with construction having also commenced 
by Crest Nicholson and Morris Homes. 
Avant Homes are building at Newark and 
Bellway will follow shortly. Two new parcels 
are under negotiation at Alconbury and 
preliminary agreements with at least two 
more housebuilders will be reached at 
Wintringham early in the new year. There 
are seven housebuilders of varying sizes 
on site for the first phase of Priors Hall.  16 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

a shortfall in new UK housing construction. 
Were there a silver bullet it would most 
certainly have been fired by now, given the 
meticulous search for a weapon. We are 
currently adding about half a million people 
a year to the national population, of which 
just less than one‑ third is net immigration 
from the European Union. The Office for 
National Statistics has revised down 
population forecasts but still expects 
population numbers to exceed 70 million 
before the end of the next decade. The 20‑year 
growth average is around 0.5 per cent per year . 
It is also as well to remind ourselves as 
to the exceptional nature of the challenge 
(and what I see as the corresponding business 
opportunity). The sustained UK population 
growth is unmatched in any of the major 
European economies. Equally, our 
unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent and 
working age employment ratio of 75.0 per cent 
are genuinely remarkable. Our country is 
one of the world’s great workplaces. 
One can argue about the quality but there 
can be no disputing that England, at least, 
has been a job‑ creating machine over the 
past decade.
Post balance sheet sales
Whilst after the year end, the effective switch 
of a part of the sales receipts from the recently 
completed Hampton by Hilton Hotel at 
Stansted Airport into the acquisition of 
Priors Hall warrants specific comment. 
The sale of the hotel, which only opened 
for trading in July 2017 , was an obviously 
strong outcome for the Group. The minimum 
consideration of £48.3 million represented a 
projected yield on stabilised EBITDA three 
years forward of 6.75 per cent and was 
15 per cent higher than the EPRA valuation 
of the completed asset in the interim balance 
sheet as at 31 March 2017. Profit realised 
on actual cost is in the order of £8.5 million. 
Cash returned back into the business, after 
accounting for development project bank 
debt, exceeded £30.0 million. An additional 
sum of up to £1.1 million will be paid to 
Urban&Civic, depending upon operational 
performance over the next two years. The signs 
are that we will receive at least a percentage. 
Initial occupancy levels and achieved room 
rates are running above pre‑ opening 
forecasts. The subsequent sale of Feethams 
in Darlington realised a further £22 million, 
representing £8 million after repayment of 
secured debt. The September 2017 EPRA 
balance sheet takes account of the realised 
values, using the minimum consideration in 
the case of Stansted. Additional commercial 
disposals remain in train.
Acquisition of Priors Hall, 
Northamptonshire
If we have sold well, we have to believe that 
we have bought better. The Priors Hall 
transaction represents an important business 
win on a project that we have monitored 
closely for several years. The acquisition 
of 965 acres of partly built land is right in 
the Urban&Civic sweet spot: chequered 
history, long and supportive funding structure, 
demonstrable potential for better project 
organisation and improved planning. Plus 
the demographic fundamentals are attractive: 
28 per cent population growth over the past 
15 years with seven million people living 
within 50 miles. Recent house price growth 
in the local area is amongst the highest in 
the country, no doubt boosted by a 68 minute 
direct rail service to London. Priors Hall has 
been achieving sales of around 200 new homes 
a year despite being under managed and 
over leveraged. The scheme will benefit 
from the love and attention that it has 
begun already to receive. Our skills and 
experience as incoming Master Developer 
confer competitive advantage for which we 
expect to be rewarded with superior returns.
Housing by numbers
A virtual forest of newspaper columns and 
no few analysts’ commentaries have sought 
to address the causes and consequences of  17 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  
S
The aspect that is often overlooked is the 
extent to which population and employment 
growth has become concentrated. The 
consequence is that population increases 
within 100 miles of London are sometimes 
double those of the headline national rate. 
Nor are the highest numbers limited to the 
capital. As examples, recent population 
growth in Cambridge and Peterborough 
has exceeded that of London. Compound 
one to two per cent growth over ten years 
and the increase is often 15 per cent. This 
is of a quite different scale from almost all 
provincial European locations.
Carrying that exposition further, a local 
authority in Southern England normally  
has around 170,000 residents. Simple 
mathematics are that 15 per cent growth  
in ten years adds 25,000 people. 
London and a few other overbought locations, 
renting is more expensive than buying 
leaving access to the deposit as the remaining 
hurdle to ownership. To that end and despite 
the interest rate rise, we should enter 2018 
in slightly better shape than one may have 
expected earlier in the year. Mortgage 
approvals are likely to be up over the year 
and transactions about 5 per cent higher. 
Borrowing costs remain historically low, 
employment levels show no signs of going 
down and income growth in the wider 
economy is likely to drift upwards as the 
labour market tightens. 
Following a hesitant recovery, housebuilding 
activity has picked up steadily in recent years. 
This has been most apparent in the period 
since the introduction of the Help to Buy 
scheme in 2013. Measured on a 12‑ month 
rolling basis, housebuilding is running at 
around 170,000 new constructions a year, 
still less than 1 per cent of existing stock. 
For this ratio to return to its long‑ term 
average, housing starts would need to 
increase to around 220,000 per annum. 
In short, all roads lead to new build, for 
the foreseeable future, as Help to Buy 
supports the marginal buyer.
Help to Buy
Help to Buy was designed to do what it said 
on the tin: to provide assistance to home 
buyers by increasing the supply of low‑ deposit 
mortgages. Since the scheme was introduced 
in April 2013, the value of Help to Buy equity 
loans has totalled £6.75 billion while the value 
of the properties bought within the scheme 
has been around £32 billion. This is equivalent 
to 4 to 5 per cent of all mortgage loans for 
house purchases over this period but a much 
higher percentage of new builds. Moreover, 
utilisation is increasing. In the year to June 
2017, there were around 43,000 Help to Buy 
completions. This was up from around 35,000 
in the same period a year earlier. The average 
property price within the scheme has been 
around £240,000. Without the scheme 
first‑ time buyers especially would be denied 
access to the mortgage market, despite 
relative affordability. It should come as 
no surprise that it was extended.
On standard occupation assumptions,  
that requires 10,000 new dwellings over  
the same period. Our conclusion is that  
the most practical way of meeting that 
requirement is to bring forward more  
big sites and to have them deliver faster.  
Now that we are five years forward sold  
to a spread of housebuilders on the initial 
parcels on our consented sites and carry 
strong backing from the Homes and 
Communities Agency, we can direct the 
balance sheet without betting the business.

The comparison is not so direct at Priors Hall 
in Northamptonshire, where we acquired 
an existing over leveraged project in 
administration. Urban&Civic has owned 
the project for just over a month but I am 
pleased to be able to inform shareholders 
that the signs are already good.
Planning normally constitutes firm ground 
for Urban&Civic but the identification of 
immediate priorities is not in any way to 
gainsay the importance of continuing to 
deliver quality and accelerated numbers 
at Alconbury, Rugby and Newark and to 
bring Priors Hall up to scratch. Quality 
delivery is a necessary accompanying 
condition in superseding the historically 
sedate rates of sale too often witnessed on 
large scale sites elsewhere. Our commitment 
includes the clearly stated intent to deliver 
a tangible dividend to the stakeholders and 
communities with which we work. We have 
sought to augment our reputation on this 
by establishing and testing some 
repeatable metrics.
Finally, the acquisition of Priors Hall in the 
course of development and the likely pace 
to delivery at Wintringham enables us to 
look to establish a chronology that includes 
new major schemes at initial commencement. 
Shareholders can be assured that we will 
only be taking on projects where the realistic 
expectation is for much faster delivery 
under our stewardship than has been the 
third party average in the past. The recent 
National Infrastructure Commission Report, 
immediately followed by the Budget, both 
require the rapid delivery of new large sites 
to achieve the housing numbers required in 
South East England. Our Master Developer 
model is halving the time from outline 
planning to start on site and thereafter 
we are on track to double historic rates 
of delivery. This is transformational to 
project economics and political credibility. 
Your Company is shortlisted or actively 
evaluating a number of significant new 
projects including opportunities along 
the Cambridge to Oxford Corridor. 
Should we achieve planning consent at 
Wintringham and Waterbeach in the current 
financial year, with at least one/two new 
strategic scale projects to come alongside, 
that would meet the previous target that we 
set ourselves of having 40,000 residential 
dwellings with Urban&Civic as Master 
Developer. Moreover, in that eventuality, 
three‑ quarters of all units would be consented. 
Catesby
There are frustrations around consented 
applications obtained by Catesby for 
790 dwellings in high growth areas, 
languishing in the judicial process. In one 
instance, the earliest a Court of Appeal 
date could be scheduled is for April 2018, 
some 20 months after the initial grant of 
planning consent in August 2016. We will, 
however , continue to account for the trading 
profits on realised sales only as they 
come through.
The competitive position of Catesby is 
strengthened by specialist expertise and 
the ability to infrastructure. The environment 
for promotions is becoming more challenging, 
both in terms of the margins being bid on 
smaller projects and in appeal decisions on 
five‑ year land supply. Consistent with broader 
Group priorities, Catesby is responding 
to changing market conditions in the land 
promotion market by targeting larger 
projects of up to 2,000 dwellings. 
Immediate priorities
One of the most pleasing aspects of your 
Company’s performance over the past 
12 months has been the manner in which 
we have been able to fulfil the immediate 
priorities articulated this time last year. 
We were able to add two important new 
projects to our portfolio and submit a planning 
application at Waterbeach, three miles north 
of the Cambridge Science and Business Parks 
which is arguably the most significant 
application being processed in the country 
at the present time.
The focus for 2018 is to secure approval for 
the submitted applications at Waterbeach 
and Wintringham, comprehensively revisit 
the assumptions for future development at 
Priors Hall and do what we can to unblock 
the prevarications that have log jammed 
consented Catesby projects that would 
otherwise be helping to add to national 
housing numbers. We are also evaluating 
making an application to open up a new 
area of 1,500+ further dwellings at 
Alconbury, which is consistent with the 
emerging Local Plan for Huntingdonshire.
We acquired our interest in the near 3,000 unit 
scheme at Wintringham in St Neots, 
Cambridgeshire, in April and submitted 
a hybrid planning application in October. 
My expectation is for a resolution to grant 
in the first quarter of 2018. Such is our growing 
reputation that housebuilder customers are 
prepared now to invest time and resources 
in working up designs ahead of consent. 
As a result we have a decent shot at getting 
foundations in the ground for contracted 
partners before the end of next year. In stark 
contrast, recent reports describe the period 
from submission of outline planning consent 
through to the delivery of first dwelling is 
typically approaching seven years for sites 
above 2,000 units. Urban&Civic as Master 
Developer is shaking those prevailing 
assumptions to their very core. Wintringham 
ought to be our fastest yet: we are on track 
to come in around 24 months from formal 
planning application submission to first 
housing delivery.  19 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc

the effective applied discount for strategic 
scale remains considerable. Using CBRE 
assumptions, the corresponding large site 
discount can be calculated at £99 million at 
September 2017 , equivalent to 68p per share, 
in addition to our reported EPRA NAV figure. 
This figure has started to reverse at Alconbury 
and Rugby and ought to become more 
incorporated in base valuations as the 
pace of sales increases and our valuers 
are able to factor in greater corroboration. 
The estimated September 2017 discount 
is higher than the equivalent figures last 
year (September 2016: £91 million, or 
60p per share) but lower than our interim 
(March 2017: £103 million, or 7.1p per share). 
In the meantime, maintained housing demand 
ought to be sufficient to ensure that net cash 
proceeds under our sales arrangements 
realise better than 2x current EPRA 
September 2017 plot values, even on 
completely flat house price assumptions.
Dividend
The final dividend of 2.0p per share 
maintains the stated policy of increasing 
annual dividends by 10 per cent when the 
performance of the Company and the 
Board’s estimation of future prospects 
is seen as warranting such. There will be a 
scrip dividend alternative for which I shall 
again be electing.
Continuing thanks
The outcomes this year underlined by the 
pace of progress in recent weeks speak 
loudly to the commitment and dedication 
of Board and staff colleagues alike. It is 
most gratifying to report that our collective 
judgements appear to be proving sound. 
It is a privilege and a delight to be part of 
such a team. We are far from finished yet.
Nigel Hugill
Chief Executive

In addition, Catesby is promoting 
10,000 new units on its own account and 
on behalf of third parties, which would lift 
the total to 50,000 prospective new dwellings 
overall. We are not about to get ahead of 
ourselves and will reset our targets only 
when the existing objectives are met. Internal 
governance has been strengthened with the 
formalisation of the Executive Management 
Committee, reporting directly to your Board, 
which establishes a broad and efficient corporate 
structure for risk management, delivery 
and future growth.
Outlook
Unusually for the property sector, there are 
very few qualifications in relation to the 
near‑ term outlook of your Company. 
In terms of the markets in which we operate, 
overall levels of housing activity have generally 
been more resilient than had been expected 
in the period since the EU referendum. 
Across all regions, house price inflation has 
been steady at around 5 per cent during 
2017. Outside London, house price inflation 
is broadly stable while housing transactions 
have been trending gently upwards. This 
confidence is reflected by housebuilders 
continuing to enter into contracts with 
Urban&Civic containing minimal annual 
commitments that extend well beyond 
the Brexit horizon.
Measures of affordability that capture the 
impact of lower borrowing costs have improved 
considerably since the recession. Across all 
regions, it has been estimated that initial 
mortgage payments for first‑ time buyers 
are currently equivalent to about a third of 
average post‑ tax earnings. This compares 
with a peak of over 50 per cent in 2007/08. 
Reflecting this, the number of first‑ time 
buyers has increased from a recession 
low of around 150,000 to around 350,000. 
The abolition of stamp duty for that group 
of purchasers on properties of up to £300,000 
can only assist sales on our sites at present. 
With high employment and borrowing costs 
remaining at historic lows, overall levels 
of housing market activity are, in my view, 
likely to trend upwards. The reasonable 
expectation is for house prices rising broadly 
in line with average earnings over the 
medium term and housing transactions 
rising further.
Your Company has been blazing its own 
trail towards the creation of a new asset 
class for licence sales on strategic projects. 
The resulting lack of comparable transactional 
evidence continues to provide challenges 
to our valuers. They are starting to nudge 
down the discount rates applied to contracted 
sales. Nevertheless, the gap between their 
starting point of the current appraised 
open market value of 150–200 plots and  20

strategic sites
Following your most recent purchase, what is your level 
of capacity in terms of manpower and cash flow to deliver 
further schemes? Is your cash flow generation fast enough? 
How do you propose to grow the business? 
 RB: We now have six sites; we could happily handle three to four 
more at different stages of maturity with additional project 
manager hires. Perhaps more. The formalisation of the Executive 
Management Committee is part of our maturing business model 
and reflects the ability and experience of our senior people to manage 
an increasing portfolio. Priors Hall will benefit from a bit of what 
Nigel calls “tough love” but we are already introducing procedures 
there that are consistent with those that are used elsewhere. 
The fundamental switch of mindset on strategic sites is that 
they are better seen as large‑ scale property development than 
conventional housebuilding. Much of the more complex project 
management comes at the front. Equally, while the eventual project 
spends may be at least on par with the schemes that we undertook 
in London, individual infrastructure packages tend to be smaller 
and there is much greater conformity and design consistency. 
As such, the risks are lower once the schemes are underway.
What is the planning status at Waterbeach?
NH: Urban&Civic and the Secretary of State for Defence submitted 
a planning application in February 2017 for the construction of up 
to 6,500 new homes on 293 hectares (715 acres) of brownfield land 
at Waterbeach Barracks, to the immediate north of Cambridge and 
part of the existing settlement of Waterbeach. Construction has 
started on site already to convert some of the existing Barracks 
buildings into 240 rooms for medical staff at Papworth Hospital. 
Detailed travel to work analysis for the main application based 
on census data has demonstrated a definitive requirement for new 
housing in the north of Cambridge, including requirements from 
the enlarging Science Park. Our best current estimate for the 
main application coming to planning committee is Q2 2018.
Which are the most active housebuilders at the moment 
on your sites? What trends are you seeing on your sites?
RB: It remains early days for us but the list of housebuilders on 
our sites (Hopkins Homes, Redrow, Morris Homes, Crest Nicholson, 
Davidsons and Avant) is a solid indication of the type of housebuilders 
with which we are most likely to partner. We are not evangelistic; 
we sold a 64‑ plot parcel to Bellway at Newark and the existing 
spread at Priors Hall is wider. Nevertheless, encouraging regional 
builders fits squarely with the Government agenda and is an 
important component of our Master Developer model.
As to trends, people like to see a show home and they are attracted 
by Urban&Civic being seen to have responsibility for site‑ wide matters 
(being an early mover is one thing but a pioneer on a never‑ ending 
building site is quite another). Our housebuilders are keen already 
to roll onto new parcels (saves on prelims and gives sub‑ contractors 
a pipeline of work, which helps keep control of wage inflation). I am 
also confident that peer group quality will be self‑ reinforcing. 
That has not always been the case on consortium sites in the past, 
which typically tended towards the lowest common denominator. 
Urban&Civic licences act against that temptation. 
What percentage of home buyers on your sites receive 
assistance from Help to Buy? 
NH: 46 per cent across all sites (52 per cent at Alconbury).
Is that a concern?
NH: Quite the opposite. It shows that we are facilitating housing 
delivery for young people and families in areas for which home 
ownership is an absolute priority. The Help to Buy equity share 
scheme was designed to provide access to the mortgage markets 
to home buyers that could afford monthly servicing repayments but 
not accumulate sufficient initial capital to fund a 25 per cent deposit. 
That was the primary objective. By definition those aspirants tend 
to be younger people in employment in middle England, where the 
cost of housebuying is appreciably lower than renting, once the 
hurdle of the initial deposit has been scaled.
The latest figures from the Department of Communities and 
Local Government speak for themselves; from the launch of the 
scheme in the second quarter of 2013, up to the end of June 2017, 
134,558 properties had been bought. The vast majority of these 
were purchased by first‑ time buyers. Those housebuyers gravitate 
naturally to high quality environments like ours where quality of living, 
green spaces and great schools can be taken as given. Self‑ evidently, 
there is a skewing towards new housing in the process but the 
Urban&Civic model tends to be more sensitive to absorption than 
marginal pricing. The bigger point from our perspective is will 
Government reduce access to young buyers when 95 per cent 
of mortgages are otherwise economically unavailable? Certainly 
not this one.
Group site locations 22 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

 continued
Is that a concern? continued
NH: We are past peak capital requirement at Alconbury and 
approaching first sales at Rugby and Newark. There are Phase 1 
receipts to come at Priors Hall and all further infrastructure 
investment scheduled to be financed from HCA project facilities. We 
are working very hard on taking on at least one project to champion 
on the Oxford to Cambridge road and rail corridor. That would be 
an addition to the back end of our project chronology – so not very 
capital demanding in the first instance but potentially of very 
substantial scale.
This picks upon a continuing theme as to the risk. We are not about 
to alter our approach to low gearing and to limiting Group borrowing 
against land to ten‑ year plus facilities from Government. On the 
basis that we get things right, there ought to be sufficient asset 
leverage in the projects. The recent commercial property sales free 
up capacity and the net cash proceeds were only partially redeployed 
in Priors Hall. Moreover, we are not necessarily wedded to keeping 
maximum ownership in our strategic projects. The new property 
asset class in large site investments could well involve percentage 
sell‑ downs and reinvestment in less mature propositions.
You have been a little quiet about Civic Living. 
What has happened there?
NH: No change of strategy. We are not about to compete with our 
housebuilding customers and have held back a few months for them 
to get established. Our starting position is that we will build out the 
more complicated parcels, notably those containing a high proportion 
of apartments. The best plots go to our customers. 
We will be on site early in 2018 now with 138 units at Alconbury, 
fronting directly onto a main entrance including a number of 
apartments. Rugby and Newark, together about 200 units, should 
start delivery in the current financial year. The ultimate objective is 
for 10 to 20 per cent of overall sales to be through Civic Living. 
Obviously, this excludes, for example, sales at New Square 
in Manchester, or likely PRS build at Waterbeach, where the pace 
would be much faster.
You recently sold the newly opened Hampton by Hilton 
Hotel at Stansted Airport and two commercial assets in the 
North East. Are there more potential commercial sales in 
the pipeline? Do you expect to bring any more commercial 
developments online this financial year?
NH: The short answer to the first question is not many because 
we have few other commercial assets to sell at present.
Those sales also serve to reinforce our clarity of purpose. 
Property companies are husbanders of assets. The responsibility 
of management is to look to maximise returns, relative to the risk 
that is being assumed. Investors can take decisions on which 
subsectors they favour. Urban&Civic was established for the very 
purpose of disrupting the standard approaches to housing delivery. 
Our Master Developer model was devised to do just that. In the 
meantime, all significant indicators point to our being in that 
period where the strongest housing performance, especially in 
terms of absorption, comes from locations with good connections 
to London. Government actions are serving as a reinforcement.

Accordingly, we remain categorical as to the direction of travel. 
Last year we reported that 73 per cent of gross property assets 
were in residential plots, mostly within a 100‑ mile radius of London. 
With the recent commercial sales and the acquisition of Priors Hall, 
we are now approaching 85 per cent, with a further 5 per cent in Catesby. 
Our licence arrangements with housebuilders contain the equivalent 
of five years’ forward sales contracts and substantively all our project 
borrowings are ten‑ year interest accrued facilities with the Homes 
and Communities Agency. No other listed property company 
comes close to this configuration and security of commitment.
RB: That is not to say that we will stop undertaking commercial 
development entirely. The senior management is steeped in 
experience, including those from the former Terrace Hill business. 
The retail park at Bradford is midway through a major upgrade 
and repositioning. We are working up new proposals with local 
authority landowners in Sunderland and Wolverhampton, where 
good progress is being made in securing pre‑ lettings. Most of our 
strategic land projects have commercial components. Away from 
our own residential sites, commercial projects will almost certainly 
be institutionally funded. There is clear appetite and therefore 
this remains a strategic priority.
Is the plan to eventually dispose of all completed assets 
which fall out of your strategic land expertise?
RB: Not necessarily. Where we can, we may decide to keep commercial 
assets on our major projects for income. Plus, as Nigel says, one 
should always look at the relative. Disposals are only made when 
additional value creation opportunities and expected market 
movements attaching to an asset are outweighed by the returns 
achievable through alternative investment of sale proceeds. 
What is the case is that overhead coverage through retaining 
income‑ producing commercial assets is less of a priority as a 
result of our strategic land minimums. Forward funding means 
that we will have less to sell; either could change over time.
Can shareholders expect dividends to grow as plot sales rise?
NH: Yes. The informal current policy is for 10 per cent annual 
growth, so long as the results warrant and the Group is largely 
reinvesting. Shareholders can expect to see increasing dividends 
as net cash generation gathers pace.

Solid growth and  
increased demand
Introduction
With six housebuilders constructing homes on seven separate 
land parcels, over three strategic land sites, the Group’s income 
statement profile continues to evolve reflecting our increased 
investment in residential land.
The Group’s joint venture with Hopkins Homes at Alconbury 
is performing well, completing on 52 homes in the year with 
a further 45 homes either exchanged or reserved by Hopkins, 
Morris Homes and Redrow. Davidsons achieved 15 reservations 
at Rugby and subsequent to the year end the first five 
reservations were made by Avant Homes at Newark.
Revaluations reflecting development progress and the 
post‑year ‑ end disposal of Stansted have also contributed 
to our 7.1 per cent growth in EPRA NAV per share.
In the absence of significant trading profits in the second 
half from either Catesby or commercial asset disposals, the 
reported profit after tax is broadly in line with the first half, 
with rental income and property trading profits all but 
covering overheads.
Key performance indicators
We have previously stated that both EPRA net asset value 
(EPRA NAV) and total shareholder returns are used to evaluate 
performance, and this remains the case; however, other key 
metrics that are important or are of growing importance 
include look‑ through gearing, EPRA triple net asset value 
(EPRA NNNAV), which provides for deferred tax on property 
revaluations, and plot completions. The growing importance 
of the latter two measures reflects lower historical tax loss 
coverage for profits going forward and growing plot 
completions at our strategic sites.
KEY OBSERVATIONS
• 52 home completions and a further 
59 reservations or exchanges in 
the year at Alconbury and Rugby.
• EPRA NAV per share up 7 .1 per cent 
to 304.4p per share; or 9.6 per cent 
per annum since 2014 Listing.
• 80 per cent of the Group’s property 
portfolio now in strategic sites.
• Government borrowings now 
account for over 80 per cent 
of total drawn debt (taking into 
account the post balance sheet 
sale of Stansted and Feethams 
and acquisition of Priors Hall).
• Large site discount at Alconbury 
and Rugby (pro-rata) now starting 
to reverse. Estimated to be around 
£99 million, or 68p per share, on the 
basis of CBRE valuation assumptions 
(March 2017: £103 million or 
71p per share).
• Increasing dividend to 2.0p, 
providing a full year dividend 
of 3.2p up 10.3 per cent.

EPRA NAV has grown from £323.8 million on the May 2014 Listing to £439.3 million at 30 September 2017, representing a compound 
annual growth rate of 9.6 per cent after an annual dividend pay‑ out of around one per cent. The 7.2 per cent (£29.5 million) increase in 
EPRA NAV in the last 12 months to 30 September 2017 is further analysed below.
Total shareholder return for the year increased 16 per cent, reflecting a 33.0p rise in share price (to 258.0p per share at 30 September 2017) 
and two dividends paid during the year totalling 3.0p per share. This compares to a 1.43 per cent rise in the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index 
and a 7.84 per cent increase in the FTSE All‑ Share Index.
Net asset value – EPRA and IFRS
The movements in EPRA and IFRS NAV during the year are summarised below. This analysis, together with the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income and balance sheet summaries presented further in my commentary, provides a non‑ statutory, line by line, proportional 
consolidation of the joint venture balances to aid comparability.

Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
The Group’s profit before tax for the year was £7.9 million, down £18.0 million from the previous financial year. This was predominantly as 
a result of lower investment property revaluation surpluses, following reclassification of Rugby to trading stock at the end of last year, and 
a fall in profits made on the sale of trading properties. These decreases have been partially offset by a net write up of trading properties 
this year compared to a write down of £7.1 million last year, a significant proportion of which related to our Scottish land sites.

1. Including residential property sales as disclosed in note 2 to the Group financial statements.
Revenue
Residential property sales, which are effectively a new income 
stream this year, now account for over 55 per cent (£33.8 million) 
of total revenue (62.8 per cent if you include joint venture residential 
sales). This relative growth in importance has been assisted somewhat 
by a £69.6 million reduction in other trading property sales since 
last year, which, you may recall, benefited from the £38.2 million 
sale of our foodstore in Herne Bay and the disposal of residential 
flats at Bridge Quay, Bristol, for £17.3 million.
At the half year, I explained that our residential revenues were 
generated from house sales by our joint venture with Hopkins 
Homes as well as the recognition of contractual minimums under 
our licence arrangements with Morris Homes at Alconbury. While 
this pattern continued into the second half (Hopkins generated 
£15.2 million for the year and Morris £10.7 million), the Group also 
recognised additional minimums in respect of Redrow licence 
arrangements at Alconbury (£6.8 million) and, for the first time, 
£0.3 million of overages on 11 contractual exchanges on properties 
sold by Morris Homes and Redrow, again at Alconbury.
Our Rugby joint venture also started to produce income from 
minimums (£11.0 million for our 50 per cent share) under arrangements 
with Crest Nicholson and Morris Homes. You will note I have 
proportionally consolidated this sum in the above table for 
ease of comparability going forward.
By way of reminder our use of the term “licence arrangements” 
refers to a number of agreements that the Group has entered 
into with housebuilders at our strategic sites. These licence 
agreements typically comprise a fixed element (the minimums) due 
to the Group upon reaching unconditional exchange and a variable 
element which is dependent on the final selling price of the house 
(the overage).
Accounting standards require us to recognise revenue when 
the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to a buyer 
and revenue can be measured reliably, among other criteria. 
Following contractual completion, and where the licence agreement 
sees us transfer land and take a charge over that land to secure 
the future overages, management is of the view that the criteria 
for recognising the revenue associated with the minimums have 
been met. Furthermore, only when the housebuilder has exchanged 
the sales contract with the home buyer, do management currently 
consider they can reliably measure and recognise overages. Current 
revenue recognition reflects the early stage of development at the 
strategic sites, where there is limited track record of sales coupled 
with the inherent uncertainty over future house prices. You should 
be aware that accounting standards are changing in this area and 
we have set out the effect of the new standard (IFRS 15 ‘Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers’) would have on current‑ year results 
in note 1 to the Group financial statements. The new standard will 
not be effective for the Group until the period commencing 
1 October 2018.
The Hopkins Homes and Davidsons arrangements do not involve 
a land transfer prior to the sale to the homeowner and therefore the 
risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred (and no revenue 
is recognised) until then. 
Although minimums and overages are recognised in full when the 
above criteria are met, as they are due in stages over the next four 
to five years they have been discounted at the counterparty’s 
weighted average cost of capital.
The amount of profit recognised in respect of the contractual 
minimums and overages is discussed overleaf.
Other revenues were broadly in line with the prior year. 28 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Gross profit
Gross profits are £2.2 million lower than reported in the year to 
30 September 2016 or £0.9 million lower if the Group’s share of 
joint venture trading property sales is proportionately consolidated.
Profits from trading property sales include £4.6 million in respect 
of residential sales at Alconbury, £4.2 million of Catesby land promotion 
profits, £0.4 million from Bridge Quay and Scottish land disposals 
and £1.1 million from Rugby joint venture residential sales. 
Residential sales profits at Alconbury comprise £2.2 million generated 
by the sale of 52 Hopkins homes, £2.1 million in respect of Morris Homes 
and Redrow contractual minimums, and overages of £0.3 million 
on exchanges made by Redrow and Morris. All of Rugby’s profits 
relate to Crest Nicholson and Morris Homes minimums.
Hopkins Homes sales amount to c. £42,000 of net proceeds per home, 
which, if you add back £15,000 of attributable land cost of sales, 
equates to £57,000 of unserviced land value per home, equivalent 
to 2.1x CBRE’s unserviced land value at 30 September 2017 (being 
£26,600 per plot). We have labelled this differential the wholesale 
discount and it represents the difference between day 1 values being 
achieved on single plot sales and the plot value implied by CBRE 
valuation assumptions, which assume a disposal of the entire site. 
While Hopkins averages are across a limited number of private plots, 
the principle set out above has been used in calculating the 68p per 
share wholesale discount referred to in the Chief Executive’s statement. 
The main adjustments to the Hopkins averages include blending 
pricing to take into account the effect of providing required affordable 
housing and other site‑ wide averaging in respect of servicing costs. 
The level of profit recognised in respect of contractual minimums 
reflects the full recognition of the discounted revenue referred to 
above net of the full associated cost of sale, which means overages 
will not bear further cost deductions as and when they arise.
The increase in rental and other property profits, when compared 
to the prior period, is due to additional rent from the completed 
Feethams Leisure scheme and increased project management fees 
on our developments.
Trading property write‑ ups of £1.4 million substantially relate 
to the completed hotel development at Stansted (£1.2 million).
Administrative expenses
Administrative costs of £14.7 million were expensed in the year, 
after capitalising £5.2 million into the Group’s development projects. 
The £2.4 million increase over the 12 months to 30 September 2017 
is predominantly due to a lower proportionate capitalisation 
(26.2 per cent this year compared to 36.7 per cent last year) following 
development completion of Feethams, Herne Bay and Stansted.
Administrative costs also include a £3.1 million charge in relation 
to the non‑ cash share‑ based payment expense (2016: £2.4 million). 
A corresponding credit has been included within retained earnings, 
resulting in the expense having no NAV impact.
Surplus on revaluation of investment properties
There have been a number of reclassifications over the last two years 
that have mirrored the Group’s changing view on those assets it 
intends to hold for income generation and capital growth and those 
it intends to sell. Following last year’s transfer of the Group’s share 
in Rugby to trading stock, a decision has been made this year to 
move the remaining Alconbury residential (previously earmarked 
for retention and rental) to trading stock and bring in a proportion 
of Waterbeach to investment properties (these movements are 
explained in more detail below). The Group now holds a less significant 
proportion of its assets, or parts of assets in the case of Alconbury 
and Waterbeach, as investment properties and therefore valuation 
movements have reduced through the income statement; uplifts on 
trading properties are only recognised through EPRA measures.
Investment properties generated £4.9 million of revaluation surpluses 
in the year and Alconbury was responsible for £5.9 million of that uplift. 
Feethams was written down to the post balance sheet sales value, 
which pared back the overall uplift to £4.9 million.
Given the scale and bifurcation of Alconbury across the Group’s 
balance sheet, I have set out below how CBRE’s valuation is 
incorporated into the Group’s NAV.
CBRE’s valuation of Alconbury increased from £197.1 million 
to £235.5 million in the year, based on the consistent assumption 
that we deliver serviced land parcels – CBRE does not value any 
work in progress in respect of housebuilding the Group may 
undertake through joint venture or on their own account.
After allowing for housebuilding expenditure incurred at 
Alconbury, under the contractual arrangements with Hopkins 
Homes, the valuation increases to £244.6 million. The allocation 
of the value within our year‑ end balance sheet is shown below.

S
The revaluation movements on the previous page reflect increases 
in sales value assumptions, which have been supported by evidence 
generated through the reservations, exchanges and sales at the 
Hopkins Homes, Redrow and Morris Homes land parcels and reduced 
discount rates for land subject to contractual arrangements.
Taxation expense
The tax charge for the year of £1.1 million reflects an effective rate 
of tax of 14.0 per cent, lower than the average rate of UK corporation 
tax for the period, principally due to losses brought forward and 
excess losses generated in the period available to offset realised 
profits and revaluation surpluses. The charge relates in most part 
to the utilisation of losses brought forward.
Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend of 2.0p in respect of the year 
ended 30 September 2017, taking the total dividend to 3.2p, up 
10.3 per cent on last year. Subject to shareholder approval at the 
AGM to be held on 8 February 2018, the dividend will be paid on 
23 February 2018 to shareholders on the register on 12 January 2018. 
Investors choosing to participate in the dividend reinvestment 
scheme will need to make their election by 26 January 2018.
The Group paid its final dividend for the year to 30 September 2016 
in February 2017 and the interim dividend in July 2017 at rates 
of 1.8p and 1.2p per share respectively, amounting to £4.5 million 
in total.

Non-current assets
Investment properties and investment properties held for sale
As a result of the reclassification of a proportion of the Group’s property interests at Waterbeach from trading stock to investment 
properties and a reclassification of the remaining Alconbury residential plots in the other direction (there is no longer the intention to 
develop and hold those homes for income) investment properties at 30 September 2017 amounted to £99.8 million comprising Bradford 
and Feethams leisure assets (£36.5 million) as well as the commercial development area at Alconbury (£60.3 million) and a proportion 
of the Waterbeach site (£3.0 million), which could deliver both commercial buildings and residential properties for rent in due course. 
As previously highlighted, CBRE valued the entire Alconbury site at £235.5 million which, after adding back the incurred cost of building 
houses under the Hopkins Homes joint venture arrangements, specifically excluded by CBRE the total Alconbury site value increased to 
£244.6 million. Of this total, the Group intends to retain £60.3 million as a long‑ term investment. 
The leisure asset at Bradford was also valued by CBRE at the year end, whereas Feethams was held at Directors’ valuation, following its 
post‑year‑end disposal. This subsequent sale is also the reason why Feethams has been classified as an investment property for sale in 
the balance sheet. 30 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Consolidated balance sheet continued
Non-current assets continued
Investment properties and investment properties held for sale continued
The Group’s total year‑ end property portfolio, irrespective of balance sheet classification, was valued at £551.3 million, 76 per cent by 
independent valuers CBRE and 24 per cent by Directors. Around a half of those properties valued by Directors were supported by 
post‑year‑end disposals.
The pie charts below provide an overview of EPRA NAV by business segment over the last two years, as well as the post year‑ end position 
that takes into account the sale of the Stansted Hotel and Feethams, together with the acquisition of the strategic site in Priors Hall.
Investment in equity accounted joint ventures and associates 
The Group’s 50 per cent interest in the Rugby site has been 
included in the balance sheet at £59.8 million. 
As a result of the decision in the last financial year to reclassify 
the site as a trading property from investment property, the 
£6.8 million revaluation has not been taken through the income 
statement as was the case in prior periods, but has instead been 
recognised through EPRA NAV. The market movement reflects 
increases in sales value assumptions and consequently serviced 
land values as well as the completion of the Crest Nicholson and 
Morris Homes contracts, which de‑ risk early land parcel revenue 
receipts. The sales launch by Davidsons in April this year and 
subsequent reservations and exchanges are supportive of 
CBRE’s pricing assumptions.
Other interests in joint ventures and associates total £17.0 million, 
up £13.7 million from last year, predominantly as a result of acquiring 
a one‑ third partnership stake in a 400‑ acre (162.3‑ hectare) site at 
Wintringham Park, St Neots, Cambridgeshire, for £13.3 million. 
An application has now been submitted for up to 2,800 residential 
units, 63,500 sq.m. of employment space, a district centre with 
ancillary uses and two primary schools. Further details are provided 
in note 13 to the Group financial statements.
Deferred tax assets
The Group has recognised an asset of £4.2 million in respect of the 
Group’s tax losses which are expected to be utilised against future 
profits of the Group. The £0.9 million reduction from last year end 
reflects utilisation of the losses brought forward against the Group’s 
profitable activities during the year.
Non-current trade and other receivables
The £16.9 million disclosed on the face of the balance sheet 
represents the discounted value of the Morris Homes and Redrow 
contractual minimums at Alconbury. Equivalent receivables are 
owed to the Rugby joint venture by Crest Nicholson (£5.4 million) 
and again Morris Homes (£5.5 million). All sums due will be received 
as and when the houses to which they relate are sold.
Current assets
Trading properties
The carrying value of trading properties increased by £104.5 million 
in the year to £289.7 million, as a result of the £1.5 million acquisition 
of a land parcel in Skelton, construction expenditure at Stansted 
(£19.8 million), development expenditure at the strategic land sites 
totalling £50.2 million, £7 .4 million of Catesby promotion expenditure 
and £14.2 million of other property expenditure. Against this 
£93.1 million of acquisitions and additions, the Group has disposed 
of £30.3 million of trading assets (including 52 homes at Alconbury 
and three Catesby sites); written back £1.4 million of previous 
provisions (see above); and reclassified a net £40.3 million from 
investment properties (£43.3 million in respect of Alconbury 
residential and £3.0 million in relation to Waterbeach).
Included within the figures mentioned above is £4.5 million of 
capitalised overheads. All trading properties are carried in the 
balance sheet at the lower of cost (or acquisition date fair value) 
and net realisable value.

S
Cash
Group cash balances were £12.2 million at the year end, down 
from £15.1 million at 30 September 2016. The £2.9 million decrease 
reflects an intensive period of construction activity, particularly in 
relation to our strategic land sites and hotel development at Stansted. 
Property additions, including our share of joint ventures, amounted 
to £120.3 million in the year and were part funded by £70.8 million 
of new borrowings, £21.7 million of net receipts on the sale of 
Herne Bay and other working capital movements.
Liabilities
Current and non-current borrowings
The Group has drawn three new loans in the year totalling 
£62.1 million and repaid £16.1 million following sale completion 
of the Sainsbury’s foodstore, Herne Bay, which was recognised in 
the 2016 accounts on unconditional exchange. These new drawings 
included £21.4 million from the new £45.1 million HCA facility at 
Alconbury, £17 .2 million in respect of the Stansted Hotel development 
and £23.5 million under the £40.0 million revolving credit facility. 
The latter facility requires full pay down for a set period in each 
financial year and has therefore been classified as due within one 
year in this year’s balance sheet. Following the post year‑ end sale 
of Stansted, this facility was paid down and requires no further 
repayments until maturity in June 2019.
Further drawings during the year of £17.3 million (Group’s share 
£8.7 million) were made from the HCA facility within the Rugby 
joint venture.
Financial resources and capital management
The Group’s net debt position at 30 September 2017 totalled 
£81.7 million (30 September 2016: £34.5 million), comprising 
external borrowings of £93.9 million and cash reserves of 
£12.2 million, producing a net gearing ratio of 22.0 per cent 
(30 September 2016: 9.4 per cent) on an IFRS NAV basis and 
18.6 per cent (30 September 2016: 8.4 per cent) on an EPRA 
NAV basis.
On a full look‑ through basis, which additionally includes the Group’s 
share of joint ventures’ net debt, gearing on an EPRA basis increases 
to 21.3 per cent. I previously stated that gearing measures would 
rise with increased development at our strategic land sites, especially 
ahead of reaching project peak capital requirement; however, it 
remains well within our self‑ imposed limit of 30 per cent and if you 
factor in the post balance sheet sale of Stansted and Feethams, and 
the acquisition of a 5,000+ unit site at Priors Hall, this measure 
falls back to 15.2 per cent. Of the £120 million of debt drawn at the 
year end, on a look‑ through basis, £58.9 million relates to HCA facilities. 
This proportion increases as a result of the post balance sheet 
disposals and acquisition.
The Group will continue to fund new developments or acquisitions 
through debt as required; however , we remain committed not to borrow 
from commercial banks in respect of infrastructure spend at our 
strategic sites. The Group will, however, continue to seek to borrow 
from Government sources, such as the HCA, where such borrowing 
enhances the speed with which such sites can be brought forward 
and where the terms can be expected to enhance our returns. 
Undrawn facilities at 30 September 2017 totalled £41.0 million 
(£50.4 million including joint venture facilities).
The Group’s weighted average loan maturity at 30 September 2017 
was 5.3 years (30 September 2016: 5.6 years) and weighted average 
cost of borrowing on drawn debt was 2.9 per cent (30 September 2016: 
3.0 per cent). The Group has no loans maturing over the next three years, 
with the exception of the £40 million revolving credit facility (RCF), 
which matures in June 2019, and a £6 million amortising investment 
facility in respect of our Bradford leisure asset.
The Group maintains a comprehensive business plan model which 
forecasts the cash usage and generation on a project‑ by‑ project 
and consolidated basis for five years, or longer in relation to our 
strategic land sites. This model is regularly updated and informs 
the Group as to its cash needs, allowing us to plan ahead. Further 
information on how the Group assesses long‑ term viability can 
found on page 32.
Post balance sheet events
Although I have already detailed the effect of post balance sheet 
events on the year‑ end valuations and gearing above, I would direct 
you to note 27 to the Group financial statements for further details 
on the October acquisition of Priors Hall and the Stansted Hotel 
disposal, as well as the November disposal of Feethams, Darlington.

Long-term viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2. of the UK Corporate Code 2016, 
the Directors have assessed the prospects and financial viability 
of the Group, taking into account both its current position and 
circumstances, and having made reasonable assumptions about 
its future trading performance and the potential impact of its 
principal risks set out in the risk review on pages 33 to 37.
The Directors’ detailed viability assessment was made in respect 
of a five‑ year period ending 30 September 2022, although where 
the duration of a particular development project extended beyond 
five years, the lifetime business plan for that development was 
reviewed to ensure commitments beyond five years did not impact 
ongoing viability.
The five‑ year review period was considered appropriate for the 
following reasons:
• the Group’s annual strategic review covers a five‑ year period;
• serviced land sales contracts in respect of the Group’s strategic 
land sites, which account for over two‑ thirds of the Group’s 
EPRA NAV, typically take the purchaser five years to build out 
and sell; 
• contractual arrangements in relation to capital expenditure 
do not normally exceed five years; and
• availability of finance and forecasting uncertainty reduces 
reliability over longer periods.
Assessing viability
The Directors assess ongoing viability principally through:
• five‑ year business plans, which are presented periodically at Board 
meetings and detail quarterly and annual cash flows (including 
dividends), balance sheets, income statements for each business 
segment or material asset, as well as financial covenant 
compliance for the period under review;
• sensitivity analysis of key assumptions and/or principal risks 
embedded within the five‑ year business plans;
• scenario modelling, which is overlaid on the five‑ year business plans 
and typically comprises investment and divestment opportunities;
• annual strategy days, which are used by the Board to agree 
priorities and budgets, which are then owned and monitored by 
relevant senior employees. Material changes to budgets require 
further Board approval and only then will the five‑ year business 
plan be updated; and
• reviewing unutilised facilities and borrowing capacity over 
the period under review.
Qualifications and assumptions
In making their assessment on viability the Directors stress tested 
the Group’s models for a number of identified risks and uncertainties, 
which were chosen to reflect the significant uncertainty surrounding 
the UK’s future economic prospects, especially in light of triggering 
Article 50 and current cyclical positioning of the housing market.
Specific scenarios modelled included delays in projected sales and 
sales rates (taking into account contractual minimum receipts already 
in place), decreases in property values and variations in discretionary 
expenditure that could mitigate downside revenue assumptions. 
No key metrics were breached with the corporate gearing remaining 
below 30 per cent throughout the forecast period.
Based on the assessment detailed above, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due for the next five years and that it is appropriate to continue 
to prepare financial statements on a going concern basis, as 
discussed in the Directors’ report on page 123.
This long‑ term viability statement was approved by the Board 
on 27 November 2017.

A top down, bottom up  
approach to risk management
Part of the Audit Committee’s role is to ensure that the 
Group’s risk management framework and processes on 
which the Board relies are working effectively. 
The work undertaken by the Audit Committee in relation 
to risk and internal controls and its anticipated 2017/18 
work programme are further set out in the Audit Committee 
report on pages 98 to 103; however, a key improvement 
made by the Audit Committee this year, and one worth 
highlighting, is the appointment of Grant Thornton to 
provide internal audit services to the Group and to 
report and provide assurance on the adequacy of the 
financial and non‑ financial controls.
A further framework development during the year, which 
has formalised and reinforced the Group’s bottom up 
approach to risk management, was the establishment 
of an Executive Management Committee (EMC), whose 
responsibilities include:
• input into the design of internal controls and risk 
management systems;
• maintenance of project‑ level risk registers; and
• reporting material risk events or changes to the Group’s 
risk environment upwards to the Board, outside the 
formal bi‑ monthly EMC meetings if necessary. 
Further details of the scope and structure of the EMC 
have been set out in the corporate governance review 
on pages 81 and 82.
Overview
Urban&Civic seeks to deliver on its strategic objectives of 
generating market‑ leading returns for shareholders, whilst 
recognising that it operates in a sector that is subject to market 
volatility and where risks are ever present. In order to balance  
these risks and rewards, the Group employs a risk management 
framework, which:
• establishes a risk envelope within which it is prepared to operate 
(a risk appetite);
• identifies and evaluates relevant risks applicable to the Group’s 
strategy and operations (including project delivery);
• designs, implements and seeks assurance over the effectiveness 
of mitigating actions; and
• manages those identified risks on an ongoing basis, including 
assessment of net risk (after mitigation) against risk appetite.

Risk culture and management
Central to the Group’s risk management strategy is understanding 
the risks that the Group is willing to take and those which it is not 
(its risk appetite). Risk appetite underpins the Group’s risk culture 
and consequently how employees behave when presented with 
certain key decisions or risks at a particular point in time.
In order to promote an alert and responsive risk culture and 
efficient reporting, the Board seeks to:
• provide an open door policy to all employees, which aids early 
identification and resolution of issues;
• put in place clear reporting lines and delegated authorities;
• provide formal and informal opportunities for intra‑ group 
debate and communication;
• avoid shocks to the control framework, by evolving systems at 
manageable rates and focusing on maintaining a stable senior 
management team;
• design robust and regular reporting systems, operational 
and financial as well as risk;
• provide appropriate training;
• identify and communicate the process for risk event 
acceleration outside the formal regular procedures; and
• ensure employees understand and believe the Group’s 
whistleblowing policy.
Risk management framework components
The principal components of the Group’s risk management 
framework comprise the risk appetite table (see below), risk 
registers, risk heat map and associated scoring matrices.
To monitor the Group’s risk profile at a point in time, the Board 
uses internal resources (such as the EMC and discussions with 
senior management) to help identify the Group’s key risks, assess 
the likelihood of that risk arising and estimate its potential impact 
on operations. Each key risk is summarised into a risk register, 
discussed and consequently scored against set criteria.
The Board, in conjunction with the EMC and taking into account 
any recommendations proposed by the third party internal auditor, 
Grant Thornton, designs internal action points and controls to 
help mitigate the identified key risks, resulting in a mitigated risk 
rating, which is referenced against the traffic light system set out 
on page 35. The addition in the year of both Grant Thornton and 
the EMC has provided additional assurance over the effectiveness 
of the Group’s identified mitigating actions.
The risk appetite and mitigated risk score are visually presented 
in a risk heat map, which allows the Board to reflect on whether 
the controls and any mitigating actions are deemed adequate. 
In the event that they are deemed inadequate, the Board will seek 
an alternative course of action and/ or formulate additional controls, 
with the assistance of the EMC, to mitigate risk to acceptable levels 
(back to within appetite).
The following table summarises the Board’s risk appetite and risk behaviour across the Group’s identified risk areas.
Risk description Risk appetite Risk behaviour
External environment High
The Group is prepared to operate in a volatile environment, but only when enhanced 
returns compensate for increased risk. Long‑ term viability is a key override.
Operational strategy
Moderate/
high
The Group’s strategy is enshrined in its investment decisions and investment thresholds 
and structures.
Operations Low
The Board seeks to deliver developments effectively, complying with all legislation and 
avoiding actions that could adversely impact performance or reputation.
Finance Low
The Group will seek to put in place non or limited recourse funding lines, with non‑ onerous 
covenants (on a flexed basis) and will not seek to borrow against land (with the exception of 
infrastructure loans provided by the Homes and Communities Agency).
People Low
The Group cannot function without a motivated and well‑ trained workforce and aims to 
recruit and retain high calibre staff, and to train and promote staff where appropriate.

Risk heat map
As previously noted, a key component of the Group’s risk management framework is the maintenance of risk registers. The Group 
maintains risk registers for each project and business area, which are used to revise and educate corporate level registers that are 
periodically reviewed by the Board. The corporate level registers typically include around 30 risks and, in line with last year, the most 
recently reviewed nine key risks, (cyber risk being added), are set out on the following pages.
Impact of risk Controls and mitigation/action Movement description
Risk rating

mitigation
R1. Market risk – External environment
The business model may be 
affected by external factors 
such as economic conditions, 
the property market, quoted 
property sector and political 
and legislative factors, such as 
changes in tax policy or a change 
in government. Adverse changes 
in market conditions and the 
economic environment increase 
the risk of a decline in 
shareholder returns.
• Strategy is considered at each Board meeting and 
specifically at the annual business strategy meeting.
• Consideration when making decisions is given to external 
markets, dynamics and influences.
• Press, industry forums and adviser updates are used to 
keep executives up to date in respect of external markets.
• Regional focus and local knowledge in areas with strong 
underlying economics (such as job creation) mitigate the 
impact of market and economic shocks.
• Increased focus on putting in place sales contracts with 
contractual annual minimums in respect of the Group’s 
most prominent segment: strategic sites.
• Prior to investment, detailed due diligence and financial 
appraisals are rigorously carried out and flexed to 
establish the financial outcome on a downside‑ case basis.
• Business plan and rolling long‑ term cash flow forecasts 
with detailed sensitivity analysis.
• Ongoing monitoring with the assistance, when required, 
of appropriate professional advisers (tax, accounting, 
regulatory and company law). 
• The triggering of Article 50 and 
ongoing Brexit negotiations could 
result in trading arrangements 
with the European Union that are 
damaging to the UK economy, 
increasing market risk 
correspondingly. Clarity 
may not be achieved in 
the forthcoming year.

R2. Strategic risk – Operational strategy
Implementing a strategy 
inconsistent with market 
environment, skillset and 
experience of the business 
could devalue the Group’s 
property portfolio, have an 
adverse impact on the Group’s 
cash flows and consequently 
erode total shareholder return.
• Board meetings are held at two‑ monthly intervals to 
review progress against objectives and, where necessary, 
to update strategy.
• The Group annually approves a business plan and 
produces rolling longer term cash flow forecasts with 
detailed sensitivity analysis. These are reviewed against 
the Group’s KPIs and revised where necessary.
• For assets under development, budgets are prepared  
and approved by the Board, costs are monitored by the 
Board and remedial actions are identified and approved 
where necessary.
• Material capital commitments, which have not previously 
been approved in the Group business plan, require 
additional Board approval.
• EMC oversight of project monitoring, risk reporting and 
communication throughout the corporate structure.
• Improved governance, through 
the new EMC and enhanced 
financial reporting to the Board, 
has uprated project monitoring, 
risk reporting and communication 
throughout the corporate 
structure.
• Third party internal auditor 
appointment, together with 
completed reviews of the Group’s 
risk management framework, 
procure to pay procedures and 
management and development 
of projects, has provided 
additional assurance.
R3. Legal and regulatory risk – Operational strategy
Non‑ compliance with laws 
and regulations could result 
in project delays, failure to 
obtain planning consents, 
financial penalties and 
reputational damage.
• The Group employs highly qualified and experienced staff 
and retains specialist consultants, where appropriate, to 
ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
• Despite increased regulation over  
a number of operational areas and 
events such as the Grenfell Tower 
disaster in the year, no change to 
the legal and regulatory risk rating 
has been made as the Board is 
satisfied that the impact of an 
event remains unaltered and 
controls in place remain effective.
R4. Competition risk – Operational strategy
Competition in the market 
could result in assets being 
acquired at excessive prices, 
potential assets not being 
acquired because pricing is 
too high or developments 
commencing at the wrong point 
in the cycle. 
• Use of experience and expertise in determining 
suitable offer prices and optimal project timings 
to maximise returns.
• Assessment of the threats of competition before 
acquiring assets.
• Our competitors continue 
to benefit from strong cash 
generation and capital availability, 
particularly in strategic land and 
land promotion sectors.
R5. Financial risk – Finance
Lack of funding, cost overruns 
or failure to adhere to loan 
covenants could result in 
financial loss or affect the  
ability to take advantage of 
opportunities as they arise.
• Detailed annual business plan prepared, approved 
and regularly monitored by the Board.
• Continuous monitoring of capital and debt markets 
(with advisers).
• Maintenance of good relationships with lenders.
• Review of principal terms of prospective loans and 
ongoing monitoring of covenants/requirements to 
ensure compliance.
• Improved management reporting 
and increased human resources 
have reduced monitoring risk.
• Contractual minimums with 
housebuilders at the Group’s 
strategic land sites have improved 
certainty over short‑ term cash 
receipts (subject to ongoing 
viability of the counterparty 
housebuilder).
• Reduced cash reserves, following the 
ongoing deployment of the 2014 
capital raise funds, have increased 
financial risk when compared to 
last year.
• Strategic land sites passing or fast 
approaching peak equity reduces 
ongoing financial risk.
• On balance the Board believes 
the Group’s financial risk 
remains unchanged.

Ineffective delivery of projects 
could lead to delays, reduced

• Projects are monitored on an ongoing basis by the Board. 
• Internal development and project management teams 
manage project delivery.
• Fixed price contracts are used where appropriate.
• Third party internal audit review of project 
delivery mechanisms.
• Despite the improvement in

the Group’s fundamental 
approach to delivery remains 
unchanged.
R7. Health and safety risk – Operations
Serious injury and loss of life.
Developments may be adversely 
impacted by site closure, 
delays and cost overrun.
Damage to reputation.
Directors’ liability.
• Health and safety procedures are reviewed, including 
the appointment of principal contractor and planning 
co‑ ordinator (to ensure compliance with the Construction 
(Design and Management) Regulations or as amended).
• Strict adherence to health and safety procedures 
at operational sites and Group offices.
• Due diligence carried out (including appropriate 
references) on principal contractor and design 
consultants prior to appointment.
• Appropriate insurance cover is carried by either the 
Group or its contractors.
• Increased risk rating due to 
increased scale of development. 
Training and new committees 
being undertaken and formed 
should reduce this risk back to 
historic levels going forward.
R8. Cyber risk – Operations
Loss of business credibility 
due to lack of timely, 
accurate information.
Cost of reinstatement.
Cost and reputational 
damage of breaches of data 
protection regulations.
• Password protocols and protections.
• Physical access to premises and computer servers restricted.
• Firewalls and anti‑ virus software with regular updates.
• Computer data backup and recovery procedures 
and periodic testing.
• Hardware replacement programme to reduce 
vulnerability.
• Administration rights restrictions.
• Outdated hardware, including 
firewalls and servers, replaced.
• New data recovery procedures 
implemented and tested during  
the year.
• Periodic review meetings held with 
external IT support providers.
• Weekly reports on IT 
performance received.
• Third party internal audit of IT 
systems and procedures scheduled 
for Q1 2018.
R9. People risk – People
Over‑ reliance on key people or 
inability to attract and retain 
people with appropriate 
qualities and skills, making the 
Group operationally vulnerable 
in terms of both time delays and 
replacement cost.
• The Group offers a competitive remuneration package 
including both long and short‑ term incentives.
• Remuneration Committee to review the remuneration 
policy and long‑ term incentives for staff (below Board 
level) in 2018.
• Employees generally work on a number of projects across 
the Group and are not dedicated to one particular site.
• Short reporting lines and delegated authority ensure staff 
feel they are contributing to the success of the Group.
• The Nomination Committee reviews succession planning.
• Appropriate notice periods to minimise disruption. 
• More robust succession plans 
have been put in place during 
the year.
• Formation of EMC devolves 
and spreads responsibilities 
more widely.
• Greater formal and informal staff 
engagement has occurred during 
the year.   —

STRATEGIC LAND 40 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017
STRATEGIC SITES
At the core of our business are the strategic sites where, 
as Master Developer, we are currently bringing forward 
5,370 acres of land predominantly within 100 miles of 
London through our fully serviced land parcel model.
With the addition this year of Wintringham and Priors Hall, 
our strategic sites will deliver around 29,470 new homes, 
more than 7 million sq.ft. of business space, at least 
14 primary schools and six secondary schools.
We work with our land owning partners, local authorities, 
communities and businesses, as well as the Homes 
and Communities Agency and our housebuilder and 
commercial customers, to use all the levers available 
to accelerate the delivery of homes, spaces, places 
and communities of real quality. 
We actively encourage the small and medium-sized 
housebuilding market by reducing the barriers to delivery 
through licence structures which reduces upfront payments 
and allows us to share in the retail sales price achieved. 
We define ourselves through our projects and maintain an 
absolute focus on quality from the first tree to the last roof 
tile and beyond. 
Civic Living is our own brand housebuilding business which will:
•  only bring forward parcels of land on our strategic sites;
•  once established, aim to build and sell over 200 homes 
a year across our portfolio; and 
•  avoid competing with our housebuilder customers 
by delivering a differentiated product on more 
complicated plots.
We will always offer our best land parcels to our customers 
but, as a Master Developer, we view Civic Living as yet a 
further lever by which we can meet national and local 
government ambitions to increase the delivery of homes 
from our strategic sites. 
We have consent for 138 Civic Living homes at Alconbury 
Weald and will be applying for planning approval at Rugby 
and Newark in 2018. Delivery is anticipated to commence 
during early 2018.

In planning 
 (56%) Catesby controls land totalling 76 acres which has been allocated for 
640 new homes in the recently adopted Warwick District Local Plan 
(September 2017). The land is controlled through two separate promotion 
agreements, the first of which was agreed in April 2014, at which point the 
land was not identified as an allocation in the emerging Local Plan. 
Due to the land’s proximity to an identified site for large scale development 
in the emerging Local Plan and our own assessment of the Council’s need 
to allocate more housing, which was proved correct through the Local Plan 
examination in public process, the site was subsequently identified by the 
Local Authority for development. 
A planning application will be submitted in early 2018, four years after 
Catesby agreed in principle the first land agreement. This site reinforces 
the need to have a portfolio of scale in order to exploit alternative planning 
strategies, due to the timescales required for delivery of sites through 
Local Plans.
Kenilworth has a population of 25,532 and is a highly desirable place to live 
with low crime rates, strong education provision and a wide range of leisure 
facilities. The town has seen relatively little new housing development in 
the last 20 years and as a consequence we expect the site to be in high 
demand from housebuilders.
 PROGRESS THIS YEAR
• The Catesby business model continues to work well with a 
record number of live planning applications or consents in 
respect of land which would deliver 3,145 dwellings across 
17 sites at year end.
• In addition, land for 600 dwellings has been allocated 
in recently adopted Local Plans and sites sufficient for 
650 dwellings are in draft allocations in emerging Local Plans. 
• The anticipated average price per square foot of dwellings 
for private sale by our customers is £328, reflecting Catesby’s 
continued focus on areas of high demand for new homes.
• Of the 3,145 dwellings identified, 735 lie within the Myton 
Green site in Leamington Spa, an area recently voted as the 
most desirable place to live in England. The site has outline 
planning consent and Catesby is investing in infrastructure 
to deliver serviced land parcels for sale to housebuilders. 
A spring 2018 start is scheduled with land disposals during 
the 2017/18 financial year. 
• Consent for 790 dwellings across two sites has been delayed 
by the decision of third parties to judicially review the planning 
consents received. Both now find themselves in the Court 
of Appeal. 
 FUTURE MILESTONES
• Catesby will continue to evolve its site search and selection 
process to reflect the changing planning environment. 
As a consequence of Central Government’s focus on 
neighbourhood planning and the emphasis on Local Plans, 
the opportunity to make applications based solely around 
the lack of five-year land supply will reduce. 
• In accordance with Catesby’s strategic objectives to increase 
land activities for sites between 500 and 2,000 dwellings, a 
site for circa 2,000 dwellings in an area of identified high 
housing need has been secured with a view to bringing the 
site forward through the Local Plan process. 
• The rebrand to Catesby Estates plc better reflects the 
business model and more clearly aligns Catesby with 
Urban&Civic. It is expected this change will deliver benefits 
in 2018 and beyond.

A DIFFERENT 
APPROACH
As a Master Developer, we believe our approach to delivering 
strategic sites is different. By listening to and working with the 
people on the ground who will be affected by our developments, 
we build confidence, bring disused land into development 
faster and make sure that the impact of change is a positive 
one. We invest early so that key infrastructure and amenities 
that people want – parks, schools, bike lanes and access roads 
– are in place for the first people who arrive, not somewhere 
down the track. We also focus hard on quality because things 
that work well, feel right, look good and last a long time are the 
essential components of great places. 
We know this approach brings benefits and have good 
anecdotal evidence of that – for example through the accounts 
of some of the first families to arrive at Alconbury Weald, who 
love the blend of transport links, a new school, good quality 
housing and the prospect of being part of a new community. 
Whilst we continue to capture their and other stories in this 
report, in 2017 we decided to go further in our efforts to 
measure and identify social and environmental impact. 
We have been reporting data on health and safety and 
greenhouse gas emissions for several years and are now 
working with consultants Anthesis to develop a range of 
metrics that give a greater sense of how our approach to 
development is different, and what effect that is having.  
This includes new information on the rate at which we are 
able to develop land; the investment we make in the communities 
both around and on our sites; and the effectiveness of our 
engagement as evidenced through the fate of planning 
applications, as well as new numbers for performance on 
waste and carbon. We expect to add further metrics in the 
coming years. 
J AME S SCO T T 
DIRE C T OR OF PLANNING 
AND COMMUNIC ATIONS
UNLOCKING VALUE THROUGH DELIVERY
OUR APPROACH 
There is no question that we need more housing in the UK. It is also 
vital that new housing can be the centrepiece of a sustainable lifestyle 
for the people who live in it, meaning it is critically important that 
the other ingredients of that lifestyle – access to work, schools and 
other amenities – are in place. Equally while the drivers for commercial 
development may be a bit different, the shops, restaurants, hotels 
and offices we are delivering are the building blocks of future 
prosperity, so it is also essential they arrive in the right places, 
in the right form. 
Land is lying derelict for too long, passed over as too complex to 
develop. Proposed developments get bogged down in planning 
because they lack buy-in from communities and politicians, either 
because the design is poor, the proposed quality is low, or people 
do not believe that the promises will be delivered. As a result, 
nothing happens and the potential for new communities, 
employment and social value remains untapped.
Urban&Civic was established to disrupt the market norm, and our 
commitment to early investment, quality, great community and 
stakeholder engagement and to high environmental standards 
means we are getting on with it at an ever-increasing rate. 
Accelerating delivery
Our Rugby development, after ceasing to be an operated BT site, had 
been idle for nine years before we began commercial development. 
We fully support the Government’s ambition that land lying idle, 
which could provide homes and employment, is brought into use 
as fast as possible. The pinch-points in the development process 
often delay delivery by months and years and we knew that the 
combination of access to land and the planning system are major 
factors limiting SME housebuilders from competing effectively. 
We believe Urban&Civic’s approach and expertise as Master Developer 
not only allow us to take on more complex sites but also create 
a serviced land product which ensures a level playing field for 
housebuilders of all sizes.

of the Homes and Communities Agency.

Play area at Alconbury Weald 62 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Accelerating delivery continued
In 2017, we decided to begin measuring and reporting how long land 
that we are now developing has been idle, and what proportion of 
land we have acquired now has outline planning consent or is in 
development. These first benchmarks will enable us to review and 
target progress in coming years. 
Stakeholder engagement 
One of the keys to our accelerated development path is successful 
stakeholder engagement. Good relationships with people near our 
sites is crucial to rapid planning consent and keeping to programme 
during the building process. We invest heavily in communication 
and consultation and have sought to measure the effect of this in 
terms of planning application and consents. 
 
We also believe that building relationships based on trust with our 
partners is essential to rapid and smooth development, particularly 
where projects are brought on over many years. This is why we place 
a strong emphasis on continuing to engage and support the people 
who live and work on or near our sites as development matures.

Job creation and economic growth 
Development can make an important contribution to local and 
regional economic prosperity, both during the construction phase 
and once in use. We have been keen to understand the impact our 
schemes have in creating jobs and enabling growth in the economy. 
In 2017, we built a more quantitative picture of our impact, measuring 
employment creation at one of our major sites, Alconbury. 
Ultimately, we want to capture the impact all our schemes have 
over time, in terms of direct and indirect economic effects.
The approach we take at Alconbury Weald is emblematic of our focus 
on making places that create and reinforce economic opportunity. 
In 2017, our team continued to support a wide range of activities 
on site, from the establishment of a new community shop to the 
opening of Ermine Street Academy, the primary school on site at 
which young residents of Alconbury will start the long journey to 
employment. For young people nearing the end of their education, 
we supported “Inspire”, an event at the Enterprise Campus at which 
14–19 year olds met employers and professionals from businesses 
based on site, and learned more about the jobs and work experience 
available at Alconbury. Case studies overleaf on Alconbury projects 
EDGE and iMET give more detail on how investment in the long 
term economic future of our sites paid dividends in 2017.
July 2017 saw the opening of the 357-bedroom Hampton by Hilton 
Hotel
1
, built on a two-acre disused car park at Stansted Airport. 
Stansted Airport is now the place of work for 11,600 people and 
serves over 24 million passengers, so modern infrastructure is vital 
if the airport is to function and flourish. The hotel Urban&Civic 
developed is an important new part of that infrastructure.
Our professional team applied modern methods of construction 
and whole life costings to create a design that combined ease of 
build and maintenance, good sustainability standards, reduced 
capital expenditure and enabled tight delivery timescales. Main 
contractors McAleer and Rushe sourced building materials locally, 
used local subcontractors, and employed local people across all 
packages of work, despite there being no section 106 obligation 
relating to skills training and jobs. No construction waste went to 
landfill – with 99.9 per cent of waste either recycled or reused on 
site and 0.1 per cent was sent to energy from waste. The build has 
achieved the BREEAM Very Good rating and Hilton awarded the 
scheme the highest marks for quality ever achieved for a similar 
brand in its portfolio. Now operational the hotel has generated 
75 full-time jobs across a range of sectors and has an established 
local supply chain.

Going to EDGE was a really positive 
experience. From the moment I walked 
into the EDGE shop I was made to feel 
welcome. Christine spent time talking to 
me and discussing my past experience

STEV E K E S LER 
CASE STUDY
CREATING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AT ALCONBURY WEALD
A jobs and skills partnership, focused on Alconbury, with a team based in Huntingdon 
town centre that works with local training providers, careers advice services, local 
authorities and the Jobcentre, and connects the companies building and occupying the 
Alconbury site with local jobseekers. EDGE has been operating since 2016, running 
careers fairs for schools, and securing apprenticeships and work experience opportunities 
– for example in February this year EDGE celebrated National Apprenticeship Week 
with companies on site at Alconbury. In last year’s report we noted that 53 local people 
had already found employment through the service. In July 2017, Steve Kesler became 
EDGE’s 100th success, in a story typical of EDGE’s work. Steve was referred to EDGE 
by the local jobcentre, after a period of unemployment had left him lacking confidence 
in his future prospects. At EDGE he met adviser Christine Dade, who invested the 
face-to-face time and support Steve needed to turn his situation around. Steve soon 
found an opportunity at T&C electricals in St Neots, where he now works. Since July, 
another 30 people like Steve have used support from EDGE to rejoin the world of work. 
EDGE also helps people out of work into self-employment, one example being local 
skateboarder Jason Emery who has turned his hobby into a business offering lessons at 
Alconbury’s new skate park, with financial support from Urban&Civic. In February, we 
were delighted to see this work acknowledged by the then Secretary of State for Work 
and Pensions Damian Green when he visited EDGE in Huntingdon with prospective 
Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Mayoral Candidate James Palmer, to find out more

Efficient design, environment and sustainability  
The speed and scale that we achieve in development unlocks the 
social value in our sites, but we ensure that this does not come at 
the expense of quality and sustainability. A responsible approach 
to energy, waste, transport, water and other environmental topics 
underlies our development model and drives the way we design, 
commission and build. 
These priorities came to the fore in many ways during 2017. 
At Newark we used geotextiles and earth instead of traditional 
retaining structures to improve visual impact for residents and 
maximise the re-use of material on site. Whilst at Alconbury we 
have already laid out the cricket pitch to give it time to bed in 
for play in 2019. 
At Rugby, we have focused strongly on sustainable drainage where 
we started by carrying out an earthworks study ahead of the delivery 
of the first parcel, to ensure that all spoil would be retained on site. 
Our surface water drainage strategy introduced new discharge 
points into existing water courses. This meant directing surface 
water through ecology corridors such as wetlands and ponds, and 
better use of highway corridors to retain water, using gravel ditches 
and oversized pipes in a mixed mode of design solutions.
This approach will enable us to minimise environmental impact over 
the lifecycle of the development. Ultimately, we believe that by going 
beyond simple compliance and a single solution, our approach will 
also add value to landscaping, placemaking and the ecology.
Elsewhere, sustainability considerations came together with modern 
methods of construction at every stage of design and construction. 
In February, Redrow Homes launched its Alconbury Weald offer, 
bringing sustainable timber frame homes to the development. 
Redrow was the first major UK housebuilder to score a maximum 
rating of “three trees” from the WWF with 99.83 per cent of timber 
sustainability sourced and offering a low carbon, reliable and efficient 
replacement for concrete blocks.
On large sites delivered over many years, getting drainage right 
plays a surprisingly important role in the future environment. 
At Rugby, we are implementing a sustainable drainage strategy 
across the whole developable area. 
Transport
Travel planning is a key component of our approach to 
sustainability, making sure that people living and working on our 
sites can access what they need easily and efficiently. One example 
is our Transport Strategy at Alconbury Weald, which includes free 
bus tickets and vouchers for cycle kit for every new household, as 
part of a plan to build a culture of walking, cycling and use of public 
transport. It is an approach we developed with Cambridgeshire 
County Council, with agreed transport interventions as the 
development unfurls, incentivising us to work with the business 
and residential community to minimise car use and promote 
sustainable travel options. 
In 2017 we surveyed how residents and businesses on site are 
travelling to see what effect these measures are having at 
Alconbury, and help shape future interventions. We learned that 
nearly 70 per cent of respondents get to educational activities on 
foot; that nearly a third of households have no bicycles – and could 
benefit from our voucher scheme; and encouragingly, 35 per cent of 
people now car share to access leisure activities. The data is being 
used to plan the frequency and routes of buses, the locations of 
three cycle hire hubs being set up in the first phase of development, 
and to inform car sharing and further public transport initiatives. 
Meanwhile, Urban&Civic’s Communities Team has been holding 
events with local partners to encourage cycling and walking, by 
communicating the many benefits of active travel, from better 
health to reducing carbon emissions and less noise, pollution 
and traffic on the development.

CASE STUDY
Alconbury’s Innovation, Manufacturing, Engineering and Technology centre 
was officially topped out in November by Huntingdon MP Jonathan Djanogly 
at a ceremony joined by leaders from business, local government and iMET’s 
partners. iMET was conceived in 2013 after research funded by Urban&Civic, 
local authorities and the Local Enterprise Partnership identified the need for 
advanced skills to support growth in engineering and high value manufacturing 
in the region. Alconbury’s proximity to the global innovation hub and cutting 
edge industries of Cambridge makes it a great location to support that skills 
agenda. Now, with £10.5 million from the Greater Cambridge and Greater 
Peterborough Enterprise Partnership and support from Cambridge and 
Peterborough’s regional colleges, iMET is being built on land donated by 
Urban&Civic. Our team has also been working with the colleges’ project teams 
on design, build, branding, business engagement and curriculum development. 
When iMET opens in 2018, it will manage business engagement in skills in the 
region, and provide the kind of training that growth in lightweight technologies, 
energy storage and low carbon manufacturing all depend on. By supporting 
that growth, iMET will extend Alconbury’s contribution to sustainability way 
beyond the confines of the site.

Productivity is becoming the catchword in 
Westminster. A key part of that productivity is 
skills, and in this part of the country making 
the most out of the wonderful resources we 
have here is key. Training is a vital part of that, 
together with an increase in apprenticeships. 
iMET will enable local businesses to take that 
to a much higher level.

INVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITIES
OUR APPROACH 
The success of the communities we build is highly dependent on 
good relationships with local people. We make significant 
investment in these relationships before and during development 
and we are proud of the outcomes we achieve together. 
Last year we reported on what we had been doing at Darlington, 
Waterbeach and elsewhere. As our strategic sites mature, in 2017 
we are able to capture more significant results, with schools and 
other amenities opening and communities coming alive. 
Staff engagement 
We encourage our team to play a part in their communities at home 
and at work, as we know it brings benefits all round. 
This year, we have measured and report this investment in time 
and resource for the first time across our strategic sites. We found 
that 1,812 hours were spent on non-obligatory initiatives. 
Our largest investment has been at Rugby and Alconbury. This 
is because both Rugby and Alconbury are much further along on 
their development stages. We expect to increase investment at all 
our strategic land sites, as each development stage progresses. 
For example, our team at Rugby invested around 160 hours in 2017 
as a member of St Gabriel’s Church of England Academy board of 
directors where we have an active role in the delivery of the school 
with the Diocese of Coventry. Over in Alconbury, Rebecca Britton 
is a school governor at Ermine Street Church Academy and is a 
board member at Groundwork East, collectively spending over 
200 hours helping with key local community activities.
Community projects 
We aim to use our capabilities and investment to provide communities 
with new facilities and lasting improvements to what already exist. 
Last year we reported on our support for the Waterbeach Toddler 
Playgroup; however, this year another, perhaps more surprising, 
example is the work we have done at Waterbeach to create space 
for those resting in peace. A growing resident population and our 
long term view of community development meant we needed to 
consider what the residents of Waterbeach will need throughout 
their lives, including right at the end. In 2017 we organised an 
extension to the village cemetery, so that by the end of the year 
an acre of Barracks land will be handed over to the Parish Council 
to provide additional space for burials. We also helped with 
landscaping – including tree planting and grass seeding the new 
area, and upgraded paths within the existing cemetery to make 
them wider with wheelchair and pushchair friendly surfaces.
In 2017, we also published “The History of Rugby Radio Station” 
in partnership with Aviva, with all proceeds from book sales donated 
to Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance. From our 
early community engagement, we understood that the radio masts 
and the station’s history were really important to local people, so 
we decided that the book would be a good way to ensure that the 
heritage lived on. Sales of the book have raised around £6,000 for 
Warwickshire Air Ambulance.

S
Over at Alconbury, we invested in our Green Skills initiative to 
provide skills and employment projects for long-term unemployed 
people with access to jobs on site and in the local area. The team 
created the allotments for new residents, and 100 per cent went on 
to employment with the local A14 Delivery Group. Our “Top Secret” 
initiative, which provides ongoing support for a project engaging 
young people in historical research, creative expression, promotion 
and event management, worked with two local schools, local heritage 
groups and the neighbouring US Air Force base, reaching around 
1,000 people.
Building on the success of The Tuning Fork Café at Rugby, we also 
invested in Swynford Stores – a shop selling everyday essentials at 
Alconbury, and run by Adrian and Samantha Wardman, who run 
the community store in neighbouring Abbots Ripton. The store 
opened in July and will evolve with the community to provide the 
right goods at the most useful opening hours, and additional 
services such as a satellite post office. 
In September, a year on from the first arrivals on site, Community 
Development Worker Steph Burton hosted Alconbury Weald’s first 
residents forum. After a breakfast stroll along the new cycleway 
and an update on site development, residents discussed future 
community facilities and social events, and fed back on existing 
services. There was great enthusiasm for new landscaping and play 
areas, and a strong sense of pride and community in maintaining 
the quality of development delivered. Plans for the future include 
an Allotment Association and regular forums that could pave the 
way for a new Parish Council.
In all we invested time, energy and resources in 44 community 
activities, reaching over 100,000 people during the year. We aim 
to maintain and where relevant increase this kind of investment 
in the future.
Charitable donations
The Urban&Civic team is encouraged to contribute its time to 
charitable activities. In 2017 we saw more volunteering than ever 
and, as in previous years, cyclists led the charge. Colleagues on 
bikes raised money for a range of charities. David Wood and 
Oluwole Ogunleye completed The London to Brighton Challenge 
(on a tandem) for the British Heart foundation. Joining them was 
Frances Chan, who rode solo. 
Others ran to raise money. Phil Partridge completed the Berlin 
Marathon in September and raised around £1,000 for Prostate 
Cancer UK. A Catesby team of David Morris, Myron Osborne, 
Ed Barrett and Phil Partridge joined over 200 professionals from 
across the property and construction industry at the inaugural 
LandAid Midlands 10K in Longbridge, Birmingham, in September. 
LandAid seeks to end youth homelessness and the money raised 
will help support local charity St Basils to convert an empty 
property into a home for 18 young people at risk of homelessness. 
Not everyone felt the need to get out of breath to help. Richard Hepworth 
remains a fund raiser and Trustee of St Teresa’s Hospice in Darlington 
and was Chair of their Development Committee this year. Under his 
watch, the hospice recently completed a new ten bedroom in-patient 
unit. Heather Williams volunteered as a minute secretary to LandAid, 
covering the Board and Finance and Audit Committee. We support 
all our colleagues’ charitable endeavours and we are immensely 
proud of their achievements.

A COMMUNITY  
TAKING SHAPE
We have created a site-wide Visitor Centre and marketing suite 
promotes the long-term vision and objectives for Houlton, and with 
HCA support we are accelerating construction of the link road, 
improving residents’ access to the town centre and train station.
The Tuning Fork eatery, which was in development when we last 
reported, opened in 2017 and has been a great success with the 
100 or so visitors who come to site each day. The family-run 
eatery sources locally wherever possible, helping support local 
jobs and suppliers. It is also a flexible space and is already hosting 
a range of events for charities and businesses. The neighbouring 
barn provides additional space for fitness, parent and toddler 
activities and other community events.
Impressed by the quality of the show home, the good transport 
links, the local academy and the prospect of being a part of a new 
community, the first family who will make Houlton their home, 
Ewan, Jenna and Rose Davidson, purchased a four-bedroom 
home on the open day. We look forward to welcoming the 
Davidsons to their new home soon.
CASE STUDY
We are transforming the former radio station site in Rugby 
into a vibrant community, with the first residents soon to 
join us at Houlton. Davidsons, Morris and Crest Nicholson 
are all building houses that meet our design codes yet vary 
in terms of style, size and price, and all our housebuilders 
offer Help to Buy schemes.

PUTTING SCHOOLS FRONT AND CENTRE
St Gabriel’s Church of England Academy at Houlton will be the first 
primary school on the site. It will open in September 2018 with its 
dedicated reception class and a mixed age provision for years one 
and two. The academy trust is a partnership between the Coventry 
Diocesan Board of Education and Urban&Civic. 
Three-year-olds Aryian and Reevan Gill along with their parents, Tina  
and AJ, will be amongst the first families to be moving to the new 
community of Houlton, and are also among the first of several families 
to apply for a place in the first primary intake in September 2018.
The family took the morning to look around the school, and met 
Andrew Taylor, the Head Teacher, who showcased the facilities, 
ethos and curriculum. The family were immediately impressed. Tina 
said: “As soon as we entered St Gabriel’s we really got a feel and 
vision for the school and its modern teaching style. Its outstanding 
facilities, with plenty of open space both inside and out, together with 
Mr Taylor’s teaching ethos, are the ideal fit for our boys. The school’s 
opening and our move to Houlton could not come at a better time, as 
the boys start their educational journey.”
The delivery of the school also enabled us to leverage opportunities 
for jobs and skills. As part of the delivery our main contractor, 
Stepnell, together with Warwickshire College Group have partnered 
to offer eight local students studying construction related courses 
work experience opportunities in the industry. Working with 
Urban&Civic, van Heyningen and Haward Architects, and Rugby 
College placement co-ordinator Leanne Booth, Stepnell has offered 
students on-site work experience, which gave students contact with 
on-site professionals including architects, bricklayers, electricians, 
project managers, plumbers, site managers, carpenters and site 
joiners. Students involved have also been offered health and safety 
training, improving their employability in the construction sector.
Elliot Bates is one apprentice benefiting from the scheme, working  
on site at the school. Karen Ryan of Stepnell explained: “We had 
a position available for an apprentice joiner in Rugby and after 
interviewing carpentry diploma students at Warwickshire College we 
invited three for work experience in our joinery shop. One person was 
ideally suited to the joinery shop while the other two were suited to 
site carpentry, and out of those two Elliott Bates stood out to us for 
an apprenticeship in site carpentry. We’ve been very encouraged by 
his progress – including winning the new entrant category of the CITB 
Skillbuild competition.”
With the school in place, The Tuning Fork, 
The Barn and the Visitor Centre, Houlton 
already has a community feel and is just the 
right place for young families such as ours.

OUR OPERATIONS
OUR APPROACH 
We keep our Company lean, so the impact we have directly as an 
organisation – through our offices, travel, and the way we protect 
the health and safety of our employees – is small compared to the 
effect of our developments. It remains vital, however, that we manage 
and minimise negative impacts where we have the most control.

Energy and greenhouse gases
We measure and report our greenhouse gas emissions, providing a 
good proxy for our overall environmental impact. Our greenhouse 
gas emissions statement includes all emission sources required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013 for the financial year ended 30 September 2017 
and includes comparison on a like-for-like basis. The following 
methodologies have been used to calculate the emissions detailed:
• the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (revised edition);
• the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(DEFRA) Environmental Reporting Guideline (2013); and
• the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(DEFRA) Carbon Conversion Factors 2017.
The emissions reported are those for operationally controlled 
facilities of Urban&Civic. Therefore, carbon emissions produced 
from assets that are not owned by Urban&Civic and where they are 
acting under a development management agreement for the assets’ 
development are deemed the responsibility of its client and have 
been excluded from this report. The assets will be included when 
the land is drawn down under that agreement in future periods.
No emissions data has been included in the emissions table 
where Urban&Civic has an interest in property or operations, 
but does not have operational control. Consequently, tenant 
consumption and certain joint ventures have been omitted from 
the presented analysis. The sites that were considered to be 
controlled operationally by Urban&Civic included all offices 
occupied by the Group, as well as Alconbury Weald and the 
Renaissance hotel at Deansgate, Manchester. The hotel at 
Deansgate and Alconbury Weald were the highest producers 
of CO
2
e emissions, accounting for 42.2 per cent and 31.1 per cent 
of Urban&Civic’s overall carbon emissions respectively.
The intensity ratio has risen by 75.0 per cent in 2017. The 2017 
reported emissions data of the Urban&Civic Group is for the 
12 months ended 30 September 2017. 
Travel
The Urban&Civic team regularly travels around the country to view 
sites, attend stakeholder events and meet landowners, contractors, 
tenants and local communities, and we are determined to keep the 
impact of travel to a minimum. We are headquartered in London, 
but we maintain a network of regional and site offices so that our 
people are efficiently distributed around the country and have the 
local knowledge and real connections that underlie our approach. 
Business travel is fully documented and subject to authorisation to 
ensure journeys are undertaken by the optimum mode. 
Travel by rail predominates longer journeys. We promote cycle use 
and have bicycles on site at Waterbeach and Alconbury for site tours. 
All employees are eligible to join the Group’s cycle to work scheme 
and currently around 10 per cent of staff commute by bicycle.
Health and safety 
It is essential that we look after the people who are building, working 
and living on our sites, so health and safety is a top priority for 
Urban&Civic, from the Board down. We review our policies regularly 
and work with contractors, tenants and other stakeholders to ensure 
our approach is effective and up to date. We continue, for example, 
our Health and Safety Forum for contractors at Alconbury Weald. 
In 2017 we moved the frequency of these events from quarterly 
to weekly and fortnightly. We have found that this new format 
with more frequent meetings has meant that issues and challenges 
were addressed more speedily. The frequency of the meetings also 
means that contractor engagement is always of the highest priority, 
and it keeps health and safety issues at the forefront of our 
contractors’ thinking.
At each meeting, we have a set agenda, which makes addressing 
health and safety issues more efficient and relevant. We cover issues 
such as health and safety matters, updates on incidents, issues and 
concerns, and other matters, such as site facilities and logistics.
The Group’s operations strictly adhere to all relevant statutory 
provisions and risk assessments are undertaken to augment 
written policies and to ensure the Group’s development activities 
and operations are undertaken safely. 
Urban&Civic’s performance in the year has been: 
• Reportable incidents: One
• Fatalities: Nil 
• Prosecutions, fines and notices: Nil 
• Incidents requiring first aid: Three

EMPLOYEES
OUR APPROACH 
Like any company, great employees hold the key to everything 
we do. Benchmarked salaries, goal-focused bonuses and incentive 
schemes, regular appraisals, training and professional development 
and internal promotion are all vital components of the way we 
attract and retain the best employees. 
Retention and training 
We are proud of our high rates of employee retention. In 2017 we filled 
posts at Urban&Civic and Catesby with new colleagues, including 
Katie Yates, Lucy Smith, Olivia Brown, Jack Williams, Kerry Milburn, 
Kirill Simdyashkin, Stephanie Burton, Galina Bardarska, Michael van 
den Berg, James Findlay, Carlo D’Emidio and Peter Briggs. 
Urban&Civic’s staff conference was held in Rugby this year. 
As well as an opportunity to update on the year’s progress, we used 
the conference to bring together our teams to collaborate on topics 
ranging from our USPs to internal communications. We are taking 
forward many of their suggestions into our business practices. 
We also organised a site tour for all employees, providing a fantastic 
opportunity for everyone, and particularly those from our central 
offices, to see how Rugby has moved on since last year. After the 
main conference and the site tour, we headed over to Birmingham 
for a team bonding meal to finish off the day’s activities. 
As in previous years, we continue to invest in training. The Board 
reviews Group policies and procedures as required, and we regularly 
update policies as a result. The Company Secretary ensures that 
updated policies are circulated to all staff and regularly refreshes 
the staff handbook to ensure it reflects best practice and the latest 
regulations. All permanent employees are eligible to join the Group’s 
benefits schemes, including life assurance, permanent health 
insurance, medical insurance and the Group pension scheme. 
We have a very open and inclusive working environment, which 
promotes personal development at all levels, and our staff are 
encouraged to attend seminars and training courses relevant to 
their role throughout the year. We hold a staff seminar twice a 
year, providing employees with an operational update and an 
overview of half and full year results, which keeps them engaged 
and included in how the Company is run. 
 
Human rights 
Urban&Civic plc has a zero tolerance approach to slavery and is 
committed to ensuring there are no acts of slavery within any part 
of its business or its supply chains. We expect high standards of our 
employees and the staff handbook includes information on health 
and safety, diversity, bullying and harassment, anti-bribery and 
whistleblowing policies. Employees are expected to report any 
concerns related to Group activities and/or supply chains of the 
business. We have also adopted an Anti-slavery and Human 
Trafficking Code of Conduct which sets out the conduct expected 
of everyone in the Group and the steps to be taken to ensure that 
slavery and human trafficking are not taking place within the 
business or its supply chains. The Code of Conduct has been 
approved by the Board and will be reviewed annually. 
As required under the Modern Slavery Act 2015, Urban&Civic prepared 
a formal policy dealing with slavery and human trafficking, which 
was published on the Company’s website in 2017. 
Diversity 
Through its diversity policy, the Board and senior management 
undertake to encourage the recruitment, development and 
retention of a diverse workforce and to eliminate discrimination.
We have adopted a diversity policy that is reviewed annually and 
it can be found on our website. Appointments are made on merit, 
skills and experience but with due regard to the benefits of diversity. 
You can read more about our approach to diversity in the report 
of the Nomination Committee on page 95.
The strategic report contained on pages 4 to 71 was approved by the Board on 27 November 2017.

Directors present. The Chairman also holds regular meetings with the Non-Executive Directors. The Board meets informally on a regular 
basis to facilitate discussions on the Group’s business and the wider environment outside the more formal structure of a Board meeting.

During the year the Board has sought to further strengthen the working relationship with the executive management team and to increase 
the effectiveness of all delegated authorities. In order to optimise the running of the business as a whole, a new Executive Management 
Committee (EMC) has been put in place to oversee the implementation of Board strategy and policies and to provide feedback from a 
wider executive team of views and comments on such matters to the Board. The EMC may also make recommendations on Group strategy 
and policies to the Board. 
The EMC will meet six times a year with meetings scheduled to be co-ordinated ahead of Board meetings, thus providing relevant and 
current comment to the Board on any matters of significance. The EMC will be fully accountable to the Board and minutes of the meetings 
will be made available to the Board. Where matters of specific interest or relevance to a particular Non-Executive Director arise, that 
Non-Executive Director can attend the EMC meeting. 
Three other committees will report into the EMC, one of which is existing and two of which are newly formed. The existing is the board 
of Catesby Estates, which meets on a quarterly basis and whose board papers will be made available to the EMC. The second two newly 
formed committees have been put in place to co-ordinate and standardise the delivery process across the commercial and strategic land 
portfolios. The Commercial Development Committee (CDC) will supervise the delivery of the commercial portfolio and the Strategic 
Development Committee (SDC) will carry out the same task for the strategic sites. Both committees will be responsible for preparing the 
annual business plan for each project and for monitoring its delivery. These two committees will meet on a quarterly basis and the minutes 
of the meetings will be made available to, and reviewed by, the EMC. 
The committee structure, which is summarised on page 82, is in its early stages and a more detailed report on its activities will be provided 
in next year’s corporate governance report.

The Board is ultimately responsible to shareholders for strategy, for the achievement of long-term sustainable success of the Company 
and for the good governance, objective risk assessment and effective leadership required to deliver the Group’s objectives. The Board has 
adopted a formal schedule of matters reserved for its decision and agreed that, although a division in responsibilities between the Board 
and the management committees is important, it is vital to ensure that the Board retains control of key decisions. The Board has delegated 
specific areas of responsibility to the Nomination, Audit and Remuneration committees, which each have the authority to make decisions 
in accordance with their terms of reference. Each committee reviews its own terms of reference on an annual basis and any amendments 
to a committee’s terms of reference are subject to Board approval.
 Terms of reference can be found on www.urbanandcivic.com/corporate-governance
Items on the schedule of matters reserved for the Board include:
• strategy;
• approval of significant acquisitions and disposals;
• internal controls and risk management;
• approval of operating and capital expenditure budgets;
• review of financial performance against a five-year plan;
• approval of interim and annual financial statements;
• dividend policy;
• corporate governance; and
• approval of Group policies.
The Company Secretary, in consultation with the Chairman, ensures that the annual timetable of Board agenda items and the papers 
discussed at each meeting provide sufficient information and discussion throughout the year on the items included in the schedule of 
matters adopted by the Board. A rolling timetable of agenda items also ensures compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’) and with any other regulatory requirements.
Board focus in the year ahead:
Leadership – Implementation of Group strategy.
Effectiveness – Ongoing succession planning and Board refreshment.
Accountability – Continued focus on risk management and internal audit review.
Remuneration – Implementation of the new remuneration policy.
Relations with shareholders – Continued programme of communication with shareholders. 85 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  
G
Effectiveness
The Code requires that the Board, its committees and individual Directors should have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Group to enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively. The Board 
is of the view that the current Board and committee structure works efficiently and is in the best interests of shareholders and the 
Group as a whole. It believes it has an appropriate balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, taking into account the nature 
and size of the business. An externally facilitated evaluation of the Board and committees was undertaken by Independent Audit at the 
beginning of 2017. The review incorporated one-to-one interviews with all Directors and the Company Secretary and a comprehensive 
report was presented to the Board by Independent Audit. The report summarised the evaluation of performance and effectiveness and 
included recommendations for strengthening the Board further. Action points are now in progress but the overall conclusion was that 
the Board benefits from strong leadership by the Chairman, a group of Non-Executive Directors who bring useful and relevant knowledge 
and experience, and good support from, and communication with, management. A more detailed description of the evaluation process 
is included in the Nomination Committee report on page 96.
Board and committee attendance
The Board holds six scheduled meetings each year. In addition, 
a number of unscheduled Board and committee meetings are held 
to discuss ad hoc issues, urgent transactional matters or matters 
of a routine/administrative nature. Ad hoc meetings do not 
necessarily require full Board attendance but all Directors are 
given the opportunity to attend and/or comment on the proposals. 
The attendance record of the Directors at the scheduled Board 
meetings is shown in the adjacent table. Attendance at committee 
meetings is shown in the reports of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration committees. Non-committee members of the Board 
attend committee meetings by invitation. All Directors in office at 
the time attended Board strategy meetings held in February and 
July 2017. Where Directors are unable to attend meetings, their 
comments are provided to the Board or committee chairman prior 
to the meeting and their views are reflected in discussions.

Appointments to the Board
During the year the Nomination Committee led a review of Board composition and succession plans, making recommendations to the 
Board that resulted in the appointment of June Barnes as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, succeeding Robert Dyson, and the 
appointment of Jon Di-Stefano as a Non-Executive Director and member of the Audit Committee. Further details are included in the 
Nomination Committee report on pages 90 to 97. The report includes details of the recruitment process, selection procedure and 
induction programme followed for the appointment of Jon Di-Stefano.
Appointments to the Board are made on merit against objective criteria with due regard to the balance of skills, experience, knowledge, 
diversity and independence of the Board to enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively. Current Non-Executive 
Directors have been appointed to ensure an appropriate balance of skills on the Board, taking into account a range of backgrounds and 
experience. The Nomination Committee leads the recruitment process for new Directors and makes recommendations to the Board.  86 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Time commitment 
Executive Directors are required to devote substantially all of their working time to their role as a member of the Board, although certain 
outside directorships are permitted. The expected time commitment of Non-Executive Directors is specified in their letters of appointment 
and the current Non-Executive Directors have confirmed that they have sufficient time to meet what is expected of them. Any other 
significant commitments of Non-Executive Directors are disclosed to the Board before their appointment, and any changes to these 
commitments will be notified to the Chairman. Directors are expected to attend all scheduled Board meetings and are also expected 
to attend all meetings of the committees of which they are a member, the annual strategy meetings and the Annual General Meeting. 
Professional development
Each Director is provided with a tailored induction on joining the Board including a comprehensive pack of information on the Group and 
its activities, guidance on specific areas of the Group’s business, one-to-one meetings with fellow Directors, senior management and key 
advisers, a briefing by the Company Secretary on procedures and the legal and regulatory framework in which the Board operates, and 
visits to our key sites. Such an induction process took place for the appointment of Jon Di-Stefano, as described in the Nomination Committee 
report on page 94. An induction was provided to June Barnes on her appointment as Chair of the Remuneration Committee with briefings 
on the Group’s remuneration policy, the operation of the Performance Share Plan and governance requirements. This took place by means 
of meetings with the Finance Director, the Company Secretary and the Group’s remuneration advisers, Aon Hewitt. A tailored session on 
the requirements and responsibilities of the role of chair of remuneration committees was provided by a third party consultant.
Directors are expected to develop their understanding of the Group’s operations and to regularly update their skills and knowledge. 
They are offered training and guidance to enable them to fulfil their duties effectively and are encouraged to attend relevant seminars and 
conferences, at the Company’s expense. During the year, specific training has been provided through presentations at Board meetings by 
senior management and external advisers. Personalised one-to-one training sessions have also been provided to Non-Executive Directors 
throughout the year. The Company Secretary regularly provides briefings on corporate governance and regulatory updates by the provision 
of Board papers and presentations at Board meetings, or between meetings as required. The Finance Director also provides individual 
training sessions with Non-Executive Directors covering areas such as financial reporting, management reporting, the valuation process 
and risk management. A programme of attendance by senior management at Board meetings has been introduced which has assisted the 
Directors in their understanding of the Group’s business and operations. Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to visit our sites, 
which allows them to spend valuable time with project management and staff. The Non-Executive Directors visit the key sites at least 
annually, enabling them to see and monitor the progress first hand. Open communication between the Non-Executive Directors and 
management between Board meetings is encouraged. 87 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  
G
Information and support available to Directors 
Directors have access to the advice and services of a professionally qualified and experienced Company Secretary. The Chairman, 
supported by the Company Secretary, ensures that Directors receive sufficiently detailed information on all relevant matters for discussion 
on a timely basis. The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring appropriate information is made available to the Board and its committees 
and for planning the agendas for the annual cycle of Board and committee meetings. Prior to all Board and committee meetings Directors 
receive agendas and supporting papers, in a form and of a quality to enable them to discharge their duties effectively, with sufficient time 
allowed for appropriate review. The Board papers, which facilitate discussion at the meetings, contain market, property, financial, governance 
and risk updates together with any other papers relating to specific agenda items as required. Presentations and verbal updates are also 
given at each Board meeting. In between scheduled Board meetings, ad hoc and transactional papers are circulated to Directors electronically 
to allow appropriate review and consideration. Objective and constructive challenge by the Non-Executive Directors is welcomed and all 
Directors are able to make further enquiries or requests for information if required. The Company Secretary facilitates professional 
development and ensures compliance with Board, regulatory and corporate governance procedures.
Minutes of Board and committee meetings, including ad hoc meetings, are circulated to all Directors shortly after each meeting. The minutes 
of each meeting are also included in the following Board pack, providing the opportunity for review and to ensure that they accurately 
reflect the discussions held and the decisions taken, prior to signature by the chairman of that meeting. The chairman of each committee 
also provides a verbal update to the Board on matters discussed at every committee meeting. A detailed action list is circulated immediately 
following each Board meeting and the Company Secretary co-ordinates the agendas and Board papers for the following meeting to ensure 
that management have dealt with all outstanding action points.
Directors are able to seek any further information or to take independent professional advice that they may require in the performance 
of their duties, at the expense of the Company. No Director sought any such advice during the year apart from June Barnes, who was 
provided with guidance from a third party on her appointment as Chair of the Remuneration Committee.
Annual re-election of Directors
Notwithstanding that the Company is not in the FTSE 350, the Board has adopted the policy that all Directors will be subject to annual 
election by shareholders in compliance with Code Provision B.7.1. Biographies of all Directors are on pages 76 to 78 and separate resolutions 
relating to their election or re-election are contained in the notice of meeting for the 2018 AGM, as circulated with this Annual Report. 
Robert Dyson has announced that he will not be seeking re-election at the 2018 AGM. The Board is satisfied that each of the Directors 
standing for election or re-election continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment to the role, and that their continued 
appointment is in the best interest of the Company. With the exception of Mark Tagliaferri, the Board confirms the independence of each 
Non-Executive Director seeking election or re-election.
Board
The Company’s lawyers attended a Board meeting and 
provided a training session for Directors covering listed 
company requirements, corporate governance, cyber 
security, GDPR, corporate reporting and general HR issues.
Remuneration Committee
The Company’s remuneration advisers presented a 
workshop to the Remuneration Committee to discuss the 
Company’s current remuneration policy together with 
proposals for the new policy. Their briefing included an 
update on the regulatory and governance environment, 
including key developments in executive remuneration, 
a report on the implications of recent AGM activity and 
a benchmarking of Executive Directors’ remuneration.
Audit Committee
The Company’s auditor attended an Audit Committee 
meeting to provide an update on corporate reporting 
requirements, including new standards in financial reporting. 
They also briefed the Committee on cyber security issues 
including understanding the nature of potential attacks, 
minimising the likely impact and how to respond.

Accountability
Audit Committee 
Ian Barlow (Chairman of the Audit Committee), Duncan Hunter and Jon Di-Stefano (members of the Audit Committee) are all considered 
to have recent and relevant financial experience and the Board considers that the Audit Committee as a whole has competence relevant 
to the sector in which the Company operates. Further details are in the report of the Audit Committee on pages 98 to 103 and biographical 
details of all Directors are set out on pages 76 to 78.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee were reviewed during the year and are available on the Group’s website.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s risk management and internal controls and, at each Board meeting, carries out a 
robust review of the Group’s risks. The Board held a risk management workshop during the year, at which the Board discussed the Group’s 
risk appetite and the Executive Management Committee structure and its role in risk identification, mitigation and reporting.
The Board has previously agreed that, due to the size and structure of the Group, it does not recommend the appointment of a separate 
risk committee. The Board has delegated responsibility to the Audit Committee to ensure that the framework and processes by which 
risks are identified and mitigated are effective and that residual risks after mitigation are within the Group’s risk appetite. Further details 
of how this is achieved are contained in the risk review on pages 33 to 37.
Notwithstanding the importance and value of the involvement of executive management in the internal controls and risk management of 
the Group, the Board has appointed Grant Thornton to fulfil the internal audit function. Details of the scope of their work and the role and 
input of the Audit Committee in risk management are described in the report of the Audit Committee on pages 98 to 103.
Remuneration
This information is contained in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 104 to 120.
Relations with shareholders
Communication with shareholders
Communication with existing and potential shareholders is given a high priority and the Group undertakes regular dialogue with its 
shareholders. The Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director are the Group’s principal representatives and hold meetings 
with investors, analysts and other interested parties throughout the year to communicate the Company’s strategy and performance. 
Duncan Hunter, as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, is available to meet with shareholders at their request to discuss any 
issues or concerns they have or, if other communication channels fail, to resolve queries raised. He is willing to hold meetings with 
shareholders whenever requested. No such requests were received from shareholders during the year. The Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee wrote to major shareholders in October 2017 outlining proposed changes to the remuneration policy, in advance of the binding 
vote at the 2018 AGM. More details of this process are found in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 107. 
An overview of major shareholders and feedback from meetings with investors and analysts is reviewed at each Board meeting, enabling 
Directors to develop an up-to-date understanding of the views of the Company’s major investors. Meetings with shareholders are 
timetabled around the financial reporting calendar although shareholder engagement and communication also occur outside the key 
financial reporting dates, including presentations, one-to-one meetings, conferences and site visits. 89 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  
G
The Group’s website is an important source of information for shareholders, enabling them to keep up to date with the Company’s activities. 
Presentations made to analysts are made available on the website as soon as practicable after they have been made. Regulatory announcements 
made by the Company are maintained on the website which also contains all other material information including Annual Reports and 
share price information. A live webcast of the presentation of the Group’s half and full year results is broadcast, enabling shareholders 
to raise questions directly with the Chairman and Executive Directors.
Key investor activities:
• Presentation of the annual results for the year ended 30 September 2016 and the interim results for the six months ended  
31 March 2017.
• Programme of meetings between the Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director and the Group’s largest shareholders and 
analysts.
• Presentations to potential investors.
• Annual General Meeting held in February 2017.
• Property tours for investors and analysts.
• Consultation with major shareholders on the proposed changes to the remuneration policy. 
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders are encouraged to participate in the Company’s annual general meetings, which are attended by the Directors, who are 
available to answer any questions. In compliance with the Code, the Company will give shareholders at least 20 working days’ notice of an 
annual general meeting. Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the 2018 AGM can be found in the notice of meeting circulated with 
this Annual Report. The 2018 AGM will be held on 8 February 2018 at 10.00 a.m. at The Savile Club, 69 Brook Street, London W1K 4ER. 
Details of the number of proxy votes for, against and withheld on each resolution will be disclosed at the meeting and will be posted on the 
website after the meeting.
The Company’s annual general meetings provide an opportunity for shareholders to raise any questions or points of concern with Directors 
and to vote on the resolutions proposed. All Directors will attend the 2018 AGM and welcome the opportunity to meet shareholders.
Annual Report and Accounts
The Board has considered the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 September 2017 and, taking account of the 
recommendations of the Audit Committee, is satisfied that taken as a whole it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.

Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the report of the Nomination Committee for the year ended 
30 September 2017. During the year the Committee continued its review of succession 
planning and Board composition, recommending to the Board the appointment of 
Jon Di-Stefano as an independent Non-Executive Director and the appointment 
of June Barnes as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, succeeding Robert Dyson. 
The Board also undertook its first externally facilitated evaluation process, which is 
described later in this report. The Committee met on four occasions during the year, 
with three scheduled meetings and one unscheduled meeting. A summary of the main 
activities of the Committee during the year, including the appointment and induction 
process for Jon Di-Stefano, is found in this report.

Role and responsibilities of the Nomination Committee
The key responsibilities of the Nomination Committee are:
• to give adequate consideration to the succession planning and leadership needs of the Group;
• to lead the process for new appointments to the Board;
• to review regularly the size, structure and composition of the Board and its committees;
• to review the Board evaluation process; and
• to review the diversity policy of the Group.
The agendas and papers of the Committee meetings are established to ensure that the Nomination Committee fulfils its responsibilities 
in accordance with its terms of reference, which can be found on the Company’s website at www.urbanandcivic.com. The Company 
Secretary sets the agendas for all meetings, which are discussed with the Chairman in advance. The annual timetable of agenda items 
ensures that the Committee fulfils its function under the terms of reference and meets all obligations required under corporate 
governance and other relevant regulations.
Main activities
The main activities of the Committee during the year were as follows:
• The Committee has devoted much time to the issue of Board succession and continues to progress plans of a phased rotation 
and refreshing of Directors.
• Review of the role potential and succession plans for senior management on a short, medium and long-term basis, including 
the retention, motivation and development of senior executives and the level below them.
• Recommendation to the Board for the appointment of a new Non-Executive Director and a new Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, as discussed later in this report. 
• The Chairman oversaw the Board evaluation process and led discussions at Board meetings of the action points arising 
from the evaluation.
• Recommendation to the Executive Directors that an operational board committee be established. As a result, a structure 
of executive committees has been set up. Further details are contained in the Corporate Governance report on pages 81 and 82.
• The Committee addressed gender diversity in the Group and satisfied itself that recruitment practices were in line with 
the Group’s diversity policy.
• Recommendation to the Board that each of the Directors be proposed for election or re-election at the 2017 AGM, 
following consideration of their performance.
• Approval of the Nomination Committee report for inclusion in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
• Annual review of terms of reference.
Composition of the Board
In 2016, the Nomination Committee commenced a review of the composition of the Board. In light of the Company’s non-compliance 
with the Code requirements at that time, it made recommendations to the Board that were subsequently adopted and reported on in last 
year’s Annual Report and Accounts. The year ended 30 September 2017 represents the first full year under the structure of a separate 
Chairman and Chief Executive and I am pleased to report that the reorganisation has proved to be successful and beneficial to the Board. 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief Executive has been established in writing and approved by the Board. 
Further details are contained in the Corporate Governance report on page 80.  93 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  
G
During the year, Jon Di-Stefano was appointed as an independent Non-Executive Director and a member of the Audit Committee. 
Jon brings with him a wealth of financial and housing sector experience. As a serving executive on another board, we will learn and 
benefit from Jon’s insight into board practice and governance procedures.
The process by which the Nomination Committee considered the candidates for the appointment is explained in this report. 
Other changes to the Board were the appointment of June Barnes as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, succeeding Robert Dyson, 
who has announced his intention to step down from the Board following the 2018 AGM. Robert will continue to be a member of the 
Remuneration Committee until the AGM and we are thankful for his valuable support and advice. 
Following the changes over the last two years, the Board now consists of a Non-Executive Chairman, three Executive Directors and six 
Non-Executive Directors. The membership of the Board and committees is well balanced in terms of skills, effectiveness, experience 
and independence. I was considered to be independent on my appointment as Chairman and, of the six other Non-Executive Directors, 
five are considered to be independent.
Succession planning 
The Nomination Committee regularly discusses issues relating to succession plans for Directors and senior management and the 
input of the Chief Executive and Managing Director in this process is valued. In reviewing succession planning for both Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors, the Committee considers the leadership needs of the Company and the balance of skills and experience of 
the Board, taking into account the balance between continuity and refreshment. During the year, the Committee undertook a review of 
the Group’s senior management structure assessing the progression of senior executives to ensure that a suitable succession planning 
process is in place for the management layer below Board level. The Group’s policy is to actively encourage executive management in their 
development and in the broadening of their experience and to seek to maintain their loyalty, which is demonstrated by the low staff 
turnover at management level. The Committee will continue to regularly review succession planning for the Board and senior 
management. 
As part of ongoing succession planning discussions, the Committee gives due consideration to corporate governance guidelines 
on the length of service of Non-Executive Directors and has taken into account the fact that the appointment date of five of the seven 
Non-Executive Directors is deemed to be 22 May 2014, being the date of admission of the Company to the standard listing segment of the 
Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange. Non-Executive Directors are appointed to the Board for an initial term and will 
typically serve a second three-year term. A third term of up to three years may be served but this would be subject to a thorough review 
of the individual and of the Board as a whole, and of the need for the refreshment of the Board. A phased refreshment of the Board has 
commenced and the chart below demonstrates the length of service of the Non-Executive Directors.
Note: Robert Dyson has been excluded from this table as he will not be seeking re-election at the 2018 AGM.

with the UK Corporate Governance Code and terms of 
reference of the Board committees. She also briefed Jon on 
Board procedures, such as the annual timetables of Board and 
committee agenda items, and Board papers. Jon is in the 
process of carrying out visits to our key strategic sites, 
accompanied on each visit by a member of our senior

management structure.

Appointment process
Appointments to the Board are made on merit against objective criteria and with due regard to the benefits of diversity on the Board. 
The Nomination Committee leads the process for recognising the need for Board appointments, for the identification of candidates and 
for the recommendation to the Board for their subsequent appointment. The Board supports recommendations and guidance to promote 
greater female Board representation and gives this full consideration when proposing new appointments to the Board. The Board believes 
that the overriding policy for selection should be based on the best person for the role based on skills, knowledge, experience and ability 
to promote the success of the Company. When considering the appointment of Non-Executive Directors, the Committee also takes into 
account independence and the provision of an effective and constructive relationship with the Executive Directors. The Nomination 
Committee has previously decided that it would not impose a quota relating to gender balance at Board level, but gives full consideration 
to achieving a diverse working environment when considering the appointment of any new Directors. 
When considering the appointment of Ian Barlow in 2016, the Nomination Committee appointed an executive search consultant, 
The Zygos Partnership (‘Zygos’). At that time, Zygos identified a number of suitable candidates, both men and women, with a range 
of backgrounds and experience, and shortlisted five for consideration by the Nomination Committee. When considering the appointment 
of a new Non-Executive Director this year, we considered several candidates, including some who had been shortlisted last year. We considered 
each of the shortlisted candidates’ skills, experience, background and personality “fit” with both the Board and the culture of the 
Urban&Civic Group. Following this review, Jon Di-Stefano was invited to meet the Directors and, as a result, the Nomination Committee 
recommended to the Board that Jon be appointed as a Non-Executive Director and member of the Audit Committee. We were delighted 
that Jon was available to accept the role and welcome him to the Board. As a serving executive director of Telford Homes Plc, we will 
benefit from the insight gained from his experience as a director of another listed company.
Zygos has adopted an industry standard voluntary code of conduct addressing gender and ethnic diversity. Zygos has no other 
connections to the Company. 
On Jon’s appointment, a formal letter of appointment was issued containing details of the terms of his appointment, including the time 
commitment of the role. All new Directors are also asked to declare any interests which may constitute a conflict or a potential conflict 
of interest. Details of these are included on the Company’s register of conflicts, which is maintained by the Company Secretary. 
New Directors receive a tailored induction facilitated by the Company Secretary. Following his appointment, a comprehensive induction 
was organised for Jon Di-Stefano.
Diversity 
The Company is committed to a culture that promotes diversity, including gender diversity, and to achieving a working environment 
which provides equality of opportunity. The Board and senior management seek to encourage the recruitment, development and 
retention of a diverse workforce and to eliminate discrimination. Employees are expected to act in accordance with the Group’s diversity 
policy. The Committee has reviewed the Group’s recruitment practices and is satisfied that the screening, interview and selection process 
is broad ranging and in compliance with the Group’s diversity policy. It is acknowledged that the property industry faces a challenge when 
recruiting as it is often the case that female candidates do not apply for roles in the industry. As a Group, we seek to recruit, encourage 
and develop both males and females but recruitment will always be driven by the availability of suitable candidates. The Committee will 
continue to monitor diversity within the Group. 
Gender diversity of the Board, senior management and the Group as at 30 September 2017 is shown below:
 
 
As part of our ongoing commitment to diversity within the Group, we intend to undertake a staff engagement survey which will 
incorporate a questionnaire seeking staff views on a variety of areas including Group culture, management, career progression, 
remuneration and diversity within the Group, and how employees view management’s approach and attitudes to diversity.

Board evaluation
During the year under review, Independent Audit were engaged to carry out an externally facilitated evaluation of Board and committee 
effectiveness. They reviewed Board agendas and papers, processes and procedures and held confidential, in depth interviews with all 
Directors and the Company Secretary. They provided a detailed report on their findings which they presented to the Board and led a 
discussion about the recommendations. A list of action points was drawn up by the Company Secretary and the progress made is reviewed 
as a standing item on all Board agendas.
One area meriting discussion and action was the improvement of Board reporting. The Non-Executive Directors recognise that the information 
provided in Board papers has been plentiful and detailed but have encouraged the Executive Directors to provide more concise and 
streamlined reports. The Non-Executive Directors have worked with executive management to ensure they fully understand our information 
needs and recognise the importance of measuring performance against projections to enable a clear appraisal of progress, in conjunction 
with financial and risk analysis. The evaluation highlighted the open dialogue Directors have with management, which is invaluable in 
creating an effective and successful working relationship.
Following the review, we have introduced a programme of senior managers attending Board meetings, each making a presentation to the 
Board. This ensures a two-way process of communication between Non-Executive Directors and senior management. We have found it 
very useful and informative to have regular contact with senior management, which also aids our succession planning discussions.
We welcomed Independent Audit’s feedback from Directors on the time allocation and quality of our discussions at Board meetings and 
have adjusted our agendas to make more effective use of our Board meeting time.
Independent Audit has no connection or previous relationship with the Company.

Directors standing for election/re-election
The Board believes that the requirements of Code Provision B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code should be fulfilled, notwithstanding 
that the Company is not in the FTSE 350. This provision requires all Directors of such companies to be subject to annual election by shareholders 
and the Board has chosen to comply with this provision as it supports the view that shareholders should have the right to vote on each 
Director’s re-election to the Board on an annual basis. The Board has considered the proposed reappointment of Directors at the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 8 February 2018, at which the following resolutions relating to the appointment of Directors will be proposed:
• the re-election of Alan Dickinson as Chairman;
• the re-election of Nigel Hugill, Robin Butler and David Wood as Executive Directors; and
• the election of Jon Di-Stefano and the re-election of Ian Barlow, June Barnes, Duncan Hunter and Mark Tagliaferri 
as Non-Executive Directors.
As previously mentioned, Robert Dyson will not be standing for re-election at the 2018 AGM. He has worked in the property sector for over 
40 years and advised this Company (and its predecessor, the Terrace Hill Group) for ten years. The Board is grateful to him for his 
contribution to the Group’s success during his tenure as a Director.
Further biographical information on all Directors can be found on pages 76 to 78.
The Nomination Committee has concluded that all of the Directors seeking election or re-election continue to be effective and to demonstrate 
commitment to their role and confirms to shareholders that they have the necessary skills, knowledge and experience to continue to 
discharge their duties effectively. I hope that shareholders will support the Committee and vote in favour of these resolutions.

Committee Chairman Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for the financial year ended 
30 September 2017. During the year, Jon Di-Stefano, ACA was appointed as a member 
of the Committee, bringing with him extensive financial and housing sector experience. 
Together with my financial experience as a chartered accountant, having had a long career 
in finance and accounting, and Duncan Hunter’s career as a managing director of finance 
at a leading investment bank, the Board is satisfied that three members of the Committee 
have recent and relevant financial experience working with financial and reporting matters. 
I am also chairman of the audit committees of two other listed companies. The Board 
considers that the Audit Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector in 
which the Company operates. All members of the Committee are independent. 
The following report sets out the meetings and membership structure of the Committee, 
its role and responsibilities and details of its main activities during the year under review.

1. No meetings were held post his appointment date.
Meetings are aligned to the Group’s financial and regulatory reporting timetable and a detailed 
schedule of annual agenda items, managed by the Company Secretary, ensures that the 
Committee complies with all matters required under the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and the duties and responsibilities under its terms of reference, which are reviewed 
annually to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory developments. 
The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee. The Chief Executive and Finance 
Director attend all meetings of the Committee, to which the Chairman and the Group’s 
external auditor are also invited. Other Executive Directors, senior members of the finance 
team and the internal auditor attend by invitation only, if required. The Committee is satisfied 
that it receives sufficient and relevant information from the Company’s management, 
external auditor and internal auditor to enable it to fulfil its duties. The Chairman of the 
Committee provides a report to the Board following each Committee meeting on the 
matters discussed by the Committee. The Committee meets with the auditor without 
management being present at least twice a year. In addition to the scheduled Committee 
meetings, members of the Committee spend time with executive management to ensure 
a good understanding of the key issues to be considered by the Committee and to identify 
areas requiring further clarification or discussion at meetings.
Other members G 100 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Role and responsibilities
The Committee’s role is to ensure the integrity of published financial information and to monitor controls within the Group. The Committee 
is also responsible for the supervision of the relationship with the external auditor, BDO LLP (BDO), including their performance and 
effectiveness, and ensuring an effective audit process. 
The Committee’s key responsibilities are to review and report to the Board on:
• financial reporting;
• risk management;
• internal controls;
• governance and compliance; and
• the external auditor.
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the Company’s website at www.urbanandcivic.com.
Main activities
The main activities of the Committee during the year were as follows:
During the year, the Committee has continued to focus on the development of the Group’s approach to the management and 
reporting of risk and has overseen the reporting by Grant Thornton following their appointment to carry out an internal audit review. 
We commenced the internal audit process in 2016 and our work this year has been to develop an appropriate programme for 2017 and 
to agree the audit areas for 2018. Further details of the internal audit process are set out later in this report. The Committee also 
considered and agreed with the auditor the method for revenue recognition in compliance with both current and prospective 
accounting standards, following the sale of certain land parcels for the first time.
The Committee’s work covers five main areas and our key work in these areas during the year ended 30 September 2017 is summarised below:
Financial reporting
During the year the Audit Committee has:
• reviewed the audited financial statements and preliminary announcement of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2016, 
including consideration of key accounting issues and areas of significant judgement. The Committee reviewed and discussed with 
the auditor the audit findings on the Group accounts for the year ended 30 September 2016. The Committee recommended the 
approval of the financial statements to the Board;
• reviewed the Company’s going concern and viability statement for the year ended 30 September 2016, taking into account the 
business plan five-year forecast and equity requirements for the period to 30 September 2021;
• reviewed the investor presentation of the results for the year ended 30 September 2016 to ensure accuracy and consistency with 
the Report and Accounts;
• reviewed the Group’s interim financial statements and announcement of results for the six months to 31 March 2017 and 
recommended their approval to the Board;
• engaged with executive management at an early stage on the 2017 audit timetable and the year-end timetable for the production  
of the Report and Accounts;
• reviewed the Audit Planning Report prepared by the external auditor in respect of the financial year ended 30 September 2017, 
confirming materiality thresholds and agreeing the key audit matters for consideration by the auditor as part of the audit; and
• considered and agreed with the auditor the key accounting treatments (including the method for revenue recognition within 
acceptable parameters of current and future accounting standards) and significant accounting judgements in respect of the 
Group’s accounts for the year ended 30 September 2017 (as described on page 102), including:
• the valuation of investment properties and carrying value of trading properties;
• revenue and profit recognition policies.
Risk management
The Audit Committee reviews and approves the risk management framework and processes, which are also reviewed by the Board. 
The Board has recently established an Executive Management Committee and one of its key responsibilities will be to review risks 
at project level and report up to the Board.

The main activities of the Committee during the year continued:
The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk and a report on risk management is set out on pages 33 to 37. During the year, the 
Committee has:
• reviewed and discussed the risk appetite of the Group prior to a discussion and adoption by the Board, which has overall 
responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in achieving strategic objectives;
• identified and evaluated risks at a strategic and project risk level and discussed risk management controls and mitigation actions 
with management. A risk matrix was then submitted to the Board for approval;
• reviewed risk management reporting and driven more regular and formal reviews of the key risks facing the Group and the related 
risk mitigation. Management prepares a risk matrix for regular review by the Committee, which provides details of key risks and 
the impact of controls. The Committee reviews the likelihood, impact and mitigation of risks and approves the resulting risk rating. 
Further details of the key risks facing the Group are contained in the risk review on pages 33 to 37; and
• approved the new management committee structure, set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 82, to ensure appropriate 
and adequate “bottom-up” reporting on project risk.
Internal controls
Following an assessment of the Group’s internal controls structure in 2016, the Committee appointed Grant Thornton to provide an internal 
audit service to the Group and to report on and provide assurance on the adequacy of the internal financial and non-financial controls. 
During the year, the Committee:
• approved the engagement letter and fees for the internal audit review;
• approved the internal audit plan for 2017 and 2018, agreeing a detailed annual plan and a higher level long-term plan;
• reviewed the findings from audits of the risk management framework, management and development of projects and procure to 
pay processes; and
• monitored the follow-up of actions identified and recommended by the reports.
Governance and compliance
The Audit Committee has:
• reviewed all declarations made under the Group’s Gifts and Hospitality policy above an agreed threshold on a six-monthly basis;
• reviewed the Committee’s compliance with the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees, published in April 2016. The Committee is 
satisfied that it complies with the guidance;
• reviewed the performance evaluation of the Committee. During the year, the Board carried out a performance evaluation process for 
the Board as a whole and its committees, as described in the report of the Nomination Committee on page 96. The Audit Committee 
concluded that meetings are conducted in a focused and efficient way with a strong discipline over the year-end financial reporting 
process. The progress of risk management and internal controls review was commended, although with acknowledgement that 
there is further work to be done;
• approved revisions to the Committee’s terms of reference which reflected the appointment of an outsourced internal audit 
function and the publication of best practice guidelines in April 2017, following the introduction in 2016 of the revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees; and
• received development training from BDO on corporate reporting requirements and cyber security.
External auditor
The Audit Committee has:
• approved the terms of engagement and the fees of the auditor for work related to the review of the interim results for the six months 
to 31 March 2017 and for the audit for the year ended 30 September 2017. Audit and non-audit fees are disclosed in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 143;
• reviewed at each meeting any fees paid to the auditor. The Committee is satisfied that these are within the Group policy for the 
agreement and authorisation of non-audit services and do not compromise their independence; 
• reviewed the effectiveness of the auditor and the audit process, concluding that both were effective. The Committee members 
each reviewed an effectiveness questionnaire which was discussed at a Committee meeting. The Committee also considered the 
feedback from executive management. The effectiveness and independence of the auditor are discussed later in this report; and
• received assurance from BDO of their independence and objectivity. 102 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

 continued
Financial year ended 30 September 2017
Since the year end, the Committee has reviewed and recommended for Board approval the Annual Report and Accounts and preliminary 
announcement for the year ended 30 September 2017 and the investor presentation of results. The Committee is satisfied with the 
accuracy and consistency of information included in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 September 2017 and that, 
taken as a whole, they are fair, balanced and understandable and that the financial statements represent a true and fair view of the 
financial state of the Group. The Committee has reviewed the assumptions upon which the going concern principle has been adopted 
for the preparation of the financial statements and approved the long-term viability statement, which is set out on page 32.
Financial reporting and significant judgements
The significant areas of judgement considered by the Committee and assessed with the external auditor in relation to the year ended 
30 September 2017 were as follows:
1. Valuation of investment properties and carrying value of trading properties
It is important to value the Group’s property interests in order to ascertain the fair value of investment properties and the carrying value 
of trading properties, which are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Property valuations also inform the calculations of EPRA 
NAV. At 30 September 2017 the total EPRA value of all the Group’s property interests was £551.3 million, which was made up of investment 
properties, trading properties, properties within property, plant and equipment and the Group’s share of properties held by joint ventures 
and associates. Independent valuers, CBRE Limited, valued 76 per cent of the property interests and the Directors valued the remaining 
24 per cent, with around half of this 24 per cent being referenced to sales subsequent to the year-end. 
Due to the subjective nature of property valuations, significant judgement is required. Members of the Committee met with the external 
valuers, without management present, to discuss the half year and year-end valuations. Each property valuation was discussed individually 
with the integrity of the valuation process also assessed. Key judgements and assumptions applied to each valuation were considered 
as well as the valuation movement in the year. For the largest assets valued, Alconbury, Rugby and Newark, a discounted cash flow model 
was used reflecting the scale of the assets and the length of time over which the assets will be realised. The Committee considered the 
key inputs to the discounted cash flow model, namely the quantum and timing of significant cash outflows, land prices and forecast 
house price and cost inflation, the assumed profit required by housebuilders, and the applied discount rates. It was concluded that 
the assumptions applied to the valuations were appropriate. 
Members of the Committee also discussed and reviewed Directors’ valuations and considered that the key assumptions applied to the 
valuations were appropriate.
2. Revenue and profit recognition
The Committee considered revenue and profit recognition in respect of sales of residential land parcels and individual units constructed 
on its strategic sites. 
Proceeds from land parcel sales under licence arrangements are receivable in stages; a fixed price element initially being earned when 
risks and rewards of ownership transfer, with a further variable overage element being receivable when homes are sold. Total receipts 
are ultimately dependent upon sales prices achieved by housebuilders. Members of the Committee assessed the substantive conditions 
attaching to these arrangements when deciding how much and at what point revenue should be recognised, which was determined with 
reference to contractual terms and forecast timescales over which these amounts were payable. Amounts were discounted to adjust for 
the time value of money. The Committee also considered the methodology and allocation of directly attributable costs of servicing each 
land parcel prior to sale which includes an allocation of site-wide infrastructure costs. 
As with the sale of residential land parcels, some commercial land sale contracts entered into provide for deferred consideration. This adds 
a certain complexity as to the point at which revenue should be recognised in the financial statements and the value at which it should 
be measured. 
The Committee reviewed these methods of revenue and profit recognition and concluded they were appropriate.  103 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  
G
Assessment of the effectiveness and independence of the external auditor
BDO has been the auditor to the Urban&Civic Group since its Listing in May 2014 and was previously auditor to the Terrace Hill Group. 
The Committee has reviewed the requirements relating to the tender of auditors and concluded that the date of appointment of BDO 
is deemed to be May 2014. A competitive tender will therefore be required by 2024. Thomas Edward Goodworth became our new audit 
partner during the year ended 30 September 2016 and, since audit engagement partners are only required to rotate every five years, a 
rotation will not be required until the year ending 30 September 2021. The Company supports BDO’s policy that senior management of 
the audit team should rotate after seven years.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the external auditor taking into account their independence, objectivity, expertise 
and resources and has concluded that both the audit and audit process were effective. The Audit Committee considered the fulfilment of 
the audit plan and the degree to which BDO was able to assess key accounting and audit judgements and the content of the audit 
clearance report issued by them. This was carried out through both formal and informal meetings with the external audit team. 
The Committee agrees that BDO remain effective in their role as external auditor and recommends to the Board that they be reappointed 
for a further year. A resolution to this effect will be proposed at the 2018 AGM.
2018 priorities
Outside of financial reporting related to the half year and year-end processes, the Committee’s key focus for the year ended 30 September 2018 
will be the ongoing assessment of risk management within the Group, the review of enhanced reporting from management committees and 
the review of reports prepared by Grant Thornton as part of the ongoing internal controls programme. In the year ending 30 September 2018, 
the second phase of the internal controls review will take place, covering information security and control of IT related risk, the effectiveness 
of budgeting and forecasting processes, the processes for identifying, mitigating and controlling health and safety risks and a further 
review of projects. I will report on this process in next year’s Audit Committee report.

The Company Secretary is secretary to the Remuneration Committee and attends all meetings. Other Directors and advisers attend the 
Committee meetings by invitation only. 
Main activities during the year
The main activities of the Committee during the year were as follows:
• Review of the Remuneration Policy, as described below.
• Approval of the annual report on remuneration and disclosures in the 2016 Annual Report, including the disclosure of payments 
to past Directors.
• Review of Executive Director and staff bonuses and LTIP awards for the year ended 30 September 2016. The Committee 
approved LTIP awards of 200 per cent of salary for Executive Directors.
• Review of Executive Director and staff salaries for the year commencing 1 October 2016. The Finance Director’s salary was 
increased on 1 July 2017, as disclosed in last year’s annual report on remuneration. Other Executive Directors’ base salary 
increases were in line with staff inflationary increases.
• Approval of bonus allocation for Executive Directors for the year ended 30 September 2016. This approval resulted from 
discussions of the performance of the Executive Directors, the attainment of objectives and their qualification for a bonus. 
The Committee approved the percentage of maximum bonus opportunity relating to personal objectives. Key performance 
areas assessed were finding new assets, the operation and development of existing assets, share price and cost management.
• Approval of Executive Director objectives (Company and personal) for the year ended 30 September 2017.
• Approval of the grant of awards under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan relating to the deferred element of the 2014, 2015 and 
2016 bonus awards. The grant of these awards was delayed due to an administrative oversight, which has since been addressed.
• Review of the terms of reference. The Committee reviews its terms of reference annually. On my appointment as Chair of the 
Committee, I received induction training which included a briefing by the Company Secretary on the functions of the Committee, 
as set out in the terms of reference. In setting the agendas of the Remuneration Committee meetings, in consultation with me, 
the Company Secretary ensures that all matters under the terms of reference are appropriately dealt with by the Committee.
• Agreement of the scope and fees of the review of the remuneration policy by Aon Hewitt.
• Review of the remuneration structure of all Group employees and commencement of a review of how the staff remuneration 
policy compares with the Directors’ policy.
• Criteria/banding for bonus payments and for eligibility for LTIP awards.
• Review of Group leavers during the year and reasons for leaving. 107 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc

Review of the remuneration policy
The Committee has undertaken a comprehensive review of the current remuneration policy in advance of the second binding vote at the 
2018 AGM. The policy was last approved by shareholders in 2015. As part of that review, we have taken into account a review of:
• market conditions;
• market practice;
• legislation and regulation;
• corporate governance and published guidance;
• motivation of executive management;
• views of shareholders and institutional investors;
• employment conditions in the Group; and
• group culture and values.
Our advisers made a presentation to the Committee at a workshop, discussing proposals for the new policy. I canvassed the views of all 
Directors and sought feedback from the Committee members after the workshop. A timetable of the steps involved in the proposal of the 
new policy was agreed, thus ensuring a comprehensive and timely review process.
The review was carried out with the purpose of ensuring a reward structure incorporating the provision of competitive awards for Executive Directors 
taking into account the performance of the Group and of individuals, the consideration of market comparisons and the attraction, retention 
and motivation of high calibre executives. We also wanted to reflect the relatively long-term business model of Urban&Civic. The reward structure 
is therefore designed to promote the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives and financial returns for shareholders and to align these 
objectives with the pay and incentives of the executives.
As part of the policy review, we gave our largest shareholders the opportunity to provide feedback on our proposals, as part of our continuing 
dialogue with them. A letter inviting consultation was sent to our largest shareholders and to two investor bodies. The Committee ensured that 
all the views of our shareholders expressed during the consultation were considered when formulating the revised Directors’ remuneration policy.
We continue to value the engagement with, and support of, our shareholders.
Changes to the policy
The key changes between the new remuneration policy to be voted on at the 2018 AGM and the current policy, which was approved 
by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, are set out in the table below. In summary, the changes represent a shift towards long-term variable 
remuneration by reducing the annual bonus opportunity, reducing pension contributions for any new Executive Director, increasing 
the annual LTIP award, and significantly increasing share ownership guidelines.
Area Current policy New policy
Pension 15% of base salary. No change for existing Directors.
New Directors will have pension contributions set at 10% 
of base salary, in line with the rest of the workforce.
Annual bonus Maximum opportunity of 175% of base salary.
Half of the bonus is deferred in shares for two years.
Maximum opportunity of 100% of base salary.
No bonus deferral.
LTIP Annual awards of 200% of base salary. Maximum annual awards of 300% of base salary for the 
CEO and MD, and 275% of base salary for the FD.
Share ownership 
guidelines
200% of base salary. 500% of base salary for the current CEO and MD.
250% of base salary for other Directors.
Other than those changes outlined above, we are not making any other changes to the remuneration policy. 108 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Introduction continued
Performance and reward in the year to 30 September 2017
The Group’s results for the year ended 30 September 2017 are discussed in the strategic report on pages 4 to 71. The Group has 
reported a total comprehensive income for the year of £6.8 million, IFRS net assets of £371.9 million and EPRA net assets of £439.3 million 
at 30 September 2017 , 1.5 per cent and 7.2 per cent higher compared against the same respective net asset valuations at 30 September 2016. 
Reflecting performance against EPRA net asset growth targets and the individual performance of the Executive Directors against their 
personal objectives, annual bonus awards for the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 September 2017 were 109 per cent of salary 
(out of a possible 175 per cent) with 50 per cent of these amounts deferred into Urban&Civic shares for two years. 
The Committee has reviewed achievement against objectives and believes that the remuneration of the Executive Directors reflects the 
performance of the Group.
Details of the changes to the salaries of the Executive Directors are set out in the annual report on remuneration on page 116.
Performance Share Plan awards 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards are due to vest based on performance from 22 May 2014 to 30 September 2017, as set out in the 
annual report on remuneration on page 116.
The Committee intends to grant awards under the 2018 PSP within six weeks of the 2018 AGM. While award levels and performance 
targets have yet to be determined, award levels will be within the normal maximum annual grant limits and performance metrics will 
be based on EPRA NAV and absolute TSR conditions. The introduction of an absolute TSR performance measure, which replaces 
the previous relative TSR measure, will directly align our executive team with the value created for shareholders over the long term. 
The Committee did consider retaining a measure of relative TSR but believes that the TSR peer group (the FTSE 350 Real Estate) comprises 
many companies exposed to markedly different market factors and operating in very different areas, for example, property rental in 
central London. An alternative peer group was considered, but there are too few comparable listed companies to form a robust group.
EPRA NA V and personal objectives
The Committee approved the EPRA NAV target and personal objectives for the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 September 2017. 
The Committee agreed that the EPRA NAV target should be set at a stretched level and that personal objectives should focus on the 
strategic priorities within the business with the aim of incentivising the executives to maximise performance. The EPRA NAV target 
and personal objectives are set out in more detail in the annual report on remuneration on pages 114 and 115.
Change of Directors 
Jon Di-Stefano was appointed as a Non-Executive Director and member of the Audit Committee on 1 September 2017. The terms of his 
appointment were approved by the Board. I was appointed as Chair of the Remuneration Committee on 1 July 2017, in place of Robert Dyson. 
I would like to thank Robert for his chairmanship of the Committee and am grateful that he continues to act as a member of the Committee, 
offering his advice, knowledge and experience on the Group’s remuneration policy and its operation. I wish him well when he steps down 
from the Board following the 2018 AGM. 
There were no other changes to the Board during the year.
Share ownership guidelines
By adopting share ownership guidelines under which Directors are expected to satisfy a minimum shareholding requirement, we encourage 
a long-term ownership culture and an alignment of executive and shareholder interests. 
Under the proposed policy the current Chief Executive and the Managing Director will be required to build, and then hold, 500 per cent of 
their base salary in the Company’s shares. The Finance Director, and any other Executive Directors appointed to the Board in the future, 
will have a minimum shareholding requirement of 250 per cent. This represents an increase for all three Executive Directors from the 
current policy which stipulates a minimum shareholding requirement of 200 per cent. A two-year post-vesting holding period of awards 
made under the PSP is also in place. This will continue to apply under the new policy. 109 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  
G
The year ahead
In the coming year, the main focus of the Committee will be to review the staff remuneration and benefits policy in operation and to look at 
areas where we can improve the investment in, and development of, staff. We intend to carry out a salary review for all staff every three years 
to ensure that benefits are in line with market practice, that they take account of the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and that 
they are appropriate for the staff employed. The first such review will take place in 2018. We are committed to retaining a well-motivated 
team of employees and as the Company headcount continues to grow, we undertake to ensure that Urban&Civic is a company that seeks 
to attract and retain high calibre individuals. 
The Committee will also oversee the introduction of the new remuneration policy and its first year in operation.
2018 AGM/recommendation 
The Committee unanimously recommends that shareholders vote to approve both the binding report on the remuneration policy and the 
advisory vote on the remuneration report at the 2018 AGM.

Directors’ remuneration policy report
Introduction and overview
The Group’s remuneration policy is designed to provide competitive rewards for its Directors, taking into account the performance of the 
Group and individual executives, together with comparisons of pay conditions throughout the markets in which the Group operates. It is 
the aim of the Committee to attract, retain and motivate high calibre individuals with a competitive remuneration package. It is common 
practice in the industry for total remuneration for Executive Directors to be significantly influenced by bonuses and long-term incentives.
The remuneration packages are constructed to provide a balance between fixed and variable rewards. Therefore, remuneration packages 
for Executive Directors normally include basic salary and benefits in kind with variable pay based on performance related annual bonus 
and long-term incentive plans.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Company encourages two-way communication with both its institutional and private shareholders and the Committee is committed 
to considering shareholder feedback received. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to 
time, is considered as part of the Group’s annual review of remuneration policy. In addition, the Remuneration Committee will seek to 
engage directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies should any material changes be made to the remuneration policy.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Group employs around 70 people and the Committee considers the general base salary increase for all employees when determining 
the annual salary increases for the Executive Directors and considers quantum and the structure of pay across the Group more generally 
when reviewing the Executive Directors’ remuneration policy.
Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Group’s senior executive remuneration policy, although the Committee 
will keep this under review. 
Summary of remuneration policy
The Directors’ remuneration policy set out below will be submitted for approval at the 2018 AGM. The differences between this policy and 
the previous policy approved at the 2015 AGM have been set out on page 107.

executives with 
shareholders.
The Committee requires 
that Executive Directors 
satisfy a minimum 
shareholding requirement.
Minimum of 500 per cent of salary for 
the current CEO and MD and 250 per cent 
for any other Executive Director 
(including the current FD).
Not applicable.
Non-Executive Directors
Fees
To provide fees 
reflecting time 
commitments and 
responsibilities of 
each role, in line 
with those provided 
by similarly  
sized companies.
Cash fee normally paid 
on a monthly basis.
Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees are determined by the 
Executive Directors having 
regard to the need to 
attract high calibre 
individuals with the right 
experience, the time and 
responsibilities entailed 
and comparative fees paid 
in the market in which the 
Group operates.
Taxable benefits may be 
provided where appropriate 
including the reimbursement 
of expenses.
There is no prescribed maximum 
individual fee or fee increase.
The Board (excluding Non-Executive 
Directors) is guided by the general 
increase for the broader employee 
population, time commitment, scope 
and responsibility of the role and/or 
relevant market movements.
Current fee levels are set  
out in the annual report  
on remuneration.
Not applicable.
Notes:
1. A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy set out in this table (from the 2018 AGM) is found in the annual report on remuneration.
2.  Below Board level, a lower or no annual bonus may apply. In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the 
various categories of individuals, together with the fact that remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior executives typically has a greater emphasis on performance related pay. 
3.  The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflects the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging 
and tied to both the delivery of financial targets and specific individual objectives. Further details of the choice of performance measures and performance targets are set out in the 
annual report on remuneration.
4.  The performance conditions applicable to the PSP (see the annual report on remuneration) are selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery 
of long-term returns to shareholders and are consistent with the Company’s objective of delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders.
5.  The Committee operates the PSP in accordance with the plan rules and the Listing Rules and the Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of 
areas relating to the operation and administration of the plan. Dividend equivalents may be paid on PSP awards.
6. Executive Directors may participate in any all-employee share plan to the extent operated.
7.  For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ remuneration policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former 
Directors (such as the payment of a pension, payment of last year’s annual bonus and the vesting/exercise of share awards granted in the past). Details of any payments to former 
Directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. 112 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

 for the year ended 30 September 2017 
Directors’ remuneration policy report continued
Reward scenarios
The charts below show how the composition of each of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages varies at different levels of 
performance under the policy, as a percentage of total remuneration opportunity and as a total value.
Notes:
1. The minimum performance scenario comprises the fixed elements of remuneration only, including:
 • salary, as set out in the annual report on remuneration;
 • pension (15 per cent of salary); and
 • benefits are approximated.
2.  The on-target level of bonus is taken to be 50 per cent of the maximum bonus opportunity, and the on-target level of PSP vesting is assumed to be 25 per cent of the face value of the 
PSP award. These values are included in addition to the components/values of minimum remuneration.
3.  Maximum remuneration assumes full bonus pay-out (100 per cent of salary only) and the full face value of the PSP (i.e. 300 per cent of salary for the CEO and MD, and 275 per cent 
for the FD), in addition to fixed components of minimum remuneration.
4. No share price growth has been factored into the calculations.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s prevailing approved remuneration 
policy at the time of appointment and would take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a candidate 
of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate and may be set initially at a below mid-market 
level on the basis that it may progress towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance have been proven and sustained. 
The annual bonus potential would be limited to 100 per cent of salary and, depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee 
may deem it appropriate to set different annual bonus performance conditions to the current Executive Directors for the first performance 
year of appointment. Grants under the PSP would be limited normally to 300 per cent of salary and can be made shortly following an 
appointment (assuming the Company is not in a close period). The Committee may provide an allowance or reimbursement of any 
reasonable expenses (including tax thereon) in relation to the relocation of an Executive Director. Any ongoing costs will be met by the 
Company for a period of no more than 12 months.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by 
an Executive leaving a previous employer if required in order to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the recruitment of the relevant 
individual. The Committee would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms 
of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue. 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental 
expenses as appropriate.

Service contracts for Executive Directors
The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations. The Committee will seek to 
ensure that no unjustified payments for failure are made.
All Executive Directors are employed on rolling contracts subject to no more than 12 months’ notice from either the Executive Director 
or the Company, given at any time. Service contracts do not provide explicitly for termination payments or damages but the Company may 
make payments in lieu of notice. For this purpose, pay in lieu of notice would consist of basic salary and other relevant emoluments for the 
relevant notice period excluding any bonus. In addition, the Company has discretion in certain circumstances to pay certain fees relating 
to the termination, for example, fees for legal advice received by the Executive Director. The Committee may pay any statutory entitlements 
or settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination of employment, where considered in the best interests of the Company.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors’ contracts which provide for longer periods of notice 
or additional payments on a change of control of the Company. Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional 
compensation on an Executive Director’s cessation of employment with the Group.
An annual bonus may be payable with respect to the proportion of a financial year served, although it will be pro-rated for time and paid 
at the normal payment date. Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Company’s share plans will be 
determined based on the relevant plan rules. In certain prescribed circumstances set out in the plan rules of the relevant share plan 
(for example, death, injury or disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee), “good leaver” status may 
be applied. For good leavers, awards will usually vest at the normal vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions at that time and will be reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the vesting period actually served, although the Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to allow these awards to vest at an earlier date (although not earlier than the date of cessation) and/or disapply 
time pro-rata. 
The Board allows Executive Directors to accept appropriate outside non-executive director appointments provided the aggregate 
commitment is compatible with their duties as Executive Directors. The Executive Directors concerned may retain fees paid for these 
services, which will be subject to approval by the Board.
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have a remuneration agreement for an initial period of 12 months and thereafter on a rolling basis subject to 
three months’ notice by either the Non-Executive Director or the Company, given at any time. In addition, temporary additional day rates 
can be provided to certain Non-Executive Directors. Full details on any additional day rates are set out in the annual report on remuneration.
In the event of termination of their appointment Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any compensation. 114 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

4.  The 2017 long-term incentive disclosure refers to the awards granted in 2014 which had a performance period which ran from 22 May 2014 to 30 September 2017. Following an 
assessment of performance, 27.7 per cent of the shares are expected to vest in early December 2017. As the awards have not yet vested, the figures shown in the table are based on 
the average share price in the three months to 30 September 2017, which is 255.87p. These figures will be restated next year using the actual share price on the vesting date. Further 
details relating to performance targets, weightings and outcomes can be found on page 116.
5. Pension payments are made as a cash supplement to the Directors or directly to a pension scheme.
6.  As permitted by the UK Corporate Governance Code, Executive Directors may be permitted to act as director of a non-Group company and to retain any earnings they receive for 
that role. During the year ended 30 September 2017, Robin Butler was a director of New Heritage Regeneration Limited and retained earnings of £20,000 for that role (2016: £20,000).
7.  Appointed as a Director on 1 July 2016. T otal remuneration stated is in accordance with the Directors’ remuneration policy in relation to the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 September 2016.

Determination of the annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2017
The annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2017 was capped at 175 per cent of salary, with 70 per cent (up to 122.5 per cent of salary) 
based on growth in EPRA NAV and 30 per cent (up to 52.5 per cent of salary) based on personal objectives. 50 per cent of any bonus award is 
paid in cash and 50 per cent is deferred into shares for two years.
EPRA NAV at 30 September 2017 was £439.3 million. This resulted in 64.7 per cent of base salary (out of a possible 122.5 per cent) being payable 
to the Executive Directors. The targets for the year ended 30 September 2017, and the associated potential bonus payments, were as follows:
Annual bonus target EPRA NAV Bonus payable
Threshold £418.2m 24.2 per cent of base salary
Target £437.2m 61.3 per cent of base salary

Determination of the annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2017 continued
Personal objectives for the year ended 30 September 2017 were set to measure the individual performance of Executive Directors and included:
• the advancement of projects within the existing portfolio;
• ensuring ongoing pipeline supply of future projects to the core business;
• delivery of projects in line with budget and agreed timescales;
• specific targets for certain projects;
• ensuring effective communication with investors and the wider investment community;
• maintenance of high quality corporate governance;
• maintenance of satisfactory and beneficial banking relationships;
• management and development of financial reporting to the Board and the investor community;
• development of a capital allocation policy and treasury and tax strategies; and
• strong leadership across the Group and management and motivation of executives.
During the year, major projects were delivered on time and on budget, and acquisitions of strategic sites were made in line with our goals for 
the year and our capital allocation policy. Progress was made on planning applications, and excellent progress was made on the development 
of our treasury and tax strategies. In addition, as set out in the operational review, strong progress was made against our strategic objectives 
for our key sites.
The Committee scored the Executive Directors’ individual performance based on an unweighted objective assessment of the level 
of attainment of each of the Executive Directors having regard to specific areas of responsibility. The Committee approved payments 
related to personal objectives of 44.6 per cent of base salary (out of a possible 52.50 per cent) being paid to current Executive Directors 
as set out in the table below.
Executive Director Maximum amount payable Actual amount payable

Implementation of the remuneration policy for the year ending 30 September 2018
The following section sets out how the Remuneration Committee intends to implement the remuneration policy for the year ending 
30 September 2018. 
Base salary
Base salary levels for the Chief Executive and Managing Director have been increased by 3 per cent, and for the Finance Director by 3.7 per cent. 
These increases are in line with the increase in base salaries of the general workforce. Base salary levels for the Executive Directors as at 
1 October 2017 and 1 October 2016 are shown below:
Director Title 2017 2016 % increase
Nigel Hugill Chief Executive £408,395 £396,500 3%
Robin Butler Managing Director £408,395 £396,500 3%
David Wood Group Finance Director £280,000 £230,000
 1
3.7%
1.  Increased to £270,000 on 1 July 2017, as disclosed in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts.
The next salary review date is expected to be 1 October 2018. 117 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc  
G
Pension
The Group will contribute 15 per cent of base salary for all Executive Directors (payable into a pension arrangement or as a salary 
supplement). New Executive Directors will have pension set at 10 per cent of base salary, in line with the rest of the workforce. 
Benefits
Benefits provided will continue to include a fully expensed company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance, permanent health 
insurance and life assurance. Other benefits may be payable where appropriate. 
Annual bonus
For the year ending 30 September 2018, the annual bonus structure will be changed from that operated in the prior year, as set out in the 
policy report on pages 110 to 113. The maximum bonus opportunity will be 100 per cent of base salary with 50 per cent of the annual bonus 
opportunity based on growth in EPRA NAV, 30 per cent based on personal/strategic objectives and 20 per cent based on cash generation. 
Annual bonus targets for the year ending 30 September 2018 are currently considered to be commercially sensitive although, as in previous 
years, retrospective disclosure will be provided in the 2018 annual report on remuneration. The Remuneration Committee retains discretion 
to reduce (but not increase) annual bonuses in the event that the share price diverges markedly from reported growth in EPRA NAV. 
Long-term incentives
Shareholders will be asked to approve an amendment to the rules of the Performance Share Plan at the 2018 AGM. While award levels and 
performance targets are yet to be determined, award levels will be within the normal maximum annual grant limits and performance metrics 
will be based on EPRA NAV and TSR conditions and measured over the performance period from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2020. 
Full details of the award levels for Executive Directors and the performance targets will be provided in the relevant Stock Exchange 
announcement which will be published immediately following grant.
The Remuneration Committee intends to grant awards under the PSP within six weeks of the 2018 AGM.
Clawback provisions
Consistent with best practice, the Company will operate clawback provisions in respect of annual bonus and PSP awards in the year ending 
30 September 2018. The Committee may withhold (‘malus’) or recover (‘clawback’) awards/payments within a period of three years from 
award in the event that the Company materially misstates its financial results, there is an error in assessing the performance targets and/or 
participants cease employment as a result of misconduct on the part of the individual.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are reviewed annually and an increase was approved by the Board to take effect from 1 October 2017.

Directors’ conflicts of interest 
Under the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’), Directors are subject to a statutory duty to avoid a situation where they have, or can have, a 
direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company. As is permissible under the Act, the 
Company’s Articles of Association allow the Board to consider and, if it sees fit, to authorise situations where a Director has an interest 
that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company. Directors are required to notify the Company under an established 
procedure as soon as they become aware of any situation that could result in a conflict or potential conflict of interest. Any conflicts or 
potential conflicts are noted at each Board meeting and a register of conflicts is maintained by the Company Secretary. No significant 
conflicts of interest arose during the year under review.
Directors’ liability insurance and indemnity
The Company maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. To the extent permitted by UK law, the Company indemnifies 
its Directors against claims brought against them as a consequence of the execution of their duties as Directors of the Company.
Charitable and political donations
During the year to 30 September 2017, Urban&Civic donated £65,000 (2016: £33,000) to charity, including local youth, sports and social 
clubs, charities that help train the unemployed back into work and community environment charities. Further details are contained in the 
corporate social responsibility report on page 67. 
Authority was granted at the 2017 Annual General Meeting (2017 AGM) to enable the Group to make political donations up to an aggregate 
amount not exceeding £150,000. That authority will expire at the 2018 AGM and a resolution will be proposed for its renewal. The Group 
made no political donations during the year (2016: £Nil).
Change of control 
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. 
Given the commercial sensitivity of these agreements, the Directors do not intend to disclose specific details.
The Group’s Performance Share Plan contains provisions relating to the vesting of awards in the event of a change in control of the Company.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for a loss of office or employment 
that occurs specifically because of a takeover bid. 
Substantial shareholdings

Purchase of the Company’s shares 
The Company was granted authority at the 2017 AGM to purchase its own shares up to a total aggregate value of 10 per cent of the issued 
nominal share capital, subject to market-standard maximum and minimum price constraints. That authority will expire at the 2018 AGM 
and a resolution will be proposed for its renewal. During the year the Company, via the Employee Benefit Trust, purchased 110,846 ordinary 
shares of 20p each at a cost of £249,404. The Company does not currently hold any shares in treasury.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s issued share capital are shown in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements on page 160. As at 30 September 
2017, there were 144,964,808 ordinary shares of 20p each in issue, each carrying one vote and all fully paid. There is only one class of share 
in issue and there are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company other than those specified by law or regulation (for example, 
insider trading laws) and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority whereby certain employees of the Group require 
the approval of the Company to deal in the ordinary shares. 
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company, every holder of ordinary shares present in person and entitled to vote shall have 
one vote and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. 
The notice of the 2018 AGM specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions 
to be passed at the meeting. There are no restrictions on voting rights other than as specified by the Company’s Articles of Association.
At the 2017 AGM, the Directors were given the power to allot shares up to a nominal amount of one-third of the Company’s issued nominal 
share capital, as well as additional authority to allot a further one-third on a rights issue. This authority expires at the 2018 AGM and a 
resolution will be proposed for its renewal.
The issued share capital was increased during the year by fully paid issues as follows:
Date Description 
Number of 
ordinary shares 
of 20p each
24 February 2017 Scrip allotment 113,541
21 July 2017 Scrip allotment 46,539
Amendment of Articles of Association 
The Company’s Articles of Association can only be amended by a special resolution of the members, requiring a majority of not less than 
75 per cent of such members voting in person or by proxy.
Annual General Meeting
The 2018 AGM of the Company will be held at The Savile Club, 69 Brook Street, London W1K 4ER at 10.00 a.m. on 8 February 2018. The special 
business at the 2018 AGM will include resolutions dealing with the authority to issue shares, the disapplication of pre-emption rights, the 
authority for the Company to purchase its own shares, the approval of an amendment to the Group’s Performance Share Plan, the authority 
to make political donations and the authority to call general meetings on not less than 14 clear days’ notice. The notice of meeting, 
containing explanations of all the resolutions to be proposed at that meeting, is circulated with this Annual Report and Accounts.
Auditor
BDO LLP is willing to be reappointed as the external auditor to the Company and Group and their reappointment has been considered 
by the Audit Committee and recommended to the Board. A resolution will be proposed at the 2018 AGM for their reappointment and 
to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration.
Going concern
In accordance with provision C.1.3 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board is required to report on the going concern of the 
Group and the Company. 
In assessing going concern, the Directors have reviewed the Group’s rolling five-year cash flow forecasts, loan maturities and undrawn 
facilities and have run sensitivities reflecting the Group’s risk profile to ensure covenant compliance over the next 12 months. The Group’s 
key risks are set out in the risk review on pages 33 to 37.
Having undertaken the assessment detailed above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
have sufficient resources to continue to operate for the next 12 months and the Board considers it appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on a going concern basis. 124 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

— DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required:
• to select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• to make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, to state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group financial statements; 
• for the Company financial statements, to state whether they have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Company financial statements;
• to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company 
will continue in business; and
• to prepare a Directors’ report, a strategic report and a Directors’ remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of any relevant audit information 
which has not been disclosed to the auditor.
Responsibility statement 
Each of the Directors confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the adoption of a going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements continues to be appropriate based on a review 
of the current and projected financial position of the Group, making reasonable assumptions about future trading performance;
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
they face; and
• the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy.
The Directors’ responsibility statement was approved by the Board.

 — 
Urban&Civic Head office, London 128 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017
— INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 to the members of Urban&Civic plc
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Urban&Civic plc 
(the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the 
year ended 30 September 2017 which comprise the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and Company 
balance sheets, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, 
the consolidated cash flow statement and notes to the financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in preparing the parent company financial statements 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including 
Financial Reporting Standard 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern 
and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information 
in the Annual Report and Accounts, in relation to which ISAs (UK) 
require us to report to you whether we have anything material to 
add or to draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts set out on 
pages 33 to 37 that describe the principal risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated; or
• the Directors’ confirmation set out on page 88 in the 
Annual Report and Accounts that they have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the Directors’ statement set out on page 123 in the financial 
statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements and the Directors’ identification of any 
material uncertainties to the Group and the parent company’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements; or
• whether the Directors’ statement relating to going concern 
made in accordance with provision C.1.3 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
• the Directors’ explanation set out on page 32 in the Annual 
Report and Accounts as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and 
why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. F
129 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc
Key audit matter How we addressed the key audit matter in the audit
Valuation of investment properties and carrying 
value of trading properties
As detailed in notes 11, 13 and 15, the Group, directly  
or through its joint ventures, associates and other 
investments, owns a portfolio of properties which 
are held as either investment properties or 
trading properties.
Investment properties owned directly by the Group, 
including those in the course of development, are 
held at fair value in the Group financial statements. 
Trading properties are carried in the consolidated 
balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value and remeasured to fair value in the Group’s 
EPRA NAV reporting.
In respect of the properties held by joint ventures 
and associates, the Group has an indirect exposure 
to fair value changes, as the Group adjusts the carrying 
amount of these investments for changes in the fair 
value of the underlying investment property and 
adjusts the EPRA carrying amount of these 
investments for changes in the fair value of the 
underlying trading property.
As described in the report of the Audit Committee 
on page 102 and in the Group’s critical accounting 
estimates and judgements on page 142, determination 
of the fair value of investment properties and the 
carrying amount and fair value of trading properties 
is a key area of estimation and we therefore considered 
this to be an area of significant audit risk and focus.
Each valuation requires consideration of the 
individual nature of the property, its location, its 
cash flows and comparable market transactions.
The majority (by value) of the property interests held 
by the Group and its joint ventures and associates are 
in the course of development. The valuation of these 
properties requires the discounting of estimated 
future cash flows with deductions for costs to 
complete, which given the long-term nature of the 
developments requires significant judgements. 
Judgements in relation to future sales values and 
build costs in particular are impacted by the political 
and economic uncertainty arising from the result of 
the EU referendum.
The valuation of the Group’s income generating 
properties requires significant judgements to 
be made in relation to the appropriate market 
capitalisation yields and estimated rental values.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to, the following:
• We reviewed the design, implementation and appropriateness of the Group’s 
controls relating to the valuation of investment and trading properties. The key 
controls were identified as being the appointment of independent experts to 
value the majority (76 per cent) of the Group’s property portfolio and the processes 
by which the Group ensures that accurate data is provided to those experts.
• We assessed the competency, qualifications, independence and objectivity 
of the external valuers engaged by the Group and reviewed the terms of their 
engagements for any unusual arrangements.
• We obtained and read the valuation reports for all properties of the Group 
and its joint ventures or associates subject to valuation and confirmed that 
they had been prepared on a basis that was appropriate for determining the 
carrying value in the Group’s financial statements. 
• The senior members of our team met with the Group’s external valuer, 
CBRE Limited, independently of management to discuss and challenge 
the valuation methodology and key assumptions.
• We tested the accuracy of the key observable valuation inputs supplied to 
and used by the external valuer and Directors as appropriate. In respect of 
the properties in the course of development, this primarily involved agreeing 
the costs incurred to date to supporting documentation and reviewing the 
costs to complete against the latest development appraisals and, where 
applicable, supplier contracts or other agreements. In respect of the income 
generating properties, this primarily involved agreeing the passing rental 
income and lease terms to underlying supporting documentation.
• We compared the key valuation assumptions against our independently formed 
market expectations and challenged the valuer where significant variances 
from these expectations were identified. We then verified their responses 
to supporting documentation where appropriate. For the properties in the 
course of development, the key valuation assumptions were deemed to be the 
forecast gross development values, house price inflation, cost price inflation, 
developer profit margin and the risk adjusted discount rates. Our review of 
these assumptions included reference to comparable market transactions, 
the sales data now being generated from the Group’s own sites and external 
market forecasts for house price and cost inflation. For the income generating 
properties, the key valuation assumptions were the market capitalisation 
yields and estimated rental values, which we reviewed by reference to market 
data based on the location and specifics of each property. We also tested the 
arithmetic and mechanical integrity of formulae in the cash flow models used 
by the external valuer in the valuation of the key strategic land sites by value 
(being Alconbury, Rugby and Newark).
• We reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures within the 
financial statements in relation to valuation methodology, key valuation 
inputs and valuation uncertainty.
Key observations
Based on our work, we are satisfied that the valuation of the Group’s investment properties and the carrying value of the Group’s 
trading properties (both held directly and indirectly through joint ventures and associates) is appropriate and in line with the Group’s 
accounting policies. 130 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Key audit matter How we addressed the key audit matter in the audit
Revenue and profit recognition
As detailed in note 2, the Group’s results for the year 
include revenue and profit from the sale of residential 
land parcels and individual units on one of its strategic 
land sites. The Group’s share of profit from joint 
ventures detailed in note 13 also includes the profits 
from the sale of residential land parcels on another 
strategic land site.
The proceeds from the sale of land parcels to 
housebuilders under licence agreements are receivable 
in stages over the anticipated period of development. 
There is also a variable price element due to the Group 
at some point in the future which is dependent upon the 
sales price that the housebuilders achieve on each unit.
The directly attributable costs of servicing each land 
parcel prior to sale include site-wide infrastructure 
costs. The Group has therefore had to develop a 
method for allocating costs so that the appropriate 
amount of profit can be recognised on each parcel 
sale. Where the Group makes direct sales of individual 
residential units, it has also had to develop a method 
to allocate the site-wide construction costs to each 
unit so that the appropriate amount of profit can be 
recognised on each unit sale.
As described in the report of the Audit Committee 
on page 102 and in the Group’s critical accounting 
estimates and judgements on page 142, a number 
of estimates have been made in determining the 
amount of revenue and profit to recognise from 
these transactions. We therefore identified the 
accounting for these sales to be an area of significant 
audit risk and focus.
The Group’s revenue also includes income from the 
sale of commercial trading properties, including land 
interests held through promotion agreements with 
the landowner. Proceeds from such sales should only 
be recognised once the risks and rewards of ownership 
have passed to the buyer, which is typically when 
contracts have been unconditionally exchanged. 
Sale transactions can also be structured such that 
the Group receives the proceeds as a series of staged 
payments over a period of more than one year. Given 
these complexities, we identified the recognition and 
measurement of this type of revenue to be an area of 
significant audit risk and focus.
Our audit work in relation to the recognition and measurement of revenue 
recognised from the sale of land parcels to housebuilders included, but was not 
restricted to, the following:
• We reviewed the terms of each licence agreement to agree how the sales proceeds 
due to the Group will be determined and when they will fall due for payment.
• We evaluated the revenue recognition policy applied to the fixed minimum 
amounts that are receivable over time under the licence agreements 
with housebuilders.
• We reviewed and challenged the discount factor applied to these minimum 
receipts and reperformed the present value calculations.
• We reviewed and evaluated management’s assessment of whether a reliable 
estimate could be made of the future variable amounts receivable under the 
licence agreements with housebuilders at the balance sheet date.
• We evaluated the recoverability assessment made by management in respect 
of the deferred sales receipts.
Our audit work in relation to the recognition and measurement of profit from the 
sale of the residential land parcels included, but was not restricted to, the following:
• We evaluated the method by which site-wide infrastructure costs have been 
allocated to each residential phase and then, where relevant, to each 
residential unit.
• We tested a sample of actual infrastructure costs incurred to date and 
reviewed the expected costs to complete against the latest project appraisals 
and contracted costs.
In respect of the recognition and measurement of profit from the sale of the 
individual residential units, we also revisited the method of allocating infrastructure 
and construction costs to each individual unit that was established in the 
previous year to evaluate whether this remained appropriate in light of current 
sales, costs and forecast data.
Our audit work in relation to the recognition and measurement of income from 
the sale of commercial property interests included, but was not restricted to, 
the following:
• We evaluated the revenue recognition policy applied to each of the significant 
disposal transactions.
• We reviewed the terms of the relevant sales agreements to ensure that the 
Group had fulfilled its contractual obligations to entitle it to the revenue.
• We reviewed and challenged the discount factor applied to any deferred sales 
receipts and tested the present value calculations.
• We evaluated the recoverability assessment made by management in respect 
of the deferred sales receipts.
Key observations
Based on our work, we consider that the revenue and profit from the sale of residential land parcels and individual units on the 
Group’s strategic land sites and the revenue from the sale of commercial trading properties has been recognised appropriately and is 
in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy.

Key audit matters continued  F
131 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing 
our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. For planning, 
we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, 
including omissions, could influence the economic decisions 
of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial 
statements. In order to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a 
lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the 
extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these 
levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also 
take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the 
particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating 
their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £6.5 million. This was determined with reference to a 
benchmark of Group total assets (of which it represents 1.2 per cent), 
which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for 
members of the parent company in assessing the financial 
performance of this asset-based Group.
International Standards on Auditing (UK) also allow the auditor to 
set a lower materiality for particular classes of transactions, balances 
or disclosures for which misstatements of lesser amounts than 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of the financial statements. In this context, we set a 
lower level of materiality of £500,000 to apply to those classes of 
transactions and balances which impact on the Group’s earnings 
before tax, excluding revaluation movements.
Performance materiality was set at 75 per cent of the above 
materiality levels.
Materiality levels are unchanged from those applied in the previous year . 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all individual audit differences in excess of £100,000. 
We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, 
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our audit of the Group was scoped by obtaining an understanding 
of the Group and its environment, including the Group’s system of 
internal control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement 
at the Group level. Audit work to respond to the assessed risks 
was performed directly by the Group audit engagement team 
who performed full scope audit procedures on the Group’s two 
components, which included its joint ventures and associates. 
Our audit work at each of these components was executed at levels 
of materiality applicable to the relevant component, which in each 
instance was lower than Group materiality.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the 
Annual Report and Accounts, other than the financial statements 
and our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible 
for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit 
of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent 
material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there 
is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our 
responsibility to specifically address the following items in the 
other information and to report as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information where we conclude that 
those items meet the following conditions:
• fair , balanced and understandable set out on page 125 – the 
statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual 
Report and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit; or
• Audit Committee reporting set out on pages 98 to 103 – the 
section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code set out on pages 79 to 89 – the parts of the 
Directors’ statement relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions 
specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinion on other matters  
prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit the information given in the strategic report and directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and 
those reports have been prepared in accordance with applicable 
legal requirements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the 
parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report or the Directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 125, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities  
for the audit of the financial statements
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level 
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
We consider that the audit procedures we have undertaken in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) have provided us with reasonable 
assurance that irregularities, including fraud, would have been 
detected to the extent that they could have resulted in material 
misstatements in the financial statements. Our audit was not 
designed to identify misstatement or other irregularities that 
would not be considered to be material to the financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters which we are required to address
We were initially appointed by the Directors in April 2001 to audit 
the financial statements of the Company for the year ending 
30 April 2001. In respect of subsequent periods we have been 
reappointed annually by the members at the Annual General 
Meeting. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 17 years, 
covering the periods ending 30 April 2001 to 30 September 2017. 
However, for the purposes of the EU Mandatory Firm Rotation 
regulations, the period of total uninterrupted engagement is 
four years, covering the years ending 30 September 2014 to 
30 September 2017.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the parent company and we 
remain independent of the Group and the parent company in 
conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the 
Audit Committee.

137 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc
— NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  for the year ended 30 September 2017
1. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs and IFRIC 
interpretations) published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union (EU adopted IFRSs) 
and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their financial statements in accordance with IFRSs.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified for the revaluation of investment 
properties and other non-current investments. The Company has elected to prepare its individual financial statements, on pages 165 to 171, 
in accordance with FRS 102.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. The policies have been 
consistently applied to both years, unless otherwise stated.
Functional and presentation currency 
All financial information is presented in British Pounds Sterling (£), the functional currency of all Group entities, and has been rounded 
to the nearest thousand (£’000) unless indicated to the contrary.
Going concern
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to meet 
its liabilities as they fall due. At 30 September 2017 the Group has prepared cash flow projections that show that it is expected to have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Adoption of new and revised standards
There have been no new or revised accounting standards that have become effective during the year ended 30 September 2017 which 
have a material impact on the Group. 
New standards and interpretations not yet applied
The IASB has issued or amended the following standards that are mandatory for later accounting years, are relevant to the Group and have 
not been adopted early. These are:
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (effective date: 1 January 2018)
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (effective date: 1 January 2018)
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (effective date: 1 January 2019)
The Group is currently considering the impact of these standards on the financial position and performance of the Group, which will depend 
on projects undertaken at the time of initial application. However, an initial assessment has been undertaken of the impact should these 
standards have been adopted for the current period of account.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ will be effective for the Group from the period beginning 1 October 2018 and applies to the recognition, 
de-recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities as well as hedge accounting. Based on the 
current financial instruments held by the Group, it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s results, other than possible 
disclosure items. 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ will be effective for the Group from the period beginning 1 October 2018 and replaces 
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’. IFRS 15 establishes a five-step principle-based approach to revenue recognition 
including identifying the contract, the performance obligations within the contract and the point at which these are satisfied, determining 
the transaction price and allocating it to the performance obligations. The principal impact on the Group is likely to be in respect of 
determining the transaction price where the Group will be required to estimate any variable consideration to which it is entitled at the 
point that the performance conditions of the contract are satisfied. Under certain land sales contracts, the Group is entitled to a minimum 
payment, with an additional overage receivable dependent on the onward house prices achieved following the construction of houses on 
the land by the purchaser. Currently, under IAS 18, the Group recognises the contractual minimums at the point of sale with the overage 
recognised when revenue can be measured reliably. Under IFRS 15, these overage amounts would instead be recognised to the extent that 
it is highly probable that there will not be a significant reversal of the cumulative amounts recognised. Were IFRS 15 to be applied to the 
current year results and the overage amounts estimated accordingly, additional revenue of approximately £7 million would be recognised 
within the income statement, with a corresponding receivable included within the balance sheet, as well as an increase in share of profits 
from and the investments in joint ventures of approximately £3 million. This acceleration of profits would result in an additional deferred 
tax charge of £2 million based on the tax rates currently in effect. 138 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

1. Accounting policies continued
New standards and interpretations not yet applied continued
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ will be effective for the Group from the period beginning 1 October 2019, and will result in the Group recognising a financial 
asset and liability on the balance sheet initially at the present value of all future lease payments it is obliged to make for any material leases 
for which it is the lessee. These are disclosed in note 25. For the year ended 30 September 2017, it has been estimated that this would lead 
to the recognition on the balance sheet of assets and liabilities of approximately £2.1 million. There is no net impact on profit and loss over 
the lease term, but under IFRS 16 part of the payment currently recognised within administrative expenses (estimated at £0.1 million) would 
be recognised as a finance cost. The treatment of leases where the Group is acting as a lessor is substantially unchanged from that currently 
applied under IAS 17.
The above assessments are based on the assumption that the Group does not take advantage of any of the transitional provisions 
available within the new standards. The Group is currently considering the transitional provisions that are available but is yet to conclude 
whether or not it will elect to apply these. 
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all three of the following 
elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power 
to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of 
these elements of control.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Group as if it formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and 
balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
Business combinations 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the consolidated 
balance sheet, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date 
on which control is obtained.
Joint arrangements
The Group is party to joint arrangements where there are contractual arrangements that confer joint control over the relevant activities of 
the arrangements to the Group and at least one other party. Joint control is assessed under the same principles as control over subsidiaries.
All of the Group’s interests in joint arrangements constitute joint ventures, where the Group has rights to only a share of the net assets 
of the joint arrangements.
In the consolidated financial statements, interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereby the 
consolidated balance sheet incorporates the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint ventures. The consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income incorporates the Group’s share of the joint ventures’ profits after tax.
Where there is objective evidence that the investment in a joint venture has been impaired, the carrying amount of the investment is tested 
for impairment in the same way as other non-financial assets.
Associates
Where the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control over the financial and operating policy decisions of another entity, 
it is classified as an associate. Associates are initially recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at cost. The Group’s share of post-acquisition 
profits and losses is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except that losses in excess of the Group’s 
investment in the associate are not recognised unless there is an obligation to make good those losses.
Where the Group has a legal obligation to a third party in relation to the losses of an associate, the Group fully provides for its share 
and the charge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Investment properties
Investment properties are properties held for long-term rental income and/or for capital appreciation and are measured initially at cost, 
including related transaction costs, and subsequently at fair value. Changes in fair value of an investment property at the balance sheet 
date and its carrying amount prior to remeasurement are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Investment properties are recognised as an asset when:
• it is probable that future economic benefits that are associated with the investment property will flow to the Group;
• there are no material conditions present that could prevent completion; and
• the cost of the investment property can be measured reliably. 139 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc
F
1. Accounting policies continued
Investment properties continued
Additions to investment properties in the course of development or refurbishment include the cost of finance and directly attributable 
internal and external costs incurred during the period of development until the properties are ready for their intended use.
An investment property undergoing redevelopment or refurbishment for continued use as an investment property will remain as an 
investment property measured at fair value and is not reclassified. 
An investment property is classified as held for sale when it is available for immediate sale, management is committed to a plan to sell, 
an active programme to locate a buyer has been initiated and a sale is expected to occur within 12 months.
A transfer of a property from investment properties to trading properties will be made where there is a change in use such that the asset 
is to be developed or held with a view to sale. 
Trading properties 
Trading properties are inventory and are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable 
value is the expected net sales proceeds of the developed property in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs to completion 
and associated selling costs. A provision is made to the extent that projected costs exceed projected revenues.
All external and internal costs, including borrowing costs, directly associated with the purchase, promotion and construction of a trading 
property are capitalised up to the date that the property is ready for its intended use. Property acquisitions are recognised when legally 
binding contracts that are irrevocable and effectively unconditional are exchanged.
Properties reclassified to trading properties from investment properties are transferred at deemed cost, being the fair value at the date 
of reclassification.
Properties reclassified from trading properties to investment properties are transferred at cost when there is a change in use of the asset 
such that it is to be held for long-term rental income and or for capital appreciation.
Leases 
Where the Group is the lessor, the Directors have considered the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance 
with IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and in their judgement have determined that all such leases are operating leases. Rental income from operating 
leases is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Where the Group is the lessee, leases in which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are retained by another party are classified 
as operating leases. The Directors have determined that all of their lessee arrangements constitute operating leases. Rentals paid under 
operating leases are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or fair value at the date of transfer less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses. This includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on all plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value, based on prices 
prevailing at the reporting date, of each asset over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold property – shorter of expected period to redevelopment and 2 per cent straight line
Leasehold improvements – shorter of term of the lease and 10 per cent straight line
Furniture and equipment – 20–33 per cent straight line
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable, including the fair value of any residential properties received in part 
exchange, excluding VAT. The following recognition policies are applied:
Sale of property 
Revenue from the sale of trading and investment properties, including interests held through land promotion agreements, is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the Group’s interest have passed to the buyer, usually when legally binding contracts 
that are irrevocable and effectively unconditional are exchanged and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue from the sale of constructed residential property is typically recognised on completion of sale. 140 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

 for the year ended 30 September 2017 continued
1. Accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition continued
Rental and hotel income
Rental income arising from property is accounted for on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives, including rent 
free periods and payments to tenants, are allocated to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over 
the lease term as a deduction from rental income.
Hotel income includes revenues derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales. Revenue is 
recognised when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. 
Fees and other income
Fees from development management service arrangements and other agreements are determined by reference to the relevant agreement 
and recognised as the services are provided.
Taxation
Current tax
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items that are non-taxable or disallowed. It is calculated 
using rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Tax payable upon realisation of revaluation 
gains on investment property disposals that were recognised in prior periods is recorded as a current tax charge with a release of the 
associated deferred taxation.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the corresponding tax base cost used in computing taxable profit.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. It is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax 
is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the same tax authority.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. 
Under IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’, a deferred tax liability is recognised for tax potentially payable on the realisation of investment properties at 
fair values at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted. 
Share-based payments
The fair value of granting share awards under the Group’s performance share plan, and the other share-based remuneration of the 
Directors and other employees, is recognised through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The fair value of shares 
awarded is calculated by using an option pricing model. The resulting fair value is amortised through the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the vesting period. The charge is reversed if it is likely that any non-market-based 
vesting criteria will not be met. The charge is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition or where a non-vesting 
condition is not satisfied.
Employee Benefit Trust
The Group is deemed to have control of its Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) and it is therefore treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for 
the purposes of the consolidated accounts. The EBT’s investment in the parent company’s shares is deducted from equity in the consolidated 
balance sheet as if they were treasury shares. Other assets and liabilities of the EBT are recognised as assets and liabilities of the Group. 
Any shares held by the EBT are excluded for the purposes of calculating earnings per share and net assets per share.
Retirement benefits
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the 
period to which they relate. 141 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc
F
1. Accounting policies continued
Government grants
Government grants received in relation to property asset capital expenditure are generally deducted in arriving at the cost of the relevant 
asset. Where retention of a Government grant is dependent on the Group satisfying certain criteria, it is initially recognised in other loans. 
When the criteria for retention have been satisfied, the balance is netted against the cost of the asset.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when the 
dividends are approved by the Directors and paid. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding trading properties, investment properties and deferred tax)
Impairment tests on the Group’s property, plant and equipment and interests in joint ventures and associates are undertaken at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication becomes evident, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated and an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income whenever the carrying 
amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is determined 
as the net present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash in hand, deposits with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less from inception. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprises 
cash in hand and deposits with banks net of bank overdrafts.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost or their recoverable amount. Impairment 
provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default 
or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable. The amount 
of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated 
with the impaired receivable. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account 
with the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On confirmation 
that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans are initially recorded at fair value, net of any directly attributable issue costs, and subsequently recognised 
at amortised cost.
Borrowing costs
Finance and other costs incurred in respect of obtaining borrowings are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest 
method and amortised to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the term of the associated borrowings.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of investment and trading properties are added to the costs 
of such properties until the properties are ready for their intended use.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred. 142 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

1. Accounting policies continued
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements. 
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Estimates and judgements 
are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event 
or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgement that may impact on the Group’s earnings and financial position include:
Valuation of investment and trading properties
For the purposes of calculating the fair value of its investment property portfolio and the net realisable value (and, for EPRA reporting 
purposes, the fair value) of its trading property portfolio, the Group uses valuations carried out by either independent valuers or the 
Directors on the basis of market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors. The valuations are based upon assumptions including future rental income, sales prices, an estimate of typical profit margins, 
anticipated maintenance costs, future development costs and appropriate discount rates. Assumptions used in the valuations of the 
Group’s significant property interests carried at valuation at 30 September 2017 are disclosed in note 11. The valuers and Directors also 
make reference to market evidence for comparable property transactions and principal inputs and assumptions.
Due to the nature of development timescales, it is routinely necessary to estimate costs to complete and future revenues and to allocate 
non-unit specific development costs between units legally completing in the current financial year and in future periods. 
Distinction between investment properties and trading properties
Where there is a strategic decision taken to develop any element of an investment property for sale rather than hold for investment 
purposes, then that element is remeasured to fair value at the decision date and transferred to trading properties. Where there is a 
strategic decision taken to hold any element of a trading property for long-term capital growth or income, then that element is 
transferred to investment properties.
Capitalisation of administrative expenses
Administrative expenses are capitalised to investment and trading properties that are in the course of development. The amounts capitalised 
are estimated with reference to the time and resources spent on the projects in the year. These amounts are disclosed in notes 11 and 15 
for investments and trading properties respectively.
Trading income
Revenue in respect of certain strategic land parcels is determined with reference to the onward house prices achieved following the construction 
of houses on the land by the purchaser following their acquisition, subject to agreed minimums. Following completion of the parcel sale, once 
all substantive conditions have been satisfied, revenue is recognised at the minimum amounts receivable discounted to adjust for the 
timescale over which these are to be received. The additional variable element of the revenue is recognised at the point where the 
Directors consider that a reliable estimate can be made of the actual amount receivable.
Cost of trading property sales
The sale of parcels or units of strategic land requires an allocation of costs, including site-wide infrastructure, any construction costs 
directly attributable to individual land parcels and capitalised administrative expenses in order to account for cost of sales associated 
with the disposal. The costs being allocated include those incurred to date together with an allocation of costs remaining. 
Taxation
There are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, the Group recognises tax liabilities 
based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate 
for all open years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies 
on estimates and assumptions and may involve judgements about future events. The Directors have also exercised their judgement in relation 
to the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. In order to assess whether the Group should recognise a deferred tax asset 
or liability, the Directors consider the timing and likelihood of expected future profits along with how these expected future profits match 
up with the existing tax losses within specific Group entities.
Share-based payments
The value of share-based payments is estimated using an option pricing model as at the date of grant and using certain assumptions 
that are disclosed in note 24. 143 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc

9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on a profit of £6,811,000 (2016: £20,841,000) and on 143,300,624 (2016: 142,981,602) 
shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year less own shares held.
Diluted earnings per share
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on a profit of £6,811,000 (2016: £20,841,000) and on 144,244,702 (2016: 144,230,321) 
shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue and to be issued less own shares held and the dilutive impact of share 
options granted. 3,785,968 (2016: 1,939,129) of share options have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
because their exercise is contingent on the satisfaction of certain criteria that had not been met at 30 September. The total number of 
share options in issue is disclosed in note 24.

arising from investment properties that generated rental income amounted to £3,011,000 (2016: £2,140,000). The Group did not incur any 
direct operating expenses arising from investment properties that did not generate rental income (2016: £Nil).

(v) Historical cost and capitalisation
The historical cost of investment properties as at 30 September 2017 was £76,773,000 (2016: £91,699,000), which included capitalised 
interest of £10,705,000 (2016: £10,705,000). There was no interest capitalised during the current or prior years. During the year staff 
and administrative costs of £725,000 (2016: £1,478,000) have been capitalised and are included within additions. 150 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

11. Investment properties continued
(vi) Transfer of properties 
On 30 September 2017, based on the terms of the licensing arrangements being agreed or negotiated with housebuilders, the Group 
agreed that the strategy for the residential part of Alconbury Weald held within investment properties was to develop it for sale. 
Accordingly, on 30 September 2017 this element of the property was reclassified as a trading property.
On 30 September 2017, based on the site intention set out in the submitted development plan, the Group agreed that the strategy for 
part of its interest in Waterbeach, previously held wholly within trading stock, was to hold for long-term capital gain and rental income. 
Accordingly, 32 per cent of the asset value was transferred to investment properties.
(vii) Fair value measurement 
The Group’s principal investment property, Alconbury Weald, which represents 60 per cent of the year-end carrying value (2016: 73 per cent), 
is valued on a semi-annual basis by CBRE Limited (CBRE), an independent firm of chartered surveyors, on the basis of fair value. The valuation 
at each period end is carried out in accordance with guidance issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. At 30 September 2017, 
another investment property, which represents 16 per cent of the year-end carrying value, has also been valued by CBRE Limited, and 
further properties, representing 24 per cent of the year-end carrying value, have been valued by Directors, either with reference to 
post-balance-sheet sales price achieved or cost incurred to date.
Fair value represents the estimated amount that should be received for selling an investment property in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the valuation date.
As noted above, the Group’s investment properties are all carried at fair value and are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy 
as some of the inputs used in determining the fair value are based on unobservable market data. The following summarises the valuation 
technique used in measuring the fair value of Alconbury Weald, the Group’s principal investment property, as well as the significant 
unobservable inputs and their inter-relationship with the fair value measurement.
Valuation technique
Discounted cash flows: the valuation model for the Group’s strategic land considers the present value of net cash flows to be generated from a 
property (reflecting the current approach of constructing the infrastructure and discharging the section 106 cost obligations), taking into 
account expected land value growth rates, build cost inflation, absorption rates and general economic conditions. The expected net cash 
flows are discounted using risk-adjusted discount rates and the resultant value is benchmarked against transaction evidence.
Significant unobservable inputs
The key inputs to the investment property valuation, which following the transfer referred to above relate to commercial land at 
Alconbury Weald, included:
30 September 
2017
30 September 
2016
Expected land price inflation (per cent) 3.0 3.0
Expected annual cost price inflation (per cent) 2.0 2.0
Commercial land value (£’000 per acre) 345 300
Risk adjusted discount rate (per cent) 7.5 8.0
Inter-relationship between significant unobservable inputs and fair value measurement
The estimated fair value would increase/(decrease) if: 
• expected annual land price inflation was higher/(lower);
• expected annual cost price inflation was lower/(higher);
• commercial land value was higher/(lower); and
• risk-adjusted discount rate was lower/(higher).
The Group’s other material investment properties at Bradford and Feethams were valued by CBRE and the Directors respectively. 
Bradford was valued using a yield-based methodology with initial yields between 6.0 and 10.0 per cent whilst Feethams was valued with 
reference to the price achieved when the property was sold in November 2017. An increase in the initial yield assumptions would result 
in a decrease in the fair value of the Bradford property. 151 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc

At 30 September 2017, the Group had unused tax losses of £32,132,000 (2016: £47,764,000), of which £23,120,000 (2016: £28,309,000) 
have been recognised as a deferred tax asset. A further £5,373,000 (2016: £18,586,000) have been applied to reduce the Group’s deferred 
tax liability recognised at the balance sheet date as required by IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ in respect of tax potentially payable on the realisation 
of investment properties at fair value at the balance sheet date. No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of realised or unrealised 
capital losses if there is uncertainty over future recoverability.
Tax losses of £3,639,000 (2016: £869,000) have not been recognised as it is not considered sufficiently certain that there will be 
appropriate taxable profits available in the foreseeable future against which these losses can be utilised.
The Group’s deferred tax balances have been measured at rates between 17 and 19 per cent (2016: between 17 and 19 per cent), being the enacted 
rates of corporation tax in the UK at the balance sheet date against which the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax are expected 
to reverse. The UK corporation tax rate reduced to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017 and will reduce to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020, which will 
reduce the amount of UK corporation tax that the Group will have to pay in the future.

Other loans comprise borrowings from the HCA and a conditional grant. Interest on borrowing from the HCA is charged between 2.2 and 
2.5 per cent above the EC Reference Rate and the facilities are secured against specific land holdings. The £1,000,000 grant is conditional 
on certain milestones of construction being achieved before 2020. The grant is only repayable if these are not reached.
Bank loans, other than the revolving credit facility, are secured against specific property holdings.
As described in note 27, after the balance sheet date two of the bank loan facilities amounting to £31,200,000 were repaid following the 
sale of the assets on which those facilities were secured. 
19. Financial instruments
(a) Capital risk management
The Group’s primary objective with regards to capital management is to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
The Group’s capital comprises equity attributable to shareholders, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
Although the Group aims to ensure borrowings are secured against specific property assets without further recourse, banking covenants 
have previously placed, and are expected to place in the future, responsibilities on the Group to manage capital to ensure that assets are 
safeguarded and early debt repayments or other financial penalties are not forthcoming. 
The Group’s capital structure is managed through close monitoring of the Group’s business plan, which encompasses a review of dividend 
proposals and proposed repayments of shareholder capital as well as identifying any required asset realisations and share issues.
The Group has a progressive dividend policy that is aligned with the performance of the Group’s net asset value. 
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Details of the Group’s significant accounting policies, including the basis on which income and expenses are recognised through the 
income statement and the basis of measurement, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in note 1.
(b) Financial risk management
The Group’s principal financial instruments at 30 September 2017 comprise cash, short-term deposits and bank and other loans. 
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations at appropriate cost and risk levels.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade and other receivables, amounts recoverable under contracts and trade 
and other payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and 
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised opposite. The magnitude of the risk that has arisen over the 
year is detailed opposite. 157 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc

19. Financial instruments continued
(b) Financial risk management continued
(i) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates.
The Group holds cash balances on short-term deposit. The Group’s policy is to monitor the level of these balances to ensure that funds 
are available as required, recognising that interest earnings will be subject to interest rate fluctuations.
When necessary and considered appropriate, the Group borrows cash in the form of loans, which are usually subject to interest at floating 
rates. It is recognised that rates will fluctuate according to changes in LIBOR and the bank base or EC reference rate. The Group is cognisant 
at all times of movements in interest rates and will, as appropriate, enter into interest rate swaps to maintain a balance between borrowings 
that are subject to floating and fixed rates. However, at 30 September 2017 (and 2016), the Group had no interest rate swaps in place and 
therefore exposure to interest rate risk in respect of its financial liabilities relates to the cost of servicing its floating rate borrowings.

(ii) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash, trade and other receivables, amounts recoverable under contracts and loans advanced 
to joint venture and associates.
Cash deposits are placed with a range of banks to minimise the risk to the Group. Details are provided in the table set out below of the 
relevant financial institutions pooled by their respective Standard and Poor long-term credit ratings or Fitch long-term credit ratings 
where Standard and Poor ratings are unavailable. All ratings are of investment grade and therefore the Directors are comfortable with 
the credit ratings of the financial institutions.
The principal credit risk is therefore deemed to arise from trade and other receivables and loans advanced to joint ventures and associates. 
Trade receivables from the sale of properties are secured against those properties until the proceeds are received. Rental receivables are 
unsecured but there is no significant concentration of credit risk as no tenant accounts for more than 5 per cent of total revenue. Credit 
checks, rental deposits and third party guarantees are used in isolation or in combination to mitigate against potential financial loss arising 
from defaults where considered necessary. Other receivables are predominantly due from local authorities, which are not considered to 
have a high credit risk. The Group’s joint ventures and associates are structured, with the assistance of professional advisers, in a way that 
provides the Group with maximum flexibility and security. Furthermore, robust controls and procedures are applied to these interests in a 
manner that is consistent with other Group operations.
Credit ratings of the financial institutions holding the Group’s cash deposits as at 30 September 2017 are shown below. Included in cash is 
£4,924,000 that is restricted (2016: £3,170,000).

Cash flow and funding needs are regularly monitored.

24. Share-based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based payment scheme for all Executive Directors and certain employees.
Options are granted over the Company’s shares that are capable of vesting on the third anniversary of issue dependent on certain performance 
conditions having been met. In the year ended 30 September 2017, options over 1,831,953 shares (30 September 2016: 1,133,924 shares) were 
awarded to Directors and other participating staff. The performance conditions attached to these awards are as follows:
• EPRA net asset value must increase by greater than 3 per cent per annum more than RPI for 25 per cent vesting and must increase 
by greater than 12.5 per cent per annum more than RPI for 100 per cent vesting. Shares will vest on a pro-rated, straight line basis for 
outperformance between 3 per cent per annum and 12.5 per cent per annum; and
• total shareholder return must be equal to the movement in the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index for 25 per cent vesting and must fall within 
the upper quartile of relative performance of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index for 100 per cent vesting. Shares will vest on a pro-rated, 
straight line basis for outperformance between the medium and upper quartile.
Awards will lapse if not vested at the end of the vesting period.
The performance conditions for the awards granted in the period run from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2019.
At 30 September 2016 there were 19,471 vested share awards outstanding that were acquired as part of the business combination in May 2014 
and had a weighted average exercise price of 20.0p. During the year 9,126 of these awards were exercised and at 30 September 2017, 10,345 
options remain vested but not exercised.

The fair value of the awards in the year ended 30 September 2017 was calculated by using an option pricing model involving six variables: 
share price, exercise price, expected term, expected dividend yield, expected volatility and risk free interest rate. The values assigned to 
those variables were: 215.00p grant date share price, 0.00p exercise price, expected term of three years, 1.35 per cent expected dividend 
yield, 24.03 per cent expected volatility and 0.23 per cent expected risk free interest rate. 163 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc

24. Share-based payments continued
The fair value of the awards in the year ended 30 September 2016 was calculated by using an option pricing model involving six variables: 
share price, exercise price, expected term, expected dividend yield, expected volatility and risk free interest rate. The values assigned to 
those variables were: 241.00p grant date share price, 0.00p exercise price, expected term of three years, 1.14 per cent expected dividend 
yield, 20.68 per cent expected volatility and 0.44 per cent expected risk free interest rate.
For each valuation, the expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility over a period of time commensurate 
with the remainder of the performance period immediately prior to the date of grant. 
This value is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period. The charge to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the year was £3,119,000 (2016: £2,368,000).
The weighted average share price on the date of the awards exercised in the year was 193.0p (2016: 243.0p).

167 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 — Urban&Civic plc
— NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  for the year ended 30 September 2017
1. Accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared under FRS 102 and the historical cost convention and in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company has taken the following exemptions as permitted by FRS 102:
• no cash flow statement is presented. A consolidated cash flow statement is presented on page 136 of the Group financial statements;
• certain financial instruments disclosure as equivalent disclosure has been provided in respect of the Group as a whole; and
• related party transactions with wholly owned members of the Group.
Rental income 
Where the Company is the lessee, leases in which substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are retained by another party are 
classified as operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over 
the term of the lease.
Share-based payments 
The fair value of granting share awards under the performance share plan and the other share-based remuneration of the Directors 
and other employees is recognised through the profit and loss account. The fair value of shares awarded is calculated by using an option 
pricing model. The resulting fair value is amortised through the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the vesting period. 
The charge is reversed if it is likely that any non-market-based criteria will not be met. The charge is not adjusted for failure to achieve 
a market vesting condition or where a non-vesting condition is not satisfied.
Where the Company grants rights in its equity directly to an employee of a subsidiary, the transaction is accounted for as an equity-settled 
transaction. In the financial statements of the Company, the grant of rights is recognised as a capital contribution made to the subsidiary.
Employee Benefit Trust
The Company is deemed to have control of its Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) and it is therefore treated as a subsidiary and is consolidated 
in the Company’s accounts. The EBT’s investment in the parent company’s shares is deducted from equity in the Company balance sheet 
as if they were treasury shares. Other assets and liabilities of the EBT are recognised as assets and liabilities of the Company.
Investments 
The investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in the Company’s balance sheet at cost less provision for impairment. 
Where the Company has a legal obligation to a third party in relation to the losses of an associate, the Company fully provides for its share 
and the charge is recognised in the profit and loss account of the Company.
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when the 
dividends are approved by the Directors and paid. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other debtors 
Trade and other debtors are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost or their recoverable amount. Impairment 
provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty or default 
or significant delay in payment) that the Company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms receivable. The amount 
of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated 
with the impaired receivable. For trade debtors, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with 
the loss being recognised within administrative expenses. On confirmation that the trade debtor will not be collectable the gross carrying 
value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities including trade creditors, other creditors, accruals and amounts due to Group undertakings are originally recorded 
at fair value and subsequently stated at amortised cost under the effective interest method. 168 Urban&Civic plc — Annual Report and Accounts 2017

  for the year ended 30 September 2017 continued
2. Directors’ and auditor’s remuneration 
Directors’ remuneration is disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 104 to 120. Details of the remuneration paid to the 
Company’s auditor, BDO LLP, for audit and non-audit services provided are given in note 3 to the Group financial statements on page 143.
There are no employees other than the Directors who are remunerated by a fellow group company. The Directors are considered to be the 
Company’s key management personnel.

The Company’s merger reserve represents the excess over the nominal value of shares issued to acquire shares in a subsidiary 
undertaking when the conditions to qualify for merger relief have not been met. 
The Company’s share scheme reserve represents the cumulative amount of share-based payment awards made to employees of 
subsidiary undertakings.
A description of the nature and purpose of the Company’s other reserves is provided in note 21 to the Group financial statements. 
The balance in the Company retained earnings reserve is distributable.
8. Share-based payments
The Company operates an equity-settled share-based payment scheme for all Executive Directors and certain employees of the Group. 
Details of the options granted under the scheme and the options outstanding at the balance sheet date are given in note 24 to the Group 
financial statements. On the basis that all awards made relate to employees of subsidiaries, this value is recognised as a capital contribution 
to those subsidiaries over the vesting period and is added to the cost of the relevant investment. The total capital contribution for the year 
was £3,119,000 (2016: £2,321,000).
Employee Benefit Trust
The Company established the Urban&Civic plc Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Trust’) to be used as part of the remuneration arrangements 
for employees. The purpose of the Trust is to facilitate the ownership of shares by or for the benefit of employees by the acquisition and 
distribution of shares in the Company. The Trust purchases shares in the Company to satisfy the Company’s obligations under its share-based 
payment plans. Transactions in the Company’s own shares in the year are given in note 24 to the Group financial statements.

Dividend Re-Investment Scheme (DRIS)
A Scrip Dividend Scheme (SCRIP) is available through which 
eligible shareholders may invest the whole of their cash dividends 
in additional shares in Urban&Civic plc at the time the dividends 
are paid. Copies of the SCRIP terms and conditions are available 
from the Company’s registrars, Share Registrars Limited (email: 
enquiries@shareregistrars.uk.com or phone: 01252 821 390), or may be 
downloaded from the Company’s website at www.urbanandcivic.com.
Shareholder fraud
Over the last year, a number of shareholders have received 
unsolicited approaches for their shares from parties suggesting 
they are linked with potential offerors. The Company believes that 
these are not bona fide offers for shares and shareholders should 
be aware that these unsolicited share purchase requests are viewed 
as suspicious by the Company.
Shareholders are advised to be wary of such calls. If you receive any 
unsolicited investment advice:
• Always ensure the firm is on the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) Register and is allowed to give financial advice before 
handing over your money. You can check at www.fca.org.uk.
• Double-check the caller is from the firm they say they are – ask 
for their name and telephone number and say you will call them 
back. Do not get into a conversation, note down the name of the 
person and firm contacting you and then end the call.
• Check their identity by calling the firm using the contact 
number listed on the FCA Register. If there are no contact 
details on the FCA Register or you are told that they are out of 
date, or if you have any other doubts, call the FCA Consumer 
Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
• Check the FCA’s list of known unauthorised overseas firms at 
www.fca.org.uk. However, these firms change names regularly, 
so even if a firm is not listed, it does not mean they are legitimate. 
Always check that they are listed on the FCA Register.
• Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm 
you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
• Think about getting independent professional advice before you 
hand over any money. Urban&Civic plc’s commitment to environmental issues is reflected in this 
Annual Report which has been printed on Acroprint, an FSC® certified material. 
This document was printed by Pureprint Group using their environmental 
print technology, which minimises the impact of printing on the environment. 
Vegetable based inks have been used and 99 per cent of dry waste is diverted 
from landfill. The printer is a CarbonNeutral® company.
Both the printer and the paper mill are registered to ISO 14001.
