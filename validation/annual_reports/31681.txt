Adult Learning Disabilities 
CareTech has always operated at the highest 
acuity range on the social care spectrum, providing 
individual tailor made solutions for people living in 
their own homes, residential care or independent 
supported living schemes. We believe that we 
should continue supporting those with the greatest 
need and this accords with local authority 
commissioning trends.
Adults with learning disabilities are increasingly 
being provided with direct funding to enable them 
to purchase their own care and support. We work 
actively with service users and advisory bodies to 
deliver self-directed support packages and see this 
as an increasingly important aspect of our service 
model, as well as offering commercial opportunity.
For many people with the most complex 
intellectual or physical challenges, residential 
care will continue to be the preferred option 
although the services will change in their 
approach as we move toward a more enabling, 
modern type of service. An alternative to 
residential care is the opportunity for people 
to live in a home of their own, sometimes shared 
with others. CareTech is a leader in the provision 
of supported living and offers packages of 
individualised self-directed support to people 
in their own homes.

outreach
The segmental figures of the Specialist Services division 
for 2016 have been restated due to the inclusion of “ABI” 
(Acquired Brain Injury). This is the first full year of Oakleaf 
Care Limited’s results and it was decided this change 
would give the shareholders greater clarity. 
Specialist Services 
Specialist services provision continues to dominate 
the health and social care agenda. Good specialist 
services is a significant contributor to a healthy 
community and national economy, while mental 
ill health is devastating to individuals and their 
families. Most commissioners are driven by a wish 
to reduce patient time in acute care and rely on 
creative outsourcing to dramatically cut the cost 
of specialist services care in hospital and within 
the criminal justice system.
CareTech’s specialist services team works 
in partnership with the NHS and social service 
departments to ensure a successful transition 
out of acute care and the prison service, delivering 
pathways to an ordinary life. 
We also have an outstanding track record 
for diverting people away from acute care and 
supporting them in their own homes. CareTech’s 
highly effective care teams are developing new 
ways to offer community support solutions and 
we believe that this will be an important growth 
platform in years to come.
For men with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) we 
provide a range of pathways from rehabilitation 
through to long-term and end of life care. 
CareTech offers highly specialised rehabilitation 
beds as well as a step down provision of 
community-based beds.

Foster Care is undoubtedly the best care solution 
for most “looked after” children. Most children 
thrive in foster care where they are supported 
within an ordinary family home and with trained 
foster carers. CareTech provides for both 
mainstream and specialist foster care through 
local agencies across the UK. Unusually we 
offer a highly respected service for physically 
and intellectually disabled children as well as 
support for children with sensory impairments. 
We provide foster care family assessments and

their birth families and in their family home.

Young People Residential Services
For a relatively small number of children, residential 
care offers a safe and helpful solution for their care 
needs and CareTech has developed an extensive 
range of highly technical care and education 
environments where those children will thrive.
Our residential provision offers high staff ratios 
and highly skilled carers, capable of ensuring both 
safety and progression. These are high cost services 
where we aim for an intensive period of care and 
a strict timetable that delivers results at a fair price 
to commissioners. As far as practicable we aim 
to help these children through our therapeutic 
care move into a more normalised family style 
environment as soon as it is wise to do so.
These services are highly intensive operations 
with exceptional staff ratios and include on site 
or dedicated educational facilities.

EQL Solutions and Dawn Hodge Associates
Since modern apprenticeships started several years 
ago we have witnessed a dramatic shift in the way 
young people enter the adult workforce. People 
are increasingly opting for an apprenticeship as 
an alternative to or as well as attending University. 
This was especially true of the Care Sector but a 
whole new generation of young people are now 
looking at the apprenticeship model as their 
further training of choice.
Through acquisition and the development of 
established apprenticeship providers CareTech 
has embraced the opportunity to capitalise on 
this change and to work closely with government 
agencies to improve the quality and skill base of 
our national workforce. We have chosen to call our 
apprenticeship scheme a Learning Service to reflect 
the aspiration of the young people we work with.
Although Learning Services provide training across 
the whole workforce we have naturally developed 
expertise within the very extensive social care sector.
Learning services addresses an adult social care 
workforce in England of some 1.16m people, 
905,000 of whom work within the independent 
sector (Skills for Care 2013).
There are 17,300 organisations providing 
Adult Social Care in England and the majority 
of these are operating at far too low a scale 
to deliver their own training or apprenticeship 
programmes. EQL Solutions and Dawn Hodge 
Associates, which received an “Outstanding” 
from Ofsted earlier this year, have significant 
market presence in social care and are well 
positioned to support both smaller companies 
as well as corporate providers.
The introduction of the apprenticeship levy 
has caused a declined in companies offering 
apprenticeships. However, the Government has 
a target of 3 million apprenticeships by 2020 and 
so far in the 2016/17 academic year the number 
of people signing up for apprenticeships was 
491,300. (Sourced from Gov.UK).
Caring every day
Since the CareTech Group came to the 
AIM market over 12 years ago, it has evolved 
through a mix of organic and prudent 
acquisitive growth that has led to our current 
position as one of the best-established and 
reputable national social care providers. 
We have national coverage across England, 
Wales and Scotland in a highly fragmented UK 
social care market. We cover the majority of 
the social care spectrum except elderly care.
The total market value is estimated (Laing and 
Buisson 2017) to be worth £7bn for children 
services and £5bn for the care of younger 
adults (below 65 years of age) in the learning 
disability and specialist services categories. 
The private sector share of this market has 
developed through successful outsourcing of 
services over the last 20 years and this trend is 
expected to continue. Local Authorities have 
largely protected their budgets for children 
and complex younger adults.

CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3 Quality and expertise
Quality is not simply compliance with the requirements of 
regulation, although that remains important. Our approach is 
to employ well qualified and skilled professionals who can ensure 
that we consistently exceed the expectation of our service users, 
their families, social workers and commissioners.
Placing people in the care of organisations that you can trust
The business of care is predicated on relationships, as much as 
it is on the practical support and guidance that we offer on a daily 
basis. Troubled children need the warmth and challenging support 
of their care workers while disabled adults make best progress 
within the trust that a great relationship brings. 
We are also mindful that social workers will prefer to place 
people in the care of organisations that share their commitment 
to optimism for service users, that they can rely on and deliver 
outstanding value.

CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 5 We fundamentally believe in choice for all our clients and 
our determination to provide this choice in all our services 
is uppermost in our commercial thinking.
Client focused innovative care pathway approach
Care and support is characterised by optimism and a genuine 
belief in the abilities of our service users. Everyone we support 
has an opportunity to make progress in their lives and our 
professional teams work hard to help those people understand 
how to move forward. Many years ago we began to describe our 
services as a Care Pathway, making clear our intention to break 
away from the old belief that care is for life. We have delivered on 
this commitment and everyone we support, from young children 
to profoundly disabled adults, shares our approach to maximise 
their independence. This is great for service users, rewarding for 
our staff and strongly supported by those who commission 
and sponsor our services.
Innovate care pathways
One of the characteristics that differentiates CareTech from the 
average provider is our commitment to opportunity. Long before 
it became fashionable we introduced the concept of a Care 
Pathway to reflect our optimism that users of our services can 
make progress in their lives. We were never content to accept that 
someone in residential care should always be in residential care 
and developed alternatives at an early stage in our development 
as a Group.

Chairman
Set out below is a summary of our financial 
results where:
 – Revenue has increased by 11.4% to £166.0m
 – Underlying EBITDA has increased by 7.5% 
to £39.9m
 – Underlying PBT has increased by 12.6% 
to £29.4m
 – Underlying basic EPS remained at 38.03p
 – Net Assets increased by 34.6% to £204.2m 
(2016: £151.7m)
 – Cash inflows from operating activities 
reduced by 4.4% to £32.7m
 – Full year dividend increased by 7.0% to 9.90p 
All of the above mentioned initiatives 
demonstrate a solid performance on delivery 
of both the key financial and non-financial 
metrics and put the Group in a strong 
position to target further underlying EPS 
growth going forward.
The Group has stood out from its peers as 
a company that can successfully combine 
quality, integrity and sound financial acumen 
and has consistently achieved good care 
quality ratings. Our credibility as the provider 
of choice has never been stronger and we 
continue our successful growth strategy with 
a confident outlook.
On 23 March 2017 the Company announced 
an oversubscribed placing which raised 
£37.4m (net of expenses) through the issue 
of 11,000,000 new ordinary shares. I am 
extremely grateful for the support from our 
existing shareholders and take the opportunity 
to also welcome new shareholders. A number 
of organic growth projects and potential 
bolt-on acquisitions had been identified 
prior to the placing.
In June 2017 the Company announced 
the acquisition of Selborne Care Limited 
for a total consideration of £16.6m in cash. 
Selborne Care is a high quality provider of 
specialist residential care, supported living 
and day care services for adults with learning 
disabilities and challenging behaviours. It has 
57 residential beds in eight freehold sites and 
supported living services are provided to 
30 service users.
I am pleased to present our results for the year ended 
30 September 2017. 
This has been another successful and 
exceptionally busy year, with the key 
highlights being:
 – Share placement raised £37.4m for 
acquisitions (net of expenses)
 – Accelerated organic initiatives including 
property purchases and reconfigurations
 – Completion of the acquisition of Selborne 
Care during the year which added to our 
geographic and Adults Service offering
 – Further strengthening of our management 
team and investment in IT systems
 – Benefit from the improved terms of the 
banking facilities
 – Established the CareTech Charitable 
Foundation and its registration with the 
Charity Commission
It is really pleasing to note that we have 
continued to maintain our position as a 
leading care provider with our improved 
quality ratings across the Group. Moreover, 
we have extended our care pathways through 
successful outcomes for the people we 
support. As a result we have improved our 
capacity during the year which has led to 
an increase in all key financial KPIs and our 
underlying EBITDA.
10 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman’s Statement
A successful 2017  
 creating a platform  
 for further expansion In addition, the Group has purchased a 
number of properties including Beacon Reach, 
a Children’s Residential and Education facility 
near Preston for £4m, which is a substantial 
Education and Residential facility for ROC NW 
who recently won the Laing and Buisson 
Award in Social Care for Children’s Services.
The Group continue to look at a number 
of other acquisition opportunities and are 
confident that the remainder of the share 
placement proceeds will be deployed in 
a timely manner on earnings enhancing 
businesses or projects.
During 2017, we again closed several services 
for reconfiguration which impacted the 
growth in revenue. Offsetting this, there are 
better fees following reconfiguration plus the 
impact of cost saving initiatives and the time 
and attendance system has further improved 
underlying EBITDA. The Group’s organic 
development programme will continue with 
further reconfigurations and, for 2018 we 
have a strong pipeline of development 
opportunities with two property purchases 
registered soon after the year end.
On 28 March 2017, 344,305 new ordinary 
shares were issued as part of the arrangements 
for full and final settlement of the earn-out 
agreed with the vendors of ROC North West 
which was acquired in 2015.
In the 12 years since joining AIM, the business 
has transformed from being very focused on 
supporting adults with a learning disability 
through residential and day care settings to 
one where today we cater for young people 
and children with complex needs across a 
range of settings, be it residential, supported 
living or community support. We focus on the 
most complex and vulnerable young people 
and the market for this client group stands at 
over £10bn. There is currently an undersupply 
of specialist beds in this niche area and the 
market is growing by almost 3% per annum. 
Over the years we have developed a range 
of care pathways and helped many that we 
support to live more independently. This is 
a fantastic outcome for both us and the 
individuals that we support and it also helps 
local authorities meet the ever increasing 
cost of social care provision.
Even with the significant growth we have 
achieved to date we still have less than 2% 
of this very large and fragmented market. 
With the increasing regulatory burden, 
the opportunity for further consolidation 
is even more attractive. 
Dividend
The Group policy has been to increase the 
total dividend per year broadly in line with 
the movement in underlying diluted earnings 
per share.
In 2017 there was a slight reduction in 
underlying diluted earnings per share of 
(0.01p) mainly due to the share placement 
in March 2017. The Board has proposed a 
final dividend of 6.60p (2016: 6.25p) per share 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 
9.90p (2016: 9.25p) per share. This represents 
a full year increase of 7.0% year on year. 
The final dividend will be paid, subject to 
shareholder approval, on 8 May 2018, with 
an ex-dividend date of 8 March 2018 and 
an associated record date of 9 March 2018.
Our Board
There have been no changes to the Board 
during the year. Providing the foundation for 
further growth, the Senior Executive Team at 
CareTech has been further strengthened by a 
number of senior appointments during the year.
During the year the Remuneration Committee, 
the Audit Committee and the Care Governance 
and Safeguarding Committee were unchanged.
Our people
We have completed our planned evolution 
into two well defined operating divisions, 
Children Services and Adult Services, and 
this has generated organisational efficiencies. 
Simplifying the structure has also supported 
planning and service delivery with a more 
powerful approach to development.
Our continuing growth, measurable success 
and forward-looking approach are a reflection 
of the hard work and dedication of staff and 
managers throughout the organisation. I am 
always drawn to the achievements of our 
excellent front line staff, which is inevitable as 
we are first and foremost a care organisation. 
Their care and commitment would be much 
less without the dedicated support of our 
administrators and support teams whose hard 
work and energy is critical to the success of 
our Company and the care we provide.
In March 2016, the Company announced the 
creation of the CareTech Sharesave Scheme, 
a Government supported method for any of 
our staff to have the opportunity to participate 
in the Company’s equity. In October 2017, 
we announced a second CareTech Sharesave 
Scheme and 259 members of staff chose to 
join this new saving scheme. We plan to 
introduce another CareTech Sharesave 
Scheme in 2018 as this is one part of our 
staff retention strategy.
With the launch of the CareTech Charitable 
Foundation in May 2017 I am pleased that 
we will be able to support members of the 
CareTech family even more. The Foundation 
has ambitious and clear sighted objectives 
to deliver meaningful impact to communities 
in the UK and overseas about which the 
staff of the Group and its service users feel 
proud and strongly-engaged, providing a 
unique contribution to the charitable 
marketplace consistent with the Group’s 
values and approach.
Outlook and prospects
We operate in a growing social care market 
worth over £10 billion per annum and we 
are well positioned to meet market demand. 
We have developed outcome-based care 
pathways which deliver value-based services 
for our Local Authority partners.
With the money raised from shareholders, 
solid free cash flow generated from the 
business plus access to bank funding, we 
have major investment plans for 2018 and 
beyond with key new organic developments 
and bolt-on acquisitions. Importantly, we 
have also, and continue to, further strengthen 
our management team, offering a forceful 
blend of experience, commercial wisdom and 
dedication to care. I have no doubt that the 
next few years will see continuing growth and 
care excellence which will help deliver our 
target of double digit growth in underlying EPS.

Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 11 The Directors present their Strategic Report on the Group for 
the year ended 30 September 2017. In preparing this report, the 
Directors have complied with S414C of the Companies Act 2006. 
The Strategic Report should be read in conjunction with the 
Strategic Review for the Group which includes the Highlights, 
Group at a glance, Chairman’s Statement, Strategic Report, 
the Chief Executive’s Statement and Performance Review 
and Financial Review. 
Our market
The care market in which the Group operates 
is a UK market worth an estimated £10bn per 
annum across the Adult Services for adults 
over the age of 18 and Children Services for 
children and young people up to the age of 18. 
The principal driver for commissioners 
in local authorities and the NHS is value. 
This is interpreted by them as the optimum 
balance between quality and price, but has 
an underpinning criterion determined by 
“outcomes”. CareTech has been aligned 
to this set of purchasing principals and we 
work closely with commissioners to ensure 
that we stay in tune with their approach 
to market management.
Most providers of social care have fewer 
than three services and this huge, fragmented 
range of providers dominates the market. 
However, the market has been steadily 
consolidating and a very small number 
of large “corporate” providers have emerged, 
with CareTech being one of the bigger 
players within the non-elderly care sector. 
Numerically the large providers will have 
a very small minority of the market capacity 
and all the evidence suggests that 
consolidation will continue, perhaps 
accelerate, during the foreseeable future.
Although the available resources to purchase 
social care remain largely static there is a 
known increase in demand across the whole 
spectrum, presenting purchasing bodies with 
a conundrum. One response has been to 
move money away from the NHS in order 
to allow local authorities greater purchasing 
power. However, the most significant change 
has been to a system of aggressive rationing. 
This has focused money on the areas of 
highest need such as complex children, very 
disabled or complex people with learning 
difficulties and hospital discharge schemes. 
This is where CareTech has developed its 
provision and helps to explain why spending 
cuts have had minimal impact on the Group.

CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 13 Our Business Model
Our Business Model represents how we 
aim to generate revenue and profit from 
our operations.
The Group aims to operate throughout 
mainland Britain in England, Wales and 
Scotland in partnership with local authorities 
and the NHS, facilitating the outsourcing 
process, driving value and removing risk.
During the period, the Group continued 
to develop and grow organically four 
existing operating divisions, which come 
under the two outcome-based sectors 
of Adult Services and Children Services. 
These four operating divisions are supported 
by the Learning Services Division. The growth 
going forward is underpinned by the strong 
starting position that we have built carefully 
over the past few years. We continue to 
extend both our geographic coverage and 
our outcome-based Care Pathway range 
of services organically and through the 
purchase and sale of properties to meet 
the needs of our marketplace, specifically 
the requirement for greater acuity service 
provision. This ensures that CareTech is 
in a very strong position to address the 
demands of our evolving marketplace.

support our people who provide care
Skilled staff to provide the management and 
training to our people who provide care.
Buildings, homes and land
The land and buildings to provide 
accommodation for residential services 
or supported living.
Financial resources

Setting out our key strategic priorities
We shall continue to improve the quality 
and scope of our services, increase market

Strategic Report continued
A strategy  
 t o d r i v e  
 f u t ur e gro w t h Our strategy
Our understanding of the social care market 
and our relationships with local authority 
commissioners is vital to our strategy. 
We are sensitive to the complex financial 
position that local authorities are in and their 
need to have trusted business partners who 
can help them deliver statutory duties 
efficiently and with care.
Social care expertise
Employing numerous qualified and skilled 
care workers, foster carers, teachers and 
managers, the CareTech front line teams 
are supported by a wide range of high level 
professionals such as social workers, nurses, 
therapists, psychologists and a skilled Medical 
Director with oversight of all interventions.
High quality
The driver for social care is an organisation’s 
ability to deliver high quality care, with 
reliable outcomes at a fair price. We believe 
that the market has recognised that CareTech 
offers the best possible balance between 
quality and value and understands the need 
for progressive thinking and innovation to 
deliver ongoing results.
Nationwide locations
The CareTech strategy is to offer a strong 
national presence with local brands and 
regional service delivery points. This supports 
development of local relationships while 
offering the comfort and security of a well 
resourced and strong Group. 
Excellent reputation
The CareTech brand is strong and our 
extensive relationships across the UK are 
robust. This is reinforced by our presence 
at major industry events where we have 
been reliable sponsors and commentators. 
The most effective way that we sustain our 
reputation is by delivering what we promise 
for the people we support and by treating 
our staff well.
High occupancy
CareTech services are in demand and 
occupancy has remained high despite fears 
of local authority austerity impacting referrals. 
What’s more, the nature of referrals in recent 
years has been toward the more complex 
end of the spectrum.
Continued growth
It is well known that demographic trends 
show growth in social care in the 
foreseeable future.
Shareholder value
CareTech has delivered sustainable 
and reliable growth since the day it listed. 
It has aimed to be a defensible stock even 
in difficult times and for some time has 
offered a good quality dividend policy. 
We have every reason to believe that 
growth will continue and the management 
team remains enthusiastic about the 
Group’s future.

CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 15 Underlying EBITDA
 £39.9m
(2016: £37.1m)
How this is calculated
Underlying EBITDA is the Earnings before Interest, 
Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation for the year excluding 
non-underlying items such as amortisation of intangible assets 
which are fully described in note 5 to the Financial Statements.
Performance this year
The underlying EBITDA has improved by £2.8m or 7.5% year 
on year. This reflects the organic growth achieved by the core 
business which has been in part reduced by the reconfiguration 
work on some properties, improved margins and acquisitions.
Underlying profit after tax
 £26.6m
(2016: £24.0m)
How this is calculated
Underlying is the Group’s profit after provision for taxation 
excluding non-underlying items such as amortisation of 
intangible assets after tax which are fully described in 
note 5 to the Financial Statements.
Performance this year
The underlying profit after tax has improved by £2.6m 10.8% year 
on year. This reflects the improved underlying EBITDA and lower 
finance charges offset by an increased tax provision.
Underlying basic EPS
 3 8 . 03p
(2016: 38.03p)
How this is calculated
Underlying basic earnings per share is the profit after tax divided 
by the weighted number of ordinary shares which are fully 
described in notes 10 and 11 to the Financial Statements.
Performance this year
The underlying based earnings per share has remained at 38.03p.

 i nd i c a t o rs Net Debt
 £147.1m
(2016: £156.4m)
How this is calculated
Net Debt is defined in the Group’s banking facilities and 
comprises the balance at the year-end for cash and cash 
equivalents net of bank loans outstanding and finance lease 
and hire purchase contract monies outstanding to the Group’s 
bankers. It does not include the finance lease obligations as 
calculated under IAS 17 arising from the ground rent transaction 
which is not owed to the Group’s bankers. 
Performance this year
Bank debt at 30 September 2017 was £147.1m which is a 
reduction of £9.3m from 30 September 2016 of £156.4m. 
Finance leases with the Group’s bankers at the year-end were 
£6.0m (2016 £6.6m) with the decrease due principally to the 
lease repayments net of the new investment in 53 new home 
vehicles during the year, which take our fleet to 515 vehicles. 
Net Debt in total reduced by £9.3m or 5.9% between 
30 September 2016 and 30 September 2017.
Capacity
 2, 53 4 
 pl a c e s
(2016: 2,319 places)
How this is calculated
The Group’s capacity is the total number of Adult Service and 
Children Service places that the Group is able to offer at that 
date. It is a total including residential care beds, independent 
supported living accommodation, community support service 
users and children that foster carers can currently look after.
Performance this year
Overall capacity has increased by 215 which is 9.3% increase. 
ROC Northwest and Spark of Genius have increased their 
capacity in the year to provide education to 46 more children 
but this is not included in the overall capacity, in total the Group 
is able to provide education to 312 Young People.
Mature Estate Occupancy
 93%
(2016: 93%)
How this is calculated
The Mature Estate Occupancy is the total number of Adult 
and Children Service Users placed in services that were open 
throughout the year.
Performance this year
The ratio has remained unchanged at 93% and reflects 
the long length of stay that the majority of service users 
have in our services.
Blended occupancy
 86%
(2016: 86%)
How this is calculated
Blended occupancy is the total number of Adult and Children 
Service Users actually placed as a percentage of the Group’s 
total capacity and so reflects facilities undergoing development 
and reconfiguration.
Performance this year
The ratio has remained at 86% and reflects the additional beds 
in reconfigured services brought back into capacity and the 
reduction in those withdrawn for reconfiguration plus new 
beds coming into service.

Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 17 The most obvious risk is that a tragedy will 
occur and that the Company will be held 
to blame. To date this has not occurred but 
we take the risk very seriously. Our principal 
risk management strategy is to ensure that 
our staff are recruited well, are trained and 
supervised properly and are subject to 
rigorous quality oversight. In addition, 
we know from experience that processes 
and documentation must be very carefully 
observed and constantly reviewed to ensure 
that it protects service users and provides 
the Company with a defendable position 
in the case of tragedy.
These matters, along with general 
safeguarding, are subject to intense scrutiny 
by our in house compliance and quality 
teams and Board level oversight.
Managing risk and mitigating risk
Social care is not a high risk business 
proposition but there are several unique 
factors that could cause difficulties. These 
centre on the way in which care and support 
are provided and the reliability of those front 
line staff who provide it. CareTech approaches 
these issues with considerable care and 
diligence, building in quality and training 
wherever it is required but also through 
its established scrutiny protocols and firm 
leadership. We care a great deal about what 
we do and have established a reputation for 
careful management of all those processes 
that could expose us to risk.
We have thoroughly reviewed our operations. 
The Group trades only within the UK and has 
no foreign exchange exposure. We have 
limited exposure to nursing staff and the EU 
labour market. Our primary recruitment is 
focused on the UK labour market for support 
staff and the recruitment of new staff is the 
factor that we are managing and we continue 
to monitor closely.
In 2017 the Apprenticeship Levy was 
introduced and we are confident that the 
Learning Division through EQL and DHA 
is well placed to take full advantage of 
the new market structure.
Our risks
All providers of health and social care are 
conscious of the need for management 
vigilance and the requirement to have a 
thorough commitment to delivering care 
that is safe and of a high quality. CareTech’s 
approach to quality and safe service delivery 
is characterised by a mixture of a dedicated 
compliance team carrying out regular audits 
of inspection and a commitment to building 
quality into everything we do.
The market for the provision of social care 
services continues to be dynamic, presenting 
both risks and opportunities. The overall 
number of people needing support will 
increase, and a smaller proportion of them 
will be placed into residential services. Those 
who do need a residential care solution will 
have more complex needs and are likely to 
require a wider range of services, including 
clinical and therapeutic support. Our 
operational management teams are already 
focusing on the delivery of high quality care. 
As we move forward this will become 
increasingly specialised with the benefit 
of professional qualified care co-ordinators 
who will prepare and direct personalised 
care plans within the services.
Most service users will be supported in their 
own homes through domiciliary care or in 
more formal supported living arrangements. 
This is a major growth area for care providers 
and CareTech already has a solid reputation 
for its high quality and flexible solutions. We 
are building this to a higher level and refining 
our organisational structure to build more 
rapidly on our successes to date.
By order of the Board
Farouq Sheikh
Chairman
18 December 2017
Social care is a long-term contract with the public sector and is 
inherently free of risk so long as quality is maintained, outcomes 
are achieved and the price is right. However, social care does 
carry risks that will always be at the forefront of our minds.
18 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report continued
 P r inc ipal r isks  
 and our strategic  
 r e s pons e Principal risks
1. Service offer and user needs
We have to create and staff a service offering 
which matches the needs of the service user 
and can be communicated to commissioners 
so it is carefully recorded locally at every 
service in order to reduce the risk of service 
users moving to other service providers.
2. Quality and safety
A health and safety breach would impact 
reputation, brand and compromise the safety 
of those in our care. This could impact on the 
demand for our business as well as incur costs 
to rectify. We have to provide and deliver safe 
care of a high quality and the Group utilises 
Acoura, an independent supplier, to audit and 
report monthly on Health and Safety matters 
as well as all RIDDORS (Reporting of Injuries, 
Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences 
Regulations) so that all incidents are recorded 
and acted upon.
3. Service value
The service offer has to be provided to meet 
the needs of the commissioners at a fair price 
and this is coming under increased scrutiny 
as commissioners regularly review value 
for money so the Group communicates 
frequently with its commissioners locally.
4. Reputation
The Group has to have a reputation for 
delivering a service that is good value and 
takes account of all risks. The Group 
maintains a Risk Register which includes all 
key risks, including reputational risk, and how 
they are mitigated through quality of service 
and good communication with service users 
and Local Authorities and this Risk Register 
is reviewed monthly. 
5. Growth funding
So that the Group can keep growing 
adequate funding has to be anticipated 
and put in place and the Group ensures 
that all of its facilities are monitored and 
reviewed regularly, particularly during its 
Budget and forecasting processes.
6. Manage debt
The level of debt obtained to fund 
operations and ensure that growth can 
occur has to be carefully managed and 
the different forms of leasing and debt 
are reviewed quarterly when all of the 
covenants are also reviewed.
Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 19 It gives me considerable satisfaction to report again on a 
successful year that reflects the hard work of our management 
team, the enthusiasm of our staff and the support of our Board.
National public policy continues to 
be a significant driver of local authority 
commissioning intentions and behaviour. 
For a number of years, public policy has 
encouraged greater personalisation of health 
and social care for adults. Commissioners 
and leading providers are driving change 
that will mean offering people more choice 
and control over the care, treatment and 
support they receive while at the same 
time maintaining the quality and safety 
of those services.
Our care priorities drive successful outcomes 
for our service users and follow closely the 
guidance from central Government.
Our key focus for delivering quality services 
and positive outcomes is supported by the 
following key factors:
Communication 
 – We have open and frank dialogue with 
our service users, their families and social 
workers, as well as the Regulators.
Independence
 – In our social care and health contracts 
we aim to help our service users to return 
to an ordinary independent life. It may 
be children who can return to their birth 
families or live independently. It may be 
adults who we can help on the pathway 
to recovery following a specialist services 
breakdown, or acquired brain injury or 
people with learning disability who we 
can support towards independent living.
Housing care and support 
 – We know that most people aspire to have 
a place of their own, employment and 
ongoing support. We have structured our 
services, developing new provision and 
creative partnerships with housing providers 
to enable these aspirations to be achieved 
whenever possible and we are tailoring 
training to assist young people and adults 
leaving our services to gain employment.
Self-directed support 
 – It is pivotal to government policy that 
adults and children receiving social care 
are fully engaged in the support that they 
require. With some adults this extends to 
the provision of a cash sum enabling them 
to purchase their care and support directly. 
CareTech managers have been further 
reviewing our systems and delivering 
training throughout the organisation 
to ensure that we are able to deliver the 
requirements of self-directed support.
Haroon Sheikh 
Chief Executive Officer
Overview
The Group has continued to build upon 
its solid foundations and remains in a strong 
position to continue as a leading provider 
of high quality specialist social care services 
in a large and growing UK market which 
remains fragmented.
The Group has continued to develop through 
organic growth and reconfigurations and, 
with the acquisition of Selborne Care Limited 
in June 2017, it has gained an experienced 
management team with skilled leaders. 
The new business has integrated and settled 
well, and our focus on organic growth also 
remains strong.
In 2017, I am extremely proud of the 
establishment of the CareTech Charitable 
Foundation which is devoted to supporting 
the social care sector. This is further discussed 
in the Corporate Social Responsibility section 
of the report.
There have also been a number of staff 
initiatives to aid retention including the second 
Sharesave Scheme and a Level 5 in Care 
Management training scheme for Managers.
Consolidation and creating 
new opportunities
CareTech remains at the forefront of social 
care outsourcing in the UK across both 
Children and Adult services and, in the year, 
there has been a further increase in working 
closely with commissioners and regulators.
20 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s Statement and Performance Review
A strong basis  
 f o r ad v a n c e me n t  Quality and dignity
 – CareTech has always delivered high 
quality care in well maintained premises. 
However, we have never been complacent 
about this and have undertaken reviews 
to ensure that we deliver the right quality 
at a reasonable price. We have also learned 
a great deal from the experience of our 
NHS colleagues and developed a Dignity 
Test to ensure that our front line and 
administrative staff treat all our clients 
in ways that promote dignity.
Progress in the year
The year has seen continued progress as 
the Group concentrates on the introduction 
of innovative new services developed in 
partnership with local authority 
commissioners reconfigured from within 
our existing portfolio of properties or through 
new properties either purchased or rented 
for service users for supported living.
In June 2017 the Group acquired Selborne 
Care Limited for a total consideration of 
£16.6m in cash. Selborne is a high quality 
provider of specialist residential care, 
supported living and day care services for 
adults with learning disabilities and challenging 
behaviours. It had at acquisition 57 residential 
beds and 30 Supported Living Service users.
Excluding Selborne Care our Adult Services 
have added a net 81 beds in the year, being 
75 in Supported Living and six in Residential.
Children Services have added 49 beds in the 
year principally in eight services. 
The Group also continues to realise the benefit 
of organisational improvements put in place 
over the past few years. We have continued 
to strengthen our management structure 
with further senior appointments planned 
and to improve the efficiency of our processes 
following further investment in new systems 
which have gone live or we are working 
on now. We are seeing the benefits of new 
executive appointments which continue to 
have a positive impact across the services.
New systems were procured during the 
year for the Group’s recruitment and training 
solutions including e-learning with standard 
automated reports as well as for maintenance, 
hosting, data analytics and e-compliance in 
order to benefit from cutting edge technology.
These improvements have put us in a strong 
position to benefit from a number of the 
commissioning opportunities by working in 
partnership with the NHS and Local Authorities.
Care Pathway Range and Services
The Group’s focus remains the provision of 
specialist social care through its five divisions. 
This is underpinned by a well-defined range 
of provisions which meet the commissioner 
requirements. These services are now even 
more extensive and focused on providing 
high quality care and positive outcomes 
for all of our service users.
The Group has continued to develop and 
grow its existing five operating divisions, 
which come under the two outcome-based 
sectors of Adult Services and Children 
Services. We continue to extend both our 
geographic coverage and our outcome-
based Care Pathway range of services 
organically by acquisition and through the 
purchase of properties to meet the needs of 
our marketplace, specifically the requirement 
for greater acuity service provision for both 
Children and Young People and Adults. 
This ensures that CareTech is in a very strong 
position to address the demands of our 
evolving marketplace.
We remain committed to the growth 
of residential care solutions for adults and 
children with the most complex needs and 
the Group has embraced the development 
of home-based solutions including foster 
care where demand for more specialist 
services remains strong. Our residential care 
services for children cater for young people 
with particularly difficult issues and offer a 
national service; with strong growth seen 
in the North of England with ROC Northwest 
which has expanded both in care and 
educational services. In the year we have 
purchased properties in Scotland and North 
West England for both Spark of Genius and 
ROC Northwest to develop into new services. 
Our adult services offer a solid and reliable 
provision across the whole spectrum of 
service offerings which now includes 
acquired brain injuries and we see a particular 
volume demand in the area of supported 
living, balanced by renewed demand for 
more specialised residential care solutions.
Our strategy is to offer a bespoke range 
of options so that we can maintain the 
Care Pathways that distinguish us from 
other providers.
Overview of progress
Our focus during the past year has continued 
to be further building on the businesses 
which established the Care Pathways whilst 
introducing innovative new solutions to meet 
the challenges faced by care commissioners 
and then adding newly acquired businesses 
with complementary skills.
Capacity has increased by 215 places 
principally because we have continued to 
reconfigure services and acquired Selborne 
Care Limited with its 87 places. Occupancy 
levels within our mature services remain at 
a creditable 93%, or 86% when taking into 
account our services under development 
and transition.
Much has been written about personalisation 
and I felt it would be useful to set out our 
own understanding and commitment 
to personalisation.
Personalisation to us means recognising 
people as individuals who have strengths and 
preferences and putting them at the centre 
of their own care and support.
The traditional service-led approach has 
often meant that people have not been able 
to procure the kind of support they need, or 
receive tailored care assistance. Personalised 
approaches such as self-directed support and 
personal budgets involve enabling people 
to identify their own needs and make choices 
about how and when they are supported to 
live their lives. 
Our two business divisions of Adult Services 
and Children Services comprise the following 
four Care Pathways and our Learning 
Services division.
1. Adult Learning Disabilities
Year to 30 September 2017
Revenue £87.7m (2016: £79.4m)
Contribution to 
Group Revenue 52.9% (2016: 53.3%)
Underlying EBITDA* £26.3m (2016: £25.4m)
Capacity 1,735 (2016: 1,567)
Adult Learning Disabilities provides individually 
tailor-made solutions for people living in their 
own homes, residential care or independent 
supported living schemes. We can work with 
clients to deliver self-directed support packages.
For some people residential care will continue 
as the preferred option and we increasingly 
offer several types of supported living and 
packages of individualised self-directed 
support to people in their own homes.
This includes adult residential care homes, 
independent supported living and community 
support services.
Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 21 We have continued to work closely with Local 
Authority and NHS commissioners and this 
has helped us to achieve our growth through 
the past year. We take a long-term view, 
recognising that change will continue and 
with this in mind I am pleased to report that 
redevelopment of some of our long stay 
residential provision has been a great success 
over the past year and will continue to meet 
the changing requirements of commissioners 
and families.
The market for high acuity care and the 
support of people with learning disability 
is growing year on year. Demand for lower 
acuity support has been impacted by the cuts 
in local authority expenditure but this is not 
an area of activity in which CareTech operates. 
Conversely, resources for those with the 
highest level of need are being maintained 
and increased in some local authorities.
During the past year we have withdrawn 
36 places in services for reconfiguration into 
new care models and have developed 47 beds 
through reconfiguration plus an additional 
70 beds have been brought into service. 
Further new provision is under development.
2. Specialist Services
Year to 30 September 2017
Revenue £15.5m (2016: £10.7m)

Group Revenue 9.3% (2016: 7.2%)
Underlying EBITDA* £3.9m (2016: £2.7m)
Capacity 214 (2016: 216)
In March 2016, Oakleaf Care (Hartwell) was 
acquired and added its range of pathways from 
rehabilitation through to long-term and end of 
life care for men with acquired brain injury. 
This acquisition builds on the Group’s existing 
neurological services and represents a further 
regional growth platform for the Group. It has 
been put alongside the Mental Health Services 
to form the Specialist Services.
The reduction in capacity in Specialist 
Services arises because there have been 
a small number of beds reconfigured and 
transferred to Adult Learning Disabilities.
The principal reason for the increase 
in underlying EBITDA of £1.2m was due 
to Oakleaf Care (Hartwell) being included 
for the whole of 2017.
Specialist Services works in partnerships 
with the NHS to ensure a successful transition 
out of acute care, delivering pathways to 
independence. We have an outstanding track 
record for helping people away from acute 
care and supporting them in their own homes.
The adult services for this Care Pathway 
include a community-based hospital, adult 
residential care homes, independent 
supported living and community outreach 
with some transitional services transferred 
within the Group.
Community Specialist Services has always 
been a critical but relatively neglected area 
of social care. However, this is changing as 
the NHS drives to lower bed capacity and 
accelerated early discharge from acute 
psychiatric hospital care. 
The growth of social care is certain and the 
response by Government to one of the key 
difficulties is progressing. There has been 
some progress in the removal of large 
numbers of learning disabled people from 
the controversial “Treatment and Assessment 
Centres” operating at various locations 
throughout the UK. CareTech has never 
operated any centres of this type but we 
understand that the CEO of NHS England has 
been tasked with ensuring that these centres 
are re-provided as a matter of urgency. 
CareTech is seeking opportunities to support 
the project and to offer a comprehensive 
solution within its community homes.
We are well positioned for expansion in 
Specialist Services and have a sustainable 
infrastructure to deliver growth including 
plans to provide care for women with 
acquired brain injury in 2018. 
3. Foster Care
Year to 30 September 2017
Revenue £8.6m (2016: £8.7m)
Contribution to 
Group Revenue 5.2% (2016: 5.8%)
Underlying EBITDA* £1.9m (2016: £2.2m)
Capacity 301 (2016: 301)
Foster Care provides for both mainstream 
and specialist foster care in small supportive 
groups across England and Wales for children 
with disabilities. We also provide foster care 
family assessments in the home rather than 
in a residential setting.
The unchanged capacity and fall in revenue 
and underlying EBITDA in Foster Care is due 
to the competitive nature of the market as 
well the change to family assessments in 
the home. It is also due to capacity being 
reported on the basis of the children that 
carers are able to look after rather than 
the number that they are approved for. 
This trend is driven by cost considerations, 
where fostering is considerably less expensive 
than residential care and by perceived quality 
care factors. It is generally held that fostering 
in an ordinary family home delivers better 
quality than any residential setting. However, 
the rising tide of fostering has been 
constrained by the challenge of finding 
foster carers with the right skill and motivation 
alongside preference by social workers to 
place within local authority services rather 
than the independent sector.
In 2013, 46% of children placed in foster homes 
were outsourced to the independent sector. 
This compares with 67% placed in residential 
homes operated by independent providers.
Our Foster Care teams and Young People 
Residential teams are working closely 
alongside each other to offer the best 
outcomes for Young People.
Our market intelligence suggests that most, if 
not all, independent sector fostering agencies 
are still experiencing some degree of “hold 
back” at present. However, the consensus 
view is that this will not last long and local 
authorities will inevitably return to progressive 
outsourcing of foster care provision.
Outsourcing is well established in the culture 
of most local authorities, but the current 
austerity measures have led a small number 
of authorities to reflect on the 50% fee 
premium paid for independent fostering. 
This disparity of cost can be attributed in 
part to the fact that the most complex and 
therefore high cost cases are placed in the 
care of independent providers. However, it is 
also clear that local authorities fail to undertake 
a full cost analysis of their in-house provision. 
Wherever this has been done, outsourcing 
is demonstrably much better value.
Demand for foster care has increased overall 
but we have noted an increasing trend among 
some local authorities to make provision 
in-house for all but the most complex 
children. In our view this is an expensive and 
unsustainable approach that exposes local 
authority commissioners to risk. Our own 
services are being maintained at an 
acceptable level. 
22 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chief Executive’s Statement and Performance Review continued * Before unallocated costs.
In October 2017 the All Wales Framework for 
the provision of foster care services outcome 
was that TLC (Wales) was ranked 1 and was 
placed in the New Tier 1. This should really 
assist in the growth of TLC (Wales) due to 
the level of referrals now being received.
Looking forward we are training our foster 
carers with the skills required to manage 
more complex work and have linked the 
fostering division with our residential team 
for children so that we can maintain an 
effective care pathway.
4. Young People Residential Services
Year to 30 September 2017
Revenue £43.8m (2016: £39.0m)
Contribution to 
Group Revenue 26.4% (2016: 26.2%)
Underlying EBITDA* £13.2m (2016: £11.8m)
Capacity 284 (2016: 235)
A number of children and young people need 
to live in specialised residential services and 
receive education. As far as practicable we 
aim to help these children move into a more 
normalised family style environment.
This segment contains children’s residential 
care homes, which includes facilities for 
children with learning difficulties and 
emotional behavioural disorders (“EBD”), 
and small specialist schools.
In December 2015 ROC Northwest was 
added and gave a further geographic spread 
to fit between the current Children residential 
services in Scotland (Spark of Genius and 
ACAD) and North Wales (Branas Isaf) 
and services in Staffordshire and Yorkshire. 
It also strengthened the residential care and 
education services for young people with 
complex needs, especially EBD.
In the year this segment benefited from new 
services which have added 49 beds to capacity 
with additions to Spark of Genius, ROC 
Northwest and the original Childrens services. 
Spark of Genius provides significant benefits 
across the division due to their well-established 
education facilities across Scotland and 
North East England which complement the 
ROC Northwest and Welsh education facilities. 
In the year the Education capacity increased 
by 46 to close at 312 Young People.
At the Laing Buisson Awards in November 
2017 the winners in Social Care for Children’s 
Services was ROC Northwest.
Children residential services have been 
growing as our reputation for quality care and 
support spreads. We are currently developing 
new beds and places that have been 
commissioned during the past year. 
5. Learning Services
Year to 30 September 2017
Revenue £10.4m (2016: £11.2m) 
Contribution to 
Group Revenue 6.2% (2016: 7.5%)
Underlying EBITDA* £0.9m (2016: £1.0m)
Learning Services comprises EQL Solutions 
which was acquired in 2013 and is a national 
provider specialising in employment and 
training services to young people and adults 
and Dawn Hodge Associates, a regional 
provider specialising in the social care sector, 
was acquired in 2016.
Their intensive pre-employment, 
development and apprenticeship 
programmes use public funds from the 
Skills Funding Agency to lay the foundations 
for individuals to achieve their career goals 
while helping to provide businesses with 
the vital skills they need in their workforce.
As well as supporting the workforce, Learning 
Services has also developed programmes for 
service users by enhancing the pathways to 
independent living and employment. Young 
People leaving care, for example, often do not 
know where to find the right job opportunities 
or have the opportunity to access employer-
focused training. We can now bridge that gap 
by supporting young people as they make the 
transition to adult life. We are also exploring 
how best to help individuals return to 
employment after mental illness and to give 
people with learning disabilities the skills and 
confidence to gain employment so that they 
are able to live more independently.
Good progress has been made in identifying 
the potential for Learning Services to add 
value to CareTech’s attraction and 
recruitment of staff and their retention, 
helping new employees gain the skills and 
qualifications to grow a successful career 
in care through an Apprenticeship.
The Aspire programme developed as a 
unique and innovative scheme that will 
ensure all CareTech’s support workers receive 
mandatory and statutory training to the 
highest standard whilst also being offered the 
opportunity to complete a Level 2 or Level 3 
Apprenticeship which has been carefully 
tailored to suit their role and 140 completed 
this apprenticeship in the last academic year.
CareTech apprentices continue their training 
with 321 CareTech support workers 
undertaking the apprenticeship programme.
The Team Leader programme has 47 staff 
members on Level 5 programmes.
In early 2016 Dawn Hodge Associates 
retained its Ofsted “Outstanding” which 
is an achievement that we are very pleased 
to have attained and provides an excellent 
base to build upon.
During 2017 with the introduction of 
the Apprenticeship Levy there have been 
significant changes to the Learning sector, 
but we believe that we are well placed to take 
advantage of the new market conditions.
However, both EQL Solutions and Dawn 
Hodge Associates faced a challenging start to 
the new Learning sector year. A reorganisation 
of the management of the division was 
undertaken and the budget for the rest of 2018 
shows an improvement on last year.

Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 23 We care about our service users
Service users are the reason for our existence 
and satisfying their needs remains our key 
objective.
As our organisation grows, we strive 
to maintain a culture which never forgets 
the important relationship we have with 
our service users. We seek to nurture these 
relationships and see them as partnerships 
of mutual interest and respect, with our 
person-centred approach ensuring service 
user interests are safeguarded and 
vulnerabilities minimised.
The further expansion of our Care Pathway 
strategy seeks to provide our service users 
with “whole of life” solutions to their needs, 
maximising independence where possible 
by encouraging education, promoting choice, 
being proactive with family members, 
providing training for employment where 
feasible and nurturing personal ambition 
where helpful. In the year we have been 
celebrating the achievements of our service 
users across the country, they have been busy 
creating art pieces for an Art Competition and 
the finalists are having another series of local 
awards presentations with a national 
presentation in November 2017 following 
the successes in 2015 and 2016.
We are determined to preserve the dignity 
of those we care for and fully support 
Government initiatives to this end. We see 
making each day as fulfilled as possible for 
our service users as a vital ingredient to their, 
and our, success.
We care about the environment
We seek to maximise environmental 
standards in all areas of our organisation. 
Energy costs are now more closely monitored 
centrally and with the installation of smart 
meters being rolled out across our services 
we are seeking to encourage more efficient 
consumption of energy, without 
compromising service user care.
Clinical waste management has an 
environmental impact and we are focused 
on ways to make this more effective whilst 
still adhering to statutory requirements.
We aim for minimal waste production 
and waste-free processes. Encouraging the 
involvement of our workforce in seeking new 
ways to “be green” is important and we are 
striving to reduce our carbon footprint in 
all commercial areas including promoting 
recycling initiatives, developing a carbon 
offset scheme for paper usage, using public 
transport where feasible and improving our 
energy efficiency.
We have continued to strive for long-lasting improvements 
in our services in a way that is consistent with the interests and 
concerns of our stakeholder community. As always, the driving 
force underpinning CareTech’s operation continues to be the 
provision of the highest quality of care to our service users.
Established during 2017, the CareTech 
Foundation is an independent grant-making 
corporate foundation registered with the 
Charity Commission. Funded and founded 
by the Group, the Foundation has an 
independent Board of trustees responsible 
for delivering its Charitable Objects. The 
Foundation has ambitious and clear-sighted 
objectives to deliver meaningful impact to 
communities in the UK and overseas about 
which the staff of the Group and its service 
users feel proud and strongly engaged, 
providing a unique contribution to the 
charitable marketplace consistent with 
the Group’s values and approach.
In the year to September 2017 the Group 
made charitable donations through the 
Charity Foundation of £4,970.
The CareTech Foundation is the first 
corporate foundation in the UK social care 
sector, demonstrating the Company’s 
commitment to wider society and to its staff 
and its desire to play a strong leadership role 
within the social care sector.
The CareTech Charitable Foundation’s 
work is focused on the following three 
key objectives:
(1)  Physical and learning disabilities and 
Specialist Services. Supporting disabled 
people and those with long-term health 
difficulties, including those with Specialist 
Services conditions and complex physical 
and learning disabilities.
(2)  Skills development for the care sector. 
Skills development for those from 
deprived and disadvantaged backgrounds 
for careers in the care sector.
(3)  Supporting our communities and 
the CareTech family. Developing an 
ambitious corporate social responsibility 
programme in partnership with the 
Group, supporting the family and friends 
of the Group’s staff facing significant 
financial, health or similar challenges.
The Foundation’s focus is devoted to supporting 
those in need in the UK and in developing 
countries overseas.
The CareTech Charitable Foundation delivers 
its key objectives through the following key 
approaches:
 – Partnership Grant-giving. The CareTech 
Charitable Foundation supports a small 
number of significant partnerships with 
credible and high-quality charities and 
social enterprises consistent with its three 
key objectives. To be considered for the 
Foundation’s support, any partnership must:
 – Involve medium to long-term 
investments in innovative and high-
impact programmes that will deliver one 
or more of the Foundation’s objectives.
 – Demonstrate and be contingent upon 
any investment by the Foundation 
leveraging additional investment.
 – Enable the Foundation to provide wider 
in-kind support through the expertise 
of the Group’s staff, supply chain and 
wider network.
 – Responsible Business. Strengthening the 
Group’s strong track record in recognising 
its responsibilities to the environment and 
communities in which it operates, the 
Foundation is funded to bring together 
and enhance the Company’s responsible 
business activities. In particular, the 
Foundation seeks to mobilise a significant 
staff volunteering programme, building 
a portfolio of high-quality and credible 
opportunities available to staff and relevant 
to the skills of the business staff and the local 
communities in which the Group operates.
 – Match-funding. The Foundation provides 
match-funding to CareTech staff’s individual 
fundraising efforts for charitable causes in 
line with the Foundation’s Charitable Objects.
 – Family & Friends grants. Modest funding 
support will be available through the 
Foundation to support the family and 
friends of CareTech staff facing significant 
challenges over and above that properly 
covered by virtue of staff members’ 
employment contracts.

Corporate Social Responsibility  We care about our staff
We remain committed to ensuring employees 
share in the success of the Group and fully 
appreciate that Group performance is affected 
by the relationship we have with them.
Sustaining the retention and development 
of employees is also critical to our continued 
success and we remain of the belief that 
fostering a positive workplace culture is 
the best way for our employees to thrive. 
Supporting them with regular supervision, 
training and clear career development 
programmes promotes staff continuity and 
leads to improved standards of care quality.
In early December 2015 we held our first staff 
awards ceremony with 10 categories for staff 
and staff teams across each Division. A larger 
event was held in November 2016 and the third 
care awards ceremony was in November 2017.
Out of a total of 5,192 staff at the end of 
September 2017, 69% are female and equal 
opportunity for all remains at the heart of our 
recruitment policies and the diversity of our 
workforce bears this out. We value our staff at 
all levels and work closely with them through 
our robust human resources department to 
foster consultation in all matters, ensure fair 
pay for all, maximise conditions of service 
and facilitate flexible working where feasible.
During the year we undertook a Staff 
Engagement Survey which involved all staff 
and looked at values and questions across 
five engagement drivers. The feedback has 
led to a Communication Plan that will lead to 
improved communication across the Group.
We have a team of in-house training staff 
delivering courses on all relevant subjects, 
enabling our workforce to gain the skills, 
knowledge and confidence to provide the 
care and support to our service users on 
a daily basis.
Our Sharesave share option scheme had been 
launched in March 2016 with a plan to offer 
new invitations regularly and to be available to 
all our employees. Over 200 staff participated 
in the three-year scheme launched in 2016. 
We have repeated the sharesave option 
scheme in 2017 with a further 259 staff 
participating in the new three-year scheme. 
It is proposed to launch another scheme in 
2018. This participation, along with regular 
senior management share option awards, 
contributes to the fulfilment of our desire 
to reward staff for loyalty, diligence and 
commitment to high standards of service.
We care about quality and safety
As a Group, our aim is to provide a safe 
working environment for service users, staff 
and visitors. We value the well-being of all 
stakeholders and develop policies to this end.
Maintaining workplace infrastructures is a 
core objective and sustained investment in 
Information Technology, furniture, facilities 
and equipment enable working environments, 
be they operational or administrative, to be 
safe and productive.
Regulation is vigorously applied with routine 
and regular inspections being made by the 
Care Quality Commission (“CQC”) and Ofsted 
in England and the services are regulated 
by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate 
Wales (“CSSIW”) in Wales and by the Care 
Inspectorate for Scotland.
We continue to resource our own highly 
experienced internal quality and compliance 
teams which undertake a programme of 
regular inspection and assessment and give 
constructive feedback backed by training and 
supervision if the requirement is there. We 
engage the services of outsourced expert 
advisers ensuring best practice and 
procedures are maintained.
We care about our communities
Doing business the right way is of 
fundamental importance to us. A successful 
business needs to operate in healthy, thriving 
communities and needs to be seen as a good 
neighbour to those communities.
We have direct involvement in a variety 
of community-based programmes further 
improving our service reputation and helping 
to foster a strengthened relationship with 
local authorities.
Being a socially responsible organisation with 
a focus on developing our ethical standards 
aligned with our economic objectives remains 
a core aim and we strive to identify the real 
value of our organisation, beyond its financial 
bottom line. Considering non-financial values 
such as reputation, employee commitment 
and service user fulfilment helps us develop 
longer-term opportunities, ultimately adding 
to the financial bottom line.
Behaving responsibly and maximising the 
benefits of a strong relationship with our 
stakeholders is an integral part of a continuing 
process of building long-term value.
Outlook
The coming year shows every sign of being 
good for health and social care providers 
and especially for those with an established 
reputation for quality and innovation. 
This year there has been significant policy 
development and we see some indicators 
that local authorities have recognised the 
need to maintain or grow their social 
care budgets.
In our view we are in a period in which 
consolidation will again feature strongly 
within the corporate sector and we are 
alert to quality opportunities that may arise. 
However, we are mindful about acquisition 
and have robust criteria which must be 
satisfied to ensure that any acquired business 
fits our long-term strategic objectives.
This has been another progressive year for 
CareTech and I am indebted to the strong 
management team who have overseen the 
provision of diligent and tailored services in 
what has been a challenging environment 
for the care sector. 
CareTech provides high quality care, support 
and outcomes to our service users. I remain 
proud to lead the Group, delivering a quality of 
care that makes a difference to so many lives.

CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 25 Underlying basic earnings per share remained 
at 38.03p (2016: 38.03p). In the year 
underlying profit before taxation increased 
by 12.6% and underlying profit after tax has 
risen by 10.8% to £26.6m (2016: £24.0m) due 
in part to the increase in the effective tax rate. 
The placing on 23 March 2017, which raised 
£37.4m (net of expenses) for acquisitions 
increased the number of shares by 11.0m 
so the weighted average number of diluted 
shares rose to 70.1m (2016: 63.2m) being an 
increase of 10.9%. Basic and diluted earnings 
per share decreased by 29.55% to 25.48p 
(2016: 36.17p) and profit after tax reduced 
by 22.3% to £17.8m (2016: £22.9m).
Cash inflows from operating activities before 
tax and non-underlying items paid were 
£32.7m (2016: £34.2m), a reduction of 4.4%. 
Net debt to the Group’s bankers (as defined 
in the Financial and Operational Highlights 
on the inside front cover) at the year end of 
£147.1m has reduced by £9.3m for the year 
(2016: £156.4m).
The Condensed Income Statement before 
non-underlying items for the year is 
summarised in table 1.
Revenue
Revenue of £166.0m (2016: £149.0m) 
was 11.4% higher than in 2016. 
In the year there was the acquisition of 
Selborne and revenue includes £3.9m from 
this acquisition.
In the established Adult Learning Disabilities 
segment we continued to experience high 
levels of occupancy and reported 93% 
occupancy at 30 September 2017. When this 
is blended with the facilities that are being 
reconfigured and so are under development, 
the overall occupancy level during the 
second half of the year and at 30 September 
2017 was 86% of capacity (September 2016: 
86%). As in recent years the demand for 
residential services continues to be 
encouraging for high acuity users.
As set out in the Chief Executive’s statement 
and note 4 to the Accounts, we are again 
reporting segmental information for the 
financial year and last year which includes 
information on client capacity and revenue 
for each segment. Specialist Services has 
been created from the old Mental Health 
Services plus the ABI business Oakleaf Care 
acquired in March 2016, Adult numbers have 
been restated.
The continued development of our care 
pathways and a growing range of service 
options has led to the proportion of Adult 
services revenue rising from 60.5% in 2016 
to 62.2% in 2017 and underlying EBITDA 
before Group Costs moving from 65.2% 
in 2016 to 65.4% in 2017.
Results
Underlying operating profit improved by 6.9% 
at £34.2m compared with £32.0m last year. 
Until 2013 the Group had been making 
strategic acquisitions to gain market share 
and extend the care pathway range of services. 
Since 2013 the focus had been on both 
organic development and cost efficiencies 
as well as acquisitions. With two share 
placements, improved banking facilities and 
a Ground Rent fund transaction the Group 
has raised £87m which has been used for 
acquisitions with four completed in the last 
two years and one more during 2017. 
The Group has continued to make good progress in 2017, and 
has raised additional funds through a share placement for further 
acquisitions. Having made one acquisition in the year, the Group 
is well placed to make further acquisitions and continue the 
growth in 2018.
26 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Review
Michael Hill 
Group Finance Director
The Group has a platform 
for further acquisitions 
and growth The Young People Residential Services total 
revenue has risen by 12.3% with Specialist 
Services growing by 44.9%, Foster Care falling 
by 1.1% and Learning Services by 7.1%. Their 
total proportion of the EBITDA before Group 
costs has moved from 34.8% in 2016 to 34.6% 
in 2017 due mainly to the acquisitions in the 
Adult Division Services.
Underlying EBITDA and total EBITDA
Underlying EBITDA has grown by 7.5% from 
£37.1m in 2016 to £39.9m in 2017. Underlying 
EBITDA includes £0.5m from the acquisition 
of Selborne Care Limited. Underlying EBITDA 
margin has decreased from 24.9% to 24.0% 
mainly due to the margin in the total of the 
acquired businesses being at a lower rate 
than the other businesses, and the growth 
in services businesses that require little 
capital expenditure like Foster Care and 
the Learning Division.
The Adult Learning Disabilities, Specialist 
Services and Young People Residential 
Services segments have higher margins 
but normally require considerable capital 
expenditure to increase capacity, whilst 
Supported Living, Foster Care and Learning 
Services operate at a lower margin in part 
because they do not require capital 
expenditure to increase capacity and are 
not reliant on the Group’s properties.
Administrative expenses, before depreciation 
and share-based payments charges, were 
£20.0m (2016: £17.2m) and increased by 
£2.8m during the year. In 2016 they 
represented 11.5% of Group revenue and 
in 2017 this further increased to 12.0% 
of Group revenue.
There has been a further considerable effort 
in the year to tighten administrative expenses 
with further back office systems centralisation 
and procurement successes for the Group.
The reconfiguration of services is a central 
part of the Board’s strategy to grow organically. 
It enhances average fee rates and maintains 
the Group’s reputation as a provider of 
highest quality of care.

166.0 39.9 149.0 37.1 In the year there has also been a greater focus 
on purchasing properties which are then 
converted to new services.
The number of employees in management 
and administration has increased by 17 as 
a result of both the acquisition in the year 
as well as organic growth. The Time and 
Attendance system has been implemented 
across all of the residential services in the 
year which will further our back office 
centralisation and ensure that staff are paid 
more accurately and quickly, as well as giving 
reliable data on staff rotas and attendance in 
each service. A new integrated Recruitment 
system has been implemented in the year.
Total EBITDA has reduced from £41.3m 
in 2016 to £35.6m in 2017.
Operating profit and profit before tax
The depreciation charge is £5.5m (2016: 
£5.0m) and reflects the investment in land 
and buildings, motor vehicles and fixtures, 
fittings and equipment.
After this charge and the share-based 
payments, underlying operating profit grew 
6.9% to £34.2m (2016: £32.0m).
Total operating profit decreased by 25.6% 
to £22.7m (2016: £30.5m).
Net underlying financial expenses of £4.8m 
(2016: £5.9m) decreased again over the 
previous year due to the effects of the share 
placement monies and the new banking 
facilities, though there were additional finance 
leases taken out on new home vehicles 
during the year.
Underlying profit before tax was £29.4m 
(2016: £26.1m) which is an increase of 12.6%.
Total profit before tax decreased by 25.3% 
to £16.8m (2016: £22.5m).
Taxation and diluted earnings per share
The effective underlying tax rate was 9.3% 
(2016: 7.8%) and reflects management’s 
expectations of future capital investment 
through organic developments and 
reconfigurations relative to available capital 
allowances, the impact of the reduction in 
the main rate of corporation tax in the year 
and also the release of a provision for tax 
no longer required.
The weighted average number of shares in 
issue rose by 10.8% mainly due to the share 
placement in March 2017. The underlying 
basic earnings per share remained at 38.03p 
in 2017 from 38.03p in 2016.
Basic and diluted earnings per share reduced 
by 29.6% to 25.48p (2016: 36.17p)
Dividends
Our policy has been to increase the total 
dividend per year broadly in line with the 
movement in underlying diluted earnings 
per share. The final dividend will therefore 
increase to 6.60p per share (2016: 6.25p), 
bringing the total dividend for the year 
to 9.90p (2016: 9.25p), a growth of 7.0%. 
Dividend cover for 2017, based upon diluted 
earnings per share before non-underlying 
items is 3.84 times (2016: 4.11 times).
Non-underlying items
As more fully explained on the face of the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and in note 5 to the Accounts, the 
Directors have separately disclosed a number 
of non-underlying items in order to improve 
understanding of the underlying trading 
performance achieved by the Group. Total 
non-underlying items represent a net charge 
of £11.4m at operating level (2016: £1.5m) 
and the principal items are the amortisation 
of intangible assets and integration and 
reorganisation costs plus costs of the 
acquisition. In 2016 non-underlying items 
were stated net of the IAS 17 profit of £5.6m 
arising from the ground rent transaction. 
Cash flow and net debt
The cash flow statement and movement in 
net debt as defined on page 17 to the Group’s 
bankers for the year is summarised below:

28 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Review continued Net debt to the Group’s bankers at 
30 September 2017 of £147.1m (2016: 
£156.4m) has decreased by £9.3m during 
the financial year, with an investment 
of £36.4m in acquisitions and capital 
improvements during the year.
Operating cash flows before 
non-underlying items
The £32.7m (2016: £34.2m) cash inflow from 
operating activities, before non-underlying 
items, represents an 82% (2016: 92%) 
underlying EBITDA cash conversion ratio.
Interest and dividend cash flows
Interest paid of £5.0m (2016: £5.5m) is 
reflective of the financial expenses per the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, whilst dividends paid are consistent 
with the relevant section earlier in the review.
Acquisitions and capital expenditure
During the year we invested total funds 
of £36.4m (2016: £41.9m) on an acquisition 
and capital expenditure. The Group acquired 
Selborne Care Limited in June 2017 for a total 
consideration of £16.6m in cash. The 
acquisition utilised part of the £37.4m share 
placement monies raised in March 2017 and 
there are plans for further acquisitions.
Further details of the acquisitions are 
explained in the Chief Executive’s Statement 
and Performance Review as well as in the 
notes to the financial statements.
Capital expenditure of £19.8m (2016: £14.3m) 
includes £10.9m to update our portfolio 
of assets.
Banking arrangements
The Group is pleased to have continued 
its strong relationships with Royal Bank of 
Scotland, Lloyds TSB, Santander and Allied 
Irish following the last refinancing in July 2016 
when the Group agreed improvements to its 
banking facilities. The facility was extended to 
January 2019 and the cost of borrowing was 
reduced through a reduction in the interest 
rate. The four banks in the Group’s banking 
syndicate agreed on 28 March 2017 to defer 
repayment of the loan instalments due on 
1 April 2017 and on 10 October 2017 until 
January 2019. In total four loan repayments, 
which were due between 2016 and October 
2017 amounting to £21.6m, have been 
deferred. In addition, there is an uncommitted 
accordion facility of up to £30m which, 
together with the deferral of loan repayments, 
give further support to the Group’s acquisition 
strategy. It is planned to undertake the 
re-financing in the first half of 2018 when 
the most appropriate and cost effective 
types of funding will be considered.
The total of the Group’s current 
freehold property portfolio is £329m 
as at 30 September 2017 (2016: £304m). 
There was an independent valuation by 
Christie & Co of the Group’s property 
portfolio of £284m following the ground rent 
transaction in February 2016 and this increased 
by £20m in the period to September 2016 
due to the cost price of the freehold 
properties purchased in the two acquisitions 
and other freehold properties purchased. 
In the year to September 2017 freehold 
properties increased by £23.2m with the cost 
price of the Selborne Care Limited freehold 
properties being £12.3m and other properties 
purchased in the year £10.9m.
At 30 September 2017 the Group has 
available bank facilities totalling £195m which 
are sufficient, with cash flow from operating 
activities, to fund present commitments. 
The Bank loans not drawn are £16.1m and the 
£30.0m accordian facility has not been utilised.
Outlook
The Group is now in a better position 
than ever before to continue its growth as 
a pioneering provider of specialist social care 
services in a UK market which is continuing 
to grow yet remains fragmented.

* By invitation.
The Board holds other Board Meetings specifically for significant 
transactions involving raising money like the ground rent transaction, 
or spending money like a significant acquisition.
What decision-making responsibilities does the Board have?
Matters which are reserved to the Board for specific consideration 
and decision include:
 – financial reporting and controls including statutory matters 
such as the approval of final and interim financial statements 
and dividend declarations;
 – Board membership and other senior, key personnel, appointments;
 – review of corporate governance arrangements;
 – Group strategy matters including the approval of annual budgets, 
acquisitions and disposals;
 – review of the processes for monitoring and evaluating risk 
and the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control 
and operational efficiency;
 – review and supervision of treasury and financial policies; and
 – shareholder communications.
Matters are delegated to Board Committees, individual Directors 
or executive management where appropriate. The Directors believe 
the Board is soundly constituted although, at this stage of the Group’s 
development, it is felt the functions of a Nominations Committee 
can be adequately fulfilled by deliberation of the full Board; this will 
nevertheless be kept under review. When the need for an additional 
Non-Executive Director is identified the Board appoints advisers 
to nominate experienced relevant and appropriate candidates. 
Board members meet the candidates and come to a collective 
view on appointments.
Who is on the Audit Committee and what do they do?
The Audit Committee comprises Karl Monaghan (Chairman), 
Mike Adams and Jamie Cumming. The Group Finance Director and 
representatives of the external auditor attend meetings by invitation as 
required. The Committee meets at least twice each year and receives 
reports from the Company’s management and external auditor relating 
to the annual and interim accounts and the accounting and internal 
control systems throughout the Group. 
The Committee has direct and unrestricted access to the external 
auditor and reviews all services being provided by them to evaluate 
their independence and objectivity, taking into consideration relevant 
professional and regulatory requirements in order to ensure that said 
independence and objectivity are not impaired by the provision of 
permissible, non-audit services. The Committee has carefully 
considered the level of non-audit services and have concluded that 
this does not impact on the independence of the auditors. Details of 
the amount paid to the external auditor during the year, for audit and 
other services, are set out in note 6 to the financial statements.
Do we comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code?
The CareTech Board of Directors (the “Board”) remains committed 
to achieving the highest standards of integrity, ethics, professionalism 
and business practice throughout its operations.
We do not comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
However, we have reported on our corporate governance arrangements 
by drawing upon best practice available, including those aspects of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code we consider to be relevant to the 
Company and best practice.
In July 2016 Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) strengthened the existing 
UK market abuse framework by extending its scope to new markets, 
new platforms and new behaviours. It also contains prohibitions for 
insider dealing and market manipulation, and provisions to prevent 
and detect these.
At every Board meeting the Board of Directors covers an AIM 
continuing obligations questionnaire and declaration of connected 
party transactions.
This sets the tone for corporate behaviour and helps make our 
governance meaningful and focused on improving our business 
and protecting Shareholder Value.
Who is on our Board?
As Executive Chairman, Farouq Sheikh leads the Board and is 
responsible for its effective running. The Chief Executive is Haroon 
Sheikh and Michael Hill is the Group Finance Director. The Directors’ 
biographies appear on pages 30 to 31 and detail their experience 
and suitability for leading and managing the Group.
Karl Monaghan, the Senior Independent Director, Mike Adams and 
Jamie Cumming are the three Non-Executive Directors and the Board 
considers each of them as independent. Collectively, the Non-Executive 
Directors bring a valuable range of expertise and experience in 
assisting the Group to achieve its strategic aims.
In the furtherance of their duties, all Directors are able to take 
independent professional advice at the expense of the Company 
and those newly-appointed are made aware of their responsibilities 
by the Company Secretary. The Board approves the appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary.
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election 
at least every three years and new Directors are subject to election 
by shareholders at the first opportunity following their appointment.
How do we deal with conflicts of interest?
Following amendments to the Company’s Articles of Association in 
2008 to reflect certain provisions of the Companies Act 2006 relating 
to conflicts of interest that came into force on 1 October 2008, the 
Board will follow a specific procedure when deciding whether to 
authorise a conflict or potential conflict of interest. Firstly, only 
independent Directors (i.e. those that have no interest in the matter 
under consideration) will be able to take the relevant decision. 
Secondly, in taking the decision the Directors must act in a way they 
consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s 
success. In addition, the Directors will be able to impose limits or 
conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate. 
It remains the Board’s intention to report annually on the Company’s 
procedures for ensuring that the Board’s power of authorisation in 
respect of conflicts is operated effectively and that procedures have 
been followed.
Corporate Governance Report 
32 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Group has 150 adult services regulated by the Care Quality 
Commission (CQC) who assess the services against approved 
essential standards of quality and safety. The regulators test and 
publicly record whether services are compliant or non-compliant 
against those standards. 
The new monitoring system has four levels of CQC reporting 
outcomes and has been applied so far by CQC to all of our Adult 
Services. The National distribution across the four outcomes is 
shown in the table below with 97% of services being either “Good” 
or “Requires Improvement” is a service which has a requirement that 
needs to improve to achieve good. Above “Good” is Outstanding 
for 1% of services and below is “Inadequate” for 2%. For the Group’s 
services the published reports are as follows with the services in 
the outcomes as set out:
Ratings Outstanding Good
Requires 
improvement Inadequate
National 1% 71% 26% 2%
CareTech – 82% 17% 1%
Adult services in Wales are regulated under different national legislation 
and are not currently rated on any form of scale, though all are 
compliant.
Our Children division is regulated by the Office for Standards 
in Education (Ofsted) in England and these services are rated as 
Outstanding or Good under the old monitoring system. Since April 
2016 for Residential Services there is no longer an overall rating and 
services are rated under three domains and the Group has had 15 
published reports. The Fostering services in England are regulated 
by Ofsted and all three services are rated Good. In Wales the services 
are regulated by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales 
(CSSIW) and are not currently rated on any form of scale. The Care 
Inspectorate of Scotland who regulate both Adults and Children 
Services have the majority of the Group’s rated Residential Services 
as Excellent or Very Good for both the established services and the 
acquired services in Scotland.
The Care Governance and Safeguarding Committee has oversight 
of all issues and reports relating to the well-being of service users, 
commissions enquiries into matters of concern and ensures that the 
Executive Team operates to the highest possible level of professional 
care standards. Throughout the past year the Care Governance and 
Safeguarding Committee has invited operational managers, regulators 
and local safeguarding lead officers to attend its meetings.
The Care Governance and Safeguarding Committee works in close 
association with the Group’s internal regulatory compliance team who 
operate across all divisions, reporting direct to the CEO.
Have we maintained an effective relationship with our shareholders? 
The Board appreciates that effective communication with the 
Company’s shareholders and the investment community as a whole 
is a key objective.
The views of both institutional and private shareholders are important, 
and these can be varied and wide-ranging, as is their interest in the 
Company’s strategy, reputation and performance.
The Executive Chairman has overall responsibility for ensuring this 
communication is effectively conveyed and for making the Board fully 
aware of key shareholders’ views, comments and opinions.
Contact with investors throughout the year is a priority and the 
Board strives to look after their interests. General presentations to 
major shareholders following the publication of the Group’s annual 
and interim results are conducted by the Executive Chairman and the 
Group Finance Director as are regular meetings through the year with 
fund managers and investment analysts.
Who is on the Remuneration Committee and what do they do?
The composition and role of the Remuneration Committee is set out 
in the Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 39. Also detailed in that 
report are Directors’ remuneration, shareholdings and share options 
scheme information. 
A key Group strategy is to attract and retain talented and committed 
personnel at every level of the organisational hierarchy and the 
Committee aims to foster remuneration philosophy, policies and 
procedures to achieve this.
The Group operates in a highly competitive environment. For the 
Group to continue to compete successfully, it is essential that the 
level of remuneration and benefits offered achieve the objectives 
of attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding the necessary high 
calibre of individuals at all levels across the Group. During the year 
Deloitte LLP were commissioned to prepare a Benchmarking report 
which has been used to provide a useful analysis of the market for 
each element of pay.
The Group therefore sets out to provide competitive remuneration 
to all its employees, appropriate to the business environment in the 
market in which it operates. To achieve this, the remuneration package 
is based upon the following principles:
 – total rewards should be set to provide a fair and attractive 
remuneration package;
 – appropriate elements of the remuneration package should be 
designed to reinforce the link between performance and reward; 
and
 – Executive Directors’ incentives should be aligned with the interests 
of shareholders.
The remuneration strategy is designed to be in line with the Group’s 
fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and to support the 
Group’s corporate strategy. A cohesive reward structure consistently 
applied and with links to corporate performance, is seen as critical 
in ensuring attainment of the Group’s strategic goals.
Who is on the Care Governance and Safeguarding Committee 
and what do they do?
The Care Governance and Safeguarding Committee is chaired by 
Mike Adams and the other members of the Board Committee are Karl 
Monaghan and Jamie Cumming plus the Chief Operating Officer John 
Ivers and the Director of Compliance and Regulation Amanda Sherlock.
The Committee was formed because the Board is sensitive to the 
public’s increased awareness and anxiety about care governance and 
safeguarding. In 2013 the Whistleblowing “Tell Us” Campaign was 
introduced by this Committee and it is pioneering because it provides 
direct access to the CEO.
The Group has always been regarded as a careful and thoughtful 
provider of care and the Committee was formed to closely examine 
and pursue improvements to all matters relating to the care 
governance and the safeguarding of those we support, including 
health and safety, across the Group. Last year it included external 
attendees to its meetings such as the Head of Safeguarding for 
Hertfordshire County Council and received external presentations 
such as Conflict Management from Maybo to help the Committee 
understand best practice and in 2017 met with CQC. 
We have held several useful meetings with regulators and also 
invited key regulation managers to attend our Care Governance 
and Safeguarding Committee. The Committee is seen as a pioneering 
initiative that has won friends and encouragement from regulators and 
commissioners alike. The Committee brings Non-Executive Directors 
into a much closer relationship with our everyday work and they have 
adopted a robust scrutiny approach to care practice. This in itself has 
had a positive impact on care quality and the executive team has been 
encouraged to introduce quality initiatives across the Company.
Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 33 The processes used by the Board to review the effectiveness of the 
system of internal controls include the following:
 – annual budgets are prepared for each operating business. Monthly 
management reporting focuses on actual performance against 
these budgets for each operating business;
 – management reports and external audit reports on the system 
of internal controls and any material control weaknesses that 
are identified;
 – discussions with management including discussions on the actions 
taken on problem areas identified by Board members or in the 
external audit reports;
 – policies and procedures for such matters as delegation of 
authorities, capital expenditure and treasury management as well 
as regular updates;
 – review of the adequacy of the level of experienced and professional 
staff throughout the business and the expertise of individual staff 
members so that they are capable of carrying out their individual 
delegated responsibilities; and
 – review of the external audit work plans.
By order of the Board
Michael Hill
Company Secretary
18 December 2017
Robust year-on-year dividend growth is an objective and all shareholders 
are encouraged to attend the Company’s Annual General Meeting, 
which all Board members attend, as this provides an opportunity 
to address questions to the Directors.
The Group’s annual and interim reports are sent to all shareholders and 
all results, Company announcements and related investor information 
can be accessed via the Group’s website, www.caretech-uk.com. 
The website is under constant review in an effort to maximise the 
effectiveness of information made available to shareholders.
How do we manage our internal controls and risks?
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The role of management is 
to implement Board policies on risk and control. The system of internal 
controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
of the achievement of business objectives. In pursuing these objectives, 
internal controls can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The recent challenging business climate has resulted in a sustained 
focus on the approach to risk. The Directors consider robust risk 
management to be crucial to the Group’s success and give a high 
priority to ensuring that adequate systems are in place to evaluate 
and limit risk exposure. They have overseen the further development 
of processes and procedures for identifying, analysing and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group. These risks have been 
discussed in the Strategic Report on pages 12 to 19. These processes 
have been implemented during the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of this annual report and financial statements. 
The processes and procedures are regularly reviewed by the Board.
A process of control and hierarchical reporting provides for a 
documented and auditable trail of accountability. These procedures 
are relevant across all Group operations: they provide for successive 
assurances to be given at increasingly higher levels of management 
and, finally, to the Board.
In 2018 there will be changes to the governance of data and the 
new General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) will change how 
the Group manages, protects and administers data. A team of Senior 
Managers are looking at how data flows in and out, and where it is 
stored throughout the Group.

and/or concerns may be taken into account in taking decisions which 
may affect their interests, and to encouraging their participation in 
schemes through which they will benefit from the Group’s progress 
and profitability. CareTech aims to foster a working environment in 
which all employees are treated with courtesy and respect and seeks 
at all times to provide opportunities to develop and reach their 
full potential.
The Group established a new sharesave share option scheme for 
eligible employees in 2016, details of which can be found in note 20 
along with options remaining on previous schemes. The Board feels 
that share ownership among employees fosters team spirit and 
motivation and will contribute to the ultimate success of the Group.
It is the Group’s policy to ensure that disabled persons are treated fairly 
and consistently in terms of recruitment, training, career development 
and promotion and that their employment opportunities should be 
based on a realistic assessment of their aptitudes and abilities. 
Wherever possible, the Group will continue the employment of 
persons who become disabled during the course of their employment 
through retraining, acquisition of special aids and/or equipment or the 
provision of suitable alternative employment.

The Company maintains appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries and reviewing the year end balance 
sheet position, the Directors have reasonable expectations that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the 
next 12 months. The Group has prepared detailed budgets and cash 
flow forecasts and have considered the capital and working capital 
requirements. There are a number of Banking Covenants which ratchet 
depending upon time and Group performance. The Directors forecast 
that they are able to meet all banking covenants which are reviewed 
regularly. For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Directors’ Report continued
36 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The following comprised the principal elements of remuneration 
for Executive Directors and Executive Management for the year 
under review:
 – basic salary;
 – bonus;
 – benefits, including car allowance, vehicle expenses and healthcare 
insurance; and
 – pension contribution.
The remuneration for Non-Executive Directors is set by the full Board 
on the recommendation of the Executive Directors. Non-Executive 
Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company’s bonus 
or share option schemes.
During the year Deloitte LLP were commissioned to prepare a 
Benchmarking report which provided for each benchmarking group 
a quartile analysis of the different elements of pay for a number of 
management roles and Non-Executive Director roles.
Bonuses paid in 2017 and 2016 to Executive Directors are triggered 
by the achievement of Underlying EBITDA targets.
The potential Bonus for the financial year 2017/18 will be triggered 
by Underlying EBITDA and also comprises other measures of quality, 
EPS and occupancy.
Directors’ service agreements
All Executive Directors’ service contracts are subject to 12 months’ 
notice of termination on either side.
The Non-Executive Directors have each been appointed under 
contracts which are subject to three months’ notice of termination 
on either side.
The Remuneration Committee comprises three Non-Executive 
Directors, Jamie Cumming (Chairman), Karl Monaghan and Mike 
Adams, and meets at least twice each year. The Company Secretary, 
Michael Hill, is the secretary of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee members have no personal financial interest, 
other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. They have 
no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or from being 
involved in the day-to-day business of the Group. They do not 
participate in any bonus, share option or pension arrangements.
The Committee’s principal duties are to review the scale and structure 
of the remuneration and service contracts for Executive Directors 
and Senior Management and it also administers the Company’s share 
option schemes.
The Committee takes into consideration environmental, social 
and governance (“ESG”) issues, in relation to corporate performance, 
when setting the remuneration of Executive Directors and takes steps 
to ensure that the incentive structure for Senior Management does 
not raise ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Remuneration Policy
CareTech’s remuneration policy is to provide for each of its Executive 
Directors and key personnel a package which is adequate to attract, 
retain and motivate individuals of the appropriate calibre, whilst at 
the same time not paying more than is necessary for this purpose.
The Remuneration Committee has the objective of ensuring that 
remuneration packages are offered which:
 – are set at a level reflecting the competitive market in which the 
Group operates;
 – have a significant part of remuneration linked to the achievement 
of performance targets;
 – have due regard to actual and expected market conditions;
 – are structured in accordance with the interests of shareholders; and
 – foster the development of a high-performance culture across 
the Group.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have to prepare 
the financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs and profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 – state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
40 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
 – the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in 
the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
 – the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s or the parent Company’s ability to continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of 
at least 12 months from the date when the financial statements 
are authorised for issue.
Overview of our audit approach
 – Overall materiality: £1.58m, which represents 4% of the Group’s 
underlying EBITDA.
 – Key audit matters were identified as completeness of revenue, 
capitalisation of plant, property and equipment and capitalisation 
of development costs. 
 – We performed a full scope audit of the financial information 
of the UK head office, in respect of the parent Company and 
the Group consolidation. 
 – There were no key changes in the scope of the audit from 
the prior year.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, 
were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of 
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the 
overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as 
a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of CareTech Holdings PLC 
(the “parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year 
ended 30 September 2017 which comprise the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow, the Company Statement 
of Financial Position, the Company Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Company Statement of Cash Flow and notes to the financial 
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and, as regards the parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 – the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group and the parent Company in accordance with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion.
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 41
Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of CareTech Holdings PLC Key audit matter – Group How the matter was addressed in the audit Key observations
Completeness of revenue 
Revenue is comprised of a number of different revenue 
streams, including the provision of care services, 
fostering services and learning services. 
The Group’s revenue has increased from £149.0m 
to £166.0m as a result of:
 – The acquisition of ROC North West Limited and 
Oakleaf Care (Hartwell) Limited in the prior period 
whereby a full year of revenue has been recognised 
in the current year. 
 – The acquisition of Selbourne Care Limited in the 
current year.
 – Organic growth within the core care and fostering 
services.
Due to the nature of the occupancy and billing 
processes and systems and the significant number 
of sites within the Group, we identified completeness of 
revenue as a significant risk, which was one of the most 
significant assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
 – We tested the design and implementation of key 
controls around the revenue cycle including the 
admissions and discharge process for service users. 
 – For a sample of both new and existing service users, 
we agreed the receipt of revenue to remittance 
advice from Local Authorities. 
 – We performed substantive analytical procedures 
on revenue based on occupancy numbers across 
the Group.
 – We tested credit notes raised during the year and 
subsequent to the year-end to confirm there was 
no gross up of revenues. 
The Group’s accounting policy on revenue 
recognition is shown in note 2(m) to the financial 
statements and related disclosures are included 
in note 4. 
Our testing did not 
identify any material 
misstatements in relation 
to the completeness 
of revenue.
Capitalisation of plant, property and equipment
The Group’s net book value of plant, property and 
equipment increased from £267.7m in 2016 to £297.2m 
in 2017. There were additions in the year totalling 
£35.2m (£17.6m of which related to the acquisition 
of Selbourne Care Limited during the year). 
The Group invests significant amounts in plant, 
property and equipment annually and therefore there 
is a risk that a material error could occur if items have 
been incorrectly capitalised. We therefore identified 
capitalisation of plant, property and equipment as a 
significant risk, which was one of the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
 – We agreed a sample of capital expenditure in the 
year to supporting documentation and confirmed 
that the accounting treatment was appropriate and 
in accordance with the requirements of IAS 16 
‘Property, Plant and Equipment’.
 – We agreed that appropriate de-recognition of assets 
has occurred when replacement or refurbishment 
projects have taken place in the year.
 – We obtained finance and operating lease schedules 
and agreed that new leases were correctly 
recognised in line with third party documentation.
The Group’s accounting policy on plant, property 
and equipment is shown in note 2(d) to the financial 
statements and related disclosures are included 
in note 12. 
Our testing did not 
identify any material 
misstatements in the 
capitalisation of plant, 
property and equipment 
during the year. 
Capitalisation of development costs
The Group capitalises development costs within 
software and licences The amount capitalised 
in the year amounted to £3.4m (2016: £3.6m).
The capitalisation of development costs under 
IAS 38 involves judgement and therefore there is 
a risk that a material error could occur if items have 
been incorrectly capitalised. We therefore identified 
capitalisation of development costs as a significant risk, 
which was one of the most significant assessed risks 
of material misstatement. 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
 – We agreed that the development costs meet the 
criteria for capitalisation stated within IAS 38 
‘Intangible Assets’.
 – We gained an understanding of the projects under 
development through the analysis of papers 
prepared by management to agree these projects 
meet the recognition criteria under IAS 38. 
 – We confirmed that salaries were capitalised in 
accordance with IAS 38, in particular that the 
developments meet the technical and commercial 
feasibility criteria.
 – We agreed, on a sample basis, relevant payroll costs 
to payroll records. 
Our testing did not 
identify any material 
misstatements in the 
capitalisation of 
development costs 
during the year.
42 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of CareTech Holdings PLC continued Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
work and in evaluating the results of that work. 
Materiality was determined as follows: 
Materiality measure Group Parent
Financial statements 
as a whole 
We determined materiality for the audit of the Group 
financial statements as a whole to be £1.6m, which 
is 4% (2016: £1.9m, which is 5%) of the Group’s 
underlying operating profit stated before depreciation, 
amortisation of intangible assets, and share-based 
payments charge (EBITDA). This benchmark is 
considered the most appropriate because of the 
nature of the listing of the Group on the AIM market 
and hence the focus by various stakeholders on this 
balance. Underlying EBITDA represents a key 
performance measure for the Group and due to 
the non-recurring nature of the exceptional items, 
we consider it appropriate that these are excluded. 
This approach is consistent with prior year.
We determined materiality for the audit of the parent 
Company financial statements to be £1.5m, which is 0.5% 
(2016: £1.3m, which is 0.5%) of the parent’s total assets. 
This benchmark is considered the most appropriate as the 
parent Company does not trade. 
Performance 
materiality used to 
drive the extent of 
our testing
Materiality for the current year is lower than the level 
that we determined for the year ended 30 September 
2016 to reflect emerging market practice and guidance 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
We use a different level of materiality, performance 
materiality, to drive the extent of our testing and this 
was set at 60% of financial statement materiality for 
the audit of the Group financial statements.
Materiality for the current year is higher than the level that 
we determined for the year ended 30 September 2016 
based on the increased level of total assets.
We use a different level of materiality, performance 
materiality, to drive the extent of our testing and this was 
set at 60% of financial statement materiality for the audit 
of the parent company financial statements.
Specific materiality We also determine a lower level of specific materiality 
for certain areas such as Directors’ remuneration and 
related party transactions. 
We also determine a lower level of specific materiality 
for certain areas such as related party transactions.
Communication of 
misstatements to the 
Audit Committee
We determined the threshold at which we will 
communicate misstatements to the Audit Committee 
to be £79,000. In addition we will communicate 
misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, 
warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
We determined the threshold at which we will 
communicate misstatements to the Audit Committee 
to be £74,000. In addition we will communicate 
misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, 
warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 43
Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough 
understanding of the Group’s business, its environment and risk profile 
and in particular include: 
 – Evaluation by the Group audit team of identified components 
to assess the significance of that component and to determine 
the planned audit response based on a measure of materiality, 
considering each as a percentage of total Group assets, liabilities, 
revenues and underlying EBITDA. 
 – Management prepare and report on the results on a Group basis 
rather than on a Company basis, all of which conduct activities 
within the UK. The subsidiaries in the Group are 100% controlled 
by CareTech Holdings PLC and the Company provides a guarantee 
for all the subsidiary liabilities apart from a limited number of 
subsidiaries as stated in note 14 of the financial statements. 
All accounting records and the finance team are located at head 
office within a shared service centre and accordingly, our work 
was conducted there. At the parent entity level, we have also 
tested the consolidation process. 
 – We evaluated controls over the financial reporting systems 
identified as part of our risk assessment and addressed critical 
accounting matters. We tested the controls around revenue 
recognition and operating expenses to confirm the controls were 
designed and operating effectively. We then undertook substantive 
testing on significant transactions and material account balances.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other 
information comprises the information included in the annual report 
set out on pages 1 to 40, other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does 
not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such 
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are 
required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in 
the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report under the Companies 
Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the 
parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic 
Report or the Directors’ Report. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit 
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
set out on page 40 the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible 
for assessing the Group’s and the parent Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part 
of our auditor’s report.

48 CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow
for the year ended 30 September 2017 1 Background and basis of preparation
CareTech Holdings PLC (the ”Company”) is a company registered and 
domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements 
of the Company for the year ended 30 September 2017 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in GBP (£), 
which is the Company’s functional currency, rounded to the nearest 
thousand. The parent Company financial statements on pages 74 to 80 
present information about the Company as a separate entity and not 
about its Group.
The consolidated financial statements were approved for release 
by the Board of Directors on 18 December 2017
Going concern
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Statement 
and Performance Review on pages 10 to 11 and pages 20 to 23. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 26 to 29. In addition, note 24 to the financial statements includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, 
its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk, 
interest rate risk and liquidity risk. As highlighted in that note, the Group 
meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through a mixture 
of bank facilities which are sufficient, with cash flow from profits, to 
fund present commitments. Term facilities are utilised to fund capital 
expenditure and short-term flexibility is achieved by the utilisation of 
cash resources in respect of financial liabilities, which are shown in 
the table in note 24 and indicates their contractual cash flow maturities. 
There are a number of Banking Covenants which ratchet depending 
on time and Group performance. The Directors forecast that they 
are able to meet all Banking Covenants which are reviewed regularly.
An extension to the existing bank facilities was agreed with our 
bankers in 2016. The facility which was due to expire in January 2017 
has been extended to January 2019. The cost of borrowing has been 
reduced through a reduction to the interest rate and four loan 
repayments, which were due between April 2017 and October 2017 
amounting to £21.6m, have been deferred. In addition, there is a new 
uncommitted accordion facility of up to £30m which, together with 
the deferral of loan repayments, gives further support to the Group’s 
acquisition strategy.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
next 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. 
The Group has prepared detailed budgets and cash flow forecasts 
and has considered the capital and working capital requirements. 
Thus the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
2 Accounting policies
(a) Applicable Accounting Standards
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”) and those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 relevant to those companies which report 
in accordance with IFRS. 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, 
been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group 
financial statements.
New and revised accounting standards applied for the first time in the 
current year
The Group has adopted the following new standards, or net provisions 
of amended standards:
 – Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle
 – Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011–2013 Cycle
There has been no material impact on either amounts reported or 
disclosure in the financial statements arising from first time adoption. 
Adopted IFRS not yet applied
At the date of authorization of these financial statements, certain 
new standards, amendment and interpretations to existing standards 
have been publishing by the IASB but are not yet effective and have 
not been applied early by the Group. Management anticipates that 
the following pronouncements relevant to the Group’s operation 
will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policies for the first 
period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement, 
once adopted by the EU:
 – IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
 – IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(effective 1 January 2018)
 – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation 
and Amortisation (Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38) 
(effective 1 January 2017)
 – Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012–2014 Cycle 
(effective 1 January 2017)
 – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation 
of Financial Statements (effective 1 January 2017)
 – IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
 – Clarification and Measurement of Share-based Payment 
Transactions (Amendment to IFRS 2) (not yet adopted by the EU)
 – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 7 (not yet adopted 
by the EU) 
IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 for accounting periods commencing on or 
after 1 January 2017 and from the perspective of the Group as lessee 
will require (subject to certain practical expedients) most of the Group’s 
lease obligations (including the recent sale and leaseback transaction) 
to be reflected on balance sheet with a corresponding asset reflecting 
the right to use the underlying leased asset.
Management are currently performing a detailed review of the 
Group’s lease arrangements and are deciding on how IFRS 16 will 
be implemented and are considering which practical expedients might 
apply and whether or not the standard will be implemented on a full 
or partial retrospective basis. The full impact of IFRS 16 is therefore 
not yet known.
The Group’s current lease accounting policy and lease disclosures 
are included in notes 17 and 25. 
There are other standards and interpretations in issue but these 
are not considered to be relevant to the Group.
The Directors expect that the adoption of the standards listed below, 
other than IFRS 16, will not have a material impact on the financial 
information of the Group in future reporting periods. This includes 
both IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers. 
(b) Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis 
except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair 
value and contingent consideration is stated at fair value through 
profit or loss.
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 49
Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements (e) Intangible assets and goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the 
acquisition method as described in note (r). Goodwill represents the 
excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired on acquisition of 
subsidiaries. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold 
separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether 
those rights are separable.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised 
but is tested annually for impairment.
Negative goodwill (bargain purchase credit) arising on an acquisition 
is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
 – customer relationships 1–20 years; and
 – software and licences  5 years.
(f) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
The cost of inventories is based on a first-in first-out cost basis.
(g) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits 
with maturities of three months or less from inception.
(h) Financial Instruments
Recognition, initial measurement and derecognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument 
and are measured initially at fair value adjusted by transactions costs, 
except for those carried at fair value through profit or loss which are 
measured initially at fair value. Subsequent measurement of financial 
assets and financial liabilities are described below.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the 
cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset 
and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is 
derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets are 
classified into the following categories upon initial recognition:
 – loans and receivables; and
 – financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
All financial assets except for those at FVTPL are subject to review 
for impairment at least at each reporting date to identify whether there 
is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired. Different criteria to determine impairment are applied 
for each category of financial assets, which are described below. 
All income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognised 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income are presented 
within finance costs or finance income, except for impairment of trade 
receivables which is presented within other administrative expenses.
2 Accounting policies (continued)
(c) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent 
Company and all of its subsidiaries as of 30 September 2017. All 
subsidiaries have a reporting date of 30 September. All transactions 
and balances between Group companies are eliminated on 
consolidation, including unrealised gains and losses on transactions 
between Group companies. Where unrealised losses on intra-Group 
asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also 
tested for impairment from a Group perspective. Amounts reported 
in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies 
adopted by the Group.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition 
of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of 
materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to 
bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use 
and capitalised borrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral 
to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part 
of that equipment.
The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant 
and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item 
if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within 
the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured 
reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is 
derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, 
plant and equipment are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different 
useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant 
and equipment and depreciated separately.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance 
leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting 
treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the 
buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated 
at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Lease payments 
are accounted for as described in note (n).
Depreciation is charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income over the estimated useful lives of each part 
of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. 
The Directors reassess the residual value estimates, particularly in 
respect of properties, on an annual basis. The estimated useful lives 
are as follows:
 – freehold buildings  2% straight-line to residual value;
 – long leasehold property  over the life of the lease;
 – short leasehold property  over the life of the lease;
 – fixtures, fittings and equipment 15% straight line; and
 – motor vehicles 25% reducing balance.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued Derivative financial instruments.
From time to time, the Group enters into derivative financial 
instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure 
to interest rate risk. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative 
is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value 
at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is 
recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative 
fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
immediately. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or 
non-current liability if the Group has an unconditional right to defer 
payment beyond 12 months. Otherwise derivatives are presented 
as current assets or liabilities.
(i) Impairment (excluding deferred tax assets)
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated.
For goodwill and assets that have an indefinite useful life, the 
recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount 
of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of 
the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash-generating unit 
is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows 
that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried 
at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated 
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset 
that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit 
to which the asset belongs.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
After initial recognition, these are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Discounting 
is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group’s 
cash and cash equivalents, trade and most other receivables fall into 
this category of financial instruments. Individually significant 
receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or 
when other objective evidence is received that a specific counterparty 
will default. Receivables that are not considered to be individually 
impaired are reviewed for impairment in groups, which are determined 
by reference to shared credit risk characteristics. The impairment loss 
estimate is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates 
for each identified group.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets that are either classified 
as held for trading or that meet certain conditions and are designated 
at FVTPL upon initial recognition. All derivative financial instruments 
fall into this category. Assets in this category are measured at fair 
value with gains or losses recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. The fair values of financial assets in this 
category are determined by reference to active market transactions 
or using a valuation technique where no active market exists.
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other 
payables and derivative financial instruments. Financial liabilities are 
measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, except for financial liabilities held for trading or designated 
at FVTPL, that are carried subsequently at fair value with gains or losses 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
All derivative financial instruments that are not designated and effective 
as hedging instruments are accounted for at FVTPL.
All interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument’s 
fair value that are reported in consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income are included within finance costs or finance income.
From time to time, the long-term debts held by the Group are either 
refinanced as these come to maturity or the margin on these facilities 
moves in line with the ratio of the Group’s net debt to EBITDA. In either 
scenario, the Group reviews whether the debt is accounted for as a 
modification or an extinguishment of the liability. A substantial 
modification should be accounted for as an extinguishment of the 
existing liability and the recognition of a new liability. A non-substantial 
modification should be accounted for as an adjustment to the existing 
liability. Both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the 
modification are taken into account to ascertain whether the 
medication is substantial and these can include the change in 
covenants, repayment dates and the effective interest rate. If 
modification accounting is adopted, the carrying value of the existing 
liability is adjusted for fees paid or costs incurred and the effective 
interest rate is amended at the modification date. If extinguishment 
accounting is adopted, the existing liability is de-recognised and the 
new or modified liability is recognised at its fair value, the gain or loss 
equal to the difference between the carrying value of the old liability 
and the fair value of the new one is recognised, any incremental costs 
or fees incurred and any consideration paid or received is recognised 
in profit or loss and a new effective interest rate for the modified 
liability is calculated and used in future periods.

Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements Share-based payment transactions
The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised 
as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over 
the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an 
option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised on 
exercise as an expense is adjusted to take into account an estimate of 
the number of shares that are expected to vest as well as to reflect the 
actual number of share options that vest, except where forfeiture is 
due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
Options lapsed are expunged from the relevant scheme.
Employee Benefit Trust 
The assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) have 
been included in the consolidated financial statements. Any assets 
held by the EBT cease to be recognised on the consolidated 
statement of financial position when the assets vest unconditionally 
in identified beneficiaries. 
The costs of purchasing own shares held by the EBT are shown as 
a deduction against equity. The proceeds from the sale of own shares 
held increase equity. Neither the purchase nor sale of own shares leads 
to a gain or loss being recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. 
(l) Provisions
A provision, other than provisions for deferred taxation, is recognised 
in the balance sheet where a reliable estimate can be made when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions 
are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash 
flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate.
(m) Revenue
Revenue in respect of the provision of care services is measured as 
the fair value of fee income received or receivable in respect of the 
services provided and is recognised in respect of the care that has 
been provided in the relevant period. Any additional services provided 
by the Group are recognised on provision of the service. Fostering 
revenue is recognised on the basis of the daily placements made with 
a full day’s revenue recognised for every night a placement is with a 
foster carer. 
Revenue in respect of learning services is directly linked to specific 
achievements, and milestones reached by apprentices at which 
point the funding from the Skills Funding Agency is receivable and 
recognised. A corresponding balance is recognised in receivables.
Income which has been invoiced but is irrecoverable is treated as a 
bad debt expense. Revenue invoiced in advance is included in deferred 
income until the service is provided. Revenue is recognised net of VAT 
and credit notes. 
2 Accounting policies (continued)
Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised 
cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can 
be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss 
was recognised. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when 
there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist 
or there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.
(j) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less 
directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any 
difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value being recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings on 
an effective interest basis.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the reporting date.
Interest on qualifying assets is capitalised in accordance with IAS 23 
borrowing costs. Refer to note 8.
(k) Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans 
are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income as incurred.
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an 
undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. 
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under 
short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result 
of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued (n) Expenses
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge 
and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is 
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a 
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items are events or transactions which, in the opinion 
of the Directors, by virtue of size and incidence are disclosed separately 
in order to improve a reader’s understanding of the financial 
statements. Details are included in note 5.
Financing costs
Financing costs, comprising interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts, 
finance charges on finance leases, the unwinding of the discount on 
provisions and the costs incurred in connection with the arrangement 
of borrowings are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income using the effective interest method.
Interest payable is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income as it accrues, using the effective interest 
method. Financing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost 
of that asset.
Financing costs also include losses arising on the change in fair value 
of derivatives that are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
(o) Operating leases
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(p) Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred 
tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly 
in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the 
expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax 
rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following 
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of 
goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, 
and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent 
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to 
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. The carrying amounts of 
deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
(q) Underlying EBITDA and underlying earnings per share
EBITDA is operating profit stated before depreciation, amortisation 
of intangible assets and share-based payments charge and is the key 
profit measure used by the Board to assess the trading performance 
of the Group as a whole.
A measure of underlying earnings and underlying earnings per share 
has been presented in order to present the earnings of the Group after 
non-underlying items which are not considered to impact an 
assessment of the trading performance of the Group.
(r) Business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business 
combinations. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain 
control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date 
fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity 
interests issued by the Group, which includes the fair value of any 
asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
The calculation of contingent consideration is based on the provisions 
included in the sale and purchase agreement of each acquisition and 
is updated if circumstances change. Acquisition costs are expensed 
as incurred. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally 
measured at their acquisition-date fair values.
(s) Sale and leaseback 
A sale and leaseback transaction is one where the Group sells an asset 
and immediately reacquires the use of the asset by entering into a lease 
with the buyer. The accounting treatment of the sale and leaseback 
depends upon the substance of the transaction (by applying the lease 
classification principles described in note (d)) and whether or not the 
sale was made at the asset’s fair value.
For sale and finance leasebacks, any profit from the sale is deferred 
and amortised over the lease term. For sale and operating leasebacks, 
generally the assets are sold at fair value, and accordingly the profit 
or loss from the sale is recognised immediately in the Group profit 
and loss account.
CareTech Holdings PLC – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 53
Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements 3 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions which affect the application of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the 
Directors have made the following estimates and judgements which 
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements:
Goodwill
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which 
goodwill has a value which will benefit the performance of the Group 
over future periods. To assist in making this judgement, the Directors 
undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of 
the Group’s capitalised goodwill, using discounted cash flow forecasts 
to derive the “value in use” to the Group of the capitalised goodwill. 
In the assessment undertaken in 2017 value in use was derived from 
discounted 10- to 20-year cash flow projections using a year-on-year 
growth rate of 0% and discount rates relevant to the cost of capital 
adjusted for risks associated with the cash-generating unit. The 
projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate 
period over which to view the future results of the Group’s businesses 
for this purpose. Changes to the assumptions of discount rates, growth 
rates, expected changes to costs and selling prices used in making 
these forecasts could significantly alter the Directors’ assessment 
of the carrying value of goodwill.
Customer relationships
The Group’s management team assess each acquisition in the historical 
financial information period to identify the intangible assets that were 
acquired in each transaction that qualify for separate recognition. 
The assessment of the future economic benefits generated from 
acquired customer relationships, and the determination of the related 
amortisation profile, involves a significant degree of judgement based 
on management estimation of future potential revenue and profit 
and the useful lives of the assets. The valuation method used to value 
customer relationships is a multi-period excess earnings method. The 
useful economic life has been assessed as ranging from 1 to 20 years 
across the acquisitions. Annual reviews are performed to ensure the 
recoverability of this intangible asset.
Property, plant and equipment
It is Group policy to depreciate property, plant and equipment items 
to their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives. 
This applies an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the 
capital costs of delivery of services. A key element of this policy is the 
annual estimate of the residual value of such assets and in particular 
of freehold property. Similarly the Directors estimate the useful life 
applied to each category of property, plant and equipment which, in 
turn, determines the annual depreciation charge. Variations in residual 
values or asset lives could impact significantly Group profit through 
an increase in the depreciation charge.
Contingent consideration payable on a business combination
When, as part of a business combination, the Group defers a 
proportion of the total purchase consideration payable for an 
acquisition, the amount provided for is the acquisition date fair value 
of the consideration. Changes in estimated contingent consideration 
payable on acquisition are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement unless they are measurement period adjustments which 
arise as a result of additional information obtained after the acquisition 
date about the facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date, 
which are adjusted against carried goodwill. Contingent consideration 
that is classified as equity is not re-measured and subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity.
Judgements
Current asset provisions
In the course of normal trading activities, judgement is used to 
establish the net realisable value of various elements of working 
capital, principally trade receivables. Provisions are established for 
bad and doubtful debts. Provisions are based on the facts available 
at the time and are also determined by using profiles, based upon 
past practice, applied to aged receivables.
In estimating the collectability of trade receivables, judgement 
is required assessing their likely realisation, including the current 
creditworthiness of each customer and related ageing of past due 
balances. Specific accounts are assessed in situations where a 
customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to 
deterioration of its financial condition, credit ratings or bankruptcy.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued 4 Segmental information
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). 
The CODM has been determined to be the Chief Executive Officer as he is primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments 
and the assessment of the performance of each of the segments.
The CODM uses underlying EBITDA as reviewed at monthly Executive Committee and Performance meetings as the key measure of the 
segments’ results as it reflects the segments’ underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation. Underlying EBITDA is a consistent 
measure within the Group.
Inter-segment revenue between the operating segments is not material.
Our two key segments are Adult Services (Adult) and Children Services (Children). Adult Services comprises the Adult Learning Disabilities (ALD) 
and Specialist Services (SS) divisions and the Children Services comprises Young People Residential Services (YPR), Foster Care (FC) and Learning 
Services (Learning).
There has been no aggregation of the operating segments in arriving at these reportable segments. 
The segment results for the year ended 30 September 2017, for the year ended 30 September 2016 and the reconciliation of the segment 
measures to the respective statutory items included in the consolidated financial information are as follows:

All operations of the Group are carried out in the UK, the Company’s country of domicile. All revenues therefore arise within the UK and all 
non-current assets are likewise located in the UK. No single external customer amounts to 10% or more of the Group’s revenues.
No asset and liability information is presented above as this information is not allocated to operating segments in the regular reporting to the Group’s 
Chief Operating Decision Maker and is not a measure used by the CODM to assess performance and to make resource allocation decisions.

(i)  The Group incurred a number of exceptional costs relating to the integration of recent acquisitions and the reorganisation of the internal operating 
and management structure and redundancy costs totalling £2,852,000 (2016: £1,780,000). Included in the cash flow statement are acquisition expenses 
of £806,000 (2016: £660,000) and integration and reorganisation costs of £2,852,000 (2016: £1,780,000), which were paid in the year.
(ii)  The present value of the future cash flows receivable from the operation of certain leased assets has been assessed as being lower than the present value 
of the rental payments to which the Group is committed. Therefore, the Group has provided for £287,000 (2016: £nil) being the present value of any onerous 
element of the remaining lease life. 
(iii)  Non-underlying items relating to derivative financial instruments include the movements during the year in the fair value of the Group’s interest rate swaps which 
are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore do not qualify for hedge accounting, together with the quarterly cash settlement, and accrual thereof.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill
The Group tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis by considering the recoverable amount of individual cash-generating units against 
carrying value.
Cash-generating units comprise operating segments. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for impairment by management. 
There are no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (other than goodwill).
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit has been calculated with reference to value in use. 
The key assumptions for the period over which management approved forecasts are based and, beyond this, for the value in use calculations 
overall, are those regarding discount rates, growth and occupancy rates, achievement of future revenues, expected changes in direct costs during 
the periods and residual values of freehold properties (which include an assumption for the growth of the House Prices Index of 2% per annum 
and that residual values will be 75% of the indexed market value). In arriving at the values assigned to each key assumption management make 
reference to past experience and external sources of information regarding the future – for example changes in tax rates. The assumptions have 
been reviewed in light of the current economic and public spending environment. The key features of these calculations are shown below:
2017 2016
Period over which management approved forecasts are based 1 year 1 year
Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 0% 0%
Pre-tax discount rate
Adult Learning Disabilities division 8% 8%
Specialist Services division 10% 10%
Young People Residential Services division 8–12% 8–12%
Foster Care division 8–12% 8–12%
Learning Services division 12% 12%
In preparing value in use calculations for cash-generating units, cash flow periods of between 10 and 20 years have been used in order to match 
the period of goodwill with the average period of time service users are expected to remain in their relevant home. The discount rates used in 
each value in use calculation have been based upon divisional specific risk taking account of factors such as the nature of service user need, 
cost profiles and the barriers to entry into each market segment as well as other macro-economic factors.
The Directors believe that, even in the current economic and public spending environment and taking into account the nature of the Group’s 
operations, any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the cash-
generating units’ carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill is split between the following cash-generating units:

(1)  The margin on the facilities has initially been set at 2.75% over LIBOR but reduces based on the ratio of the Group’s net debt to EBITDA. The overall margin 
in the year is 2.25% over LIBOR. The Group have reviewed the present value of the cash flows under the new margin and determined the modification to not 
be substantial under IAS 39. Hence the modification has been accounted for as an adjustment to the existing liability. 
At 30 September 2017 the Group has available bank facilities totalling £195m, sufficient, with cash flow from profits, to fund present commitments. 
Term facilities are used to fund capital expenditure and short-term flexibility is achieved by the utilisation of cash resources.
The term loans are secured by way of a charge over certain assets, primarily property, plant and equipment of the Group.

Defined contribution plans 
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was £976,000 (2016: £867,000) of which £nil (2016: £37,000) was outstanding 
at the year end.
Share-based payments
The Company operates four share option schemes: The CareTech Holdings 2005 Approved Share Option Scheme (“The Approved Scheme”); 
the CareTech Holdings 2005 Unapproved Share Option Scheme (“The Unapproved Scheme”); the CareTech Holdings 2005 Share-Save Scheme; 
and the CareTech Holdings 2016 Share-Save Scheme. 
The Executive Shared Ownership Plan (“ExSOP”) was formed in March 2016. Under the provisions of the ExSOP, shares (the “ExSOP shares”) 
are jointly owned by nominated senior employees and by an employees’ share trust. The ExSOP awards are subject to a time-related performance 
condition measured over a three-year period beginning with the date of the grant. To the extent the performance condition is satisfied, the 
participant can benefit from any growth of the share price in excess of the issue price. The options have been valued using the Black Scholes 
option pricing model in line with IFRS 2 “Share Based Payments”. The assumptions used as part of the model include the following:
 – Expected volatility  25%
 – Expected dividend yield  3.90%
 – Risk free interest rate  2.39%
 – Vesting period 3 years
Grant of the ExSOP scheme requires specific performance conditions being satisfied. These criteria are set out below:
 – EPS Target requires the growth in the Company’s underlying Diluted EPS over the Performance Period to be at least 15% (being an average 
5% annual growth rate, calculated without compounding).
Approved and Unapproved scheme options are exercisable at any time from the third anniversary of the date of grant to the tenth anniversary, 
other than nominal cost options which may become exercisable at the earliest after a period of 30 dealing days following the third anniversary 
of being granted. SAYE scheme options are normally exercisable within six months following the third anniversary of the date of grant. Options 
granted under the above schemes, together with those remaining at 30 September 2017, are as follows:

23 Business combinations
(a) Acquisitions 2017
The Group made one acquisition in the year which has been accounted for as business combinations under IFRS 3 (revised). 
The following table of fair values summarises the acquisition made during the financial year.
On 19 June 2017 the Group acquired the equity of Selborne Care Limited, which provides a range of supported living, residential care and 
day opportunity services in Birmingham, Sandwell, Coventry and Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Wolverhampton, Bristol, South Gloucestershire, 
Bath and North East Somerset, Devon, Plymouth and Cornwall. 
The book values attributable to the acquisition were £18,281,289 net assets and fair value and adjustments were £4,397,000.

will be adjusted in next year’s financial statements.
Cash 18,281 18,281
Goodwill 77
The acquisition was undertaken to enhance the Group’s position in the respective industries. Control was obtained through the acquisition 
of share capital.
The book values of the assets and liabilities were extracted from the underlying accounting records of the acquired entities on the date 
of acquisition. The book value of receivables represents the gross contractual amounts receivable, all of which are considered recoverable. 
The fair value adjustments made to property, plant and equipment, trade and other receivables and creditors are to reflect their value on 
a going concern market value basis. The remaining goodwill of £77,000 relates to the assembled workforce acquired on acquisition.
Goodwill which is not expected to be tax deductible arises due to the requirement to recognise deferred tax in respect of the fair value 
adjustments to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, together with synergies expected to arise from combining operations, 
workforce in place and other intangible assets which do not qualify for separate recognition.

Strategic Review Governance – – Financial Statements 24 Financial instruments
The use of financial instruments is managed under policies and procedures approved by the Board. These are designed to reduce the financial 
risks faced by the Group, which primarily relate to credit, interest and liquidity risks, which arise in the normal course of the Group’s business.
Credit risk
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Group to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. Cash equivalents 
are deposited only with major financial institutions that satisfy certain credit criteria.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are carried out on all 
significant prospective customers and all existing customers requiring credit beyond a certain threshold. Varying approval levels are set on the 
extension of credit depending upon the value of the sale.
Where credit risk is deemed to have risen to an unacceptable level, remedial actions including the variation of terms of trade are implemented 
under the guidance of senior management until the level of credit risk has been normalised.
The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of business with a provision for specific doubtful receivables. The balance includes 
the amounts considered recoverable which also equals their fair value. The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets. During 
the year there was a credit to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for bad or doubtful debts of £100,000 (2016: debit £259,000).
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each financial asset. Based on past experience, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect 
of trade receivables not past due.
The trade receivables as at 30 September are aged as follows:
2017 
£000
2016 
£000
Not due 7,240 6,337
Not more than three months past due 3,060 2,591
More than three months but not more than six months past due 4,388 1,127
Trade receivables (note 15) 14,688 10,055
The movement in provisions for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:
£000
At 1 October 2015 556
Charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive Income 259
At 1 October 2016 815
Charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive Income (100)
At 30 September 2017 715
  
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through called up share capital, retained profits, bank borrowings, and the sale of assets if appropriate. 
The Group’s income is by its nature relatively stable and its growth is, inter alia, impacted by inflation. Group policy is to balance interest rate fixes 
between the short, medium and long term. The benchmark rate for bank borrowings is LIBOR. As at 30 September, the Group carried ten hedging 
instruments, details of which are as follows:
 – a three-year swap commencing 28 January 2017 at pre-determined amounts initially starting at £35.2m at LIBOR fixed at 1.032%
 – a three-year swap commencing 9 February 2017 at pre-determined amounts initially starting at £38.2m at LIBOR fixed at 1.097%
 – a three-year swap commencing 9 February 2017 at pre-determined amounts initially starting at £18.1m at LIBOR fixed at 1.097%
 – a three-year swap commencing 12 February 2017 at pre-determined amounts initially starting at £18.5m at LIBOR fixed at 1.097%

Notes to the Financial Statements continued Liquidity risk
The Group prepares annual cash flow forecasts reflecting known commitments and anticipated projects. Borrowing facilities are arranged as 
necessary to finance requirements. The Group has available bank facilities, sufficient, with cash flow from profits, to fund present commitments. 
Term facilities are utilised to fund capital expenditure and short-term flexibility is achieved by the utilisation of cash resources in respect of financial 
liabilities. The following table indicates their contractual cash flow maturities.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that activities of the Group will be able to continue as a going concern whilst maximising returns 
for shareholders through the optimisation of debt and equity.
The Group’s capital structure is as follows:
2017 
£000
2016 
£000
Net debt 147,132 156,424
Equity (see page 46) 204,201 151,667
Our policy is to increase the total dividend per year broadly in line with the movement in underlying diluted earnings per share. The final dividend 
will therefore increase to 6.60p per share demonstrating a confident view of the Group’s fundamental strength.
Net debt
Net debt as defined by the Group’s banking facilities and comprises cash and cash equivalents net of all Loans and Borrowings due to the 
Group’s bankers.

Foreign currency risk
The Group operates entirely in the UK and is not exposed to any foreign currency risks.
Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. Over the longer term, 
however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 30 September 2017, it is estimated that a general increase of 1% in interest rates would impact finance expense and decrease the Group’s 
profit before tax and equity by approximately £430,000 (2016: £450,000). Economic hedging instruments have been included in this calculation.

Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows 
at prevailing interest rates with the following assumptions being applied:
 – for trade and other receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year the carrying amount is deemed to reflect the fair value;
 – for cash and cash equivalents the amounts reported on the balance sheet approximates to fair value;
 – for secured bank loans at floating rate the carrying value is deemed to reflect the fair value as it represents the price of the instruments in the 
market place; 
 – for finance lease liabilities, all amounts are due within five years and are on terms similar to those estimated to be achievable in the market;
 – for the derivatives financial instruments, these were entered into to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk on its external borrowings; 
and 
 – for contingent consideration, this was entered into as part of the acquisition of Spark of Genius, Oakleaf Care (Hartwell) Limited. 
 The fair value will be determined with reference to: 
 – Spark of Genius’s EBITDA performance over the four financial years ending 30 September 2019; 
 – Oakleaf Care (Hartwell)’s EBITDA performance over the two financial years ending 31 March 2018.
Fair value hierarchy
The financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method are analysed as follows:
 – Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: £nil (2016: £nil).
 – Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either as a direct price or indirectly 
derived from prices: liability £940,000 (2016: liability £789,000).
 – Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liabilities that are not based on observable market data: liability £3,553,000 (2016: liability £5,875,000). 
The financial liability measured at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 30 September 2017 is deferred consideration. 
The fair value of deferred consideration relates to the acquisitions completed in current and prior years and is the estimated cash flows payable. 
The cash flows are not discounted as management deem this to be immaterial to the future cash flows payable. The effects on the fair value 
of risk and uncertainty in the future cash flows are dealt with by adjusting the estimated cash flows. Should any of the acquired businesses 
not achieve its performance targets then the estimated cash flows may be reduced.

Company Statement of Cash Flow
for the year ended 30 September 2017 27 Accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 relevant to those companies which 
report in accordance with IFRS. 
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own comprehensive statement 
of income. The profit for the year dealt with in the financial statements of the Company was £13,889,000 (2016: £13,388,000).
(b) Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet of the Company at cost less impairment written off.
(c) Cash and liquid resources
Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand and those with maturities of three 
months or less from inception, less overdrafts payable on demand. 
(d) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
value being recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the reporting date.
(e) Financial Instruments
Recognition, initial measurement and derecognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial 
instrument and are measured initially at fair value adjusted by transactions costs, except for those carried at fair value through profit or loss which 
are measured initially at fair value. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset 
and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.
(f) Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
(g) Revenue
Revenue represents management fees receivable, in respect of the period to which management services relate.
(h) Share-based payments
The share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee 
expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual 
number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises an increase in the cost of investment 
in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiary’s financial statements with the 
corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
(i) Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are 
no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
(j) Merger reserve 
The merger reserve represents the premium arising on the ordinary shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of shares in another 
company (merger relief).

(1)  The margin on the facilities has initially been set at 2.75% over LIBOR but reduces based on the ratio of the Group’s net debt to EBITDA. The overall margin is 
2.25% over LIBOR. The Group have reviewed the present value of the cash flows under the new margin and determined the modification to not be substantial 
under IAS 39. Hence the modification has been accounted for as an adjustment to the existing liability. 
At 30 September 2017 the Group has available bank facilities totalling £195m, sufficient, with cash flow from profits, to fund present commitments. 
Term facilities are used to fund capital expenditure and short-term flexibility is achieved by the utilisation of cash resources.
The term loans are secured by way of a charge over certain assets of the Group.

35 Directors’ remuneration
The analysis of Directors’ emoluments and share options is included within the Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 39. This analysis forms 
part of these financial statements.
36 Staff numbers and costs
The Company has no employees (2016: none) other than the Directors. Directors’ emoluments are paid by a subsidiary undertaking.
37 Related parties
During the year the Company received dividends of £13,000,000 (2016: £13,500,000) and received interest of £6,409,000 (2016: £6,109,000) and 
fees of £70,000 (2016: £70,000) from its subsidiary undertakings. The amount due to the Company from its subsidiary undertakings at the balance 
sheet date amounted to £269,304,000 (2016: £229,753,000).
38 Financial instruments
The use of financial instruments is managed under policies and procedures approved by the Board. These are designed to reduce the financial 
risks faced by the Company, which primarily relate to credit, and liquidity risks, which arise in the normal course of the Company’s business.
Credit risk
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Company provides credit to 
subsidiaries in the normal course of business. The balance includes the amounts considered recoverable which also equals to their fair value. 
The Company has collateral in respect of the investments it holds in its subsidiary undertakings. During the year there was no charge to the 
income statement for bad or doubtful debts (2016: £nil).
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying 
amount of each financial asset.
The receivables as at 30 September are inter-company balances as follows:
2017 
£000
2016 
£000
Not due 269,304 229,753
Not more than three months past due – –
More than three months but not more than six months past due – –
More than six months past due – –
Trade receivables (note 30) 269,304 229,753
The fair values of these balances is equal to their carrying value.
Interest rate risk
The Company finances its operations through called up share capital, retained profits, bank borrowings, and the sale of assets if appropriate. 
Group policy is to balance interest rate fixes between the short, medium and long term. The benchmark rate for bank borrowings is LIBOR.

Liquidity risk
The Company prepares annual cash flow forecasts reflecting known commitments and anticipated projects. Borrowing facilities are arranged as 
necessary to finance requirements. The Company has available bank facilities, sufficient, with cash flow from profits, to fund present commitments. 
Term facilities are utilised to fund capital expenditure and short-term flexibility is achieved by the utilisation of cash resources in respect of financial 
liabilities, the following table indicates their contractual cash flow maturities.

Capital risk management
The Company manages its capital to ensure that activities of the Company will be able to continue as a going concern whilst maximising returns 
for shareholders through the optimisation of debt and equity.
The Company’s capital structure is as follows:
2017 
£000
2016 
£000
Net debt 148,287 154,588
Equity 155,936 108,894
Our policy is to increase the total dividend per year broadly in line with the movement in underlying diluted earnings per share. The final dividend 
will therefore increase to 6.60p per share demonstrating a confident view of the Group’s fundamental strength.
Foreign currency risk
The Company operates entirely in the UK and is not exposed to any foreign currency risks.
Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate risks the Company aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Company’s earnings and equity. 
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings and equity.
At 30 September 2017 it is estimated that a general increase of 1% in interest rates would impact finance expense and decrease the Company’s 
profit before tax and equity by approximately £430,000 (2016: £450,000). Hedging instruments have been included in this calculation.
Fair values
The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows:

Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows 
at prevailing interest rates with the following assumptions being applied:
 – for trade and other receivables and payables the carrying amount is deemed to reflect the fair value;
 – for cash and cash equivalents the amounts reported on the balance sheet approximates to fair value;
 – for secured bank loans at floating rate the carrying value is deemed to reflect the fair value as it represents the price of the instruments in the 
market place.
