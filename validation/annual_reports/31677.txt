hotel groups in the Caribbean in order to 
deliver sustainable investor returns”
Simon Sherwood 
Chairman
T
he Group has 
delivered a solid 
performance 
in the financial year 
ended 30 September 
2017 against a 
background of changed 
market conditions. 
We were encouraged 
to see occupancy 
recover in H2 2017 
which, together with the 
addition of Waves Hotel 
to the portfolio, led to a 
revenue increase of 5% 
over 2016.
The team remains firmly focused 
on delivering our strategy, and we 
are pleased with the operational 
progress that has been made during 
the year. We have continued to strive 
for day-to-day excellence, investing 
in our people and systems to ensure 
that our hotels continue to provide 
exceptional guest experiences, as 
well as successfully expanding our 
sales and marketing presence in the 
US in order to drive further growth in 
visitor numbers from that market. 
We have also continued with 
our programme of refurbishing, 
repositioning and repricing elements 
of the existing portfolio. This has 
included enhancements to The 
House, which re-opened in October 
2017 after being closed for six weeks, 
and the addition of new food and 
beverage outlets at two of our 
all-inclusive properties – Crystal 
Cove and Turtle Beach. Daphne’s, 
our beachfront restaurant, was also 
closed for renovation for six weeks 
in H1.
During the year, we expanded 
outside of Barbados through a 
management contract for Hodges 
Bay Resort & Spa (Hodges Bay) in 
Antigua and a sales and marketing 
contract for The Landings Resort 
& Spa (The Landings) in St Lucia. 
The Landings contract is progressing 
well and enables us to expand our 
sales and marketing footprint.
The construction of Hodges Bay 
is currently taking longer than 
expected but we’re pleased that the 
owners are ensuring that this product 
is built to the highest standards. 
We continue to believe that 
management contracts and sales 
and marketing agreements represent 
compelling opportunities.
In April we were pleased to acquire 
Treasure Beach hotel, a 4-star 
35-suite hotel next to our existing 
Tamarind hotel. On its re-opening 
towards the end of 2017, Elegant 
Hotels’ properties account for a 
continuous 300 metre stretch of 
the prestigious “Platinum Coast” 
of Barbados.
I was pleased to welcome two new 
additions to our Board this year. 
Jeff Singleton joined the Group as 
Chief Financial Officer in December 
2016 and was appointed to the 
Board in March 2017. Jeff brings 
significant industry and listed-
company experience and since his 
arrival has focused on restructuring 
the finance function and improving 
risk management, internal controls 
and management information. 
Luke Johnson joined the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director in May 2017, 
adding his significant hospitality 
experience and business skills to 
the Board.
Details about how the Board and its 
Committees have discharged their 
corporate governance duties during 
the year are outlined in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 26 
to 27. As the business matures, the 
Board is focussing on the continued 
development and dissemination of 
our corporate culture throughout 
the Group, and looks forward to 
reporting on this further in the 
coming financial year. 
4 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW Elegant Hotels Group set out its 
dividend policy at the time of IPO in 
May 2015. Since then, we have paid 
cumulative dividends of 14 pence 
per share, while seeing a significant 
shift in the market largely due to the 
devaluation of Sterling compared 
to the US dollar. We have also taken 
advantage of multiple expansion 
and strategic opportunities 
including Waves Hotel & Spa and 
Treasure Beach.
Our objective is to become one of the 
leading hotel groups in the Caribbean 
in order to deliver sustainable 
investor returns. To achieve this, 
the Group must reinvest in its 
business model and ensure that it 
is well placed to capitalise on the 
numerous opportunities that we see 
for expansion. 
Given the current market 
opportunities and the need to 
reinvest in our properties in an 
increasingly competitive market, the 
Board is recommending a reduction 
in our final dividend to 1.75p for the 
year ended 30 September 2017 from 
3.5p in the prior year. This equates 
to a full-year dividend of 5.25p for 
the year ended 30 September 2017 
versus 7.0p in the prior year. 
Going forward, the Group intends 
to pay a full year dividend of 
4.0p for the financial year ending 
30 September 2018, split into a one 
third interim payment and two thirds 
final dividend payment. As always, 
the payment of dividends will be 
subject to the discretion of the Board 
and to the Company having sufficient 
distributable reserves.
Finally, the Board and I would like to 
thank our customers, management, 
staff and shareholders for their 
continued support and contributions 
to the Group’s success.

BUSINESS MODEL
HOW WE CREATE VALUE Our strategy utilises our 
inputs and resources 
to capture the market 
opportunity in three ways:
• Firstly, we leverage our 
existing properties, our 
fantastic teams and the 
wonderful Caribbean 
climate to attract our 
guests and ensure 
they leave wanting 
to visit us again;
• Secondly, we look to 
enhance our existing 
portfolio by refurbishing, 
repositioning and repricing 
to maximise guest 
experience, profitability 
and occupancy;
• And thirdly, we actively 
seek out expansion 
opportunities within 
Barbados and in the 
wider Caribbean, 
through acquisitions and 
management or sales and 
marketing agreements.

9 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION T
he rebased 
market has meant 
that it has been 
necessary for us to 
discount rates at certain 
of our properties on a 
targeted and tactical 
basis. This has inevitably 
affected the profit 
margins of the business, 
but we believe that the 
pricing environment is 
now much more stable. 
As such, these market 
conditions should be 
seen as the new normal. 
OVERVIEW
MARKET OVERVIEW
Barbados arrivals and competition
As expected, market conditions in 
Barbados remained challenging 
throughout the 2017 financial year. 
While arrivals to Barbados were up 
6.4% year-on-year for the January 
to October 2017 period (2016: 5.5%), 
this was the first full year of a 
rebased Sterling/USD exchange 
rate, which has had a negative 
impact on our business: the Group’s 
rates are priced in USD while the 
majority of customers are from the 
UK (around 75% on a room nights 
basis). This affects both the rates the 
Group is currently able to achieve 
at some of its properties, as well as 
demand for Barbados as a luxury 
tourist destination.
Recent data from the Barbados 
Tourism Marketing Inc shows that 
stay-over tourist arrivals from the 
UK have grown 0.7% year-on-
year for January to October 2017, 
compared to growth of 2.2% for 
2016. In addition, demand for luxury 
accommodation from UK travellers 
has declined despite the overall 
increase in numbers, and the villa and 
value market have tended to benefit 
from increased visitor arrivals. 
However, we remain confident in 
the underlying attractiveness of 
Barbados for UK travellers, given 
its reputation as a safe destination 
and the fact that it is fortunate to be 
located south of the hurricane belt. 
Barbados is very rarely affected by 
hurricanes and, during the recent 
hurricane season, we experienced no 
disruption at the hotels and saw no 
material impact on bookings.
In addition to daily flights from 
London Gatwick and Manchester by 
a number of different carriers, 
Virgin is running a new twice-
weekly service direct from London 
Heathrow from December 2017 to 
April 2018. There are also significant 
opportunities outside the UK market 
which the Group is working to 
capture, as set out further below. 
In particular, US arrivals to Barbados 
were up 14.2% year-on-year (January 
to October) compared to an 11.5% 
increase in the prior year. 
REVIEW OF FY 2017 
PERFORMANCE AGAINST 
STRATEGY
DAY-TO-DAY EXCELLENCE
Revenue – pricing and occupancy
Revenue for 2017 was $59.9 million, 
up 5.1% on the prior year (2016: 
$57.0 million). This reflected an 
improvement in occupancy in H2 
2017, partially due to the timing 
of Easter (which fell in H2 in 
2017, as opposed to H1 in 2016). 
Occupancy was 63.9% for the Group, 
up from 62.9% in the prior year. 
However, ADR fell 6.3% in the period 
from $378 to $354. This partially 
reflects the success of Waves 
Hotel & Spa, which contributed 
strongly to occupancy but had a 
lower average rate, especially in H1. 
Excluding Waves, ADR would have 
been $365, a reduction of 3%.
During the year, the Group reviewed 
the pricing strategy for some of 
its properties in response to the 
weakening of Sterling. Rates were 
discounted on a targeted and 
tactical basis in certain cases in 
order to drive occupancy in the 
context of the rebased market. 
ADR was maintained at The House 
and Colony Club, our properties 
with the highest rates. For these 
properties, maintaining rates has 
been a strategic objective in order 
to maintain differentiation among 
the hotels in the portfolio. In 2018, 
“We delivered a solid performance 
in 2017 against a background 
of changed market conditions”
Sunil Chatrani
Chief Executive Officer
10 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT we intend to continue to review 
pricing strategies for each property 
to ensure that we effectively balance 
occupancy and rate. 
During the year, we used targeted 
promotions to boost occupancy 
during slower periods. Over the high 
demand periods, our specialised 
US-based revenue team continues 
to be disciplined and cautious with 
discounting, leveraging both the 
Group’s excellent relationships with 
tour operators as well as its scale 
and its substantial share of available 
luxury rooms in Barbados. 
Target market and go-to-market 
strategy
Throughout 2017, the Group 
expanded its target market focus 
in response to the weaker UK 
market conditions. The sales teams 
in both the UK and the US were 
bolstered, and during the year the 
Group launched a new website to 
target direct bookings from the 
US. In addition, new contracts were 
signed with tour operators in the US 
and Canada, and the Group hosted 
a number of familiarisation trips for 
US operators. As a result of this, and 
the addition of Waves in 2016, the 
proportion of bookings from North 
America rose from 14% in 2015/2016 
to 17% in 2016/2017.
There are also both opportunities 
and challenges in relation to changes 
in the demographic of visitors. 
The number of older, repeat guests 
is declining so attracting new 
guests is an area of growing focus. 
An increasingly important market for 
us is the millennial segment, including 
families and “double income no 
kids”, who tend to value experiences 
and sustainability and for whom 
repeat visits are less common. As a 
result, when we are refurbishing our 
properties we continually focus on 
appealing to this segment as well as 
our more established guest-type.
In this regard, the marketing of 
Waves as a contemporary all-
inclusive spa resort has been 
highly successful, and resulted 
in an increase in the number of 
guests from the millennial category. 
Given the success of this offering, we 
have incorporated a new spa into the 
refurbished House, and continue to 
assess additional spa opportunities 
throughout the Group. 
COST CONTROL
Implementing cost control measures 
has been a key area of focus for the 
Group during 2017 given the pressure 
on rates. This has involved targeted 
streamlining and centralisation of 
back office functions, and the set-up 
of a central warehousing function 
which was operational from the 
end of calendar 2017. The impact 
of these measures is expected to 
be seen in the financial year ending 
30 September 2018.

ENHANCEMENT
We are continuously looking to 
improve the profitability of our 
hotels with our focussed three-
step programme of refurbishing, 
repositioning and repricing. 
These steps interplay to find the best 
combination of physical structure 
(refurbish), guest experience 
(reposition) and yield management 
(reprice).
In addition to our regular capex 
spend of 4% of each hotel’s revenue, 
we spent approximately $1.5m 
on special projects, as planned. 
The most significant project 
undertaken during the year was the 
refurbishment of the public areas at 
The House, as well as the addition 
of a new spa. The House was closed 
from mid-August to the beginning of 
October, and since its re-opening has 
seen a 9% increase in business-on-
the books, driven by a stronger rate, 
compared to the same time in 2016.
In addition, we added a coffee shop 
and ice cream parlour to Turtle 
Beach and a coffee and wine bar to 
Crystal Cove. These additions, along 
with targeted discounting, resulted in 
both of these hotels increasing their 
occupancy compared to the prior 
year, and enhanced our offerings 
compared to new all-inclusive 
competitors on the island.
The results of Waves Hotel & Spa, 
following the post-acquisition 
refurbishment, also illustrate the 
success of this strategy. Waves’ 
occupancy was the highest in the 
Group at 73%, and it maintained 
ADR significantly in excess of pre-
acquisition levels.
EXPANSION
During 2017, we acquired Treasure 
Beach, a 35 suite hotel located 
next to the Tamarind Hotel on the 
‘Platinum Coast’ of Barbados. At the 
time of the IPO in 2015 we set out 
our acquisition plan – to add hotels 
that complement our portfolio and 
that benefit from the Group’s scale. 
Treasure Beach is a great geographic 
fit, as well as meeting our criteria of 
acquiring under-performing hotels 
that can be refurbished, repositioned 
and repriced in line with our 
enhancement strategy. It reopened 
in December 2017 following $2.8m of 
refurbishments as a European-plan 
adults only resort. 
As a result of our acquisition strategy, 
our total room count is now 588 
compared to 483 at the time of the 
IPO. This is more than twice the 
nearest competitor on Barbados 
and gives the Group significant 
influence and leverage with tour 
operator partners.
During the year, the Group added 
two properties to its portfolio via a 
management contract and a sales 
and marketing contract. In October 
2016, the Group entered into an 
agreement to manage Hodges Bay 
Resort, a new 122-room luxury hotel 
in Antigua. 
In March 2017, the Group added The 
Landings Resort and Spa, an 85 
villa property in St. Lucia, with an 
agreement to provide a variety of 
services across the areas of sales, 
marketing, reservations, revenue 
management and public relations 
across all key markets.
The Group is continually assessing 
potential acquisition targets both 
in Barbados and throughout the 
wider Caribbean. We see a number 
of compelling opportunities ahead 
of us, and are constantly managing 
our cash flow and debt availability 
in order to ensure that we can 
take advantage of them as they 
present themselves.
OUTLOOK
Trading since the start of the new 
financial year has remained in line 
with market expectations, and our 
bookings are currently tracking 
ahead of the same period last year. 
As a result, the Group remains 
confident in its prospects for 2018 
and beyond.

Management presents various key performance indicators to illustrate the Group’s performance during the period 
and progress against strategic objectives. During 2017, a number of KPIs have been added and explanations 
of these measures are provided below. Due to the nature of the Group’s operations and strategy, the Group 
uses alternative performance measures (including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted profit measures) to present 
the underlying performance of the Group on a more consistent year-on-year basis. These measures exclude 
exceptional items such as acquisition and restructuring costs, the bargain purchase gain and share-based payment 
costs. A full reconciliation of alternative measures to statutory equivalents is provided on page 16.
14 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 “The Group continues to 
generate significant free cash flow”
Jeff Singleton
Chief Financial Officer
OVERVIEW
As outlined in the CEO’s report, there 
has been a good recovery in revenue 
in H2 2017 which has continued into 
2018. However, lower rates at some 
of our properties have continued to 
put pressure on EBITDA and, as a 
result, cost control in the Group has 
been a key focus. Specific activities 
in this area have included the 
streamlining and centralising of 
the finance functions in order to 
achieve economies of scale, as 
well as enhancing the Group’s risk 
management framework.
GROSS PROFIT
Gross profit for the year was $35.5m 
(2016: $35.1m), while gross margin 
reduced from 61.6% to 59.3%, due 
to a combination of lower rates and 
a greater relative contribution from 
lower-margin H2 revenue compared 
to 2016.
SELLING, GENERAL AND 
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Selling, general and administrative 
expenses before exceptional items 
and the bargain purchase gain 
increased to $22.9m (2016: $20.1m), 
principally reflecting the addition 
of Waves Hotel & Spa. Additionally, 
the Group increased its corporate 
costs compared to the prior 
period with the appointment of a 
Chief Financial Officer and Group 
Operations Director. Both of these 
appointments were necessary in 
order to fulfil the Group’s strategic 
expansion strategies. 
Depreciation and amortisation 
increased from $3.2m to $4.1m 
primarily due to the acquisition of 
Waves in the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative 
expenses before exceptional items 
and the bargain purchase gain were 
38% of revenue in 2017 (2016: 35%). 
This reflects the above increased 
costs as well as the inclusion of 
Waves, which as an all-inclusive 
property has a lower operating profit 
margin, and the flow through effect 
of rate reductions.
EXCEPTIONAL COSTS AND 
BARGAIN PURCHASE GAIN
Exceptional costs were $1.1m in 2017 
compared to $2.2m in the prior 
year. Included within exceptional 
costs is a credit of $0.6m from the 
reversal of share-based payment 
expense related to the share options 
issued on IPO which did not vest. 
These awards had been treated as 
exceptional as they related to the IPO 
of the Group in 2015. The remaining 
exceptional costs were $1.7m in 
2017 and $2.0m in 2016, reflecting 
the acquisitions of Treasure Beach 
and Waves respectively as well as 
other exceptional costs including 
restructuring costs and professional 
fees. The Group also recognised a 
bargain purchase gain in 2017 of 
$1.3m, related to the acquisition of 
Treasure Beach (refer to note 4 for 
further details).
The Group presents measures of 
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted profit 
before tax and Adjusted EPS. 
These measures exclude exceptional 
costs, non-exceptional share-based 
payment charges and the bargain 
purchase gain. These items are 
excluded as they do not reflect 
the underlying performance of the 
Group. The tables opposite set out 
the calculation of these measures.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
CONTINUED OTHER OPERATING INCOME
Other operating income of $1.0m 
(2016: $1.1m) principally comprises 
gains on foreign exchange 
on converting US dollars into 
Barbados dollars. 
REPORTED AND ADJUSTED 
EBITDA
Reconciliations of Reported and 
Adjusted EBITDA are set out in the 
table above. After adjusting for 
one-off items, Adjusted EBITDA 
was $18.1m (2016: $19.6m), 7.6% 
lower than the prior period, and 
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2 
percentage points lower than the 
prior period at 30.2%. This reflects 
the above-mentioned movements. 
Daphne’s contributed approximately 
$500k to the decrease in Adjusted 
EBITDA, predominantly relating to 
its closure for renovation, with the 
closure of The House accounting for 
approximately $250k. 
FINANCE EXPENSES
Interest on loans increased in the 
current year from $1.8m to $2.5m, as 
a result of additional debt associated 
with the Waves and Treasure Beach 
acquisitions and movements in the 
US LIBOR rate from circa 50 basis 
points at the start of the year to 125 
basis points at the end. The Group 
continues to explore opportunities 
to convert variable interest 
rates to fixed rates in the future. 
Finance expenses also included 
$0.3m of foreign exchange losses on 
forward contracts (2016: $0.4m).
TAXATION
Taxation of $1.8m (2016: $2.0m) 
largely reflected lower profit before 
tax as well as changes in the relative 
level of bargain purchase gain and 
exceptional expenses compared to 
the prior year.
The adjusted effective tax rate on 
adjusted profit before tax was 18.7% 
compared to 17.6% in the prior year. 
PROFIT AFTER TAX AND 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Profit after tax reduced to $9.2m 
compared to $9.8m in the prior 
year (restated), with diluted EPS 
at 10.3 cents per share compared 
to 11.0 cents per share (restated). 
Adjusted profit after tax decreased 
to $9.0 million (2016: $11.7 million). 
Adjusted diluted EPS reduced from 
13.1 cents per share to 10.1 cents 
per share.
NON-CURRENT ASSETS
Property, plant and equipment 
increased to $183.7m from $172.8m, 
largely due to the purchase of 
Treasure Beach in May 2017. 
In addition, $0.1m of intangible 
assets were recognised in relation 
to the cost of the Group’s new 
commercial website.
NET DEBT AND NET 
ASSET VALUES
Net debt has increased from $61.8m 
to $73.1m at 30 September 2017, 
primarily due to the acquisition 
of Treasure Beach in May 2017. 
An additional $8.4m was added to 
the Bank of Nova Scotia loan facility 
and was fully drawn down at that 
point. In addition, the Group drew 
down its $5.0m revolving facility and 
made total repayments of $5.2m 
against bank and vendor loans. 
At 30 September 2017, the Group 
has an additional undrawn overdraft 
facility available of $9.6m and 
undrawn revolving facilities of $0.2m.
Treasure Beach Hotel was valued 
by Terra Caribbean at $9.7m at 
acquisition. Combined with the 
valuation of Waves in June 2016 
and the remaining properties in 
April 2015, total property valuation 
is $267.2m, which is greater than its 
carrying value in these accounts.
Despite the shift in the market which 
has affected the cash flow valuation 
of the properties, in the Directors’ 
opinion and based on internal 
impairment testing, asset values 
remain significantly in excess of 
carrying values and no impairments 
are required.
The Group therefore has an implied 
net asset value of $194.1m at 
30 September 2017, or 163 pence per 
share (218 cents per share).
CASH FLOW
The Group’s free cash flow (defined 
as cash flow from operations less 
capital expenditure) was $6.9m for 
2017 (2016: $7.4m). The increase 
comprises a reduction in cash from 
operations ($12.5m compared 
to $17.0m) offset by a reduction 
in capital expenditure ($5.6m 
compared to $9.7m) associated 
with the completion of the 
Waves renovation in late FY 16. 
Capital expenditure on Treasure 
Beach renovations of $0.7m has been 
recognised in 2017.
As well as reduced EBITDA, cash 
flow from operations was impacted 
by the first year of payments on 
account for Barbados tax expenses 
(leading to a $2.5m cash tax 
payment compared to $0.7m in 
the prior year) and an increase in 
trade and other receivables of $1.2m 
largely relating to VAT receivables 
and non-trade amounts associated 
with the new management contract 
and sales and marketing agreement.
The Group paid $8.2m in relation 
to consideration and fees for the 
Treasure Beach acquisition, net of 
cash acquired, which was financed 
through additional loan financing. 
Dividends paid were $1.6m lower 
than the prior year at $7.9m, largely 
due to changes in the Sterling/USD 
exchange rate, however cash interest 
paid increased by $0.7m.
Overall, cash and cash equivalents, 
net of drawn overdraft, decreased 
from $3.7m to $0.6m at 
30 September 2017.

THE MARKETPLACE
Reduction 
in airlift
1
The Group’s business is 
dependent on airlift to 
Barbados, which serves 
as the primary means 
by which the Group’s 
customers arrive in 
Barbados to stay at 
its hotels. 
The Group has the largest 
proportion of quality 
room stock in Barbados. 
It contracts business 
with tour operators on an 
annual basis, who in turn 
take up seats on the main 
airlines into Barbados, 
supporting the carriers. 
The Group markets itself 
and participates in national 
marketing programmes for 
the island in the major feeder 
markets, all of which assist 
in creating the demand for 
airline seats into Barbados. 
Despite weakness in 
Sterling, this risk is 
largely unchanged 
from the prior year

strategy on pages 7 to 9
Increase 
in competition
2
The Group operates in a 
competitive market and 
competes with a variety of 
operators of varying sizes 
and operational standards, 
including international 
hotel chains, regional and 
local site operators. 
The Group continues to 
reinvest in its properties 
through targeted 
maintenance and the 
refurbish, reposition and 
reprice strategy.
The Group also invests in 
employee engagement 
and training.
These actions are 
designed to maintain 
and improve service and 
offering standards and 
sets the Group apart from 
direct competitors.
There are several 
significant 
refurbishments and 
new resorts on the 
island of Barbados 
which are due to 
open in 2018, and 
are expected to 
increase the level of 
relevant competition. 
Day-to-
day operational  
excellence
Read more about our 
strategy on pages 7 to 9
Exchange 
rate volatility
3
The Group conducts its 
operations principally 
in US dollars and 
Barbados dollars 
and is consequently 
subject to currency risk 
due to fluctuations in 
exchange rates. 
This includes longer-term 
weakness in Sterling 
leading to a perception 
of higher prices by 
UK customers, and 
transactional currency risk.
In addition, the Group’s 
dividends are paid 
in Sterling.
The Group’s top line is 
primarily earned in US 
dollars and the major 
expenses are in US dollars 
and Barbados dollars 
(which is pegged to the US 
dollar). The Group holds US 
dollar and Barbados dollar 
accounts in Barbados. 
Transactional currency 
fluctuations against Sterling 
on booking are at the tour 
operator’s risk, however, 
any losses on currency by 
tour operators is ultimately 
factored into prices.
To counter longer-term 
weakness in Sterling, the 
Group aims to grow the 
level of business from North 
America. During 2017, the 
Group also reduced its 
rates on a targeted basis 
to maintain occupancy in a 
number of hotels.
Longer-term 
weakness in Sterling 
in 2016 and 2017 has 
led to a perception 
of higher prices and 
affected the rate the 
Group can charge.

Extreme 
weather and  
environmental 
degradation
4
The Group’s properties 
are situated on the coast 
and exposed to extreme 
weather in the medium-
term, and erosion and 
other environmental 
degradation and climate 
impacts in the longer-
term.
Extreme weather, pollution 
and the degradation of 
reefs and other natural 
attractions may reduce 
the attractiveness of 
Barbados and the 
wider Caribbean as a 
tourist destination.
The Group maintains 
appropriate disaster 
management procedures 
and insurance coverage to 
respond to extreme weather 
events, and has in place 
a number of adaptation 
initiatives to combat erosion 
and other climate change-
related issues.
In addition, the Group works 
in partnership with the 
Barbados government on 
nationwide environmental 
initiatives and has a strong 
focus on sustainability and 
environmental protection at 
the Group-level. Please see 
our CSR report on pages 22 
to 23 for further information.
While Barbados has 
not seen significant 
severe weather 
impacts during 
the 2017 hurricane 
season, and may 
benefit slightly from 
damage on other 
Caribbean islands, 
the risk of negative 
weather perception 
amongst customers 
has increased.
Longer-term climate-
related risks continue 
to increase  
incrementally.

Health and 
safety impacts
5
Disease outbreaks may 
make Barbados and/or 
the wider Caribbean less 
attractive as a destination 
for international guests. 
Even if not a significant 
health threat, disease 
outbreaks can generate 
negative publicity that 
may affect pricing and 
demand for hotels.
The Group has implemented 
health and safety practices 
at the properties to minimise 
the risk of the spread 
of infections.
The Group also continues 
to work with Government 
Agencies to eradicate 
diseases and responds 
to any publicity with 
targeted marketing and 
promotional campaigns.
No new outbreaks 
of diseases have 
occurred in the year.

OPERATIONAL
Loss of key  
tour operator  
relationships
6
The Group derives the 
majority of its business 
from key tour operators. 
As in most businesses, key 
customer relationships 
could come to an end 
and materially affect the 
Group’s business.
The Group maintains 
strong relationships with 
tour operators under an 
annual contract. While these 
relationships can change, 
there are always new 
entrants in the marketplace. 
The Group has 
representation in the trade 
managing these relationships 
on a daily basis. The senior 
sales and marketing team 
attend the major travel trade 
conferences each year and 
continue to manage existing 
relationships and develop 
new ones with the operators.
In addition, during 2017 
the Group launched a new 
website to encourage 
direct sales. 
This risk is largely 
unchanged from the 
prior year.

Reliance on 
key personnel
9
Loss of key personnel, 
including members of 
the Board and the senior 
management team, could 
impact the Group’s ability 
to expand and manage 
day-to-day operations.
Sourcing appropriate 
replacements may be 
more challenging given 
the Group’s location 
in Barbados.
In addition, key 
personnel expertise 
and skill in identifying 
new acquisitions and 
opportunities and 
managing projects 
is critical to the 
Group’s success.
The Group operates an 
LTIP which includes the 
senior management team. 
This is expected to support 
retention and motivate 
the team to achieve 
strategic objectives.
The Board and senior 
management team have 
been strengthened in 2017 
by the addition of a new 
Chief Financial Officer and 
Non-Executive Director.
The Board and Executive 
Directors also reassess the 
skills and experience of 
the senior management 
team on a regular basis and 
identify requirements and 
opportunities for additional 
training or support.
The Group’s strategic 
focus has continued 
to broaden towards 
expansion and 
developing the 
existing portfolio, 
increasing the 
reliance on key 
personnel and risks 
associated with skills 
and experience.

Issues with project 
management or 
difficulties sourcing 
appropriate human and 
physical resources can 
cause delays to openings 
and refurbishments, or 
affect the quality of the 
finished offerings.
This may impact the 
Group’s reputation, its 
achievement of strategic 
objectives, and reduce 
revenue and profitability.
The Group prepares 
project management plans, 
outsources elements of 
the project to design and 
construction firms and 
hires project managers 
where required.
The Group conducts return 
on investment analysis, 
including sensitivity 
analysis, on all major 
projects, expansion and 
capital spending.

21 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION Empowerment of women – The majority of senior management across the 
Elegant Hotels Group are female.
One of the key outcomes of the 
Group’s value creation model 
is to build a positive social and 
environmental legacy. In addition, 
our critical resources and inputs to 
our business model include engaged 
employees and environmental 
and natural resources. Therefore, 
we always consider our impact on 
Barbados, the Caribbean and its 
people in our operations and our 
strategic plans. 
INVESTING IN OUR EMPLOYEES 
Elegant is the largest hotel operator 
on the island of Barbados employing 
over 1,000 people local to the region. 
We invest in the engagement and 
development of our team members 
in a number of ways.
TRAINING AND ADVANCEMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES 
Regular training is undertaken by 
all team members using specialist 
internal and external trainers. 
Training is provided to meet 
Hospitality Standards in areas 
of operations, health and safety, 
environmental and socio-cultural.
The Group also places considerable 
emphasis on maintaining good 
relations with its employees. 
Employees are consulted, through 
their representatives, so that their 
views may be taken into account in 
making decisions which may affect 
them. We encourage our employees 
to achieve greatest productivity 
and personal satisfaction and we 
strive to ensure that our team 
members know that their hard 
work is valued by celebrating their 
performance. We seek to enhance 
employee awareness of the business 
factors affecting the Group through 
meetings with employees and the 
dissemination of relevant information.
We are advocates of career 
advancement and providing 
opportunities for growth through 
key strategic initiatives including 
promotion to management 
positions from within the Group 
and our successful management 
trainee programme.
HEALTH AND WELLNESS 
The Group is committed to high 
standards in health and safety. 
We seek to provide safe places and 
systems of work; especially with 
plant and machinery and handling 
of materials. Our Human Resources 
team ensure that appropriate 
information, instruction and training 
required for an employee to perform 
their role is in place. We have well 
established procedures relating 
to the reporting and monitoring 
of health and safety incidents and 
issues. Emphasis is placed on all 
employees having a responsibility to 
maintain a safe working environment.
We encourage and support our 
employees to lead healthier lifestyles 
while at work and beyond. We want 
to ensure our employees are happy, 
healthy and engaged. As part of 
this, we host various health and 
wellness activities annually across 
the Group to promote healthy 
lifestyles including health checks, 
cross country walks and educational 
seminars and workshops.
GENDER EQUALITY AND 
SOCIAL INCLUSION 
Elegant offers equal employment 
opportunities to all people, 
regardless of colour, race, creed or 
gender. The Group is committed 
to fair pay and treatment of all 
its employees, and works closely 
with local unions to deliver on 
this. Approximately 54% of the 
Group’s employees and nine out of 
eleven senior managers (excluding 
Directors) across the Group are 
female, a testament to our corporate 
culture of supporting gender equality 
and the empowerment of women in 
our workforce.
We are committed to the 
employment of people with 
disabilities and guarantee an 
interview for those who meet 
the minimum selection criteria. 
We provide training and 
development for people with 
disabilities which is tailored, where 
appropriate, to ensure they have 
the opportunity to achieve their 
potential. If a team member becomes 
disabled while in our employment 
we endeavour to retain them, 
including consulting them about their 
requirements, making reasonable 
and appropriate adjustments 
and providing alternative suitable 
employment where possible.

PRESERVING OUR 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND 
NATURAL ASSETS
We support environmentally 
sustainable practices across the 
Group. It is our policy to act in 
a manner so as to minimise the 
effects of our operations on 
the environment. 
The majority of our hotels are Green 
Globe certified, a globally recognised 
certification reserved for companies 
who practice sustainable tourism 
and are committed to making 
positive contributions to people 
and the planet. During the year, 
we introduced a number of new 
initiatives such as our group wide 
beach clean-up in recognition of 
the globally observed Earth Day. 
Over 200 Elegant team members 
played their part in keeping 
Barbados’ beaches clean, collecting 
in excess of 200 bags of debris, 
plastic and other garbage found 
along a 12-kilometre stretch of beach. 
As in prior years, the Group has 
a number of initiatives including 
dedicated recycling programmes for 
materials such as cardboard, plastic, 
glass and paper, waste and water 
management, the use of energy 
efficient lighting systems to reduce 
energy consumption, donation of 
shredded paper and gently used 
linens to various organisations 
and supporting the Barbados Sea 
Turtle Project’s efforts to restore the 
turtle population to levels at which 
they can fulfil their ecological roles. 
We also incorporate environmentally 
sustainable practices into the guest 
experience through our linen and 
towel reuse programme. 
DELIVERING POSITIVE 
SOCIAL BENEFITS TO 
OUR COMMUNITIES
Across the Group, our commitment 
to bring positive change to 
the communities we work in is 
unwavering. We continue to actively 
support a number of charitable 
organisations in Barbados and 
abroad. In the year, we provided 
more than 100 donations to local 
churches, schools, orphanages, 
sports clubs and other non-
governmental organisations and 
fundraisers. While Barbados was 
fortunate to escape damage 
from major storms in the region, 
we supported emergency relief 
efforts with US$10,000 in a 
range of supplies for affected 
Caribbean islands.
This year, we partnered with 
Transplant Links Community, a UK 
charity which has started a living-
donor kidney transplant programme 
in Barbados aimed at saving lives 
on the island. Seven members of 
the charity stayed at one of our 
all-inclusive resorts, Turtle Beach, 
while they performed a successful 
transplant and conducted a week 
of training for staff at the Barbados’ 
Queen Elizabeth Hospital. 
We continue to lend our support 
to local institutions including the 
Barbados Community College, 
the University of West Indies and 
the Barbados Vocational Board, 
by providing numerous internship 
opportunities across the Group. 
This year, a number of students 
completed internships across the 
Group, gaining essential first-hand 
industry experience. 
At Elegant, we strongly believe 
that our rich heritage should be 
preserved and celebrated. Guests are 
provided with opportunities to 
learn about the heritage and culture 
of Barbados through a variety of 
activities including community 
walks, island tours, cooking 
demonstrations, and entertainment 
at the hotels showcasing local artists 
through dance and music. We have 
established clear guidelines for 
guests wishing to visit culturally or 
historically sensitive sites in order 
to minimise visitor impact and 
maximise enjoyment.

GOING CONCERN ASSESSMENT
The Committee assessed the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern by reviewing its operating 
and financing assumptions for a 
period 20 months from the date 
of assessment. This assessment 
was prepared by management 
and included sensitivity analysis 
to account for potential changes in 
circumstances from the underlying 
assumptions. This assessment 
was updated on 8 January 2018. 
The Committee concluded that 
the Group is able to continue as a 
going concern.
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
The Audit Committee gives 
consideration to issues it considers 
important by virtue of their impact 
on the Group’s results, or the 
level of complexity, judgement 
or estimation involved in their 
application. In addition, the Audit 
Committee periodically reviews 
papers presented by management 
on significant accounting policies and 
estimates as set out in notes 2 and 3 
to the financial statements. 
The main issues considered by the 
Audit Committee in relation to the 
2017 financial statements were:
• Acquisition accounting for Treasure 
Beach – reviewed papers prepared 
by management in accordance 
with IFRS 3 Business Combinations; 
including the key assumptions and 
judgements such as the purchase 
price allocation. The Committee 
concluded that the Group’s 
allocation of the purchase price 
was reasonable; 
• Impairment testing – reviewed key 
management judgements including 
definitions of cash generating 
units, long-term growth rates and 
discount rates applied.
INTERNAL CONTROLS 
AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
FRAMEWORK
The Board is responsible for the 
internal controls of the Group. 
The Audit Committee assists the 
Board in its responsibility to ensure 
the operation of effective systems of 
internal control and risk management 
appropriate to the Group’s business.
The Audit Committee has concluded 
that sound risk management and 
internal controls have been in 
operation throughout the annual 
accounting period. The Group’s 
internal control framework is 
intended to provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against 
material financial misstatement 
or loss. 
The Group’s internal control 
environment consists of: 
• Codes of conduct and policies;
• Appropriate governance and 
organisational structures; 
• Risk management framework;
• Review and testing of accounting 
and control systems;
• Process to ensure compliance with 
rules & regulations;
• Individual responsibilities 
and documented delegation 
of authorities;
• An annual budget is prepared 
against which specific objectives 
and targets are set. This budget 
is approved by the Board and 
reviewed on a regular basis. 
Senior management monitors 
trading activity weekly and 
prepares and reviews internal 
management accounts monthly, 
with comparisons against the latest 
plan and the prior year; 
• Monitoring of performance against 
budget and key KPIs;
• Review and challenge at senior 
management and Board level;
• Corrective action from top down 
and bottom up;
• Annual Audit Committee review; 
and
• External audit review.
The risk management framework 
is set out in more detail in the Risk 
Management section of this report 
on pages 18 to 21. The Group will 
continue to review and develop 
operating documentation and 
controls as the business develops.
29 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
AND REPORTING
The Committee is satisfied that 
the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements, taken as a whole, 
provides a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the 
Group’s performance, position, 
business model and strategy 
at 30 September 2017 and has 
advised the Board accordingly. 
The Committee is also satisfied 
that the judgements made by 
management are reasonable and 
that appropriate disclosures in 
relation to key judgements and 
estimates have been included in the 
financial statements. 
In reaching these conclusions 
the Committee has considered 
the information provided by 
management, has constructively 
challenged assumptions, and has 
considered detailed reporting 
from and discussions with the 
external auditors. In addition, the 
Committee has considered the 
procedures in place to ensure a 
fair, balanced and understandable 
annual report and accounts, which 
include review by financial and non-
financial management.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
KPMG have been the external 
auditors of the Group since 2015 
when the Group’s shares were 
admitted to AIM. A review of KPMG’s 
independence and audit process 
effectiveness is performed each 
year before a recommendation 
is made to the Board to propose 
KPMG for re-election at the 
AGM. In assessing KPMG’s 
independence, the Committee 
received confirmation that, in KPMG’s 
professional judgement, KPMG is 
independent within the meaning of 
all UK regulatory and professional 
requirements and the objectivity 
of the audit partner and staff are 
not impaired.
In the 2017/18 financial year, the 
Committee proposes to further 
safeguard the independence of the 
external auditor by removing tax 
compliance and consultancy work 
from the external auditor’s remit.
The Committee has reviewed and 
agreed the scope and methodology 
of the work undertaken by the 
Group’s external auditors. It has 
evaluated their independence and 
objectivity and has agreed the terms 
of their engagement and the fees to 
be paid to them. 
The total fees paid to KPMG for the 
year ended 30 September 2017 were 
$0.3 million (2016: $0.5 million) of 
which $0.1 million (2016: $0.2 million) 
related to non-audit work. The non-
audit work related primarily to tax 
compliance and consultancy work 
as discussed above. KPMG were 
considered independent in relation 
to this work as no accounting 
judgement was involved.
WHISTLEBLOWING
The Chairman of the Audit 
Committee is listed as the 
Designated Officer under the 
Group’s Whistleblowing Policy. 
During the year, no whistleblowing 
instances were reported.
INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
Given the Group’s size and 
development, the Board did not 
consider it necessary to have an 
internal audit function during the 
year. The Board will continue to 
monitor this requirement annually.

On behalf of the Remuneration 
Committee, I am pleased to present 
the Remuneration Report for the

The Committee seeks to provide 
a framework that is aligned to 
the strategy and values of the

to recruit, retain and appropriately 
incentivise high-calibre managers 
to deliver the Group’s strategy. 
I hope you find the report clear 
and informative.
OVERVIEW
The Remuneration Committee 
is responsible for reviewing 
the performance of the senior 
executives, the Executive Directors 
and the Group’s Chairman, as well as 
determining the scale and structure 
of their remuneration, their terms and

to the interests of shareholders. 
The Committee is also responsible 
for reviewing the overall policy 
in respect of remuneration of all 
other employees of the Group and 
establishing the Group’s policy and 
operation of share option schemes.

senior executives, the Committee 
seeks to enable the Group to attract

recommendations to the Board 
concerning the allocation of options 
to executives under the LTIP and for 
the administration of this scheme.
COMPOSITION AND MEETINGS
The Remuneration Committee 
consists of two Non-Executive 
Directors being David Adams 
(Chairman) and Steve Baldwin. 
Other Directors are invited to 
attend meetings as required. 
The Remuneration Committee meets

DAVID ADAMS
Chairman, 
Remuneration Committee
31 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION REMUNERATION POLICY 
AND ADVISORS
The objectives of the remuneration 
policy are to ensure that the overall 
remuneration of senior executives is 
aligned with the performance of the 
Group and preserves an appropriate 
balance of annual profit delivery and 
longer-term shareholder value. 
The Committee keeps the 
remuneration policy, in particular the 
need for share ownership guidelines 
for Executive Directors, regularly 
under review and will take action 
whenever deemed necessary to 
ensure that remuneration is aligned 
with the overall strategic objectives 
of the Group.
The Committee seeks the advice of 
appropriate, independent, advisors 
where required on remuneration-
related matters. The Committee 
periodically reviews any relationships 
and remains satisfied that 
appropriate safeguards exist to 
ensure the independence of advisors.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE 
PLAN AND SHARE-BASED 
PAYMENTS POLICY
The Chairman, Executive Directors 
and senior managers receive 
remuneration in the form of equity–
settled share–based payments 
(long-term incentive plans), whereby 
they provide services in exchange for 
options over shares. 
On IPO in May 2015, 10% of the 
issued share capital of the Group was 
allocated for share-based incentives 
(5% for employee plans and 5% for 
non-employee plans). It is the Board’s 
intention to seek approval through a 
special resolution at the next Annual 
General Meeting to make available 
the 5% for non-employee plans to 
employee plans.
In July 2017, share option awards 
were issued to the Chairman, 
Executive Directors and senior 
management. As with prior years, 
targets were set with reference to 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (50% 
of awards) and earnings per share 
(EPS) (50% of awards) measures. 
The Remuneration Committee 
considers that the targets are 
appropriate and are aligned with 
shareholder interests. 
The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange 
for the grant of options or shares 
is recognised as an expense on 
a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period. The total amount 
to be expensed is determined 
by reference to the fair value of 
the options or shares determined 
at the grant date, excluding the 
impact of any non–market based 
vesting conditions (for example, 
continuation of employment and 
performance targets). 
The share options are valued 
using the Monte Carlo option 
pricing model. Non–market based 
vesting conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to become 
exercisable or the number of shares 
that the employee will ultimately 
receive. This estimate is revised at 
each balance sheet date to allow 
for options that are not expected to 
vest and the difference is charged 
or credited to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, with a corresponding 
adjustment to reserves.

REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
CONTINUED
34 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for 
each financial year. As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London 
Stock Exchange they are required 
to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent 
Company financial statement on the 
same basis.
Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent Company and of their profit 
or loss for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the 
Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable, relevant 
and reliable;
• state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS, 
as adopted by the EU; 
• assess the Group and parent 
Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and
• use the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or 
the parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show 
and explain the parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
They are responsible for such 
internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and have 
general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic Report and a 
Directors’ Report that complies with 
that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for 
the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT 
AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO THE MEMBERS OF ELEGANT HOTELS  
GROUP PLC
1. OUR OPINION IS UNMODIFIED 
We have audited the financial statements of Elegant 
Hotels Group plc (“the Company”) for the year ended

statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
and company statement of financial position, the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity, the 
company statement of changes in equity, the 
consolidated and company statement of cash flows, and 
the related notes, including the accounting policies in 
note 2. 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s 
affairs as at 30 September 2017 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
• the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable 
law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have 
fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are 
independent of the Group in accordance with, UK 
ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard 
as applied to listed entities. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 2. KEY AUDIT MATTERS: OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. In arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters, in decreasing order 
of audit significance, were as follows: 
The risk Our response
Acquisition of Treasure Beach
Refer to page 29 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 45 
(accounting policy) and pages 
49 to 50 (financial disclosures).
Accounting application: 
A significant transaction during 
the year was the acquisition of 
Treasure Beach in May 2017 for 
$7.9m. The bargain purchase 
gain recognised was $1.3m. 
Given the majority of the value 
acquired was property, plant and 
equipment there is judgement 
required in determining whether 
or not the transaction is a 
business combination or an asset 
acquisition under the relevant 
accounting standard.
Subjective valuation:
The assets and liabilities acquired 
are required to be measured 
at their acquisition-date fair 
values. The valuation of land and 
buildings includes subjective 
assumptions which determine the 
valuation total.
Our procedures included: 
• Accounting analysis: We challenged 
whether a business combination was the 
appropriate accounting treatment based on 
our review of the SPA and discussion with 
the Directors. We considered the specific 
factors in the acquisition against the relevant 
accounting standard’s identification rules of 
business combination vs asset purchase. 
• Assessing valuer’s credentials: Assessed 
the third party valuation report for the 
PPE acquired as part of the business 
combination through consideration of the 
competence and independence of the third 
party provider. 
• Benchmarking assumptions: We challenged 
the highest and best use valuation basis 
based on our understanding and knowledge 
of the sector. We challenged the key 
assumptions used such as occupancy rate, 
discount rate and cost of refurbishment by 
comparing to industry norms and historic 
financial information. 
• Comparing valuations: Compared the 
valuation to those of similar transactions in 
the marketplace. 
• Assessing transparency: Assessed the 
adequacy of the disclosures around the 
business combination. 
Recoverability of parent 
company’s investment in 
subsidiaries 
($104.6m million; 2016: $125.1m)
Refer to page 45 (accounting 
policy) and page 64 
(financial disclosures).
Low risk, high value 
The carrying amount of the 
parent Company’s investments 
in subsidiaries represents 100% 
(2016: 99%) of the parent 
Company’s total assets. Their 
recoverability is not at a high risk 
of significant misstatement or 
subject to significant judgement. 
However, due to their materiality 
in the context of the parent 
Company financial statements, 
this is considered to be the area 
that had the greatest effect on our 
overall parent Company audit. 
Our procedures included: 
• Tests of detail: Compared the carrying 
amount of 100% of investments with the 
relevant subsidiaries’ draft balance sheets to 
identify whether their net assets, being an 
approximation of their minimum recoverable 
amount, were in excess of their carrying 
amount and assessing whether those 
subsidiaries have historically been profit-
making. 
• Assessing subsidiary audits: Assessed 
the work performed by the subsidiary 
audit teams on all of those subsidiaries and 
considering the results of that work, on 
those subsidiaries’ profits and net assets. 
37 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION 3.  OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN 
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at $525,000 (2016: $700,000), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Group profit before tax, of 
$10,987,000 (2016: $11,789,000, of which it represents 
4.8% (2016: 5.9%). 
Materiality for the parent Company financial statements 
as a whole was set at $458,000 (2016: $458,000), 
determined with reference to a benchmark of parent 
company total assets, of which it represents 0.4% 
(2016: 0.4%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any 
corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements 
exceeding $26,000 (2016: $35,000), in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
Of the Group’s 23 (2016: 21) reporting components, we 
subjected 10 (2016: 21) to full scope audits for Group 
purposes and 1 (2016: 0) to specified risk-focused audit 
procedures. The latter component was not individually 
financially significant enough in 2017 to require a full 
scope audit for Group purposes, but did present specific 
individual risks that needed to be addressed. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted 
for the percentages illustrated opposite. 
For the residual components, we performed analysis 
at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these. 
The Group team instructed the component auditor 
as to the significant areas to be covered, including 
the relevant risks detailed above and the information 
to be reported back. The Group team approved the 
component materialities, of $395,000 (2016: $458,000), 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of 
the Group across the components. The work on 9 of 
the 10 components (2016: 21 of the 22 components) 
was performed by the component auditor and the 
rest, including the audit of the parent Company, was 
performed by the Group team.
The Group team visited the only component location 
(i.e., Barbados) (2016: Barbados) for the components 
not audited by the Group audit team to assess the audit 
risk and strategy. Telephone conference meetings were 
also held with this component auditor. At this visit and 
meetings, the findings reported to the Group team 
were discussed in more detail, and any further work 
required by the Group team was then performed by the 
component auditor. The audit of the parent Company 
was performed by the Group team.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
CONTINUED 4.  WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON 
GOING CONCERN 
We are required to report to you if we have concluded 
that the use of the going concern basis of accounting 
is inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material 
uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the use 
of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements. We have 
nothing to report in these respects. 
5.  WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON THE OTHER 
INFORMATION IN THE ANNUAL REPORT
The Directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the 
financial statements. Our opinion on the financial 
statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, 
except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial 
statements audit work, the information therein is 
materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that 
work we have not identified material misstatements in the 
other information. 
Strategic report and Directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report and the Directors’ report; 
• in our opinion the information given in those reports 
for the financial year is consistent with the financial 
statements; and 
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
6.  WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON THE OTHER 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO 
REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or 
• the parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7. RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out 
on page 35, the Directors are responsible for: the 
preparation of the financial statements including being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
assessing the Group and parent Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern; and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to 
liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
A fuller description of our responsibilities is 
provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities.
8.  THE PURPOSE OF OUR AUDIT WORK AND TO 
WHOM WE OWE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

43 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION
CONSOLIDATED AND COMPANY STATEMENTS 
OF CASH FLOWS 1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Elegant Hotels Group plc (“Elegant Hotels” or the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated in the UK and 
listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office 
is 10 Norwich Street, London, EC4A 1BD. 
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) is the ownership and operation 
of hotels and restaurants in the Caribbean, principally on the island of Barbados. During the year, the Group acquired 
Treasure Beach, a Barbados-based 35 room hotel.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Company and Consolidated Financial Statements 
are set out below. They have been consistently applied in the financial years ending 30 September 2017 (2016/17 
financial year) and 30 September 2016 (2015/16 financial year) unless otherwise stated.
2.1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements of Elegant Hotels Group plc and the consolidated financial statements for the Group have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption provided under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual 
Income Statement and related notes.
The Company and Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, modified by the 
revaluation of certain assets and liabilities at amortised cost.
The functional currency of the Company is United States dollars ($). The dominant currency of the trading entities 
is United States dollars. The Company and Group presents the financial statements in United States dollars, and 
all information is stated in United States dollars unless otherwise indicated. All amounts have been rounded to the 
nearest thousand (‘000), unless otherwise indicated. 
2.1.1. GOING CONCERN
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements with the assistance of its bank facilities which were 
renewed on 26 May 2015. The Group’s forecasts and projections take account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance and show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities, 
meet future debt repayments and continue to comply with its banking covenants for at least the foreseeable future. 
The Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group financial statements.
2.1.2. PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT – CORRECTION OF DEFERRED TAX ON ACQUISITION 
– RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR PERIOD FIGURES
A prior year adjustment has arisen in respect of the year ended 30 September 2016.
In the preparation of these financial statements, the Directors identified that a deferred tax liability that should have 
been recognised on the 3 March 2016 acquisition through business combination of Waves Hotel and Spa had been 
omitted from the acquisition accounting and the 2016 statement of financial position. The deferred tax relates to 
buildings acquired through that business combination for which there is no recognition exemption. As a result the 
Directors have made a prior period adjustment to correct this, restating the prior year consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of changes in equity, 
consolidated statement of cash flows and related notes as at 30 September 2016, to eliminate the bargain purchase 
gain in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and record the deferred tax liability of $3,995k in the 
consolidated statement of financial position as set out below. In addition, the Directors have made a restatement to 
gross up the prior year deferred tax balances by $574k, a reclassification of liabilities out of deferred tax assets, in 
order to correctly present their position. The affected balances have been marked as restated.

The impact on profit before and after tax is a decrease of $3,995k and the impact on net assets is a decrease of 
$3,995k. The impact on both basic and diluted EPS is a reduction from 15.5 to 11.0 cents per share.
44 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.1.3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES
No new standards, interpretations or amendments effective for the first time to the year ended 30 September 2017 
have had a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group or Company.
Management is assessing the following standards, interpretations and amendments, which are not yet effective or 
adopted, for the impact on the Group:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective date for accounting periods from 1 January 2018).
• IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with Customers (effective date for accounting periods from 1 January 2018).
Management has reviewed IFRS 15 and is considering the treatment of service charge in accordance with the 
revised standard. Currently, service charge collected as part of revenue and paid to employees is not recorded as 
revenue. If service charge was recorded as revenue, it would increase revenue by circa 10%. There would be no 
impact on profit as a result of any change.
• IFRS 16 Leases (effective date for accounting periods from 1 January 2019). This standard has not yet been endorsed 
by the EU. Management has reviewed IFRS 16 and does not believe it will have a material impact on the Group. 
The Group owns all of its properties and has very few arrangements that meet the definition of a lease per IFRS 16.
• Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions – Amendments to IFRS 2. This amendment 
has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU.
• Annual improvements to IFRSs (2014-2016 Cycle) – Minor amendments to various accounting standards, effective 
for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 onwards. This amendment has not yet been endorsed for use in 
the EU.
The other standards not yet in effect are not expected to have a material impact on the Group or Company. 
New standards, interpretations or amendments effective for the first time to the year ended 30 September 2017 have 
had a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group or Company.
2.2. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
SUBSIDIARIES
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases.
ACQUISITIONS
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the 
acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. 
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition related costs are 
expensed as incurred.
INTRA-GROUP 
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, 
are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the 
investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as 
unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 
In the Company financial statements, all investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment. 
45 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION 2.3. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the 
transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign 
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated 
at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which 
case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. 
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for exchange differences 
on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor 
likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially 
in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the 
net investment. 
The Group enters into forward US dollar/Sterling forward exchange contracts to secure the amount of approved 
dividends. No other forward contracts or similar contracts are conducted.
2.4. REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue for the Group is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts, value 
added taxes and service charges. The Group recognises revenue for services provided when the amount of revenue 
can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity.
Revenue arising from the provision of hotel accommodation, restaurant and bar services and activities is recognised 
when the service is provided or the products are delivered to the customer.
All deposits for accommodation and similar income which are received in advance of the related performance are 
classified as deferred revenue and shown as a liability until delivery of the service. 
2.5. FINANCE INCOME AND EXPENSE
Finance income is recognised in profit and loss on an accruals basis. Finance expense is recognised in profit or loss 
using the effective interest method.
2.6. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are items that are, in the judgment of management, material due to their size or nature, or non-
recurring items that are considered exceptional. They are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is 
necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. 
2.7. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount 
expected to be paid if the Elegant Hotels Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a 
result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. 
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income in the year to which the employee’s services relate.
2.8. SEGMENT REPORTING
An operating segment is a component of the Elegant Hotels Group that engages in business activities from which 
it may earn revenues and incur expenses; whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its 
performance; and for which discrete financial information is available. 
All revenue and operating profit is derived from the main activity of the Group. Each hotel is considered to be a 
separate operating segment of the Group based on the information provided to the CODM (considered to be the 
Board of Directors). These segments are aggregated for the purposes of disclosure as the aggregation criteria of 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments are considered to be met. The Directors believe the aggregation criteria is met due to the 
similar economic characteristics of the hotels which all operate on the island of Barbados.
46 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED 2.9. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
Employees (and Executive Directors) receive remuneration in the form of equity-settled share-based payments, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares (share options). The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of share options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share 
options determined at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market based vesting conditions (for example, 
continuation of employment and performance targets). 
Non-market based vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to 
become exercisable or the number of shares that the employee will ultimately receive. This estimate is revised at each 
reporting date to allow for forecasted employee attrition and the difference is charged or credited to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
2.10. TAXATION
Income tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in 
the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other 
comprehensive income, where it is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current tax for the year is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using the best estimate of the 
weighted average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets or liabilities, using the tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. 
Deferred income tax is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a 
business combination, if at the time of the transaction there is no effect on either accounting or taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the unused tax losses and credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting 
date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority and the Group 
intends to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.11. INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first in, first out basis. The cost is determined 
using a weighted average basis. Net realisable value for inventories held for sale is the estimated selling price in the 
normal course of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Net realisable value for inventories 
held for consumption in the provision of services is equivalent to cost.
2.12. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost, including directly attributable costs, and 
subsequently stated at historical cost less depreciation and impairment.
Land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation is calculated on other items of property, plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the expected 
useful economic life of the asset as follows:
Buildings – 30 to 50 years. 
Furniture, fixtures and fittings – 2 to 15 years. 
Motor vehicles – 7 years.
Depreciation on assets under construction does not commence until they are complete and available for use. 
These assets represent “fit-outs”. 
2.13. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Group records intangible assets relating to its commercial website. These assets are initially recorded at cost. 
The website has been assessed as an asset with a finite life of three years. The cost of the website is amortised on a 
straight line basis over this period. The carrying value and the amortisation period is reviewed annually. 
Costs associated with maintaining the website are recognised as an expense when incurred. 
47 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION 2.14. IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Assets that have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. All other 
non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the 
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).
The Group determines any impairment by comparing the carrying values of each of the Group’s assets (or the cash-
generating unit to which it belongs) to their recoverable amounts, which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less 
costs to sell and its value in use. Fair value represents market value in an active market. Value in use is determined by 
discounting future cash flows arising from the asset. Future cash flows are determined with reference to the Group’s 
own projections using pre-tax discount rates.
2.15. LEASED ASSETS
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group (an “operating 
lease”), the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a 
reduction of the rental expense over the lease term. 
2.16. FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group classifies its existing financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents, as loans and receivables. 
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
Management determines the classification of financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at 
every reporting date.
2.16.1. LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They arise principally through the provision of services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also 
incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset. 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and accounts and 
other receivables.
They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or 
issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for 
impairment. Accounts receivable are presented in current assets in the Statement of Financial Position, except for 
those with maturities greater than one year after the reporting date, which are presented as non-current assets.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on 
the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of 
the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net 
carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.
The Company advances loans to its subsidiary undertakings which are accounted for as part of its net investment 
in those operations. These loans are repayable on demand and are stated at amortised cost less provision 
for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and fixed deposits with original maturity dates of 90 days or less. 
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Financial Position is considered to be fair value.
2.17. FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently carried at 
amortised cost. The Group’s financial liabilities include bank and third-party loans, the bank overdraft and trade and 
other payables.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan and amortised to the 
profit and loss over the life of the loan. 
All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
48 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED 2.18. PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it 
is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation.
The Group’s provisions are made up of legal amounts relating to specific legal claims, employee benefits, specifically 
annual leave, and sales incentive schemes. The timing of the utilisation of the provision is uncertain and is largely 
outside of the Group’s control. 
2.19. SHARE CAPITAL
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition 
of a financial liability. The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity.
2.20. DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial 
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends 
are recognised when paid. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the 
financial statements. 
3. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income 
and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Judgements made by the Directors, in the application of 
these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk 
of material adjustment in the next year are:
Property, plant and equipment – The assessment of the useful economic lives requires judgement in order that 
depreciation can be charged over the life selected. This also includes the assessment of residual values that will be 
attributed to the hotel properties. Judgement is also required in determining whether the carrying values of the assets 
have any indication of impairment. 
Acquisition accounting – The Group assessed the identifiable assets and liabilities of Treasure Beach Limited on 
acquisition. The Group acquired an operation that was capable of being run as a business and therefore has been 
accounted for as a business combination. The difference in the fair value and the carrying amount on the property 
acquired resulted in a bargain purchase gain (see note 4). Other Items specifically considered but not deemed 
relevant related to customer lists, brand name and intellectual property. The Group did not identify any intangible 
items that would meet the criteria for recognition on acquisition. A one percent change in the discount rate used in the 
valuation would increase/decrease the valuation by $0.9m. A one per cent change in the occupancy rate assumption 
used in the valuation would increase/decrease the valuation by $0.2m. For the purposes of IFRS 3, this transaction 
has been recorded as a business combination. 100% of the share capital of Treasure Beach Limited, which was the 
company holding the assets, liabilities and trade of Treasure Beach Hotel, was acquired.
4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
ACQUISITION OF TREASURE BEACH HOTEL
On 5 May 2017, the Group purchased 100% of the share capital of Treasure Beach Limited for $7.9 million. 
Treasure Beach Limited is a Barbados externally registered company which owns the business and property of 
Treasure Beach Hotel, located in Paynes Bay, St. James, Barbados. The Group purchased Treasure Beach to further 
expand within Barbados. It has refurbished the property as an adults-only European plan offering.
Treasure Beach Limited’s property has been independently valued at $9.7 million by Terra Caribbean. In addition, a 
deferred tax liability of $0.6 million was recognised on the value of the buildings. The difference of approximately 
$1.3 million between the total consideration and the fair value of the assets and liabilities is shown as a bargain 
purchase gain on acquisition in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The bargain purchase gain 
resulted from the property being for sale for a number of years. The property was loss making prior to acquisition 
and the Directors believed the property was not operating to its full potential. The Directors reviewed the purchased 
assets for unrecognised intangible assets but could not identify any.
The acquisition accounting policies are consistent with those of the Group.
In the period immediately following the date of acquisition up to July 2017, the operation of the hotel was under the 
existing brand and the net losses of $0.1 million have been recognised as exceptional expenses. The property closed 
for renovations and reopened in December 2017 under the Elegant Hotels brand.
49 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION 4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (CONTINUED)
Acquisition related costs
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of $0.4 million comprising legal, professional and due diligence fees, 
stamp duty and renovation/refurbishment project management fees. These costs have been included as exceptional 
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Acquired receivables
The fair value of acquired receivables was $0.1 million. The gross contractual amounts receivable is $0.1 million and, at 
the acquisition date, all of the contractual cash flows were expected to be received.
ACQUISITION OF WAVES HOTEL & SPA
On 3 March 2016, the Group purchased Waves Hotel & Spa via the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Swiss 
International Ltd for $5.4 million. This was satisfied in cash and a loan from the vendor of $2.0 million. The loan 
is payable in four equal instalments which commenced on 3 September 2016 and will be settled within the next 
three years. 
The acquisition is in line with the Group’s stated strategy to expand both on Barbados and further into the Caribbean. 
In the period immediately following the date of acquisition up to 18 April 2016, the operation of the hotel and spa was 
licensed back to the former owner to fulfil existing customer reservations. The property closed for renovation and 
reopened in August 2016. Waves therefore contributed a small operating loss for the 2016 financial year, the period 
of acquisition.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share amounts 
are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year together with the dilutive number of ordinary shares. 
The Company has 1,717,223 potentially issuable shares (2016: 4,037,084) all of which relate to share options issued to 
Directors and key management personnel. The dilutive number of issuable shares is 285,082 (2016: 221,921) for the 
purposes of calculating the dilutive earnings per share.
Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share has been shown in order to compare underlying earnings per share 
year on year. In order to calculate adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share, the numerator has been adjusted 
to exclude the after tax effect on earnings of share based payments, bargain purchase gains, acquisition and pre-
opening costs relating to new hotels and other exceptional items.

The recoverability of the deferred tax asset is dependent on future taxable profits in excess of those arising from the 
reversal of deferred tax liabilities. The deferred tax asset has been recognised to the extent that it is considered to be 
recoverable based on forecasts for future periods. At 30 September 2017, the value of the unrecognised deferred tax 
asset is $0.2 million (2016: $0.9 million). $0.2 million (2016: $0.3 million (restated)) of deferred tax assets and deferred 
tax liabilities are presented net in the Statement of Financial Position as the Group has the legal right to settle current 
tax amounts on a net basis and the deferred tax amounts are levied by the same taxing authority on the same group 
of entities that intend to realise the asset and settle the liability at the same time.

CREDIT QUALITY OF TRADE RECEIVABLE AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES
Industry standard repayment terms for credit sales are applied to all receivables. The Group monitors each receivable 
balance on a regular basis with regard to credit sales granted and payments received. In order to manage credit risk 
credit limits are set for customers based on volume of business and payment history. New accounts are usually on a 
prepaid basis. Credit limits are reviewed by the finance team on a regular basis based on the customer’s debt ageing 
and collection history.

The Group’s loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of loans and borrowings is 
equivalent to their outstanding originated value. For more information about the Group and Company’s exposure to 
interest rate risk, see note 29.
During the period, the Group received $13.4 million from loans and borrowings (2016: $18.5 million) and repaid 
$4.2 million (2016: $12.2 million). The Group also repaid $1.0 million in relation to third-party borrowings (2016: 
$1.4 million). 
Secured bank loans  
In May 2015, the Group entered into a Credit Agreement with the Bank of Nova Scotia to provide a US-dollar Term 
Loan Commitment of $50 million with a maturity of 2020 which was fully drawn. This loan facility was increased and 
drawn for the acquisition of Waves in April 2016 by $13.5 million and Treasure Beach in May 2017 by $8.4 million for a 
total of $71.9 million (2016: $63.5 million). After accounting for repayments of $4.0 million during the year (2016: $nil), 
$67.9 million of this facility remains outstanding.
As part of the Credit Agreement with the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Group also has a Revolving Loan Commitment of 
$5 million. $4.8 million of this facility was drawn at the end of the year (2016: $0.0 million).
The Group also has an operating overdraft facility in Barbados dollars of $19.8 million (US $10 million). This facility was 
drawn down by $0.4 million (2016: not drawn). 
58 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED 20. LOANS AND BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)
The secured bank loans carry interest at US LIBOR plus 275 basis points. The Group’s management review the 
forecast US LIBOR rates on a regular basis and may lock in the future rate for a specific period depending on the 
assessment of trends and forecasts. The overdraft carries interest at the Barbados Government Base rate less 200 
basis points. Therefore, these balances are entirely variable. 
The Company is party as a guarantor to cross-guarantees in respect of the indebtedness of its subsidiary 
undertakings to the Bank of Nova Scotia. At 30 September 2017, the total indebtedness of subsidiary undertakings 
under these cross-guarantees amounted to $72.7 million (2016: $63.5 million). 
Third-party loan 
As part of the acquisition of Waves Hotel & Spa, the Group agreed an US dollar interest-free loan with the vendor 
in the amount of $2.0 million. This loan is repayable in four annual instalments of $0.5 million commencing from 
September 2016. The final two instalments are due in September 2018 and September 2019.
Sensitivity analysis  
An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would decrease profit or loss by $0.7 million on an annual basis. 
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. 
The financial liabilities which have a contractual maturity greater than one year are the Group’s loans and borrowings. 
Including estimated interest payments and excluding the effect of netting agreements, the payments due in relation 
to the Group’s loans and borrowings are $8.6 million due within one year and $68.6 million due between one and five 
years (2016: $7.0 million due within one year and $65.1 million due between one and five years).

• Sales incentives – the Group rewards certain travel agents with accommodation or cash rewards based on sales. 
The timing, amount or likelihood of any settlement of these rewards is uncertain.
59 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION 23. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Awards are made under long-term incentive and other arrangements. Certain employees of the Group have been 
eligible for options over ordinary shares in the Company, awarded under the Share Option Scheme. 
The award of options is subject to market and non-market conditions. The market conditions are based on the total 
shareholder return over the performance period which is the three years prior to vesting. The non-market conditions 
are based on the Group’s earnings per share return over the same performance period. Once these criteria have been 
met the options remain exercisable subject to the vesting provisions. If performance conditions are not met, then a 
portion or all of the awards will lapse. 
All options granted under the Scheme have a fixed exercise price of 1 pence per option. The contractual life of the 
options is five years. Options cannot normally be exercised until the full vesting conditions including term of service 
have been met. The options are classified as equity-settled.
The issued share options include market-based performance conditions. From 2016/17, new option grants have 
been valued using a Monte Carlo option pricing model. Prior to 2016/17, options were valued using the Black-
Scholes method.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of share-based payments are as follows: 
• The expected life of the share options is five years (2016: five years).
• Expected dividends (dividend yield) is 7% (2016: 7%).
• All option exercises are expected to be equity-settled.
• The expected volatility in all cases is 40% based upon historical share price volatility of listed, comparable 
businesses over a period of time equal to expected option life ending on date of grant.
• The risk free rate applied to the options is 5.5% and is based upon the yield on zero–coupon Barbados government 
bonds of a term consistent with the expected option life.
• It has been assumed that the employee attrition rate will be 5% (2016: 6.3%) throughout the period.
• The exercise price and weighted average exercise price of all options is 1 pence.
• The weighted average share price during the year was 80 pence (2016: 89 pence).

CONTINUED 24. SHARE CAPITAL AND RESERVES (CONTINUED)
MERGER RESERVE
The merger reserve represents amounts attributable to equity in respect of merged subsidiary undertakings and 
includes an amount relating to the capitalisation of an inter-company loan within the subsidiaries which is shown 
within merger reserve on consolidation. 
In May 2015, the Company became the new holding company for the Group. This was put into effect through a 
share-for-share exchange of 56,615,788 ordinary shares of £0.01 in the Company for the whole of the issued capital 
of eight St Lucia domiciled companies. These companies owned all of the share capital in ten trading subsidiaries. 
The introduction of the new holding company was accounted for as a capital reorganisation using the merger 
accounting principles prescribed within IFRS 3 Business Combinations. 
The use of merger accounting principles resulted in a balance in the Group and Company reserves which has been 
classified as a merger reserve and included in the Group’s shareholders’ funds. The Company recognised the value of 
its investment in the acquired St Lucian companies at a value based upon the initial share placing price on admission 
to AIM of £1 per share. As permitted by Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 the amount attributable to share 
premium has been transferred to the merger reserve. 
25. OBLIGATIONS UNDER OPERATING LEASES
The Group has total non-cancellable operating lease rentals in respect of its US sales office of $0.2 million 
(2016: $0.2 million). Of these amounts, $0.1 million (2016: $0.1 million) are payable in less than one year, $0.1 million 
(2016: $0.1 million) are payable between one and two years and no amounts over two years (2016: $0.0 million). 
No other lease obligation is considered significant. The Company has no operating lease commitments. 
26. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
There were outstanding capital commitments of $0.1 million at 30 September 2017 (30 September 2016: $nil). 
The Company is party as a guarantor to cross-guarantees in respect of the indebtedness of subsidiary undertakings. 
At 30 September 2017 the total indebtedness of subsidiary undertakings under these cross-guarantees amounted to 
$72.7 million.
There are no other material contingent liabilities attributable to the Group or Company.

61 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION 29. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Group’s financial instruments are classified into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to 
determine fair value. This hierarchy can be summarised as follows:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable input)
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 million (2016: $3.7 million) are classified as Level 1 in the valuation 
hierarchy. All other financial assets of $2.4 million (2016: $2.5 million) and financial liabilities of $81.9 million (2016: 
$73.1 million) are classified as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy. The carrying value of all of the Group’s net financial 
liabilities of $78.4 million (2016: $66.4 million) is equivalent to their fair value. 
The CBRE valuation dated April 2015 indicated a value of $235.5 million for properties with the exception of Treasure 
Beach Hotel and Waves Hotels and Spa (those properties disclosed as acquired in these financial statements). This is 
classified at level 3 under the fair value hierarchy and valued using the highest and best use method. The fair value has 
been primarily derived using discounted cash flows, supported by market transaction data.
The Company had trade and other payables with a carrying value of $0.0 million (2016: $1.0 million) which would be 
classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies. 
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting 
the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. The Group has not issued or used any other financial instruments of 
a speculative nature. In the 2017 financial year, the Group used forward currency contracts to secure the value of 
approved dividends payable to its shareholders. No other new forward currency contracts are undertaken.
To the extent financial instruments are not carried at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, 
book value approximates to fair value at 30 September 2017 and 30 September 2016.
Cash and cash equivalents are held in various currencies including US dollars, Barbados dollars and Sterling.
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost. Book values and expected cash flows are reviewed 
by the Board and any impairment charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the 
relevant period.
Trade and other payables are measured at book value and amortised cost. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. The Group is exposed 
to credit risk in respect of these balances such that, if one or more of the customers’ encounter financial difficulties, 
this could adversely affect the Group’s financial results. The Group attempts to mitigate credit risk by assessing the 
credit rating of new customers prior to entering into contracts and by entering into contracts with customers with 
agreed credit terms. Provision is made against any receivable considered to be impaired. 
The Group is only exposed to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents (refer note 19) and trade receivables (refer note 
17). The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date by class of financial asset is limited to its carrying 
amount. The credit risk associated with cash is remote. The Group’s principal credit risk arises from non-recovery of 
trade receivables. The credit risk relating to receivables is detailed in note 17. 
The Company has no assets that are exposed to credit risk.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. 
Liquidity risk is mitigated by management of working capital, capital expenditure and debt servicing requirements. 
The Group and the Company seek to manage liquidity risk by ensuring sufficient funds are available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest cash safely and profitably. The Group monitors its cash resources through short, 
medium and long-term cash forecasting against available facilities. 
Management monitors the liquidity risk by considering the maturity of both financial assets and projected cash flows 
from operations. Short-term flexibility is available through additional overdraft and capital expenditure facilities as set 
out in note 20. 
All financial liabilities classified as current have a contractual maturity of less than one year. The contractual maturities 
for the loans and borrowings can be found at note 20. 
The Company has contractual cash maturities of $nil (2016: $nil) in relation to trade and other payables of less than 
one year.
62 ELEGANT HOTELS GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED 29. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices 
will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The majority of the Group’s business is conducted in US dollars and Barbados dollars. The exchange rate of the 
Barbados dollar is fixed to the US dollar at a rate of Bds$1.98 = US$1.00. Revenue is earned in US dollars from 
contracts with tour operators who effectively take the risk of any fluctuation against the currency paid by the end 
consumer. The longer-term risk to the Group of a deterioration in the rate of exchange in origin countries is that the 
rates for hotel accommodation may be perceived as becoming more expensive.
The majority of the Group’s expenditure, including operating costs as well as capital expenditure, occurs in US dollars 
or in Barbados dollars.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk is small and limited to the carrying amount for monetary financial 
instruments that are denominated in currencies other than US dollars and Barbados dollars and to transactions that 
are payable in Sterling, including dividends to shareholders of the Company. 
Interest rate risk
Market interest rate risk arises from the Group’s borrowings which are denominated in US dollars.
None of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are subject to fixed rates of interest. The most significant element 
of the financial liabilities relates to the Group’s long-term loan which is subject to interest at US LIBOR plus 275 basis 
points and is therefore entirely variable. 
The Group is also exposed to market interest rate risk in respect of its cash balances held pending investment in the 
growth of the Group’s operations. The effect of interest rate changes on the Group’s financial instruments is set out in 
note 20.
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to shareholders through optimising the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company. The Group’s capital is made 
up of share capital, share premium, merger reserve, translation reserve and retained earnings totalling $109.8 million 
(30 September 2016: $109.0 million).
The Group’s objectives when maintaining capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level 
of risk.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The Group’s capital is not 
restricted. Management may seek additional external borrowings to fund the future investment and growth of the 
Group. All funding required to expand the Group’s business, including the acquisition and development of new hotels 
and for working capital purposes are financed from existing cash resources where possible. Management will also 
consider future fundraising or bank finance where appropriate.
The Group has a progressive dividend policy which takes into account the results of the past year and the 
trading outlook.
